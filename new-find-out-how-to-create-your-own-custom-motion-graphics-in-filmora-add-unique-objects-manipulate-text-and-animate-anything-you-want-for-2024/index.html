                ></p>
<p>Step 6</p>
<p>Click the drop-down arrow on the <strong>Shape Fill</strong> option and change the <strong>Type</strong> to <strong>Gradient Fill.</strong> Then, adjust the two color pallets from lighter to darker to create a gradient effect. Finally, adjust the rectangle to fit the entire screen. Click <strong>OK.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="shape fill settings"
                ></p>
<p>Step 7</p>
<p>Go to the <strong>Transitions</strong> tab <strong>→</strong> search for “<strong>Push</strong>” <strong>→</strong> drag the Push transition to the Default Title in the Timeline. Then, move the Playhead to the 1-second marker and drag another Default Title to that point from the <strong>Titles</strong> tab.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="push transition"
                ></p>
<p>Step 8</p>
<p>Double-click on the new Default Title <strong>→</strong> go to <strong>Advanced.</strong> Delete the default text and add a <strong>Circle</strong> shape this time instead of a Rectangle. Disable the <strong>Text Fill and Shape Fill</strong> options this time.</p>
<p>Step 9</p>
<p>Scroll down to <strong>Shape Border</strong> and increase the <strong>Thickness</strong> bar all the way up. Then, change the circle’s color to match your background as closely as possible. Click <strong>OK.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="shape border filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 10</p>
<p>Copy the Title you just edited and paste it into the above layer. Then, double-click on the copied Title and go to its <strong>Advanced</strong> settings panel.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/copy.png"
                      alt="copy title"
                ></p>
<p>Step 11</p>
<p>In the Advanced panel, copy the circle and paste it somewhere else on the screen. Change its size if you want, and change the shade of its color to match the background once more. You can add as many new copies of the Default Titles and copy as many circles as you want. Click <strong>OK.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add more circles"
                ></p>
<p>Step 12</p>
<p>After you’re done copying and pasting more Default Titles with more Circles inside, you can start animating them. Start with the first one. Double-click on the first Default Title with the Circle inside. Make sure you place the Playhead at the beginning of that clip. Then, go to the <strong>Animation</strong> tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="animation tab filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 13</p>
<p>You need to add 3 keyframes. Add the first one right now. Just click on the “**+Add<strong>” button. Then, move the Playhead somewhere in the middle and click “</strong>+Add<strong>” again. Last, move the Playhead at the end of the clip, and click “</strong>+Add**” again to add the third keyframe.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add keyframe filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 14</p>
<p>Now, go back to the first keyframe to edit its settings. Click the arrows to move between keyframes. Once you’re at the first one, start decreasing the <strong>Scale</strong> and the <strong>Position values</strong> as you move the Playhead toward the second keyframe. There are no rules here. Move each value based on how it looks best to you.</p>
<p>For the <strong>second keyframe</strong>, just increase the <strong>Scale</strong> and adjust the <strong>Position</strong> value based on how it looks on the screen.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="circle position"
                ></p>
<p>Step 15</p>
<p>Now, apply the same method as in <strong>Step 14</strong> to all the other circles in your video. Then, adjust the keyframe positions for all layers to create more unique movement throughout the video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="keyframe positions"
                ></p>
<p>Step 16</p>
<p>Move the Playhead to 1 second and 30 frames. Then, add a new Default Title in the Timeline and go to its Advanced settings panel. From there, <strong>Enable</strong> the <strong>Outline</strong> option and <strong>Disable</strong> the <strong>Fill</strong> option. In the Outline option, change the color to White, set Opacity to 50%, and decrease Thickness to 1.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="outline settings"
                ></p>
<p>Step 17</p>
<p>Next, choose your favorite font and type in your text inside the textbox. Then, change the value you see highlighted in this image to “-20”. Finally, increase the text size to almost fit the entire screen. Don’t worry about the fact that you can’t see all of it on the screen.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="edit text filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 18</p>
<p>Go to the <strong>Animation</strong> tab and apply the <strong>“Type Writer”</strong> animation. Then, drag the yellow lines below just like you see in the image here. The arrows show you the length to which you need to drag these lines. Click <strong>OK.</strong></p>

                      alt="type writer animation filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 19</p>
<p>Set the Playhead to 1 second and 40 frames. Now, double-click on the last Default Title we just created and go to its <strong>Animation settings. NOTE:</strong> Don’t open its Advanced settings this time. Next, add a keyframe. Then, move the Playhead near the end of this clip in the Timeline. Now, drag the X position to the left until you see the last letter of your text appear on the screen. Click <strong>OK.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>Step 20</p>
<p>Now, add another Default Title to the Timeline. Open its Advanced settings and type in your main text. Then, go to its <strong>Animation</strong> tab and apply the “Random 2” animation. Change its starting and end times according to your preference. Click <strong>OK.</strong></p>

<p>Step 7</p>
<p>Go to the <strong>Transitions</strong> tab <strong>→</strong> search for “<strong>Push</strong>” <strong>→</strong> drag the Push transition to the Default Title in the Timeline. Then, move the Playhead to the 1-second marker and drag another Default Title to that point from the <strong>Titles</strong> tab.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="push transition"
                ></p>
<p>Step 8</p>
<p>Double-click on the new Default Title <strong>→</strong> go to <strong>Advanced.</strong> Delete the default text and add a <strong>Circle</strong> shape this time instead of a Rectangle. Disable the <strong>Text Fill and Shape Fill</strong> options this time.</p>
<p>Step 9</p>
<p>Scroll down to <strong>Shape Border</strong> and increase the <strong>Thickness</strong> bar all the way up. Then, change the circle’s color to match your background as closely as possible. Click <strong>OK.</strong></p>
<p><img

<p>Step 10</p>
<p>Copy the Title you just edited and paste it into the above layer. Then, double-click on the copied Title and go to its <strong>Advanced</strong> settings panel.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="copy title"
                ></p>
<p>Step 11</p>
<p>In the Advanced panel, copy the circle and paste it somewhere else on the screen. Change its size if you want, and change the shade of its color to match the background once more. You can add as many new copies of the Default Titles and copy as many circles as you want. Click <strong>OK.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="add more circles"
                ></p>
<p>Step 12</p>
<p>After you’re done copying and pasting more Default Titles with more Circles inside, you can start animating them. Start with the first one. Double-click on the first Default Title with the Circle inside. Make sure you place the Playhead at the beginning of that clip. Then, go to the <strong>Animation</strong> tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="animation tab filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 13</p>
<p>You need to add 3 keyframes. Add the first one right now. Just click on the “**+Add<strong>” button. Then, move the Playhead somewhere in the middle and click “</strong>+Add<strong>” again. Last, move the Playhead at the end of the clip, and click “</strong>+Add**” again to add the third keyframe.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="add keyframe filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 14</p>
<p>Now, go back to the first keyframe to edit its settings. Click the arrows to move between keyframes. Once you’re at the first one, start decreasing the <strong>Scale</strong> and the <strong>Position values</strong> as you move the Playhead toward the second keyframe. There are no rules here. Move each value based on how it looks best to you.</p>
<p>For the <strong>second keyframe</strong>, just increase the <strong>Scale</strong> and adjust the <strong>Position</strong> value based on how it looks on the screen.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="circle position"
                ></p>
<p>Step 15</p>
<p>Now, apply the same method as in <strong>Step 14</strong> to all the other circles in your video. Then, adjust the keyframe positions for all layers to create more unique movement throughout the video.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 16</p>
<p>Move the Playhead to 1 second and 30 frames. Then, add a new Default Title in the Timeline and go to its Advanced settings panel. From there, <strong>Enable</strong> the <strong>Outline</strong> option and <strong>Disable</strong> the <strong>Fill</strong> option. In the Outline option, change the color to White, set Opacity to 50%, and decrease Thickness to 1.</p>

                      alt="project settings filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3</p>
<p>Open the <strong>Titles</strong> tab and drag the <strong>Default Title</strong> to the Timeline. Then, double-click on the Default Title and click on <strong>ADVANCED.</strong></p>
<p><img

                      alt="default title filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4</p>
<p>From the Advanced settings panel, delete the existing text and add a <strong>Rectangle shape.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="advanced title settings filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5</p>
<p>Disable the <strong>Text Fill</strong> and the <strong>Shape Border</strong> options from the panel on the left side.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/disable.png"
                      alt="disable options"
                ></p>
<p>Step 6</p>
<p>Click the drop-down arrow on the <strong>Shape Fill</strong> option and change the <strong>Type</strong> to <strong>Gradient Fill.</strong> Then, adjust the two color pallets from lighter to darker to create a gradient effect. Finally, adjust the rectangle to fit the entire screen. Click <strong>OK.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shape-fill.png"
                      alt="shape fill settings"
                ></p>
<p>Step 7</p>
<p>Go to the <strong>Transitions</strong> tab <strong>→</strong> search for “<strong>Push</strong>” <strong>→</strong> drag the Push transition to the Default Title in the Timeline. Then, move the Playhead to the 1-second marker and drag another Default Title to that point from the <strong>Titles</strong> tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/push.png"
                      alt="push transition"
                ></p>
<p>Step 8</p>
<p>Double-click on the new Default Title <strong>→</strong> go to <strong>Advanced.</strong> Delete the default text and add a <strong>Circle</strong> shape this time instead of a Rectangle. Disable the <strong>Text Fill and Shape Fill</strong> options this time.</p>
<p>Step 9</p>
<p>Scroll down to <strong>Shape Border</strong> and increase the <strong>Thickness</strong> bar all the way up. Then, change the circle’s color to match your background as closely as possible. Click <strong>OK.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/borders.png"
                      alt="shape border filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 10</p>
<p>Copy the Title you just edited and paste it into the above layer. Then, double-click on the copied Title and go to its <strong>Advanced</strong> settings panel.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/copy.png"
                      alt="copy title"
                ></p>
<p>Step 11</p>
<p>In the Advanced panel, copy the circle and paste it somewhere else on the screen. Change its size if you want, and change the shade of its color to match the background once more. You can add as many new copies of the Default Titles and copy as many circles as you want. Click <strong>OK.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/copy-circle.png"
                      alt="add more circles"
                ></p>
<p>Step 12</p>
<p>After you’re done copying and pasting more Default Titles with more Circles inside, you can start animating them. Start with the first one. Double-click on the first Default Title with the Circle inside. Make sure you place the Playhead at the beginning of that clip. Then, go to the <strong>Animation</strong> tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="animation tab filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 13</p>
<p>You need to add 3 keyframes. Add the first one right now. Just click on the “**+Add<strong>” button. Then, move the Playhead somewhere in the middle and click “</strong>+Add<strong>” again. Last, move the Playhead at the end of the clip, and click “</strong>+Add**” again to add the third keyframe.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/keyframe.png"
                      alt="add keyframe filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 14</p>
<p>Now, go back to the first keyframe to edit its settings. Click the arrows to move between keyframes. Once you’re at the first one, start decreasing the <strong>Scale</strong> and the <strong>Position values</strong> as you move the Playhead toward the second keyframe. There are no rules here. Move each value based on how it looks best to you.</p>
<p>For the <strong>second keyframe</strong>, just increase the <strong>Scale</strong> and adjust the <strong>Position</strong> value based on how it looks on the screen.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="circle position"
                ></p>
<p>Step 15</p>
<p>Now, apply the same method as in <strong>Step 14</strong> to all the other circles in your video. Then, adjust the keyframe positions for all layers to create more unique movement throughout the video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="keyframe positions"
                ></p>
<p>Step 16</p>
<p>Move the Playhead to 1 second and 30 frames. Then, add a new Default Title in the Timeline and go to its Advanced settings panel. From there, <strong>Enable</strong> the <strong>Outline</strong> option and <strong>Disable</strong> the <strong>Fill</strong> option. In the Outline option, change the color to White, set Opacity to 50%, and decrease Thickness to 1.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="outline settings"
                ></p>
<p>Step 17</p>
<p>Next, choose your favorite font and type in your text inside the textbox. Then, change the value you see highlighted in this image to “-20”. Finally, increase the text size to almost fit the entire screen. Don’t worry about the fact that you can’t see all of it on the screen.</p>

                      alt="edit text filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 18</p>
<p>Go to the <strong>Animation</strong> tab and apply the <strong>“Type Writer”</strong> animation. Then, drag the yellow lines below just like you see in the image here. The arrows show you the length to which you need to drag these lines. Click <strong>OK.</strong></p>

<p>Step 8</p>
<p>Double-click on the new Default Title <strong>→</strong> go to <strong>Advanced.</strong> Delete the default text and add a <strong>Circle</strong> shape this time instead of a Rectangle. Disable the <strong>Text Fill and Shape Fill</strong> options this time.</p>
<p>Step 9</p>
<p>Scroll down to <strong>Shape Border</strong> and increase the <strong>Thickness</strong> bar all the way up. Then, change the circle’s color to match your background as closely as possible. Click <strong>OK.</strong></p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 10</p>
<p>Copy the Title you just edited and paste it into the above layer. Then, double-click on the copied Title and go to its <strong>Advanced</strong> settings panel.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/copy.png"
                      alt="copy title"
                ></p>
<p>Step 11</p>
<p>In the Advanced panel, copy the circle and paste it somewhere else on the screen. Change its size if you want, and change the shade of its color to match the background once more. You can add as many new copies of the Default Titles and copy as many circles as you want. Click <strong>OK.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/copy-circle.png"
                      alt="add more circles"
                ></p>
<p>Step 12</p>
<p>After you’re done copying and pasting more Default Titles with more Circles inside, you can start animating them. Start with the first one. Double-click on the first Default Title with the Circle inside. Make sure you place the Playhead at the beginning of that clip. Then, go to the <strong>Animation</strong> tab.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="animation tab filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 13</p>
<p>You need to add 3 keyframes. Add the first one right now. Just click on the “**+Add<strong>” button. Then, move the Playhead somewhere in the middle and click “</strong>+Add<strong>” again. Last, move the Playhead at the end of the clip, and click “</strong>+Add**” again to add the third keyframe.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>Step 14</p>
<p>Now, go back to the first keyframe to edit its settings. Click the arrows to move between keyframes. Once you’re at the first one, start decreasing the <strong>Scale</strong> and the <strong>Position values</strong> as you move the Playhead toward the second keyframe. There are no rules here. Move each value based on how it looks best to you.</p>
<p>For the <strong>second keyframe</strong>, just increase the <strong>Scale</strong> and adjust the <strong>Position</strong> value based on how it looks on the screen.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>Step 15</p>
<p>Now, apply the same method as in <strong>Step 14</strong> to all the other circles in your video. Then, adjust the keyframe positions for all layers to create more unique movement throughout the video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="keyframe positions"
                ></p>
<p>Step 16</p>
<p>Move the Playhead to 1 second and 30 frames. Then, add a new Default Title in the Timeline and go to its Advanced settings panel. From there, <strong>Enable</strong> the <strong>Outline</strong> option and <strong>Disable</strong> the <strong>Fill</strong> option. In the Outline option, change the color to White, set Opacity to 50%, and decrease Thickness to 1.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="outline settings"
                ></p>
<p>Step 17</p>
<p>Next, choose your favorite font and type in your text inside the textbox. Then, change the value you see highlighted in this image to “-20”. Finally, increase the text size to almost fit the entire screen. Don’t worry about the fact that you can’t see all of it on the screen.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>Step 18</p>
<p>Go to the <strong>Animation</strong> tab and apply the <strong>“Type Writer”</strong> animation. Then, drag the yellow lines below just like you see in the image here. The arrows show you the length to which you need to drag these lines. Click <strong>OK.</strong></p>

                      alt="type writer animation filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 19</p>
<p>Set the Playhead to 1 second and 40 frames. Now, double-click on the last Default Title we just created and go to its <strong>Animation settings. NOTE:</strong> Don’t open its Advanced settings this time. Next, add a keyframe. Then, move the Playhead near the end of this clip in the Timeline. Now, drag the X position to the left until you see the last letter of your text appear on the screen. Click <strong>OK.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="text animation settings"
                ></p>
<p>Step 20</p>
<p>Now, add another Default Title to the Timeline. Open its Advanced settings and type in your main text. Then, go to its <strong>Animation</strong> tab and apply the “Random 2” animation. Change its starting and end times according to your preference. Click <strong>OK.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
