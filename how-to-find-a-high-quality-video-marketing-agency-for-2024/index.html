You can assess their quality by judging their creativity, work style, production value, and marketing techniques from their past works. Once you are convinced of their skills and capabilities, you can shortlist them.</p>

With so many video marketing companies ready to scam you, the question boils down to how to find a high-quality agency that can provide the expected results. Here are some crucial steps to judge if a marketing video agency is worth your time and money.</p>
<h5 id="Step-1-Be-Clear-About-Your-Objective-3"><a href="#Step-1-Be-Clear-About-Your-Objective-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 1 Be Clear About Your Objective"></a>Step 1 Be Clear About Your Objective</h5><p>Before you start finding video content marketing companies, you should be clear about the goals you want to achieve through video marketing. For some brands, the goal could be increasing brand awareness and visibility by driving website traffic. For others, it could be generating leads and boosting sales. Once you are clear about your goals and expectations, you can start finding agencies that specialize in fulfilling your objectives.</p>

But you cannot take their promises for granted. Instead, evaluate their capabilities by reviewing their portfolio consisting of their past projects. You can assess their quality by judging their creativity, work style, production value, and marketing techniques from their past works. Once you are convinced of their skills and capabilities, you can shortlist them.</p>

<h2 id="Shots-Required-For-Super-Jump-Effect"><a href="#Shots-Required-For-Super-Jump-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Shots Required For Super Jump Effect"></a>Shots Required For Super Jump Effect</h2><p>You can use either a mobile phone or a camera for shooting, but you have to keep these things in mind:</p>
<p>Keep the following important tips in mind while shooting clips using your phone or camera.</p>
<p><strong>● Use Wide-Angle</strong></p>
<p>Always use the wide-angle view to ensure everything is in focus with a good depth of field.</p>
<p><strong>● The Camera Should Be Steady</strong></p>
<p>Make sure that the phone or camera is on a steady surface to avoid any turbulence or frame shifting.</p>
<p><strong>● Sufficient Light</strong></p>
<p>Make sure there is sufficient light and ambiance. Once you have set your camera, these are the three shots you have to take:</p>
<h3 id="Shot-1-Jump-Into-the-Air-at-a-Distance"><a href="#Shot-1-Jump-Into-the-Air-at-a-Distance" class="headerlink" title="Shot 1: Jump Into the Air at a Distance"></a>Shot 1: Jump Into the Air at a Distance</h3><p>The subject will jump into the air at a distance from the camera.

Here is a step-by-step guide for editing these shots.</p>
<h3 id="Steps-To-Edit-These-Clips"><a href="#Steps-To-Edit-These-Clips" class="headerlink" title="Steps To Edit These Clips"></a>Steps To Edit These Clips</h3><p>The tools we are going to use in this editing are masking, time ramping, speed ramping, keyframing, the Boris FX effect, and many more.</p>
<p><strong>Open Wondershare Filmora and Add Video Tracks</strong></p>
<p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
<p>Step1 Select the empty background clip (shot 3) and place it on the first video track timeline.</p>
<p>Step2 Now place the jumping clip (shot 4) on the top.</p>
<p><strong>Adding a Freeze Frame</strong></p>
<p>A freeze frame is a type of still image that is created by simply freezing the action. Most of the time, this is used in the last shot of a movie to capture a moment in time. Here are the steps to adding a free frame.</p>
<p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
<p>Step1 Move the playhead up to the point where the subject’s body appears smallest.</p>
<p>Step2 Add a freeze frame at this point by right-clicking on the playhead and selecting the speed option.</p>
<p>Step3 Make a cut at the start of the freeze frame, keep it for 8 frames and delete the rest.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Masking of the Video Clips</strong></p>
<p>Masking is a tool in editing software that allows you to hide, duplicate, show, or adjust footage by selecting a specific section of the video or using video overlays. The steps for adding the masking effect are given below:</p>
<p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
<p>Step1 Now click on the clip view to open the “settings” window.</p>
<p>Step2 Click on the “mask” section and select the circle mask and create the mask of the jumping subject.</p>
<p>Step3 Hide the first track clip so that mask can be viewed better and edited effectively.</p>
<p>Step4 Adjust the scale, position, and shape of the mask and make the edges smoother to match the object.</p>

                      alt="masking"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Boris Fx Effect</strong></p>
<p>Boris FX is a video editing and visual effects software. Filmora supports six continuum units-professional quality effects plugins from award-winning developer Boris FX.</p>
<p>To add these effects to your videos, follow the steps below:</p>
<p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
<p>Step1 Go to the “effects” window and open the Boris FX effects.</p>
<p>Step2 Select the directional blur from the bcc blur category.</p>
<p>Step3 Drag the effect to the freeze frame.</p>
<p>Step4 Now clicking on freeze frame, its settings will open.</p>
<p>Step5 Adjust the degree and angle of blur to get a perfect mask object. Turn ON the first video track.</p>
<p>Step6 Add the landing clip (shot 2) on top of the first video track after the freezing frame.</p>
<p>Step7 Find the point where the subject starts to descend toward the floor. Cut the clip here and delete the previous part.</p>
<p>Step8 Move the clip next to the freeze frame clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/super-jump-effect-6.gif"
                      alt="borax fx effect"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Keyframing</strong></p>
<p>Now we have to add animation in the freezing frame so that the masked shadow can be shown moving from the back towards the front, a speedy moving shadow. This is probably the most crucial step in editing.</p>
<p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
<p>Step1 Click on the freezing frame, and in the settings window, open “animation.”</p>
<p>Step2 Click on the customized option. Add the first keyframe at the start of the clip.</p>
<p>Step3 Now move two frames and add another keyframe with the position of the masked shadow as it is moving out of frame.</p>
<p>Step4 Now move two frames keeping the settings the same.</p>
<p>Step5 Add another keyframe at the end with your masked shadow appearing half from the top of the frame.</p>
<p>This step is a bit tricky to understand, but the most important. Once it is done, your animation will give the impression of an object moving like a flash from the back to the front of view.</p>

                      alt="keyframing"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Speed Ramping</strong></p>
<p>Once the keyframing is done, your super jump effect is roughly ready. All you have to do now is synchronize the speed of jumping, moving shadow, and landing. Here we will use the “speed ramping” tool.</p>
<p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
<p>Step1 Click on the clip, and in the settings window, choose “speed.”</p>
<p>Step2 Click on customize and increase the speed of any frame or clip.</p>
<p>Step3 Move the play head on the frame that you intend to increase the speed of, and move the frame on the speed window to speed up that part.</p>
<p>Once you have done speed ramping on both clips, your editing is done. Now play the video and see how the clip looks and if your super jump effect is remarkable or not.</p>
