And Why AI Upscaling Is Significant?"></a>Part 1 What Is AI Upscaling? And Why AI Upscaling Is Significant?</h2><p>The process of generating or creating additional pixels of an image or frame in a video is AI Upscaling. This has many good results on the final video output.</p>
<p>This is mainly done to raise the bit rate of the video and, therefore, slightly improve the visual quality of the video. This is also used to improve the picture quality of DVDs and other low-quality videos. It is done to support lower quality videos or pictures on higher resolution screens like TV. This kind of upscaling is mostly done in TVs automatically.</p>

If you display a lower resolution video on a high-resolution TV, the TV will upscale the video quality of the lower resolution video. This process mainly happens by the displaying device itself. But you can try to upscale videos by yourself using this software, which will help you achieve the best results.</p>
