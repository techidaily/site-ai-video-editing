                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/funny-content-ideas-6.jpg"
                      alt="add video to timeline"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Now, let the fun begin. Start by double-clicking on the video part that you want to edit and animate. Then enable the ‘Motion Tracking’ option and adjust the tracker on the screen where you want the scene.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="use motion tracking feature"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: Let us make the editing enjoyable. For that, head to the ‘Elements’ tab. Search for laser-related elements. Then, drag your selected element to the timeline. You can adjust the element in the preview window by double-clicking on it.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="add elements to video"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4: Finish off by adding a cool transition to your funny meme video. This could be done from the ‘Transition’ section. You can add as many Elements and Transitions as you want.</p>
