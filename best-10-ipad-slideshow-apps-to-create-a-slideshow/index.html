Type Text Effect</h3><p>The type text effect in Filmora is referred to as the typewriter text effect in Premiere Pro and After Effects. The effect displays the text as if it is being typed in real-time as it is done in a typewriter. The characters will appear on the screen with a cursor on the screen and therefore, it takes more duration than most other text effects.</p>
<p>The type text effect is particularly useful when you are displaying a large size of text on the screen. It is also widely used when showing a paragraph of text instead of a simple line. This helps in drawing the attention of the audience to the paragraph and retaining the attention for a longer duration of time.</p>
<h3 id="3-WordArt-Effect"><a href="#3-WordArt-Effect" class="headerlink" title="3. WordArt Effect"></a>3.

Apart from 3D effect, text can have a thick stroke or outline as well as a gradient color style when WordArt effect is applied. In Filmora, you will find a plethora of WordArt effects and some are them are modern while others have a retro feel to them.</p>
<p>The WordArt effect is particularly popular while displaying titles and funny texts on the entire screen or covering a large part of the video. These are mostly used in the opening or ending scenes of the video. Besides, some video creators use them while making transitions from one scene to another.</p>
<h3 id="4-Keyframe"><a href="#4-Keyframe" class="headerlink" title="4. Keyframe"></a>4. Keyframe</h3><p>If you want to create text animations as per your requirements, you have to use keyframes in any video editor. You can always apply the ready-made video editing text effects but if you want to customize and personalize, you can add keyframes in between two timestamps. Thereafter, you need to change text styles and parameters for each frame so that it looks like an animation.</p>
<p>If you want to add uniqueness to text animations so that you can make the audience wonder and appreciate, keyframes are the way. Adding keyframes in the text layer on Filmora is super easy and you can get effects like texts slowly scaling up, dancing randomly, changing fonts, and much more.</p>
<h3 id="5-Color-Text-Effect"><a href="#5-Color-Text-Effect" class="headerlink" title="5. Color Text Effect"></a>5. Color Text Effect</h3><p>The color text effect is becoming extremely popular and it is widely used for opening and ending credits.

Generally, the effect lasts for a few seconds before the text disappears. When you are using it for a larger text, you can use it for promotions and advertisements as well.</p>
