No matter how wonderful or perfect a video clip is, if the audio playing while watching it is terrible, it may be a very frustrating experience. So, we’ve gone over a few different software options for removing audio from a video file and replacing it with another audio in a couple of moments.</p>

<p>To begin, open Resolve and import your audio clip:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the “Edit” page.</li>
<li>Select the tab “Media Pool.”</li>
<li>Right-click and choose “Import Media” or push “Ctrl + i.”</li>
<li>Pick your audio clip and browse to your location.</li>
<li>Select “Open.”</li>
</ol>
<p>The audio clip is now imported into the “Media Pool.” After that, you’ll need to figure out which part of the audio track you’ll use.</p>
<p>Double-click the audio clip to play it. In the “Source Viewer,” it will appear.</p>
<p>Set the needed audio parts in (press I) and out (press O). Alternatively, if you need the entire soundtrack, there’s no need to set in and out.</p>
<p>Drag &amp; drop the audio track (from the media pool) underneath the video you want to use. It will then add the sound file with the selected portion of the audio. You can now modify the audio to match the visual.</p>
