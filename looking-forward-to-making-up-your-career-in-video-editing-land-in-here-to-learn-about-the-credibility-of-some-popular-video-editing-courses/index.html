<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Look for a site that can translate a GIF document to the APNG file. Don’t worry about this step since you can always google the top options. We currently have the ezgif site but technology changes every day; hence you can expect rising websites.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Create a GIF or download one that meets your taste from different websites. Currently, we have many sites offering free GIFs; hence you don’t have to worry about copyright issues. Some top websites to consider are Giphy, Gifer, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Look for a site that can translate a GIF document to the APNG file. Don’t worry about this step since you can always google the top options. We currently have the ezgif site but technology changes every day; hence you can expect rising websites.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Check on the Crossfade Frames option. Note that you need to choose images with at most thirty frames. Finally, click on the Make APNG option</p>

<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> You can add multiple after-effects after creating the GIF to customize the final look</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Download the final file and save it on your PC with the name you wish</p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Upload on Discord</p>
<p><strong>Important things to note when uploading GIFs on Discord</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Discord only allows a file that is at least 8MBs. So, if yours isn’t, you can compress it via different websites.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A gif with nitro is neater, but a GIF without nitro works better than having an image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Even without discord Nitro, you still have access to the <strong>cool animated discord profile pics if you have a discord server.</strong> Suppose you have an <strong>animated discord profile</strong>, and then we can only see one frame without discord nitro.</p>

When it is about editing GIFs, you are free to experiment with limitless creativity. While making GIFs from videos is quite a common edit, something that gains attraction is, turning dull videos into classic, <strong>transparent GIFs</strong>.</p>
<p>Still wondering on this to be a possibility? Rest assured, because it is certainly a ‘Yes’. You can very conveniently create a <strong>transparent GIF</strong> from your videos without a hustle. All you need to do is just a background shuffle. While you can do this with almost any GIF editing software available across the web, here’s how you can take up the process using the Egif video converter tool:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Convert a Video to GIF</strong></p>
<p>Using Egif, first of all convert a desired video into GIF. Take caution to manually remove backgrounds from all video frames and save the GIF using .gif or .png file extensions. Don’t use .jpg extension; else you will end up losing background transparency.</p>
<p>In case of a solid color GIF background, navigate to Egif’s ‘Effects Tool’ and click on ‘Replace Color with Transparency’.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="Original GIF with White Background"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Color Selection</strong></p>
<p>Make a desired color selection that you wish to replace with transparent pixels. Select ‘White’ for a black and white GIF background. In case of color backgrounds, open any suitable picture editor (GIMP, MS Paint, etc.) and choose the hex color code using the ‘Color Picker’ tool.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/How-to-make-a-GIF-with-transparent-background-2.JPG"
                      alt="Background Options"
                ></p>

                      alt="Processed GIF with Transparent Background"
                ></p>
<p>This tool however, has compatibility limitations and can replace only a restricted number of color backgrounds, which too should not match the color scheme of foreground objects that you wish to restore in your GIF. If you require partially transparent backgrounds within specific portions of complex animated creations, you can use the ‘GIF Maker’ tool to selectively split and edit every clip frame, apply the transparency effect and finally merge all such clips together.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Can-Parts-of-GIF-Be-Made-Semi-Transparent"><a href="#Part-2-Can-Parts-of-GIF-Be-Made-Semi-Transparent" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Can Parts of GIF Be Made Semi-Transparent?"></a>Part 2 Can Parts of GIF Be Made Semi-Transparent?</h2><p>No matter how much disappointing it appears, you can never introduce semi-transparent backgrounds in your GIFs. This is due to the fact that the GIF format has a limitation on pixel appearances. This basically means that you can only have completely opaque or completely transparent GIF backgrounds, strictly permitting nothing in between. Hence, it is a regret to conclude that you can literally never add anti-aliasing effects to your GIF backgrounds.</p>
<p>This may be a little disapproving though, but thanks to revolutions in technology, you can live up to the hope that creating semi-transparent GIFs would not be a forever tussle. You never know when the trick strikes IT engineers, and you may possibly be reading an article on interesting ways of creating semi-transparent GIFs in future!</p>

When it is about editing GIFs, you are free to experiment with limitless creativity. While making GIFs from videos is quite a common edit, something that gains attraction is, turning dull videos into classic, <strong>transparent GIFs</strong>.</p>
<p>Still wondering on this to be a possibility? Rest assured, because it is certainly a ‘Yes’. You can very conveniently create a <strong>transparent GIF</strong> from your videos without a hustle. All you need to do is just a background shuffle. While you can do this with almost any GIF editing software available across the web, here’s how you can take up the process using the Egif video converter tool:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Convert a Video to GIF</strong></p>
<p>Using Egif, first of all convert a desired video into GIF. Take caution to manually remove backgrounds from all video frames and save the GIF using .gif or .png file extensions. Don’t use .jpg extension; else you will end up losing background transparency.</p>
<p>In case of a solid color GIF background, navigate to Egif’s ‘Effects Tool’ and click on ‘Replace Color with Transparency’.</p>

                      alt="Original GIF with White Background"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Color Selection</strong></p>
<p>Make a desired color selection that you wish to replace with transparent pixels. Select ‘White’ for a black and white GIF background. In case of color backgrounds, open any suitable picture editor (GIMP, MS Paint, etc.) and choose the hex color code using the ‘Color Picker’ tool.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>This tool however, has compatibility limitations and can replace only a restricted number of color backgrounds, which too should not match the color scheme of foreground objects that you wish to restore in your GIF. If you require partially transparent backgrounds within specific portions of complex animated creations, you can use the ‘GIF Maker’ tool to selectively split and edit every clip frame, apply the transparency effect and finally merge all such clips together.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Can-Parts-of-GIF-Be-Made-Semi-Transparent-1"><a href="#Part-2-Can-Parts-of-GIF-Be-Made-Semi-Transparent-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Can Parts of GIF Be Made Semi-Transparent?"></a>Part 2 Can Parts of GIF Be Made Semi-Transparent?</h2><p>No matter how much disappointing it appears, you can never introduce semi-transparent backgrounds in your GIFs. This is due to the fact that the GIF format has a limitation on pixel appearances. This basically means that you can only have completely opaque or completely transparent GIF backgrounds, strictly permitting nothing in between. Hence, it is a regret to conclude that you can literally never add anti-aliasing effects to your GIF backgrounds.</p>
<p>This may be a little disapproving though, but thanks to revolutions in technology, you can live up to the hope that creating semi-transparent GIFs would not be a forever tussle. You never know when the trick strikes IT engineers, and you may possibly be reading an article on interesting ways of creating semi-transparent GIFs in future!</p>

When it is about editing GIFs, you are free to experiment with limitless creativity. While making GIFs from videos is quite a common edit, something that gains attraction is, turning dull videos into classic, <strong>transparent GIFs</strong>.</p>
<p>Still wondering on this to be a possibility? Rest assured, because it is certainly a ‘Yes’. You can very conveniently create a <strong>transparent GIF</strong> from your videos without a hustle. All you need to do is just a background shuffle. While you can do this with almost any GIF editing software available across the web, here’s how you can take up the process using the Egif video converter tool:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Convert a Video to GIF</strong></p>
<p>Using Egif, first of all convert a desired video into GIF. Take caution to manually remove backgrounds from all video frames and save the GIF using .gif or .png file extensions. Don’t use .jpg extension; else you will end up losing background transparency.</p>
<p>In case of a solid color GIF background, navigate to Egif’s ‘Effects Tool’ and click on ‘Replace Color with Transparency’.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2: Color Selection</strong></p>

Windows Movie Maker comes pre-installed in older Windows versions though it has been discontinued in the latest Windows versions. However, if you are using the latest Windows versions, you can install MiniTool Movie Maker instead. If you are editing your video in Windows Movie Maker, you should know how to save your video in MP4 format.</p>
<p>MP4 file format is the most used video file format, and hence, you should know how to save Windows movie maker mp4 file. Otherwise, you won’t be able to play your video on regular video players on different devices. This is because not all video players support the native Windows Movie Maker file format, but they support MP4 format as it is very common. In this article, we will illustrate the steps for Windows Movie Maker how to save as MP4 file.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Steps-to-Save-Windows-Movie-Maker-Video-as-MP4"><a href="#Part-1-Steps-to-Save-Windows-Movie-Maker-Video-as-MP4" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Steps to Save Windows Movie Maker Video as MP4"></a>Part 1. Steps to Save Windows Movie Maker Video as MP4</h2><p>There are two scenarios you may come across while dealing with Windows Movie Maker MP4 situation. First, you might be editing your video on Windows Movie Maker, and you want to save it in MP4 format. Second, you might have received a video file saved in the native Windows Movie Maker file format and you want to convert it to MP4 file format. In the second scenario, you must opt for a Windows Movie Maker to MP4 converter such as VideoConverterFactory.</p>
<p>For the first scenario where you are editing your video on Windows Movie Maker, the solution is simple. This is because the default file format to save a video file on Windows Movie Maker is MP4. There are other options available such as WMV, but if you opt for the recommended settings, you can easily save your video file in MP4. Here are the steps for Windows Movie Maker to mp4 file format.</p>
<p>Step1Launch Windows Movie Maker on your PC. Create a new project and import your video clips. Split, trim, join, add transitions, effects, and titles as per your requirements.</p>
<p>Step2When you are done editing your video, go to Home tab&gt; Save Movie button available on Share section.</p>
