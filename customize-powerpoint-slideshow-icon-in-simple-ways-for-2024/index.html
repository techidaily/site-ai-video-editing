Videos are like windows to the past, allowing us to relive precious moments and memories. Similarly, good-looking videos have this remarkable ability to last forever. Even when it comes to content creation, videos are a great engagement tool. They engage audiences like no other medium can, conveying emotions and messages.</p>
<p>However, <strong>VHS effects</strong> have added more spice to the content creation and the creative work behind it. They give a normal video a distinct character and style, further improving it. By applying <strong>VHS filters</strong>, you can change the mood of your videos entirely. Applying these effects to your videos sometimes becomes difficult. However, there is always a simple solution to apply VHS to your videos.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-VHS-Effect-An-Overview"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-VHS-Effect-An-Overview" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is VHS Effect? An Overview"></a>Part 1: What is VHS Effect? An Overview</h2><p>People from the 80s would remember the good old days when they used to watch movies on VHS tapes. In simple terms, the <strong>VHS effect</strong> is a style that tries to recreate the look of VHS recordings. It’s a nostalgic-style effect that has gained popularity in recent years. You can apply different filters and techniques to your videos to achieve this effect.</p>
<p>These techniques aim to replicate the features of VHS tapes. The key features of the VHS filters include distortion, noise, and tracking errors. Distortion and noise create flickering lines and static. Furthermore, the tracking errors give the impression of an unstable video signal. These elements make the video appear just like the old VHS tapes from the 80s.</p>
<p>Additionally, color grading plays an important role in creating this effect. VHS tapes had a unique color palette with saturated and slightly shifted colors. You can replicate this effect by adjusting and applying color grading effects.</p>

This part will discuss the steps to add VHS video effects using Premiere Pro. Although you can also try this on your Mac, you can surely look for other options. If you are a consistent user of FCPX instead of Premiere Pro, you can also <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >apply VFH effects to your videos using FCPX <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open Adobe Premiere Pro and import the video to which you want to apply the effect. Click on the “Color” option in the main toolbar to open the “Lumetri Color” panel. In the panel, choose “Lumetri Scopes” from the top toolbar to open a graph window.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Switch to the “Creative” tab in the “Lumetri Color” panel. Increase the “Faded Film” to your preference. Lower the “Sharpness,” “Saturation,” and “Vibrance” as desired. Adjust the color wheels in the “Color Wheels &amp; Match” section of the “Lumetri Color” tab to achieve the desired VHS look. Find the “Vignette” option in the same tab and increase its value.</p>

This part will discuss the steps to add VHS video effects using Premiere Pro. Although you can also try this on your Mac, you can surely look for other options. If you are a consistent user of FCPX instead of Premiere Pro, you can also <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >apply VFH effects to your videos using FCPX <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open Adobe Premiere Pro and import the video to which you want to apply the effect. Click on the “Color” option in the main toolbar to open the “Lumetri Color” panel. In the panel, choose “Lumetri Scopes” from the top toolbar to open a graph window.</p>

When designing an anime character, there are a series of aspects to be held into the light. Considering the fact that these elements add spark and engagement into the story being depicted, enough focus should be laid on crafting out the minute details that are essential to infuse liveliness and suitability into the character.</p>
<p>Anime characters are created to foretell a customary tale in a fantasizing manner, depicting all the superficial elements that you may possibly never imagine of coming across in real life. Another aspect is the animation element that happens to be the pivot of anime designing. All these put together on a single palette work to bring out an amazing anime story to life. But that’s not all.</p>
<p>No doubt on the significance of the aforesaid elements in crafting the most perfect anime design, but an essential fact that naturally goes unnoticed is the creator’s own interpretations and thoughts about the specific anime characters that are responsible for delivering a captivating story. Talking of specific character design, the key is to include the exact and accurate details of style, physical features, body language, costumes and other nuances that are crucial factors to comment on how the audience relates and responds to the character.</p>
<p>Respecting the diversity in the realm of <strong>anime design</strong>, each character tends to portray a completely distinguished appeal from the others. As of the likehood factor, while some characters receive a moderate attention, there are others who conveniently succeed in creating a long lasting impact. Moving ahead with our discussion along the same line, let us talk about some of the most loved and stand out anime character designs in what follows next:</p>
<h3 id="01My-Hero-Academia"><a href="#01My-Hero-Academia" class="headerlink" title="01My Hero Academia"></a>01My Hero Academia</h3><p><strong>Main Attractive Design Features</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Character design has a significant influence of Western comics</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Special attention is paid on the hair styling and costume selection of each character</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The characters have a unique color crafting for a stand out recognition</p>

Moving along the line, this anime artwork dedicates itself to follow the exact footprints of the Western caricature art form in every aspect of character improvisation, right from color crafting to dynamic styling.</p>
<p>Another significant element of character design that is laid special focus on by the aforesaid anime flick, of course in cohesion with the Western comics is the hairstyle and costumes of the characters. Such elements are used to raise up the personality of the characters, while simultaneously sparking up their powers.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> The series is a classic school level anime series with a reflective character design</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The character formations have a minute and distinguished detailing in physical features and body language</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The costumes, shade summaries and specific personality etiquettes work to set up a subtle communication among the characters</p>
<p>Centered greatly on school level anime creation, the most reflective aspects of Kyoto Animation character designs are present in the quick apparel changes and impressive body language. For instance, a simple flip of the hair can say a lot about a character’s personality of being lazy or active. It is however, interesting to note that Kyoto Animation did not have a significant recognition in character design before the advent of Miss Kobayashi’s Dragon Maid.</p>
<p>The aforesaid anime series opened massive doors for the animation company to try hands at experimenting with the epic cuteness that the latter is known for in today’s times. Be it the character costumes, color patterns, or even a quick shine in the eye, everything works so perfectly to build up a subtle communication among the dragon girls of this series.</p>
<p>The minute detailing works to highlight the differences between the respective personalities of these characters, along with setting each one miles apart from the other in a hoard of aspects.</p>

<h3 id="03Kill-La-Kill"><a href="#03Kill-La-Kill" class="headerlink" title="03Kill La Kill"></a>03Kill La Kill</h3><p><strong>Main Attractive Design Features</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The <strong>animation character design</strong> of this anime series is inspired by the art style of Studio Trigger</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The best thing about the aforesaid character formations is the flawless homogeneity among the apparel design, color coding and line work</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The character frames are also quite impressive and neatly adopted to the formations</p>
<p>The character design schematics of Kill La Kill attempts to display the best version of Studio Trigger’s art style. As of the specific design form, the latter works to strike the closest communication between the line work, color and costume design. A significant amount of character information can be drawn out with just a close observation of these details.</p>
<p>For instance, you can figure out the silly nature of Mayo, or the jittery one of Ryuko by sparing a mere look at their specific character outlines. Moving ahead, you can make out a clear difference among each of the Student Council Members. The expressive play of vibrant shades in the characters’ costumes makes them appear no less than those of a fight sequence.</p>
<p>No doubt on the animation expertise of Studio Trigger; yet the latter has worked a lot on their character frames as well. The anime flick has a neat adoption of these elusive character design aspects to put forward a masterpiece of art.</p>

<h3 id="04Naruto"><a href="#04Naruto" class="headerlink" title="04Naruto"></a>04Naruto</h3><p><strong>Main Attractive Design Features</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The Naruto anime series has succeeded in showcasing the Shonen Jump character design in possibly the best possible manner</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The character design aims to bind together the characters’ personalities with their abilities and the contemporary culture</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The character design is a balanced play of character communication and formation diversities</p>
<p>One of the 3 major anime productions that have incorporated the Shonen Jump’s style of character design, Naruto is credited with the depicting the best play of art through its set of the closest resembling characters. Talking of the impersonation of the other two flicks, One Piece showcases a vibrant but quite a caricaturized character formation.</p>

Be it the body language, or the distinguished costume style, each character has its own space to communicate with the story.</p>
<p>Whether it is the extravagant dress of Kiss Shot, Karen’s egg braid and track suit in yellow, or the explicitly visible difference between Hanekawa and Senjougahara’s eye looks, everyone has its own signature style or appearance.

<p><strong>●</strong> The aforesaid series showcases affordably the weirdest character designs ever, but that’s what the captivating factor</p>

Consisting of the most influential members of the Hunter Association, the character assimilation is entirely centered on the animal theme picked by the chairman.</p>
<p>The characters are made to wear some the most oddly pronounced looks, like that of Cheadle, who appears to be a dog.

A few instances include the uncomfortably clean behavior of Pariston, and Ging’s ugly, beggar-like appearance.</p>
<p>The weird and overly pronounced character design draws its inspiration from the dark designs of the Phantom Troop, the Zoldyck’s ghastly stares in casual attire, and the absence of any sort of biological resemblances in the Chimera Ants.</p>

<h3 id="03User’s-Guide-to-Create-an-Anime-Character-Design"><a href="#03User’s-Guide-to-Create-an-Anime-Character-Design" class="headerlink" title="03User’s Guide to Create an Anime Character Design"></a>03User’s Guide to Create an Anime Character Design</h3><p>Adhere to the following guide for a stepwise assistance towards creating your own anime character design in a quick time span:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Create a Character Outline</strong></p>
<p>Start with planning out the fundamental image and appearance of your character. Pen down the minimum details that the character is supposed to retain, of course in line with the message it has to deliver. Moving a bit deeper, point out the essentials of the character’s basic personality, like, the costumes, accessories, postures and physical features.</p>
<p>In case you are focused on designing a human character formation, take care to punch in some fundamental information about the same in your design. Moving in to add more comprehensive detailing, you can include the elements of age, occupation, etc. When everything is set and you have all the requisite details at one place, it’s time to proceed towards the next step.</p>

                      alt="Creating Your Own Anime Character- Creating a Character Outline"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Sketch Out a Rough Design</strong></p>
<p>Having all the character details by your side, proceed to club them in a rough sketch. You are free to select the viewing angle and posture of your character in line with your specific preferences. it is a smart idea to design a minimum of one complete figure sketch and a few variations of close up facial expressions.</p>
<p>Some specific character designs require having a particular size preference for the character, like that of it being specifically small or big. In such a case, you can have a better analysis of your character’s height by sketching them out in parallel with an additional character with an average size. It is further advisable to work with a minimum detailing of the different aspects of your character, lest you may end up with a complicated design.</p>
<p>If, at a later stage, the character comes out with a bland appearance, there is always a scope of adding extra details. When you have a host of character sketches portraying specific elements, you can move ahead with selecting the best pieces and combining the same into a single character design.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Develop Your Character Design</strong></p>
<p>The basic design of an anime character is sufficiently crafted in Step 2. However, if you wish to spark up your character design with some extra detailing, move ahead with working on the postures of your character. Sketch the front, back and both sides of your character. It is important to note that should not skip drawing any of the side poses unless you a creating a mirrored effect with the character, where both the sides appear exactly same.</p>
<p>You can further, add some additional posture views from different angles. Trying out the anterior, posterior, top and lateral viewing angles can be of great help when designing complex characters with a comprehensive detailing. Experimenting with a diversity of postures and viewing angles aids to fetch an all-round character design that can be used to work with the same character in different motion graphic applications.</p>
<p>To craft your character’s design in even proportion across different formation views, you can attempt to work with a simple, 2-step process. Draw guidelines of a particular body part in a specific view, followed by using these guidelines to sketch out the same body part in a different view. You should significantly realize the fact that the difference in perspectives does not allow the perfect alignment of specific portions of a character design to its counterparts, when looked through different viewing angles.</p>
<p>As in the following figure, you can easily observe the misalignment of the character’s feet on account of being viewed from the front view. You can also notice the sketches to move a bit ahead of the guideline as the character approaches forward in the front view.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Complement Your Design With Perfect Shades</strong></p>
<p>In the specific case of manga character design, the formations mostly go well with a black and white color arrangement. You can however, add a tint of complementary shades when creating a character design for a cover page. When proceeding to open the color palette for your character design, there are a variety of aspects worth paying attention.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="Creating Your Own Anime Character- Selecting the Perfect Color Scheme"
                ></p>
<p>It is always a smart idea to choose complementary colors that are a perfect mix and match for each other.

<p><strong>Step 1: Create a Character Outline</strong></p>
<p>Start with planning out the fundamental image and appearance of your character. Pen down the minimum details that the character is supposed to retain, of course in line with the message it has to deliver. Moving a bit deeper, point out the essentials of the character’s basic personality, like, the costumes, accessories, postures and physical features.</p>
<p>In case you are focused on designing a human character formation, take care to punch in some fundamental information about the same in your design. Moving in to add more comprehensive detailing, you can include the elements of age, occupation, etc. When everything is set and you have all the requisite details at one place, it’s time to proceed towards the next step.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Sketch Out a Rough Design</strong></p>
<p>Having all the character details by your side, proceed to club them in a rough sketch. You are free to select the viewing angle and posture of your character in line with your specific preferences. it is a smart idea to design a minimum of one complete figure sketch and a few variations of close up facial expressions.</p>
<p>Some specific character designs require having a particular size preference for the character, like that of it being specifically small or big. In such a case, you can have a better analysis of your character’s height by sketching them out in parallel with an additional character with an average size. It is further advisable to work with a minimum detailing of the different aspects of your character, lest you may end up with a complicated design.</p>
<p>If, at a later stage, the character comes out with a bland appearance, there is always a scope of adding extra details. When you have a host of character sketches portraying specific elements, you can move ahead with selecting the best pieces and combining the same into a single character design.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3: Develop Your Character Design</strong></p>
<p>The basic design of an anime character is sufficiently crafted in Step 2. However, if you wish to spark up your character design with some extra detailing, move ahead with working on the postures of your character. Sketch the front, back and both sides of your character. It is important to note that should not skip drawing any of the side poses unless you a creating a mirrored effect with the character, where both the sides appear exactly same.</p>
<p>You can further, add some additional posture views from different angles. Trying out the anterior, posterior, top and lateral viewing angles can be of great help when designing complex characters with a comprehensive detailing. Experimenting with a diversity of postures and viewing angles aids to fetch an all-round character design that can be used to work with the same character in different motion graphic applications.</p>
<p>To craft your character’s design in even proportion across different formation views, you can attempt to work with a simple, 2-step process. Draw guidelines of a particular body part in a specific view, followed by using these guidelines to sketch out the same body part in a different view. You should significantly realize the fact that the difference in perspectives does not allow the perfect alignment of specific portions of a character design to its counterparts, when looked through different viewing angles.</p>
<p>As in the following figure, you can easily observe the misalignment of the character’s feet on account of being viewed from the front view. You can also notice the sketches to move a bit ahead of the guideline as the character approaches forward in the front view.</p>

<p>Understating this with an example, you would generally refrain from adding shades of red in a character design that is centered on ice magic fantasy. Instead, picking a blue tint would work a lot better and complementary for this particular character design.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> The aforesaid series showcases affordably the weirdest character designs ever, but that’s what the captivating factor</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The character styling and costume design is centered on an animal theme</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The body language of the non-animal characters is no less in adding to the uniqueness of character formations</p>
<p>Looking from the character design aspect, the aforesaid anime series may appear more as an odd synchronization of styling elements to most of us. However, this very weirdness is the catchy cue of the special character formations of the Hunter X Hunter storyline. Consisting of the most influential members of the Hunter Association, the character assimilation is entirely centered on the animal theme picked by the chairman.</p>
<p>The characters are made to wear some the most oddly pronounced looks, like that of Cheadle, who appears to be a dog. The striking attraction of the character design is however, the non-animal costumes of some characters, who talk better with their attitudes. A few instances include the uncomfortably clean behavior of Pariston, and Ging’s ugly, beggar-like appearance.</p>
<p>The weird and overly pronounced character design draws its inspiration from the dark designs of the Phantom Troop, the Zoldyck’s ghastly stares in casual attire, and the absence of any sort of biological resemblances in the Chimera Ants.</p>

<h3 id="03User’s-Guide-to-Create-an-Anime-Character-Design-2"><a href="#03User’s-Guide-to-Create-an-Anime-Character-Design-2" class="headerlink" title="03User’s Guide to Create an Anime Character Design"></a>03User’s Guide to Create an Anime Character Design</h3><p>Adhere to the following guide for a stepwise assistance towards creating your own anime character design in a quick time span:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Create a Character Outline</strong></p>
<p>Start with planning out the fundamental image and appearance of your character. Pen down the minimum details that the character is supposed to retain, of course in line with the message it has to deliver. Moving a bit deeper, point out the essentials of the character’s basic personality, like, the costumes, accessories, postures and physical features.</p>
<p>In case you are focused on designing a human character formation, take care to punch in some fundamental information about the same in your design. Moving in to add more comprehensive detailing, you can include the elements of age, occupation, etc. When everything is set and you have all the requisite details at one place, it’s time to proceed towards the next step.</p>

                      alt="Creating Your Own Anime Character- Creating a Character Outline"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Sketch Out a Rough Design</strong></p>
<p>Having all the character details by your side, proceed to club them in a rough sketch. You are free to select the viewing angle and posture of your character in line with your specific preferences. it is a smart idea to design a minimum of one complete figure sketch and a few variations of close up facial expressions.</p>
<p>Some specific character designs require having a particular size preference for the character, like that of it being specifically small or big. In such a case, you can have a better analysis of your character’s height by sketching them out in parallel with an additional character with an average size. It is further advisable to work with a minimum detailing of the different aspects of your character, lest you may end up with a complicated design.</p>
<p>If, at a later stage, the character comes out with a bland appearance, there is always a scope of adding extra details. When you have a host of character sketches portraying specific elements, you can move ahead with selecting the best pieces and combining the same into a single character design.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Develop Your Character Design</strong></p>
<p>The basic design of an anime character is sufficiently crafted in Step 2. However, if you wish to spark up your character design with some extra detailing, move ahead with working on the postures of your character. Sketch the front, back and both sides of your character. It is important to note that should not skip drawing any of the side poses unless you a creating a mirrored effect with the character, where both the sides appear exactly same.</p>
<p>You can further, add some additional posture views from different angles. Trying out the anterior, posterior, top and lateral viewing angles can be of great help when designing complex characters with a comprehensive detailing. Experimenting with a diversity of postures and viewing angles aids to fetch an all-round character design that can be used to work with the same character in different motion graphic applications.</p>
<p>To craft your character’s design in even proportion across different formation views, you can attempt to work with a simple, 2-step process. Draw guidelines of a particular body part in a specific view, followed by using these guidelines to sketch out the same body part in a different view. You should significantly realize the fact that the difference in perspectives does not allow the perfect alignment of specific portions of a character design to its counterparts, when looked through different viewing angles.</p>
<p>As in the following figure, you can easily observe the misalignment of the character’s feet on account of being viewed from the front view. You can also notice the sketches to move a bit ahead of the guideline as the character approaches forward in the front view.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Complement Your Design With Perfect Shades</strong></p>
<p>In the specific case of manga character design, the formations mostly go well with a black and white color arrangement. You can however, add a tint of complementary shades when creating a character design for a cover page. When proceeding to open the color palette for your character design, there are a variety of aspects worth paying attention.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Creating Your Own Anime Character- Selecting the Perfect Color Scheme"
                ></p>
<p>It is always a smart idea to choose complementary colors that are a perfect mix and match for each other. When picking complementary colors; look for the shades that lie across of each other on the color wheel. Such color arrangements are the preferences of almost any popular anime character you normally come across.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

        Shades"
                ></p>
<p>It is of course not necessary to pick your color scheme in perfect cohesion with the color wheel. You are free to select the desired variation of a specific color if the latter corresponds with the elements of your character design. Black and white is the safest choices, as they can go well with almost every color scheme and design specifications.</p>
<p>It would be wise enough to select your shades in line with the overall personality and appeal that your character is aimed at portraying. Colors are often linked with setting a specific mood for your creation. For instance, choosing a shade of blue would imbibe a sense of your character being cool, which picking a red tint on the other hand, adds an effect of warmth to the same.</p>
<p>Understating this with an example, you would generally refrain from adding shades of red in a character design that is centered on ice magic fantasy. Instead, picking a blue tint would work a lot better and complementary for this particular character design.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Hand Drawn Character Illustrations</strong></p>
<p>This style of anime character design is more suited to a craft oriented application that generally has a personal touch and appeal.

The advent of novel software packages for graphic design applications allow you to create such character designs digitally, ahead of paper.</p>

<h3 id="03User’s-Guide-to-Create-an-Anime-Character-Design-3"><a href="#03User’s-Guide-to-Create-an-Anime-Character-Design-3" class="headerlink" title="03User’s Guide to Create an Anime Character Design"></a>03User’s Guide to Create an Anime Character Design</h3><p>Adhere to the following guide for a stepwise assistance towards creating your own anime character design in a quick time span:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Create a Character Outline</strong></p>
<p>Start with planning out the fundamental image and appearance of your character. Pen down the minimum details that the character is supposed to retain, of course in line with the message it has to deliver. Moving a bit deeper, point out the essentials of the character’s basic personality, like, the costumes, accessories, postures and physical features.</p>
<p>In case you are focused on designing a human character formation, take care to punch in some fundamental information about the same in your design. Moving in to add more comprehensive detailing, you can include the elements of age, occupation, etc. When everything is set and you have all the requisite details at one place, it’s time to proceed towards the next step.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Creating Your Own Anime Character- Creating a Character Outline"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Sketch Out a Rough Design</strong></p>
<p>Having all the character details by your side, proceed to club them in a rough sketch. You are free to select the viewing angle and posture of your character in line with your specific preferences. it is a smart idea to design a minimum of one complete figure sketch and a few variations of close up facial expressions.</p>
<p>Some specific character designs require having a particular size preference for the character, like that of it being specifically small or big. In such a case, you can have a better analysis of your character’s height by sketching them out in parallel with an additional character with an average size. It is further advisable to work with a minimum detailing of the different aspects of your character, lest you may end up with a complicated design.</p>
<p>If, at a later stage, the character comes out with a bland appearance, there is always a scope of adding extra details. When you have a host of character sketches portraying specific elements, you can move ahead with selecting the best pieces and combining the same into a single character design.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/10-amazing-anime-character-designs-to-inspire-you-15.JPG"
                      alt="Creating Your Own Anime Character- Creating Rough Character Sketches"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Develop Your Character Design</strong></p>
<p>The basic design of an anime character is sufficiently crafted in Step 2. However, if you wish to spark up your character design with some extra detailing, move ahead with working on the postures of your character. Sketch the front, back and both sides of your character. It is important to note that should not skip drawing any of the side poses unless you a creating a mirrored effect with the character, where both the sides appear exactly same.</p>
<p>You can further, add some additional posture views from different angles. Trying out the anterior, posterior, top and lateral viewing angles can be of great help when designing complex characters with a comprehensive detailing. Experimenting with a diversity of postures and viewing angles aids to fetch an all-round character design that can be used to work with the same character in different motion graphic applications.</p>
<p>To craft your character’s design in even proportion across different formation views, you can attempt to work with a simple, 2-step process. Draw guidelines of a particular body part in a specific view, followed by using these guidelines to sketch out the same body part in a different view. You should significantly realize the fact that the difference in perspectives does not allow the perfect alignment of specific portions of a character design to its counterparts, when looked through different viewing angles.</p>
<p>As in the following figure, you can easily observe the misalignment of the character’s feet on account of being viewed from the front view. You can also notice the sketches to move a bit ahead of the guideline as the character approaches forward in the front view.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Complement Your Design With Perfect Shades</strong></p>
<p>In the specific case of manga character design, the formations mostly go well with a black and white color arrangement. You can however, add a tint of complementary shades when creating a character design for a cover page. When proceeding to open the color palette for your character design, there are a variety of aspects worth paying attention.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/10-amazing-anime-character-designs-to-inspire-you-17.JPG"
                      alt="Creating Your Own Anime Character- Selecting the Perfect Color Scheme"
                ></p>
<p>It is always a smart idea to choose complementary colors that are a perfect mix and match for each other. When picking complementary colors; look for the shades that lie across of each other on the color wheel. Such color arrangements are the preferences of almost any popular anime character you normally come across.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/10-amazing-anime-character-designs-to-inspire-you-18.JPG"
                      alt="Creating Your Own Anime Character- Color Palette Showing Complementary
        Shades"
                ></p>
<p>It is of course not necessary to pick your color scheme in perfect cohesion with the color wheel. You are free to select the desired variation of a specific color if the latter corresponds with the elements of your character design. Black and white is the safest choices, as they can go well with almost every color scheme and design specifications.</p>
<p>It would be wise enough to select your shades in line with the overall personality and appeal that your character is aimed at portraying. Colors are often linked with setting a specific mood for your creation. For instance, choosing a shade of blue would imbibe a sense of your character being cool, which picking a red tint on the other hand, adds an effect of warmth to the same.</p>
<p>Understating this with an example, you would generally refrain from adding shades of red in a character design that is centered on ice magic fantasy. Instead, picking a blue tint would work a lot better and complementary for this particular character design.</p>
