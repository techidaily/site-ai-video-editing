A lot of times, you’ll get a video file that was shot in low light, and it will make your subject look dark and underexposed. Video brightness is an important feature that is easy to adjust.

When you brighten a video, there is a chance that you might lose quality a little bit. So, to overcome that deficiency, this method might be helpful. Enhancing your videos with Premiere Pro is easy once you know the proper steps to do so. Just follow the steps described below:</p>
<h3 id="Step-1-11"><a href="#Step-1-11" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h3><p>In the effects panel, search for “unsharp Mask” and drag it to the video clip.</p>

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="enhance video in premiere pro"
                ></p>
<h3 id="Step-2-11"><a href="#Step-2-11" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h3><p>In the effect control panel under the Unsharp mask, set the amounts, radius, and threshold to enhance the video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/premiere-pro-brighten-video-9.png"
                      alt="enhance video in premiere pro"
                ></p>
<p>Keep in mind that you can increase the values of these parameters too high, but you will end up with a distorted video. Try increasing the values by small increments and see what happens. Avoid increasing the “amount” and radius value beyond 100% and ten, respectively.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>● Brightening in Premiere Pro is a simple process that can benefit some video projects. Whether you want to brighten the video by increasing exposure, increasing luminance, or adding a vignette effect altogether, there are several ways to do so in Premiere Pro.</p>
<p>● However, you should know that neither option is necessarily better than the other. Video editing in general does take a bit of practice to master, but in this article, we have provided you with the basics and helped you on your way. All methods can be helpful in different situations, and even with similar circumstances, you might find advantages to all practices.

<p>1. Recording options: An ideal screen recorder should have all the different options for recording your screen, webcam, system audio, and external audio from microphone. Besides, it should offer you the option to customize the recording area by selection. You should be able to record full screen, application window, and browser tab accurately.</p>
<p>2. Price: If you are serious about recording your screen video and uploading the recorded video on online platforms, you have to opt for a premium screen recorder. While purchasing a proprietary screen recorder, you need to compare the software price with its peers and ensure that you are getting more features for the price you are paying.</p>
<p>3. Customer support: You need to ensure that the screen recorder you are purchasing, they have a highly responsive customer support. This is a highly neglected factor but users suffer a lot when the customer support team is not responsive. Be sure that you will need to contact the customer support team at some time to learn more about certain features and troubleshoot in emergency situations.</p>
<p>4. Sharing options: When your ultimate goal is to share your recorded video online, you should check for the sharing options available in the screen recorder. There are screen recorders that allow sharing recorded and edited videos on online platforms, cloud storage platforms, and video streaming platforms. It should also offer you options to let you export videos in different file formats.</p>

<p>6. Customer Reviews: Last but most importantly, you should check the customer review of the screen recording software.

Practice before recording: Unless you are a pro, you should practice at least once before the actual recording. This will help you to execute your plan according to your script smoothly when you actually start recording. Besides, you can check if the frame, the camera, the mic, and everything else are working perfectly.</p>
<p>2. Only record the required screen: Screen recorders offer you the option to record the entire screen, any specific application window or any specific tab of your browser. In fact, you can even customize the screen recording area as per your requirements for better focus and better visual experience.</p>
<p>3. Keep it short: It is always necessary to keep the length of the video as short as possible without skipping the relevant points and important explanations. That is where a proper script before recording is crucial so that you can have a plan and execute it properly without stretching your explanation unnecessarily.</p>
<p>4. Speak slowly and clearly: The way you speak in the video can attract as well as repel audiences. If you speak too fast and if you have a weird accent, it is going to repel audiences. That is why it is important for you to speak slowly and clearly so that everyone can understand everything you speak and negate your accent to a greater extent.</p>
<p>5. Use screen drawing tools: If you are recording a video where you need to explain something, it is always better if you use screen drawing tools. In fact, it is important that you choose the screen recorder that offers drawing tools so that the video gets visually pleasing and impactful for audiences to understand effectively.</p>
<p>6. Cut out dead moments: When you are recording screen videos, there are going to be a lot of dead moments and boring pauses. You have to cut out those boring and dead moments while editing so that the video stays interesting and the audiences do not lose concentration. This will also help to tighten the length of the video.</p>
<p>7. End with a summary: Last but most importantly, you should offer a proper conclusion before ending the video. You need to summarize everything you have discussed in the video so that the audience can get a revision of all the important points. Besides, a proper ending rather than an abrupt ending can leave a positive impact regarding your video.</p>

<p>2. Price: If you are serious about recording your screen video and uploading the recorded video on online platforms, you have to opt for a premium screen recorder.

Practice before recording: Unless you are a pro, you should practice at least once before the actual recording. This will help you to execute your plan according to your script smoothly when you actually start recording. Besides, you can check if the frame, the camera, the mic, and everything else are working perfectly.</p>
<p>2. Only record the required screen: Screen recorders offer you the option to record the entire screen, any specific application window or any specific tab of your browser. In fact, you can even customize the screen recording area as per your requirements for better focus and better visual experience.</p>
<p>3. Keep it short: It is always necessary to keep the length of the video as short as possible without skipping the relevant points and important explanations. That is where a proper script before recording is crucial so that you can have a plan and execute it properly without stretching your explanation unnecessarily.</p>
<p>4. Speak slowly and clearly: The way you speak in the video can attract as well as repel audiences. If you speak too fast and if you have a weird accent, it is going to repel audiences. That is why it is important for you to speak slowly and clearly so that everyone can understand everything you speak and negate your accent to a greater extent.</p>
<p>5. Use screen drawing tools: If you are recording a video where you need to explain something, it is always better if you use screen drawing tools. In fact, it is important that you choose the screen recorder that offers drawing tools so that the video gets visually pleasing and impactful for audiences to understand effectively.</p>
<p>6. Cut out dead moments: When you are recording screen videos, there are going to be a lot of dead moments and boring pauses. You have to cut out those boring and dead moments while editing so that the video stays interesting and the audiences do not lose concentration. This will also help to tighten the length of the video.</p>
<p>7. End with a summary: Last but most importantly, you should offer a proper conclusion before ending the video. You need to summarize everything you have discussed in the video so that the audience can get a revision of all the important points. Besides, a proper ending rather than an abrupt ending can leave a positive impact regarding your video.</p>

<p>1. Recording options: An ideal screen recorder should have all the different options for recording your screen, webcam, system audio, and external audio from microphone. Besides, it should offer you the option to customize the recording area by selection. You should be able to record full screen, application window, and browser tab accurately.</p>
<p>2. Price: If you are serious about recording your screen video and uploading the recorded video on online platforms, you have to opt for a premium screen recorder. While purchasing a proprietary screen recorder, you need to compare the software price with its peers and ensure that you are getting more features for the price you are paying.</p>
<p>3. Customer support: You need to ensure that the screen recorder you are purchasing, they have a highly responsive customer support. This is a highly neglected factor but users suffer a lot when the customer support team is not responsive. Be sure that you will need to contact the customer support team at some time to learn more about certain features and troubleshoot in emergency situations.</p>
<p>4. Sharing options: When your ultimate goal is to share your recorded video online, you should check for the sharing options available in the screen recorder.

Practice before recording: Unless you are a pro, you should practice at least once before the actual recording. This will help you to execute your plan according to your script smoothly when you actually start recording. Besides, you can check if the frame, the camera, the mic, and everything else are working perfectly.</p>
<p>2. Only record the required screen: Screen recorders offer you the option to record the entire screen, any specific application window or any specific tab of your browser. In fact, you can even customize the screen recording area as per your requirements for better focus and better visual experience.</p>
<p>3. Keep it short: It is always necessary to keep the length of the video as short as possible without skipping the relevant points and important explanations. That is where a proper script before recording is crucial so that you can have a plan and execute it properly without stretching your explanation unnecessarily.</p>
<p>4. Speak slowly and clearly: The way you speak in the video can attract as well as repel audiences. If you speak too fast and if you have a weird accent, it is going to repel audiences. That is why it is important for you to speak slowly and clearly so that everyone can understand everything you speak and negate your accent to a greater extent.</p>
<p>5. Use screen drawing tools: If you are recording a video where you need to explain something, it is always better if you use screen drawing tools. In fact, it is important that you choose the screen recorder that offers drawing tools so that the video gets visually pleasing and impactful for audiences to understand effectively.</p>
<p>6. Cut out dead moments: When you are recording screen videos, there are going to be a lot of dead moments and boring pauses. You have to cut out those boring and dead moments while editing so that the video stays interesting and the audiences do not lose concentration. This will also help to tighten the length of the video.</p>
<p>7. End with a summary: Last but most importantly, you should offer a proper conclusion before ending the video. You need to summarize everything you have discussed in the video so that the audience can get a revision of all the important points. Besides, a proper ending rather than an abrupt ending can leave a positive impact regarding your video.</p>

But you don’t have to worry about it anymore let’s begin:</p>
<p><strong>What are you planning to use it for?</strong>: You must know the use of video editing software before picking one. Whether you are using it for gaming or creating ordinary YouTube videos. These decisions are very important to take before opting for downloading it from the internet.</p>
<p><strong>Learning curve</strong>: You should keep in mind which editing software is complex to learn and which one is easy in comparison with that. If you didn’t keep this in mind you might end up wasting your time by downloading and trying in vain.</p>
<p><strong>Quality</strong>: Another important factor to consider in video editing software is the quality and format of the video. There are many formats and quality of video content, therefore it is important to choose the one which supports your video format.</p>
<p><strong>Resources</strong>: Depending upon the requirements of the editing on your video, you should choose a video editor that should have all the video effects, music tracks, and other resources that you might need to apply to your video. Be careful not to select one with few resources.</p>
<p><strong>Compatability</strong>: The most important point is whether your PC, Mac, or Android platform can run the video editor you have heard the name from your friend. Consult the internet for compatibility of the software by checking its minimum specification requirement on its manual or docs.</p>

<p>1. Recording options: An ideal screen recorder should have all the different options for recording your screen, webcam, system audio, and external audio from microphone. Besides, it should offer you the option to customize the recording area by selection. You should be able to record full screen, application window, and browser tab accurately.</p>
<p>2. Price: If you are serious about recording your screen video and uploading the recorded video on online platforms, you have to opt for a premium screen recorder. While purchasing a proprietary screen recorder, you need to compare the software price with its peers and ensure that you are getting more features for the price you are paying.</p>
<p>3. Customer support: You need to ensure that the screen recorder you are purchasing, they have a highly responsive customer support. This is a highly neglected factor but users suffer a lot when the customer support team is not responsive. Be sure that you will need to contact the customer support team at some time to learn more about certain features and troubleshoot in emergency situations.</p>
<p>4. Sharing options: When your ultimate goal is to share your recorded video online, you should check for the sharing options available in the screen recorder. There are screen recorders that allow sharing recorded and edited videos on online platforms, cloud storage platforms, and video streaming platforms. It should also offer you options to let you export videos in different file formats.</p>
<p>5. Video editing tools: You have to edit your recorded video to trim out unnecessary parts and add effects and filters to enhance your video content and video quality. Besides, you may need options to add music and voiceover as well as intro and outro. That is why you should opt for a screen recorder where a great video editor is available.</p>
<p>6. Customer Reviews: Last but most importantly, you should check the customer review of the screen recording software. Even when a screen recorder has loads of features, if the customer reviews are not good enough, you should not choose you. Besides, the customer reviews reveal the pros and cons of a screen recorder for your better understanding.</p>
<h2 id="Part-8-Screen-Recording-Tips-and-Tricks-3"><a href="#Part-8-Screen-Recording-Tips-and-Tricks-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 8: Screen Recording Tips and Tricks"></a>Part 8: Screen Recording Tips and Tricks</h2><p>1. Practice before recording: Unless you are a pro, you should practice at least once before the actual recording. This will help you to execute your plan according to your script smoothly when you actually start recording. Besides, you can check if the frame, the camera, the mic, and everything else are working perfectly.</p>
<p>2. Only record the required screen: Screen recorders offer you the option to record the entire screen, any specific application window or any specific tab of your browser. In fact, you can even customize the screen recording area as per your requirements for better focus and better visual experience.</p>
<p>3. Keep it short: It is always necessary to keep the length of the video as short as possible without skipping the relevant points and important explanations. That is where a proper script before recording is crucial so that you can have a plan and execute it properly without stretching your explanation unnecessarily.</p>
<p>4. Speak slowly and clearly: The way you speak in the video can attract as well as repel audiences. If you speak too fast and if you have a weird accent, it is going to repel audiences. That is why it is important for you to speak slowly and clearly so that everyone can understand everything you speak and negate your accent to a greater extent.</p>
<p>5. Use screen drawing tools: If you are recording a video where you need to explain something, it is always better if you use screen drawing tools. In fact, it is important that you choose the screen recorder that offers drawing tools so that the video gets visually pleasing and impactful for audiences to understand effectively.</p>
<p>6. Cut out dead moments: When you are recording screen videos, there are going to be a lot of dead moments and boring pauses. You have to cut out those boring and dead moments while editing so that the video stays interesting and the audiences do not lose concentration. This will also help to tighten the length of the video.</p>
<p>7. End with a summary: Last but most importantly, you should offer a proper conclusion before ending the video. You need to summarize everything you have discussed in the video so that the audience can get a revision of all the important points. Besides, a proper ending rather than an abrupt ending can leave a positive impact regarding your video.</p>
<h2 id="Part-9-Frequently-Asked-Questions-3"><a href="#Part-9-Frequently-Asked-Questions-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 9: Frequently Asked Questions"></a>Part 9: Frequently Asked Questions</h2><p><strong>How do I record Windows 10 screen?</strong></p>
<p>You can use Windows Game Bar that comes pre-installed on Windows 10. However, for a better screen recording experience, we recommend Wondershare Filmora where you can edit the recording as well.</p>
<p><strong>Can I screen record on my Mac?</strong></p>
<p>You can use QuickTime that comes pre-installed on Mac. However, for professional screen recording experience, you can use Filmora or Camtasia where you will get more recording options and tools for editing after recording.</p>

<p><strong>Which quality is best for screen recording?</strong></p>
<p>The best quality for screen recording should be the same resolution as the screen. This means if you have a 4K monitor, the screen recording will be best at 4K resolution. In today’s scenario, 1080p or full HD is the optimal quality for screen recording.</p>
<p><strong>What do most YouTubers use to record their screen?</strong></p>
<p>Most YouTubers use Filmora or OBS Studio to record their screen. OBS Studio is mostly used by those who livestream their screen or gameplay. Filmora is mostly used by those who emphasize heavily on editing their recorded screen video for better output.</p>
<p><strong>Does screen record ruin quality?</strong></p>
<p>Your screen record quality can get ruined only when you use a screen recorder that records at a lower resolution due to its inability as well as to reduce file size. When you record your screen with a proprietary screen recorder, it can record the screen at exactly the same resolution as that of your screen. Hence, the video quality and resolution will stay intact.</p>
<p><strong>What do gamers record their screens?</strong></p>

Here I’m Going to Share some of the Tips to Make a Better Event Videography"></a>Event Videography Is Popular in Weddings, Graduation, Family Reunion and Other Great Moments. Here I’m Going to Share some of the Tips to Make a Better Event Videography</h2><p>There is no doubt that if you have an upcoming corporate event, you will want to record it using professional</p>
<p>corporate event video production. This is something that can’t be stressed enough. Providing video footage of events is an excellent method to raise people’s awareness of your brand, as well as interest in and enthusiasm for the work that your firm does.</p>
<p>Let’s start!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h2 id="1-A-quality-corporate-event-video-represents-your-business"><a href="#1-A-quality-corporate-event-video-represents-your-business" class="headerlink" title="1. A quality corporate event video represents your business"></a>1. A quality corporate event video represents your business</h2><p>People who are watching your corporate event video aren’t just learning about who your company is and what your company does. They’re also learning about your commitment to quality. If your event video looks like it was shot off the cuff by an employee on someone’s phone, people may assume you take that kind of approach to your business and service to your customers.</p>
<p>You don’t, but it’s an easy assumption to make. A professionally shot, high-quality video signals to viewers that your company appreciates quality and seeks it out in everything they do. It also shows your attention to detail and what they can expect when they choose your business to handle their own occasions or services.</p>
<h2 id="2-A-professional-videographer-is-capable-of-editing"><a href="#2-A-professional-videographer-is-capable-of-editing" class="headerlink" title="2. A professional videographer is capable of editing"></a>2. A professional videographer is capable of editing</h2><p>Videoing your corporate event is about more than just filming, it’s knowing how to cut the event together, how to mix the shots and the sound, and add music and any subtle effects or graphics that will make the video really shine. There is a lot that goes into post-production that an amateur simply cannot replicate.</p>
<p>Editing your video without the benefit of a dedicated studio with years of experience just won’t have the same</p>
<p>effect when it comes to amplifying the energy and mission of your event. It also will not show the level of detail that your video could contain if a professional corporate event video production company did it.</p>
<h2 id="3-A-professional-video-is-completed-on-schedule"><a href="#3-A-professional-video-is-completed-on-schedule" class="headerlink" title="3. A professional video is completed on schedule"></a>3. A professional video is completed on schedule</h2><p>It can take longer than you anticipate if you opt to handle your corporate or conference videos yourself or</p>
<p>delegate the task to one of your workers. Without a lot of post-production knowledge, it could take a lot of trial and error to put your material together in a way that produces the desired outcome.</p>
<p>If you’re trying to summarize an event and demonstrate to stakeholders or customers how effective it was, you might not have time for that. Even though unforeseen issues might always arise, if you and a competent</p>
<p>videographer agree on a finish date, they will be able to deliver. This is crucial if you want to utilize your video</p>
<p>to promote a recent event or for marketing purposes.</p>
<h2 id="4-A-skilled-videographer-avoids-interference"><a href="#4-A-skilled-videographer-avoids-interference" class="headerlink" title="4. A skilled videographer avoids interference"></a>4. A skilled videographer avoids interference</h2><p>A skilled videographer is trained to film an event without getting in the way, so things can keep going as usual.</p>
<p>If you’re not used to doing professional videography, you might not realize you’re bothering your guests and</p>
<p>messing up the event while you’re trying to film it. This can turn people off and hurt your finished product, as</p>
<p>well as the success of your event. If your occasion is streamed online, you don’t want the videographer to get in the way or become visible in the frame your live show.</p>
<h2 id="5-A-video-that-is-done-well-tells-a-story"><a href="#5-A-video-that-is-done-well-tells-a-story" class="headerlink" title="5. A video that is done well tells a story"></a>5. A video that is done well tells a story</h2><p>Companies with experience creating videos do more than just capture actions digitally, they also find the story</p>
<p>in the event they are recording and use their videography skills to tell that story. This storyline is defined in</p>
<p>what they choose to shoot, when they shoot it and how they edit it all together. It’s that storyline that is going</p>
<p>to capture the attention from the audience and give your video the desired impact.</p>
<p>It’s also going to stir up emotions and passion in your audience, creating momentum in your company and with your customers that will last until your next event. Remember that any video you share with your customers or employees is a video marketing exercise that helps you build brand awareness. Let your corporate event video reflect positively on your business.</p>
<h2 id="6-A-videographer-has-a-shot-list"><a href="#6-A-videographer-has-a-shot-list" class="headerlink" title="6. A videographer has a shot list"></a>6. A videographer has a shot list</h2><p>It is not enough to simply create a list; you must also put it to good use. The idea that you should plan your shot and then execute your plan is a fundamental element of production. Create a strategy and put it into action since your videographer will be knowing his job to adhere to this concept regardless of whether or not they are aware of it.</p>
<p>Also, get things you may or may not need for editing. It is usually excellent practice to use some B roll audio</p>
<p>and video, in addition to establishing shots, no matter what kind of event you are filming, be it a wedding or a business function. If you anticipate that it will be overly crowded during the event, take your creative shoton a pleasant day that occurs before the main event.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-4"><a href="#Conclusion-4" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>We sincerely hope that some of these pointers will be of assistance to you as you navigate the area of special</p>
<p>events videos. Whether you are able to employ all of them or not will depend on your client, the event, and</p>
<p>your own workflow; nonetheless, the takeaway from this anecdote is that you should be prepared for the</p>
<p>worst-case scenario and find that you are better equipped to offer the best possible results. There won’t be</p>
<p>many situations that you won’t be able to manage with grace and professionally if you have the ability to</p>
<p>remain calm, cool, and professional.</p>
