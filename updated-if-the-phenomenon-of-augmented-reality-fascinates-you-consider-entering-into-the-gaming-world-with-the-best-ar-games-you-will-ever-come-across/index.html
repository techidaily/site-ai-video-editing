While the common beliefs with respect these graphic uplifts are restricted within personal boundaries of fun and entertainment, the professional credibility of emojis is no less.</p>
<p>When the talk is about marketing and business strategies, the significance of these elements cannot be limited within the constraints of domain and time. Entering into the application varieties, you can work with emojis everywhere, from promotional advertisements to promote your brand, to devising strategic video presentations and slideshows to showcase your company utilities in front of a target audience.</p>
<p>Beginning our discussion towards the same, let us look through the different aspects and benefits of including emojis as a compliment to business marketing strategies in the following section:</p>
<p><strong>Merits of Using Emojis as a Marketing Tactic</strong></p>
<h3 id="01Social-Media-Utility"><a href="#01Social-Media-Utility" class="headerlink" title="01Social Media Utility"></a>01Social Media Utility</h3><p>Considering the fact that social media is turning into a content sharing hub, irrespective of information genres, the business marketing arena is obviously not left untouched. With the revolutionary expansion in the concept and credibility of digital marketing, social media platforms have become a significant space for product advertisement and brand promotion.</p>
<p>Speaking in the light of the above, the fact that emojis have long been a part of social media conversations is something that cannot be ignored. Using a combination of emojis and social media can thus, work to deliver a more effective presentation of your brands, products and company services, while keeping the audience captivated by making them connect with the feel of the utility they are viewing at.</p>
<h3 id="02Making-the-Brand-Come-Alive"><a href="#02Making-the-Brand-Come-Alive" class="headerlink" title="02Making the Brand Come Alive"></a>02Making the Brand Come Alive</h3><p>It is a known fact that a trusted brand name works to earn a hoard of loyal customers in the long run. Adding an emoji in your brand promotion strategies helps to establish a great deal of emotional connection of the same with your target audience, while making them relate to the regular inclusion of these graphic elements in their social media conversations.</p>
<p>Working towards adding emojis in your product or company presentations or ad campaigns caters to convey the product information in a unique style of its own by adding an extra bit of liveliness to your brand.</p>
<p>You should however, be cautious while using emojis to promote your brand, lest these may end up crowding the presentation snippet. It is a wise decision to use a single or couple of emojis at the end of a text based content, rather than stuffing the same with a series of emojis to avoid the distraction of audience.</p>
<p>Another way of making an impressive use of emojis in your promotional media posts is creating engaging feature lists of your brand, or adding the same to the product headlines, while giving them an extra impact. Such graphic creativity will surely put your brand ahead of the numerous counterparts on promotional business sites.</p>
<h3 id="03Enhanced-Viewer-Engagement"><a href="#03Enhanced-Viewer-Engagement" class="headerlink" title="03Enhanced Viewer Engagement"></a>03Enhanced Viewer Engagement</h3><p>It is a common practice to include emojis within personal chats and social media conversations to ensure an improved peer engagement, while uplifting the degree of fun and entertainment. The same concept can be applied to brand promotion strategies for bringing in an increased number of interested audiences.</p>
<p>Supplementing your promotional content with emojis helps the latter to gain a casual and informal presentation approach that suits the audience in a much better way. Speaking in the light of the current social media and digital market trends, emojis have managed to achieve a universal credibility that is far ahead of video and image centered promotional elements.</p>
<p>As a product or business marketer, you can work with these conveying graphic utilities to initiate thematic conversations with your viewers and potential customers. Care should however be taken to make an intelligent and smart usage of emojis, to ensure that the latter works to uplift and compliment your promotional strategies, lest you would end up distracting your audiences.</p>
<h3 id="04Supplementing-the-Content-With-a-Cohesive-Context"><a href="#04Supplementing-the-Content-With-a-Cohesive-Context" class="headerlink" title="04Supplementing the Content With a Cohesive Context"></a>04Supplementing the Content With a Cohesive Context</h3><p>When aiming at creating a brand awareness of your product or company via promotional messaging, emojis can help to convey an emotional exactness that a text based content often falls short of adhering to.</p>
<p>While using emojis alone can make the task a bit difficult, an intelligent combination of the latter with cohesive text elements can effectively cater towards delivering a top rated promotional output, while adding an extra bit of meaning and depth to the same.</p>
<p>When promoting your product across social media platforms that have a restriction on the maximum number of characters within a single post or message, using emojis can compensate for the text you would otherwise prefer to add. The additional benefit of this inclusion lies in supplementing your text with the missing emotional connect and feel that works to build an emphasis of your brand among the viewers.</p>

Whether used in casual conversations and personal chats on social media platforms for fun and entertainment, or included in promotional strategies to create brand awareness across the digital market, emojis cater to one and all concerns with the same effectiveness and credibility.</p>
<p>Working with emojis is one aspect, but the latter’s interface compatibility is also of considerable importance. When proceeding to use the elements, you should take care to check the accessibility of these elements with the system you are working on.

<h5 id="Step2-Mask-the-white-sample"><a href="#Step2-Mask-the-white-sample" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Mask the white sample"></a>Step2 Mask the white sample</h5><p>Since we want to create a thin horizontal shape, you need to make some adjustments to the white sample by using an image mask. So, go to the <strong>Effect window &gt; Utility &gt; Image Mask</strong>. Then, drag and drop the “Image Mask” onto the white color sample.</p>

                ></p>
<p>After that, double-click the white sample on the timeline and find the Image Mask setting. Choose the shape that works best for your needs. For this tutorial, we are going to use this one. Then, adjust the X and Y-axis scale numbers until it becomes a thin white line. Click OK.</p>

<p>Double-click on the text clip to open the settings, then type some text there and adjust the size and font.</p>

<h5 id="Step4-Add-animation-to-the-text"><a href="#Step4-Add-animation-to-the-text" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Add animation to the text"></a>Step4 Add animation to the text</h5><p>Click <strong>Advanced &gt; Animation &gt; Up Down 1</strong> animation. Adjust the animation length by dragging the two brackets on the timeline on the right side. Click Ok.</p>

Then, playback the animation of the text, find a position before the text animation starts and move the play head there. Make sure it is close enough to when the texts show up so the white line enters the keyframe right before the text enters.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add keyframes to the white line clip when entering"
                ></p>
<p>Click to add a keyframe, double-check to make sure it is the final position you want, and the opacity should be 100 at this point.</p>
<p>After that, move the play head to the left for a few frames and click add again. To make sure the white line is out of the frame before entering, you need to change the Y-axis number. Change the opacity to 0 as the white line starts in transparent color.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-10.gif"
                      alt="move the play head to the left"
                ></p>
<p>These two keyframes will create an effect of the line entering the frame while turning from transparent to white. Playback the animation and adjust the keyframes marks by dragging them to the left or right until you feel the timing looks good.</p>
<h5 id="Step6-Add-keyframes-to-the-white-line-clip-when-exiting"><a href="#Step6-Add-keyframes-to-the-white-line-clip-when-exiting" class="headerlink" title="Step6 Add keyframes to the white line clip when exiting"></a>Step6 Add keyframes to the white line clip when exiting</h5><p>Playback again to find where the texts disappear, then move the play head to a position after it. Also, make sure it’s close enough to where the texts disappear so you can ensure the white line exits right after the texts disappear. Then, add the keyframe.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add keyframes to the white line clip when exiting"
                ></p>
<p>You don’t need to change the setting this time because this keyframe is used to keep the position and opacity unchanged.</p>
<p>Instead, move the play head again to the right for a few frames and add another keyframe. Move the texts out of the frame by changing the y-axis number, then change the opacity to 0. This keyframe is used to create the white line animation exiting the frame and turning back to transparent in the meantime.</p>

<p>Playback the video and see how it looks.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Sometimes you might want to create a name card with a solid background like the sample above. To create it, we can use the same method. Here’s how to do it:</p>
<h5 id="Step1-Make-the-lower-third-background"><a href="#Step1-Make-the-lower-third-background" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Make the lower third background"></a>Step1 Make the lower third background</h5><p>Select the white color sample from the sample color folder and drop it onto the upper video track of the video.</p>

                      alt="make the lower third background"
                ></p>
<p>Change the scale to 30%, then reposition the white sample to your desired place. Click OK.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="change the scale to 30%"
                ></p>

                      alt="create an image mask"
                ></p>
<p>Double-click on the white sample clip to activate the video setting window and find the Image Mask settings. Then, choose the mask shape you need. You can also adjust its size by changing the X or Y-axis.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h5 id="Step3-Add-some-text"><a href="#Step3-Add-some-text" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Add some text"></a>Step3 Add some text</h5><p>Once the background card is in place, go to Titles &gt; Plain Text &gt; ‘Basic 6’ and drop it onto the third video track.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="go to titles"
                ></p>
<p>Now, type in the texts as needed. Reposition and scale the texts to make sure they are on top of the background shape.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step4-Add-animation-to-the-text-1"><a href="#Step4-Add-animation-to-the-text-1" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Add animation to the text"></a>Step4 Add animation to the text</h5><p>Click Advanced &gt; Animation &gt; Push. Then, adjust the animation length accordingly. Click Ok.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-20.jpg"
                      alt="click advanced"
                ></p>
<p>Double-click on the background clip to show the animation tab setting. Then, playback the text animation and find a position earlier than the start and add a keyframe.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="double-click on the background clip"
                ></p>
<p>Similar to the tutorial before, move the play head again a few frames earlier to the left and add another keyframe. If you want to have the name card flying in from the left while expanding, you can change the X-axis and scale of the background card to 0. Change the opacity to 0 to create a color change from transparent to white.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="move the play head again"
                ></p>
<p>To let the background card exit the frame, add two more keyframes to the background card. Add a keyframe with no changes to settings. Move the play head to the right for a few frames and add another keyframe.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-23.gif"
                      alt="add two more keyframes"
                ></p>
<p>If you want the name card to exit to the bottom, change the Y-axis number until it exits. Change the scale and opacity to 0. Then, playback and adjust the keyframes.</p>
<p>Finally, you can add a Subscribe button from the new default Filmora element pack “Social Media.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add a subscribe button"
                ></p>
<h2 id="Wrapping-up"><a href="#Wrapping-up" class="headerlink" title="Wrapping up"></a>Wrapping up</h2><p>These are two ways you can create your own Lower Thirds in FIlmora. You can also change the keyframe settings to customize your lower thirds even more. Now, it’s time to try it yourself, and let us know what you think!</p>

<p>After that, double-click the white sample on the timeline and find the Image Mask setting. Choose the shape that works best for your needs. For this tutorial, we are going to use this one. Then, adjust the X and Y-axis scale numbers until it becomes a thin white line. Click OK.</p>

<p>Double-click on the text clip to open the settings, then type some text there and adjust the size and font.</p>

<h5 id="Step4-Add-animation-to-the-text-2"><a href="#Step4-Add-animation-to-the-text-2" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Add animation to the text"></a>Step4 Add animation to the text</h5><p>Click <strong>Advanced &gt; Animation &gt; Up Down 1</strong> animation. Adjust the animation length by dragging the two brackets on the timeline on the right side. Click Ok.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

Then, playback the animation of the text, find a position before the text animation starts and move the play head there. Make sure it is close enough to when the texts show up so the white line enters the keyframe right before the text enters.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add keyframes to the white line clip when entering"
                ></p>
<p>Click to add a keyframe, double-check to make sure it is the final position you want, and the opacity should be 100 at this point.</p>
<p>After that, move the play head to the left for a few frames and click add again. To make sure the white line is out of the frame before entering, you need to change the Y-axis number. Change the opacity to 0 as the white line starts in transparent color.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="move the play head to the left"
                ></p>
<p>These two keyframes will create an effect of the line entering the frame while turning from transparent to white. Playback the animation and adjust the keyframes marks by dragging them to the left or right until you feel the timing looks good.</p>
<h5 id="Step6-Add-keyframes-to-the-white-line-clip-when-exiting-1"><a href="#Step6-Add-keyframes-to-the-white-line-clip-when-exiting-1" class="headerlink" title="Step6 Add keyframes to the white line clip when exiting"></a>Step6 Add keyframes to the white line clip when exiting</h5><p>Playback again to find where the texts disappear, then move the play head to a position after it. Also, make sure it’s close enough to where the texts disappear so you can ensure the white line exits right after the texts disappear. Then, add the keyframe.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add keyframes to the white line clip when exiting"
                ></p>
<p>You don’t need to change the setting this time because this keyframe is used to keep the position and opacity unchanged.</p>
<p>Instead, move the play head again to the right for a few frames and add another keyframe. Move the texts out of the frame by changing the y-axis number, then change the opacity to 0. This keyframe is used to create the white line animation exiting the frame and turning back to transparent in the meantime.</p>

<p>Playback the video and see how it looks.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Sometimes you might want to create a name card with a solid background like the sample above. To create it, we can use the same method. Here’s how to do it:</p>
<h5 id="Step1-Make-the-lower-third-background-1"><a href="#Step1-Make-the-lower-third-background-1" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Make the lower third background"></a>Step1 Make the lower third background</h5><p>Select the white color sample from the sample color folder and drop it onto the upper video track of the video.</p>

                      alt="make the lower third background"
                ></p>
<p>Change the scale to 30%, then reposition the white sample to your desired place. Click OK.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="change the scale to 30%"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step2-Create-an-image-mask-for-the-lower-third-background-1"><a href="#Step2-Create-an-image-mask-for-the-lower-third-background-1" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Create an image mask for the lower third background"></a>Step2 Create an image mask for the lower third background</h5><p>Drag and drop the Image Mask onto the white sample clip on the timeline.</p>

                      alt="create an image mask"
                ></p>
<p>Double-click on the white sample clip to activate the video setting window and find the Image Mask settings. Then, choose the mask shape you need. You can also adjust its size by changing the X or Y-axis.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h5 id="Step3-Add-some-text-1"><a href="#Step3-Add-some-text-1" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Add some text"></a>Step3 Add some text</h5><p>Once the background card is in place, go to Titles &gt; Plain Text &gt; ‘Basic 6’ and drop it onto the third video track.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="go to titles"
                ></p>
<p>Now, type in the texts as needed. Reposition and scale the texts to make sure they are on top of the background shape.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h5 id="Step4-Add-animation-to-the-text-3"><a href="#Step4-Add-animation-to-the-text-3" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Add animation to the text"></a>Step4 Add animation to the text</h5><p>Click Advanced &gt; Animation &gt; Push. Then, adjust the animation length accordingly. Click Ok.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-20.jpg"
                      alt="click advanced"
                ></p>
<p>Double-click on the background clip to show the animation tab setting. Then, playback the text animation and find a position earlier than the start and add a keyframe.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="double-click on the background clip"
                ></p>
<p>Similar to the tutorial before, move the play head again a few frames earlier to the left and add another keyframe. If you want to have the name card flying in from the left while expanding, you can change the X-axis and scale of the background card to 0. Change the opacity to 0 to create a color change from transparent to white.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="move the play head again"
                ></p>
<p>To let the background card exit the frame, add two more keyframes to the background card. Add a keyframe with no changes to settings. Move the play head to the right for a few frames and add another keyframe.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-23.gif"
                      alt="add two more keyframes"
                ></p>
<p>If you want the name card to exit to the bottom, change the Y-axis number until it exits. Change the scale and opacity to 0. Then, playback and adjust the keyframes.</p>
<p>Finally, you can add a Subscribe button from the new default Filmora element pack “Social Media.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-24.jpg"
                      alt="add a subscribe button"
                ></p>
<h2 id="Wrapping-up-1"><a href="#Wrapping-up-1" class="headerlink" title="Wrapping up"></a>Wrapping up</h2><p>These are two ways you can create your own Lower Thirds in FIlmora. You can also change the keyframe settings to customize your lower thirds even more. Now, it’s time to try it yourself, and let us know what you think!</p>
