For this tutorial, we will select the white color. Then, drag and drop this sample color onto the upper video track.</p>
<p><img

<p>Double-click the white sample clip to open the settings and scale it to 30%. Then, reposition the white bar to your desired place.</p>

<h5 id="Step2-Mask-the-white-sample"><a href="#Step2-Mask-the-white-sample" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Mask the white sample"></a>Step2 Mask the white sample</h5><p>Since we want to create a thin horizontal shape, you need to make some adjustments to the white sample by using an image mask. So, go to the <strong>Effect window &gt; Utility &gt; Image Mask</strong>. Then, drag and drop the “Image Mask” onto the white color sample.</p>

                ></p>
<p>After that, double-click the white sample on the timeline and find the Image Mask setting. Choose the shape that works best for your needs. For this tutorial, we are going to use this one. Then, adjust the X and Y-axis scale numbers until it becomes a thin white line. Click OK.</p>

Don’t worry about the exact position yet. We can adjust it later.</p>

<p>Double-click on the text clip to open the settings, then type some text there and adjust the size and font.</p>

Then, playback the animation of the text, find a position before the text animation starts and move the play head there. Make sure it is close enough to when the texts show up so the white line enters the keyframe right before the text enters.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add keyframes to the white line clip when entering"
                ></p>
<p>Click to add a keyframe, double-check to make sure it is the final position you want, and the opacity should be 100 at this point.</p>
<p>After that, move the play head to the left for a few frames and click add again. To make sure the white line is out of the frame before entering, you need to change the Y-axis number. Change the opacity to 0 as the white line starts in transparent color.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-10.gif"
                      alt="move the play head to the left"
                ></p>
<p>These two keyframes will create an effect of the line entering the frame while turning from transparent to white. Playback the animation and adjust the keyframes marks by dragging them to the left or right until you feel the timing looks good.</p>
<h5 id="Step6-Add-keyframes-to-the-white-line-clip-when-exiting"><a href="#Step6-Add-keyframes-to-the-white-line-clip-when-exiting" class="headerlink" title="Step6 Add keyframes to the white line clip when exiting"></a>Step6 Add keyframes to the white line clip when exiting</h5><p>Playback again to find where the texts disappear, then move the play head to a position after it. Also, make sure it’s close enough to where the texts disappear so you can ensure the white line exits right after the texts disappear. Then, add the keyframe.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add keyframes to the white line clip when exiting"
                ></p>
<p>You don’t need to change the setting this time because this keyframe is used to keep the position and opacity unchanged.</p>
<p>Instead, move the play head again to the right for a few frames and add another keyframe. Move the texts out of the frame by changing the y-axis number, then change the opacity to 0. This keyframe is used to create the white line animation exiting the frame and turning back to transparent in the meantime.</p>

<p>Sometimes you might want to create a name card with a solid background like the sample above. To create it, we can use the same method. Here’s how to do it:</p>
<h5 id="Step1-Make-the-lower-third-background"><a href="#Step1-Make-the-lower-third-background" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Make the lower third background"></a>Step1 Make the lower third background</h5><p>Select the white color sample from the sample color folder and drop it onto the upper video track of the video.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Change the scale to 30%, then reposition the white sample to your desired place. Click OK.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Double-click on the white sample clip to activate the video setting window and find the Image Mask settings. Then, choose the mask shape you need. You can also adjust its size by changing the X or Y-axis.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Similar to the tutorial before, move the play head again a few frames earlier to the left and add another keyframe. If you want to have the name card flying in from the left while expanding, you can change the X-axis and scale of the background card to 0. Change the opacity to 0 to create a color change from transparent to white.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="move the play head again"
                ></p>
<p>To let the background card exit the frame, add two more keyframes to the background card. Add a keyframe with no changes to settings. Move the play head to the right for a few frames and add another keyframe.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add two more keyframes"
                ></p>
<p>If you want the name card to exit to the bottom, change the Y-axis number until it exits. Change the scale and opacity to 0. Then, playback and adjust the keyframes.</p>
<p>Finally, you can add a Subscribe button from the new default Filmora element pack “Social Media.”</p>

<h5 id="Step2-Mask-the-white-sample-1"><a href="#Step2-Mask-the-white-sample-1" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Mask the white sample"></a>Step2 Mask the white sample</h5><p>Since we want to create a thin horizontal shape, you need to make some adjustments to the white sample by using an image mask. So, go to the <strong>Effect window &gt; Utility &gt; Image Mask</strong>. Then, drag and drop the “Image Mask” onto the white color sample.</p>

                ></p>
<p>After that, double-click the white sample on the timeline and find the Image Mask setting. Choose the shape that works best for your needs. For this tutorial, we are going to use this one. Then, adjust the X and Y-axis scale numbers until it becomes a thin white line. Click OK.</p>

Then, playback the animation of the text, find a position before the text animation starts and move the play head there. Make sure it is close enough to when the texts show up so the white line enters the keyframe right before the text enters.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>Click to add a keyframe, double-check to make sure it is the final position you want, and the opacity should be 100 at this point.</p>
<p>After that, move the play head to the left for a few frames and click add again. To make sure the white line is out of the frame before entering, you need to change the Y-axis number. Change the opacity to 0 as the white line starts in transparent color.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="move the play head to the left"
                ></p>
<p>These two keyframes will create an effect of the line entering the frame while turning from transparent to white. Playback the animation and adjust the keyframes marks by dragging them to the left or right until you feel the timing looks good.</p>
<h5 id="Step6-Add-keyframes-to-the-white-line-clip-when-exiting-1"><a href="#Step6-Add-keyframes-to-the-white-line-clip-when-exiting-1" class="headerlink" title="Step6 Add keyframes to the white line clip when exiting"></a>Step6 Add keyframes to the white line clip when exiting</h5><p>Playback again to find where the texts disappear, then move the play head to a position after it. Also, make sure it’s close enough to where the texts disappear so you can ensure the white line exits right after the texts disappear. Then, add the keyframe.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>You don’t need to change the setting this time because this keyframe is used to keep the position and opacity unchanged.</p>
<p>Instead, move the play head again to the right for a few frames and add another keyframe. Move the texts out of the frame by changing the y-axis number, then change the opacity to 0. This keyframe is used to create the white line animation exiting the frame and turning back to transparent in the meantime.</p>
