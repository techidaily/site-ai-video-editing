<p><strong>Which Should I choose Free or Paid FLV Editor</strong> <strong>:</strong></p>
<p> Are you confused to choose the FLV editor for you? Then look for the one that suits your other needs. Like if you want an editor only to crop or trim videos then save your money and go for a free video editor. But if you want some extra features to enhance your workflow or have some cash then go for paid software.

<p>~ Some FAQs about FLV Videos:</p>
<p><strong>why is .flv format used?</strong></p>
<p>FLV is basically used to publish or distribute videos on the Internet. Many social platforms and web pages (such as youtube, Hulu, e.t.c.) use .flv files as it provide high-quality synchronized audio and video in compact file size. It was mostly used for embedded videos on these platforms. It is compatible with most browsers and devices even with older phones and computers.</p>
<p><strong>How to play .FLV files?</strong></p>
<p>To play .flv files a flash player is required. Which is pre-installed in almost most of the computers and browsers, if that’s not the case. Then you need a good video player which supports .flv format. Therefore VLC media prayer is a good choice. It is quite easy to use and has some useful features like Speed, Adding subtitles, Audio sync, e.t.c.</p>
<p><strong>Is .flv file easy to edit?</strong></p>
<p>FLV is just a format, It can be edited like any other format. Steps may differ from software to software. But don’t worry as I have mentioned the steps of some popular FLV video editors above.</p>
<p><strong>Can the .flv file be converted?</strong></p>
<p>If you don’t want to stick with the .flv format for long enough and want to switch over to a more convenient format then you can try these converters.</p>
<p><strong>VLC Media Player:</strong> Yes, apart from being a video player it can convert video formats. It’s quite easy to use.</p>
<p>Simply Open VLC Media Player &gt;&gt; Click Media tab &gt;&gt; Click “Convert&#x2F;Save” &gt;&gt; On pop up menu Select “Add” to add file (can add multiple files also) &gt;&gt; Click “Convert&#x2F;Save” &gt;&gt; Add Destination folder and File Format (to convert in) then click “Start”.</p>
<p><strong>Hand Brake:</strong> It is another popular video converter that can convert a .flv file into almost any file format.</p>
<p>Open HandBrake-“Drop a file” screen will appear &gt;&gt; Select the specific file you one to convert &gt;&gt; Select Destination filder &gt;&gt; Click “Start encoding”.</p>
<p><strong>Flv vs Mp4 which is better?</strong></p>
<p>FLV format was quite popular back in 2010 as it provides high-quality compressed video for the internet. It takes less space which makes it easy to download and transfer quickly. Nowadays MP4 format is used more as it is versatile and is compatible with almost all devices like Mobile, PC, TV, e.t.c. FLV uses H.263 codec while MP4 uses  codec which provides better quality after compression. Still .flv file is a better choice for streaming platforms as one of the most common software used for streaming is OBS studio and it produces .flv files.</p>
<p> <strong>It is available for both Windows and Mac.</strong></p>

<p>~ Some FAQs about FLV Videos:</p>
<p><strong>why is .flv format used?</strong></p>
<p>FLV is basically used to publish or distribute videos on the Internet. Many social platforms and web pages (such as youtube, Hulu, e.t.c.) use .flv files as it provide high-quality synchronized audio and video in compact file size. It was mostly used for embedded videos on these platforms. It is compatible with most browsers and devices even with older phones and computers.</p>
<p><strong>How to play .FLV files?</strong></p>
<p>To play .flv files a flash player is required. Which is pre-installed in almost most of the computers and browsers, if that’s not the case. Then you need a good video player which supports .flv format. Therefore VLC media prayer is a good choice. It is quite easy to use and has some useful features like Speed, Adding subtitles, Audio sync, e.t.c.</p>
<p><strong>Is .flv file easy to edit?</strong></p>
<p>FLV is just a format, It can be edited like any other format. Steps may differ from software to software. But don’t worry as I have mentioned the steps of some popular FLV video editors above.</p>
<p><strong>Can the .flv file be converted?</strong></p>
<p>If you don’t want to stick with the .flv format for long enough and want to switch over to a more convenient format then you can try these converters.</p>
<p><strong>VLC Media Player:</strong> Yes, apart from being a video player it can convert video formats. It’s quite easy to use.</p>
<p>Simply Open VLC Media Player &gt;&gt; Click Media tab &gt;&gt; Click “Convert&#x2F;Save” &gt;&gt; On pop up menu Select “Add” to add file (can add multiple files also) &gt;&gt; Click “Convert&#x2F;Save” &gt;&gt; Add Destination folder and File Format (to convert in) then click “Start”.</p>

<p><strong>Flv vs Mp4 which is better?</strong></p>
<p>FLV format was quite popular back in 2010 as it provides high-quality compressed video for the internet. It takes less space which makes it easy to download and transfer quickly. Nowadays MP4 format is used more as it is versatile and is compatible with almost all devices like Mobile, PC, TV, e.t.c. FLV uses H.263 codec while MP4 uses  codec which provides better quality after compression. Still .flv file is a better choice for streaming platforms as one of the most common software used for streaming is OBS studio and it produces .flv files.</p>

<p><strong>Flv vs Mp4 which is better?</strong></p>

Nowadays MP4 format is used more as it is versatile and is compatible with almost all devices like Mobile, PC, TV, e.t.c.

<p>~ Some FAQs about FLV Videos:</p>
<p><strong>why is .flv format used?</strong></p>
<p>FLV is basically used to publish or distribute videos on the Internet. Many social platforms and web pages (such as youtube, Hulu, e.t.c.) use .flv files as it provide high-quality synchronized audio and video in compact file size. It was mostly used for embedded videos on these platforms. It is compatible with most browsers and devices even with older phones and computers.</p>
<p><strong>How to play .FLV files?</strong></p>
<p>To play .flv files a flash player is required. Which is pre-installed in almost most of the computers and browsers, if that’s not the case. Then you need a good video player which supports .flv format. Therefore VLC media prayer is a good choice. It is quite easy to use and has some useful features like Speed, Adding subtitles, Audio sync, e.t.c.</p>
<p><strong>Is .flv file easy to edit?</strong></p>
<p>FLV is just a format, It can be edited like any other format. Steps may differ from software to software. But don’t worry as I have mentioned the steps of some popular FLV video editors above.</p>
<p><strong>Can the .flv file be converted?</strong></p>
<p>If you don’t want to stick with the .flv format for long enough and want to switch over to a more convenient format then you can try these converters.</p>
<p><strong>VLC Media Player:</strong> Yes, apart from being a video player it can convert video formats. It’s quite easy to use.</p>

<p>Open HandBrake-“Drop a file” screen will appear &gt;&gt; Select the specific file you one to convert &gt;&gt; Select Destination filder &gt;&gt; Click “Start encoding”.</p>
<p><strong>Flv vs Mp4 which is better?</strong></p>
<p>FLV format was quite popular back in 2010 as it provides high-quality compressed video for the internet. It takes less space which makes it easy to download and transfer quickly. Nowadays MP4 format is used more as it is versatile and is compatible with almost all devices like Mobile, PC, TV, e.t.c. FLV uses H.263 codec while MP4 uses  codec which provides better quality after compression. Still .flv file is a better choice for streaming platforms as one of the most common software used for streaming is OBS studio and it produces .flv files.</p>

<p>This many features make you think – how come it is possible to do all that on a mobile phone? How come Kinemaster is not only a software you can download, pay for, and use on your computer, which, on its behalf, should also be a powerful one? It would be a logical question, but remember, we are in 2022 already, so, no limits are put to the technology of today! On Google Play Store, in the description of the abovementioned app, it reads: “KineMaster makes video editing fun on your phone, tablet, or Chromebook!” – So, why not use this opportunity, to explore new ways of making our content better and as appealing as ever for our viewers?</p>
<p>Even though Kinemaster deserves a bigger article with more explanation of each tool, for now, we will only be focusing on cropping a video in this app. First off, why crop a video at all? – well, sometimes we have a wonderful footage but the aspect ratio just doesn’t work for us. It might be because we want to upload our clip on a platform needing a specific aspect ratio, or, we just need to crop and pan (which means to move around within a clip or an image) because we don’t like some things shown in the original video – we might as well need to zoom in and out, in order to get the best out of our footage. For whatever reason, when you need or just wish to crop a video, it should not be a big deal, and let’s see how KineMaster makes it a good and easy experience.</p>
<p>So, the first thing we do in almost every situation is to access the platform or an application itself! – you guessed it right, download KineMaster from Google Play Store! Once you have it on your phone, open it and enjoy the introduction of the app itself.</p>

<p>The interesting fact you will notice is that the layout of the app is horizontal, not vertical, unlike in most cases. So, it makes you feel like you are at least close to what video editors who work on their computers represent. The interface of the app is quite enjoyable for your eyes, as it is kind of fun, as well.</p>
<p>It is needless to say that, if you are going to do a specific “operation” to the video, such as cropping, you will already have figured out which one of your footage you want to crop and pan. So, it’s wise to jump on the button which says: Create New.</p>

<p>This will take you to the editor. Even though in the media section you will find the video you want to work on, but you might be struggling to notice a Crop button. It is because unfortunately, it’s not possible to crop your video right away in KineMaster – first, you will need to add a background, for example, a black one.</p>

<p>So, in this article, you have learned how to crop a video using a mobile app KineMaster, as well as using a software – Wondershare Filmora X. of course, there are many other ways in which you can crop your video and make the best out of it.

You might need to crop your video for your channel on Youtube, or for your page on social media, or an official web-page of your company; last but not least is cropping and editing your video for your own pleasure, which is also a great way to interact with the virtual world around us.</p>
<p>Scrolling down, we see a rich list of all the features KineMaster offers to its users, such as: Assets, Projects, Backup and Share, Blending Modes, Reverse, Chroma Key, High Resolution, Video Layers. Simply put, on KineMaster, you can download projects, add more than 2 500 effects, use powerful tools, add cinematic color, etc…</p>

                      alt="crop-video-kinemaster"
                ></p>
<p>This many features make you think – how come it is possible to do all that on a mobile phone? How come Kinemaster is not only a software you can download, pay for, and use on your computer, which, on its behalf, should also be a powerful one? It would be a logical question, but remember, we are in 2022 already, so, no limits are put to the technology of today! On Google Play Store, in the description of the abovementioned app, it reads: “KineMaster makes video editing fun on your phone, tablet, or Chromebook!” – So, why not use this opportunity, to explore new ways of making our content better and as appealing as ever for our viewers?</p>
<p>Even though Kinemaster deserves a bigger article with more explanation of each tool, for now, we will only be focusing on cropping a video in this app. First off, why crop a video at all? – well, sometimes we have a wonderful footage but the aspect ratio just doesn’t work for us. It might be because we want to upload our clip on a platform needing a specific aspect ratio, or, we just need to crop and pan (which means to move around within a clip or an image) because we don’t like some things shown in the original video – we might as well need to zoom in and out, in order to get the best out of our footage. For whatever reason, when you need or just wish to crop a video, it should not be a big deal, and let’s see how KineMaster makes it a good and easy experience.</p>
<p>So, the first thing we do in almost every situation is to access the platform or an application itself! – you guessed it right, download KineMaster from Google Play Store! Once you have it on your phone, open it and enjoy the introduction of the app itself.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="crop-video-kinemaster"
                ></p>
<p>The interesting fact you will notice is that the layout of the app is horizontal, not vertical, unlike in most cases. So, it makes you feel like you are at least close to what video editors who work on their computers represent. The interface of the app is quite enjoyable for your eyes, as it is kind of fun, as well.</p>
<p>It is needless to say that, if you are going to do a specific “operation” to the video, such as cropping, you will already have figured out which one of your footage you want to crop and pan. So, it’s wise to jump on the button which says: Create New.</p>

                ></p>
<p>This will take you to the editor. Even though in the media section you will find the video you want to work on, but you might be struggling to notice a Crop button. It is because unfortunately, it’s not possible to crop your video right away in KineMaster – first, you will need to add a background, for example, a black one.</p>
