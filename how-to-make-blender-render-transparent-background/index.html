If you are pondering over the perfect task choice to start your editing journey with Blender, you can begin with making a material transparent in the software.</p>
<p>When beginning to create transparent artworks in Blender, you need to be familiar with the Transparent BSDF node. Here’s a quick explanation:</p>
<p><strong>Transparent BSDF Node</strong></p>
<p>When working with Blender, you get to access a variety of graphic nodes that cater to specific design purposes. Likewise, the transparent BSDF, as the name suggests, is an exclusive transparency creation graphic node that is essential to make materials transparent in Blender. Talking of the specific node function, it is there to facilitate the control of different transparency modes, in cohesion with specific user requirements.</p>
<p>Browse through the following section for a guided tutorial to make a material transparent using Blender:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p>Prepare a suitable BSDF material by selecting any image from your device and applying it to the object in the Blender’s viewport.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p>To start working with the Transparent BSDF node, you first need to insert the same into the node tree amongst the Principle BSDF and the Mix Shader nodes. To do this, you need to select ‘Add’ or press ‘Ctrl + A’, followed by locating the same in the ‘Shader’ submenu. Do not forget to add the ‘Mix Shader’ node, which is again, present in the ‘Shader’ submenu, to the node tree.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p>
<p>Plug in the Transparent BSDF output into the top Shader input of the Mix Shader, while dragging the latter into the connecting link between the Material Output and Principle BSDF nodes. This enables the Mix Shader node to pass through the two output generating nodes. The resultant ‘Transparency Effect’ can be seen on the viewpoint object within a few seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong></p>
<p>Make an additional connection of two fresh nodes into the node tree as follows:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Transparent BSDF output to the Mix Shader input</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Principal BSDF output to the Mix Shader input</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Mix Shader output to the Surface input</p>
<p>This will finally fetch a transparent material output for the selected image object.</p>

<p>Browse through the following section for a guided tutorial to make a material transparent using Blender:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p>Prepare a suitable BSDF material by selecting any image from your device and applying it to the object in the Blender’s viewport.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p>To start working with the Transparent BSDF node, you first need to insert the same into the node tree amongst the Principle BSDF and the Mix Shader nodes. To do this, you need to select ‘Add’ or press ‘Ctrl + A’, followed by locating the same in the ‘Shader’ submenu. Do not forget to add the ‘Mix Shader’ node, which is again, present in the ‘Shader’ submenu, to the node tree.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p>
<p>Plug in the Transparent BSDF output into the top Shader input of the Mix Shader, while dragging the latter into the connecting link between the Material Output and Principle BSDF nodes. This enables the Mix Shader node to pass through the two output generating nodes. The resultant ‘Transparency Effect’ can be seen on the viewpoint object within a few seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong></p>
<p>Make an additional connection of two fresh nodes into the node tree as follows:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Transparent BSDF output to the Mix Shader input</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Principal BSDF output to the Mix Shader input</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Mix Shader output to the Surface input</p>
<p>This will finally fetch a transparent material output for the selected image object.</p>

If you are pondering over the perfect task choice to start your editing journey with Blender, you can begin with making a material transparent in the software.</p>
<p>When beginning to create transparent artworks in Blender, you need to be familiar with the Transparent BSDF node. Here’s a quick explanation:</p>
<p><strong>Transparent BSDF Node</strong></p>
<p>When working with Blender, you get to access a variety of graphic nodes that cater to specific design purposes. Likewise, the transparent BSDF, as the name suggests, is an exclusive transparency creation graphic node that is essential to make materials transparent in Blender. Talking of the specific node function, it is there to facilitate the control of different transparency modes, in cohesion with specific user requirements.</p>
<p>Browse through the following section for a guided tutorial to make a material transparent using Blender:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p>Prepare a suitable BSDF material by selecting any image from your device and applying it to the object in the Blender’s viewport.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p>To start working with the Transparent BSDF node, you first need to insert the same into the node tree amongst the Principle BSDF and the Mix Shader nodes. To do this, you need to select ‘Add’ or press ‘Ctrl + A’, followed by locating the same in the ‘Shader’ submenu. Do not forget to add the ‘Mix Shader’ node, which is again, present in the ‘Shader’ submenu, to the node tree.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p>
<p>Plug in the Transparent BSDF output into the top Shader input of the Mix Shader, while dragging the latter into the connecting link between the Material Output and Principle BSDF nodes. This enables the Mix Shader node to pass through the two output generating nodes. The resultant ‘Transparency Effect’ can be seen on the viewpoint object within a few seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong></p>
<p>Make an additional connection of two fresh nodes into the node tree as follows:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Transparent BSDF output to the Mix Shader input</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Principal BSDF output to the Mix Shader input</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Mix Shader output to the Surface input</p>
<p>This will finally fetch a transparent material output for the selected image object.</p>

<h2 id="Easy-Ways-to-Edit-Recorded-Video"><a href="#Easy-Ways-to-Edit-Recorded-Video" class="headerlink" title="Easy Ways to Edit Recorded Video"></a>Easy Ways to Edit Recorded Video</h2><p>The most critical component of post-production for a video marketer is editing. Your video will seem unfinished and repel your viewers if you cannot effortlessly weave your images together or get your cut to reach the proper frame. Learning to edit a video may soon become a never-ending task. While each project you work on will have somewhat different editing needs, the principles of video editing remain basically the same. You don’t need to spend a lot on costly equipment to have a professional appearance; if you pay attention to a few important things, you can produce excellent movies with whatever you have right now.</p>
<p>Content producers, entrepreneurs, and influencers can have much too much material to include into a single YouTube video. You may not be able to buy video editing software if you’re on a tight budget. So, what does a video marketer do if they don’t have editing software? To assist you with the process of video editing, we’ve put up this thorough tutorial that covers everything you’ll need to know to make stunning films, even if you’ve never done it before. We’ll also demonstrate how to utilize the super-intuitive and user-friendly editor to create a video.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Edit-Recorded-Video-in-OBS"><a href="#Part-1-Edit-Recorded-Video-in-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Edit Recorded Video in OBS"></a><strong>Part 1. Edit Recorded Video in OBS</strong></h2><p>OBS is a video streaming and recording application. It’s open source, free, and works on Macs, Windows, and Linux. It is a strong and adaptable screencast video creation tool when paired with competent audio and video editing tools. Unfortunately, OBS doesn’t support editing feature and hence, we’re enlisting the recording steps so you can edit them by using a third-party toolkit mentioned in the guide.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1. Download and Install OBS</strong></p>
<p>Install OBS according to the instructions for your operating system by downloading it from the link below.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2. Setup Screen Recording</strong></p>
<p>The window is divided into separate parts called “docks” when you initially launch the app. Every dock has a distinct function. Scenes, Sources, Mixer, and Controls are the areas to pay attention to. OBS employs a Scenes and Sources system, which will be discussed in more depth in a later lesson. These two tools operate in tandem to help you keep track of your video, audio, and other production materials. When you first start OBS, you’ll see that a scene is already loaded, which you can locate in the bottom left corner of the interface.</p>
<p><img

<p><strong>Shooting the first clip</strong></p>
<p>For the first shot, stay on one side of the frame and do the first action. For example, you can pretend to yank and take off your jacket. Then, drop the jacket to the other side of the frame.</p>

<p>Once you have opened Filmora 11, follow the steps below:</p>
<p>Step1 Bring the first clip to the timeline and cut the clip where you pretend to yank and take off the jacket. Select and delete the unnecessary clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-4.jpg"
                      alt="bring the first clip to the timeline"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 After you have the first part of the effect ready, let’s start working on the clone part using masking.</p>
<p>First, place the second clip on a different window track, and the starting point is where you react to the “clone.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-5.jpg"
                      alt="place the second clip on a different window track"
                ></p>
<p>Then, double-click the second clip and go to the Filmora setting window. Tap on the <strong>Mask</strong> section &gt; <strong>Single line</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-6.jpg"
                      alt="tap on mask section"
                ></p>
<p>On the preview screen, adjust the position of the mask to only show “the clone.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-7.gif"
                      alt="adjust the position of the mask"
                ></p>
<p>Set the blur strength on the setting to make a smoother edge transition.</p>
<p>Step3 If the timing of the two clips doesn’t match, you can fix it using the speed ramping feature on Filmora 11. To use it, double-click the second clip and select <strong>Speed &gt; Speed Ramping &gt; Customize</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-8.jpg"
                      alt="double-click the second clip"
                ></p>
<p>Move the keyframe up to increase the speed. You can adjust it according to your needs.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adjust keyframe"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 Once you are satisfied, adjust the clip length on the timeline and make sure that both clips finish at the same time.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="adjust the clip length"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Extra tip:</strong> Add one more effect to make it more magical.</p>
<p>Step1 Open the <strong>Effects</strong> window and search for “up down 1.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="open the effects window"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Drag and drop the effect onto the timeline where the first cut is set. Adjust the effect length to match the action.</p>

<p>Then, drag and drop the effect again in the transition between the first and the second clip. Adjust it to the appropriate length, then it will give a more dramatic effect.</p>

Of course, each artist’s ability differs, and so does art as well, but to start out, you do not need much. You need, though, careful planning and knowing the exact scale of your art.</p>
<p>You can break the creation of pixel art in Minecraft into four different steps:</p>
<h3 id="1-Choose-an-image-that-you-like"><a href="#1-Choose-an-image-that-you-like" class="headerlink" title="1. Choose an image that you like"></a>1. Choose an image that you like</h3><p>It is important that you reference the original work and can easily access it, as you might need to peek often while building your own art. The best thing to do is when you are starting to copy an image and work on it, rather than start it from scratch, as it takes an enormous amount of time and you need to be an expert to do it.</p>
<h3 id="2-Break-the-image-down-into-single-color-sections"><a href="#2-Break-the-image-down-into-single-color-sections" class="headerlink" title="2. Break the image down into single-color sections"></a>2. Break the image down into single-color sections</h3><p>This is the part where “careful planning” comes in. You need to be looking at your original piece constantly to know if you are going in the right direction. Also, take all the colors and try to group them. Deconstructing the original image into colored shapes is a process that will help you outline the shape and color of the original design.</p>
<h3 id="3-Obtain-the-necessary-resources"><a href="#3-Obtain-the-necessary-resources" class="headerlink" title="3. Obtain the necessary resources"></a>3. Obtain the necessary resources</h3><p>You can start this step by opening Minecraft and start collecting blocks that you think will be useful for your pixel art. It does not matter if you play in Survival, Hardcore, or Adventure mode. The process is the same. It is ideal, though, that you work on creative mode when making pixel art, as the game gives you unlimited resources. You are also able to fly in this mode, making it easier to pick up blocks, and there is no risk of your art being destroyed.</p>
<h3 id="4-Start-building"><a href="#4-Start-building" class="headerlink" title="4. Start building"></a>4. Start building</h3><p>Now you can start building your masterpiece. Start with the foundation and build from there; although you can virtually start anywhere, these blocks can float, unlike art or buildings outside the game. The time the process takes depends on the amount of work that needs to be done and the piece’s complexity.</p>
<h2 id="Part-5-Tips-for-Creating-a-Wonderful-Minecraft-Pixel-Art"><a href="#Part-5-Tips-for-Creating-a-Wonderful-Minecraft-Pixel-Art" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Tips for Creating a Wonderful Minecraft Pixel Art"></a>Part 5: Tips for Creating a Wonderful Minecraft Pixel Art</h2><p>There are many ways to draw Minecraft pixel art, but here are some tips to help you out.</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a clear idea of what kind of art you want to do. And start with something pre-made if you are only starting out. It is extremely hard to start something from scratch.</li>
<li>Plan the pixel art you are going to do. Gather around all the block materials and colors that you’ll need to make your pixel art.</li>
<li>Use creative mode. Because with the creative mode, you are not limited to the number of blocks you can find, and also, no one can come and destroy your art.</li>
<li>If it is easier, you can first draft your pixel art on another app to help you map out your own project.</li>
</ul>

Of course, each artist’s ability differs, and so does art as well, but to start out, you do not need much. You need, though, careful planning and knowing the exact scale of your art.</p>
<p>You can break the creation of pixel art in Minecraft into four different steps:</p>
<h3 id="1-Choose-an-image-that-you-like-1"><a href="#1-Choose-an-image-that-you-like-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Choose an image that you like"></a>1. Choose an image that you like</h3><p>It is important that you reference the original work and can easily access it, as you might need to peek often while building your own art. The best thing to do is when you are starting to copy an image and work on it, rather than start it from scratch, as it takes an enormous amount of time and you need to be an expert to do it.</p>
<h3 id="2-Break-the-image-down-into-single-color-sections-1"><a href="#2-Break-the-image-down-into-single-color-sections-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Break the image down into single-color sections"></a>2. Break the image down into single-color sections</h3><p>This is the part where “careful planning” comes in. You need to be looking at your original piece constantly to know if you are going in the right direction. Also, take all the colors and try to group them. Deconstructing the original image into colored shapes is a process that will help you outline the shape and color of the original design.</p>
<h3 id="3-Obtain-the-necessary-resources-1"><a href="#3-Obtain-the-necessary-resources-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Obtain the necessary resources"></a>3. Obtain the necessary resources</h3><p>You can start this step by opening Minecraft and start collecting blocks that you think will be useful for your pixel art. It does not matter if you play in Survival, Hardcore, or Adventure mode. The process is the same. It is ideal, though, that you work on creative mode when making pixel art, as the game gives you unlimited resources. You are also able to fly in this mode, making it easier to pick up blocks, and there is no risk of your art being destroyed.</p>
<h3 id="4-Start-building-1"><a href="#4-Start-building-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Start building"></a>4. Start building</h3><p>Now you can start building your masterpiece. Start with the foundation and build from there; although you can virtually start anywhere, these blocks can float, unlike art or buildings outside the game. The time the process takes depends on the amount of work that needs to be done and the piece’s complexity.</p>

<ul>
<li>Have a clear idea of what kind of art you want to do. And start with something pre-made if you are only starting out. It is extremely hard to start something from scratch.</li>
<li>Plan the pixel art you are going to do. Gather around all the block materials and colors that you’ll need to make your pixel art.</li>
<li>Use creative mode. Because with the creative mode, you are not limited to the number of blocks you can find, and also, no one can come and destroy your art.</li>
<li>If it is easier, you can first draft your pixel art on another app to help you map out your own project.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can break the creation of pixel art in Minecraft into four different steps:</p>
<h3 id="1-Choose-an-image-that-you-like-2"><a href="#1-Choose-an-image-that-you-like-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Choose an image that you like"></a>1. Choose an image that you like</h3><p>It is important that you reference the original work and can easily access it, as you might need to peek often while building your own art. The best thing to do is when you are starting to copy an image and work on it, rather than start it from scratch, as it takes an enormous amount of time and you need to be an expert to do it.</p>
<h3 id="2-Break-the-image-down-into-single-color-sections-2"><a href="#2-Break-the-image-down-into-single-color-sections-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Break the image down into single-color sections"></a>2. Break the image down into single-color sections</h3><p>This is the part where “careful planning” comes in. You need to be looking at your original piece constantly to know if you are going in the right direction. Also, take all the colors and try to group them. Deconstructing the original image into colored shapes is a process that will help you outline the shape and color of the original design.</p>
<h3 id="3-Obtain-the-necessary-resources-2"><a href="#3-Obtain-the-necessary-resources-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Obtain the necessary resources"></a>3. Obtain the necessary resources</h3><p>You can start this step by opening Minecraft and start collecting blocks that you think will be useful for your pixel art. It does not matter if you play in Survival, Hardcore, or Adventure mode. The process is the same. It is ideal, though, that you work on creative mode when making pixel art, as the game gives you unlimited resources. You are also able to fly in this mode, making it easier to pick up blocks, and there is no risk of your art being destroyed.</p>
<h3 id="4-Start-building-2"><a href="#4-Start-building-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Start building"></a>4. Start building</h3><p>Now you can start building your masterpiece. Start with the foundation and build from there; although you can virtually start anywhere, these blocks can float, unlike art or buildings outside the game. The time the process takes depends on the amount of work that needs to be done and the piece’s complexity.</p>
<h2 id="Part-5-Tips-for-Creating-a-Wonderful-Minecraft-Pixel-Art-2"><a href="#Part-5-Tips-for-Creating-a-Wonderful-Minecraft-Pixel-Art-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Tips for Creating a Wonderful Minecraft Pixel Art"></a>Part 5: Tips for Creating a Wonderful Minecraft Pixel Art</h2><p>There are many ways to draw Minecraft pixel art, but here are some tips to help you out.</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a clear idea of what kind of art you want to do. And start with something pre-made if you are only starting out. It is extremely hard to start something from scratch.</li>
<li>Plan the pixel art you are going to do. Gather around all the block materials and colors that you’ll need to make your pixel art.</li>
<li>Use creative mode. Because with the creative mode, you are not limited to the number of blocks you can find, and also, no one can come and destroy your art.</li>
<li>If it is easier, you can first draft your pixel art on another app to help you map out your own project.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Conclusion-6"><a href="#Conclusion-6" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Minecraft pixel art is a growing trend in the video games world. It can range from easy and accessible to beginners to extremely complicated pieces of art. Players are becoming more engaged with this type of art in-game, and the future only predicts a bigger expansion. There are several tools that you can use to start out in your pixel art, as well as many tutorials.</p>
