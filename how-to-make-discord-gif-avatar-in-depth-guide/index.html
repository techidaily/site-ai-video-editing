<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>It is suitable for gaming communication:</strong> Discord is primarily popular among gamers. The platform is new, but it has quickly overtaken its competitors, Skype and TeamSpeak. Why? Many gamers consider it a revolutionized application that solves all their worries making gaming communication bigger and better. Before Discord, gaming communication was difficult and dangerous. After all, you need to share personal Skype details that connect with your phone, making it a not-safe option. When we consider TeamSpeak, you realize that it is limiting with the option available since you only have a voice call. Discord brings out the best network channel; gamers and friends have quickly started using it.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Most services are free: Discord includes multiple benefits that make</strong> communication straightforward and convenient. Luckily, most of the services available are free, meaning that almost everyone can access them.

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Discord is safe:</strong> The settings under Discord are safe since they include suitable privacy options and monitoring. Thus, it is a safe option. But many people often raise the question of open chatting in apps and the security issues that come with them. Many people can confirm that Discord is a safe option and if you feel otherwise, ensure that you only add friends you know.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Why-Discord-Emojis"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Discord-Emojis" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Why Discord Emojis?"></a>Part 2 Why Discord Emojis?</h2><p>From the information above, you can tell that Discord’s primary role is communication.

Of course, they are useless for formal communication, but Discord holds a considerable weight for various issues.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>They are fun and exciting</strong>. Sometimes you can choose to use an emoji instead of writing some phrase, and this option works for all. Besides, it feels good to see different emojis instead of a long paragraph that tells the same story.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Emojis make communication easy</strong>. We are in the 21st century with multiple revolutionary changes with our communication channels. Young people prefer emojis for different conversations.</p>

<h2 id="Tips-for-a-Fantastic-Logo-Intro"><a href="#Tips-for-a-Fantastic-Logo-Intro" class="headerlink" title="Tips for a Fantastic Logo Intro"></a>Tips for a Fantastic Logo Intro</h2><p>We hope the comprehensive guide above was easy to follow and inspired you to try your hand at creating your own logo reveal video. Without further ado, let’s discuss some tips for a fantastic logo intro.</p>
<ul>
<li>Start by conducting ample research to find as many intro videos as possible before attempting to make your own. Watching and learning will allow you to figure out what works and what you shouldn’t do. You might also discover many resources to make a fantastic intro video you missed.</li>
<li>Understand what message your company intends to send and tailor your intro video to portray it as accurately as possible. For instance, you could create a fun video to relay that your brand is easygoing.</li>
<li>It wouldn’t be a great idea to show your entire logo all at once. You could create anticipation by showing tiny bits of your logo in each frame till the final logo covers the screen.</li>
<li>Design your video in a manner that keeps your audience glued to the screen. The dynamism will keep the viewer watching because they don’t want to miss what comes next.</li>
<li>Though it is not mandatory, you could end the video on a dark background, such as pitch black, to ensure your logo is clearly visible to your audience.</li>
<li>The most important tip is to keep the video short, so you don’t bore your audience. The average attention span for most viewers is shorter than 15 seconds, meaning any video longer than that will cause them to click away from your video.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="People-Also-Ask"><a href="#People-Also-Ask" class="headerlink" title="People Also Ask"></a>People Also Ask</h2><p>Before we bid you goodbye, let’s answer some commonly asked questions about template intro logo and logo reveals.</p>
<h3 id="Q1-What-Is-a-Logo-Intro"><a href="#Q1-What-Is-a-Logo-Intro" class="headerlink" title="Q1. What Is a Logo Intro?"></a>Q1. What Is a Logo Intro?</h3><p>You have probably seen a logo intro before, even though you didn’t know what you were looking at. A logo intro is a short clip of a company’s logo that features before a movie.</p>
<p>Recently, companies have started warming up to logo intros to create a lasting impression on their visitors and prospective clients. You could use a logo intro to portray your unique character and encapsulate what you stand for. In addition, a logo intro is a sure way to gain a competitive advantage over your rivals.</p>
<h3 id="Q2-What-Is-a-Logo-Reveal"><a href="#Q2-What-Is-a-Logo-Reveal" class="headerlink" title="Q2. What Is a Logo Reveal?"></a>Q2. What Is a Logo Reveal?</h3><p>Contrary to the logo intro that features at the beginning of the clip, a logo reveal comes at the tail end. This short animation is a depiction of your logo, which helps cement your marketing strategy and display your brand in a more interactive manner.</p>
<p>A logo reveal is also known as a logo stinger or sting. Since the average attention span of Internet users is pretty short, it would be a great idea to keep the logo reveal to a maximum of 10 seconds. The shorter the video, the higher the chance your audience will grasp your message and remember your brand.</p>
<h3 id="Q3-What-Are-the-5-Rules-of-a-Good-Logo"><a href="#Q3-What-Are-the-5-Rules-of-a-Good-Logo" class="headerlink" title="Q3. What Are the 5 Rules of a Good Logo?"></a>Q3. What Are the 5 Rules of a Good Logo?</h3><p>You cannot create an unforgettable logo reveal without designing the logo first. Since your company logo appears on almost anything concerning your business, it would be wise to make a valiant effort to ensure it fits the bill. Below are some of the qualities of a good logo.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rules-of-good-logo.jpg"
                      alt="5 rules of a good logo"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Unique</strong></p>
<p>It would be a shame if your logo looked like someone else’s. Ensure your logo is your own creation and can easily be associated with your brand. Copying someone else’s logo could make your audience mistake you for someone else.</p>
<p><strong>Simple</strong></p>
<p>Complex logos are hard to recognize. They are also much harder to enlarge or reduce. It would help to incorporate strong lines and letters into your logo as opposed to thinner ones.</p>
<p><strong>Versatile</strong></p>
<p>Your logo should look good with or without colour. If you must add colour, ensure you don’t exceed four colours in the design. Remember that printing your logo when it contains too many colours becomes an expensive affair.</p>
<p><strong>Scalability</strong></p>
<p>It would help to ensure that your logo looks good in a big or small size. Remember that you will use your logo on letterheads and perhaps on large banners.</p>
<p><strong>Balanced</strong></p>
<p>Lastly, you should ensure that no element within your logo overpowers the rest. Ensure you keep all the elements in the centre because an asymmetrical logo with all the details in the corner doesn’t look aesthetically pleasing.</p>
<h3 id="Q4-What-Are-the-7-Elements-of-a-Good-Logo"><a href="#Q4-What-Are-the-7-Elements-of-a-Good-Logo" class="headerlink" title="Q4. What Are the 7 Elements of a Good Logo?"></a>Q4. What Are the 7 Elements of a Good Logo?</h3><p>The seven elements of a good logo include the following.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/elements-of-good-logo.jpg"
                      alt="7 elements of a good logo"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Simplicity</strong></p>
<p>A simple design is far more superior to an overly complicated one. You could draw inspiration from brands like Nike.</p>
<p><strong>Memorability</strong></p>
<p>A good logo is one that your audience can remember off-head. Simple doesn’t always have to mean simplistic.</p>
<p><strong>Timelessness</strong></p>
<p>Trends come and go, but a timeless logo will remain appropriate in the years to come. It is not uncommon for some brands to retain their logos for more than a decade.</p>
<p><strong>Relevance</strong></p>
<p>It would be wise to ensure your logo relates to your industry in one way or the other.</p>
<p><strong>High-quality typography</strong></p>
<p>The wrong font on your logo can negatively impact your business. Your typography should also be easy to read from afar.</p>
<p><strong>Well-balanced colors</strong></p>
<p>Your choice of colors can subconsciously influence your target audience’s buying decisions and how they perceive you. For instance, blue communicates honesty and reliability, while yellow elicits feelings of happiness.</p>
<p><strong>Versatility</strong></p>
<p>Lastly, it would be wise to ensure that you can use your logo in numerous instances, like on a letterhead or on your social media platforms.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>We cannot dispute a logo’s importance to your overall brand image. Your logo helps you communicate your unique message to your target audience and prospective clients. Instead of sticking with the bland, old-fashioned static logo, you have now learned a new way to animate your logo and add some spice. We hope the suggestions in this article will help you create an excellent logo reveal intro video that keeps your audience hooked and craving more.</p>

<h2 id="Tips-for-a-Fantastic-Logo-Intro-1"><a href="#Tips-for-a-Fantastic-Logo-Intro-1" class="headerlink" title="Tips for a Fantastic Logo Intro"></a>Tips for a Fantastic Logo Intro</h2><p>We hope the comprehensive guide above was easy to follow and inspired you to try your hand at creating your own logo reveal video. Without further ado, let’s discuss some tips for a fantastic logo intro.</p>
<ul>
<li>Start by conducting ample research to find as many intro videos as possible before attempting to make your own. Watching and learning will allow you to figure out what works and what you shouldn’t do. You might also discover many resources to make a fantastic intro video you missed.</li>
<li>Understand what message your company intends to send and tailor your intro video to portray it as accurately as possible. For instance, you could create a fun video to relay that your brand is easygoing.</li>
<li>It wouldn’t be a great idea to show your entire logo all at once. You could create anticipation by showing tiny bits of your logo in each frame till the final logo covers the screen.</li>
<li>Design your video in a manner that keeps your audience glued to the screen. The dynamism will keep the viewer watching because they don’t want to miss what comes next.</li>
<li>Though it is not mandatory, you could end the video on a dark background, such as pitch black, to ensure your logo is clearly visible to your audience.</li>
<li>The most important tip is to keep the video short, so you don’t bore your audience. The average attention span for most viewers is shorter than 15 seconds, meaning any video longer than that will cause them to click away from your video.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="People-Also-Ask-1"><a href="#People-Also-Ask-1" class="headerlink" title="People Also Ask"></a>People Also Ask</h2><p>Before we bid you goodbye, let’s answer some commonly asked questions about template intro logo and logo reveals.</p>
<h3 id="Q1-What-Is-a-Logo-Intro-1"><a href="#Q1-What-Is-a-Logo-Intro-1" class="headerlink" title="Q1. What Is a Logo Intro?"></a>Q1. What Is a Logo Intro?</h3><p>You have probably seen a logo intro before, even though you didn’t know what you were looking at. A logo intro is a short clip of a company’s logo that features before a movie.</p>
<p>Recently, companies have started warming up to logo intros to create a lasting impression on their visitors and prospective clients. You could use a logo intro to portray your unique character and encapsulate what you stand for. In addition, a logo intro is a sure way to gain a competitive advantage over your rivals.</p>
<h3 id="Q2-What-Is-a-Logo-Reveal-1"><a href="#Q2-What-Is-a-Logo-Reveal-1" class="headerlink" title="Q2. What Is a Logo Reveal?"></a>Q2. What Is a Logo Reveal?</h3><p>Contrary to the logo intro that features at the beginning of the clip, a logo reveal comes at the tail end. This short animation is a depiction of your logo, which helps cement your marketing strategy and display your brand in a more interactive manner.</p>
<p>A logo reveal is also known as a logo stinger or sting. Since the average attention span of Internet users is pretty short, it would be a great idea to keep the logo reveal to a maximum of 10 seconds. The shorter the video, the higher the chance your audience will grasp your message and remember your brand.</p>
<h3 id="Q3-What-Are-the-5-Rules-of-a-Good-Logo-1"><a href="#Q3-What-Are-the-5-Rules-of-a-Good-Logo-1" class="headerlink" title="Q3. What Are the 5 Rules of a Good Logo?"></a>Q3. What Are the 5 Rules of a Good Logo?</h3><p>You cannot create an unforgettable logo reveal without designing the logo first. Since your company logo appears on almost anything concerning your business, it would be wise to make a valiant effort to ensure it fits the bill. Below are some of the qualities of a good logo.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rules-of-good-logo.jpg"
                      alt="5 rules of a good logo"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Unique</strong></p>
<p>It would be a shame if your logo looked like someone else’s. Ensure your logo is your own creation and can easily be associated with your brand. Copying someone else’s logo could make your audience mistake you for someone else.</p>
<p><strong>Simple</strong></p>
<p>Complex logos are hard to recognize. They are also much harder to enlarge or reduce. It would help to incorporate strong lines and letters into your logo as opposed to thinner ones.</p>
<p><strong>Versatile</strong></p>
<p>Your logo should look good with or without colour. If you must add colour, ensure you don’t exceed four colours in the design. Remember that printing your logo when it contains too many colours becomes an expensive affair.</p>
<p><strong>Scalability</strong></p>
<p>It would help to ensure that your logo looks good in a big or small size. Remember that you will use your logo on letterheads and perhaps on large banners.</p>
<p><strong>Balanced</strong></p>
<p>Lastly, you should ensure that no element within your logo overpowers the rest. Ensure you keep all the elements in the centre because an asymmetrical logo with all the details in the corner doesn’t look aesthetically pleasing.</p>
<h3 id="Q4-What-Are-the-7-Elements-of-a-Good-Logo-1"><a href="#Q4-What-Are-the-7-Elements-of-a-Good-Logo-1" class="headerlink" title="Q4. What Are the 7 Elements of a Good Logo?"></a>Q4. What Are the 7 Elements of a Good Logo?</h3><p>The seven elements of a good logo include the following.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/elements-of-good-logo.jpg"
                      alt="7 elements of a good logo"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Simplicity</strong></p>
<p>A simple design is far more superior to an overly complicated one. You could draw inspiration from brands like Nike.</p>
<p><strong>Memorability</strong></p>
<p>A good logo is one that your audience can remember off-head. Simple doesn’t always have to mean simplistic.</p>
<p><strong>Timelessness</strong></p>
<p>Trends come and go, but a timeless logo will remain appropriate in the years to come. It is not uncommon for some brands to retain their logos for more than a decade.</p>
<p><strong>Relevance</strong></p>
<p>It would be wise to ensure your logo relates to your industry in one way or the other.</p>
<p><strong>High-quality typography</strong></p>
<p>The wrong font on your logo can negatively impact your business. Your typography should also be easy to read from afar.</p>
<p><strong>Well-balanced colors</strong></p>
<p>Your choice of colors can subconsciously influence your target audience’s buying decisions and how they perceive you. For instance, blue communicates honesty and reliability, while yellow elicits feelings of happiness.</p>
<p><strong>Versatility</strong></p>
<p>Lastly, it would be wise to ensure that you can use your logo in numerous instances, like on a letterhead or on your social media platforms.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>We cannot dispute a logo’s importance to your overall brand image. Your logo helps you communicate your unique message to your target audience and prospective clients. Instead of sticking with the bland, old-fashioned static logo, you have now learned a new way to animate your logo and add some spice. We hope the suggestions in this article will help you create an excellent logo reveal intro video that keeps your audience hooked and craving more.</p>

In addition, a fast-processing feature is necessary to reduce the editing time significantly.</p>
<h3 id="·-Budget-2"><a href="#·-Budget-2" class="headerlink" title="· Budget"></a>· Budget</h3><p>Another factor that’s important to consider is your budget. You can use free software, but you need to note that the features are limited. If the tool doesn’t offer you the features you’re looking for, you might need to subscribe to a paid video cutter. Always choose a video cutter that falls within your budget.</p>
<h3 id="·-Experience-Level-2"><a href="#·-Experience-Level-2" class="headerlink" title="· Experience Level"></a>· Experience Level</h3><p>Are you looking to develop your editing skills?

The goal is to get a video editor that will provide you with more editing tools to enhance your video. It is pretty easy to outgrow free video cutters because of their limited features.
