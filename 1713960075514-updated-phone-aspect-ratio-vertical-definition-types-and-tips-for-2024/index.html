<p>If you are a professional video or image creator, you know what aspect ratio is and why aspect ratio is important. Even people passionate about their cameras and visual art enthusiasts know it. If you are a newbie, Let us make it easy for you. This article will talk about the vertical phone aspect ratio ratio, its definition, types, iPhone vertical video dimensions, etc. We’ll also provide you solid tips on mobile vertical video size and how to create phone vertical videos easily. Let’s jump into the topic and see what you can learn.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Phone-Aspect-Ratio-Vertical"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Phone-Aspect-Ratio-Vertical" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical?"></a>Part 1 What is Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical?</h2><p>The vertical phone aspect ratio is the “proportional” relationship between the screen’s width and height. For example, if your image or video has an aspect ratio of 4:5, it simply means the width of the screen (photo or video) is four times the height of the image.</p>
<p>The vertical phone aspect ratio is the “proportional” relationship between the screen’s width and height. For example, if your image or video has an aspect ratio of 4:5, it simply means the width of the screen (photo or video) is four times the height of the image.</p>
<p>Back in the television days, you might have seen certain old pictures with black padding on either side of the screen. It was just that they were shot in different aspect ratios and your television screen had different aspect ratios.</p>
<h3 id="Aspect-Ratio-Vs-Resolution"><a href="#Aspect-Ratio-Vs-Resolution" class="headerlink" title="Aspect Ratio Vs Resolution"></a>Aspect Ratio Vs Resolution</h3><p>Remember that aspect ratio does not refer to the physical size of an image or its dimensions in pixels (resolution). So aspect ratio 3:1 does not refer to the actual width and height of the image or video; it just describes their relationship.</p>
<p>You are wrong if you think aspect ratio is just another fancy name for resolution. Think again. Check out how it is calculated.</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>| |  Aspect Ratio | Resolution                                                     |                                                                                    |<br>| ————— | ————————————————————– | ———————————————————————————- |<br>| Definition      | The Ratio of the width of an image to the height of the image. | Total number of pixels displayed on your screen (computer, cell phone, television) |<br>| Commonly Used   | ● 1:1 ● 3:1 ● 3:2 ● 4:3 ● 5:4 ● 9:1 ● 16:9                     | ● 640x480 ● 800x600 ● 1024x768                                                     |</p>
<h3 id="Aspect-Ratio-Calculator"><a href="#Aspect-Ratio-Calculator" class="headerlink" title="Aspect Ratio Calculator"></a>Aspect Ratio Calculator</h3><p>To get the resolution, you need to multiply width times the height. To get aspect ratio, the formula is: Divide the width by the height or simply divide the long side by the short side.</p>
<p>There are multiple online aspect ratio calculators available. Check out the value for both the images and the videos generated through the photo ratio calculator for your ease.</p>

<p>For example, the aspect ratio of 3:1 may be an image of 3m wide and 1m high. At the same time it can be 3 feet wide and 1 foot high. For further simplification, consider dimensions in pixels: a 6000×4000 image has 3:2 aspect ratios.</p>
<p>Always remember this small but crucial point. The aspect ratio refers to the image or video you captured or recorded and the display (or screen) in which your video or image would be displayed.</p>
<h3 id="Why-is-the-aspect-ratio-important"><a href="#Why-is-the-aspect-ratio-important" class="headerlink" title="Why is the aspect ratio important?"></a>Why is the aspect ratio important?</h3><p>In the age of web content, asking why aspect ratio is important? Some may consider it naïve. Images need to be uploaded at different aspect ratios for different uses (desktop vs. mobile or blog vs. social media). Incorrect aspect ratio affects your final image and end-user experience.</p>
<p>Choice of the wrong aspect ratio can eliminate the potential for editing (cropping and resizing). In addition, using the correct aspect ratios saves you from facing the trouble of distortion or clipping.</p>

                ></p>
<p>If you have seen a square-shaped image, it had probably a 1:1 aspect ratio. It simply means both sides (width and height of the image) are equal. It was initially the aspect ratio of square television sets. However, this is commonly used for print photos, mobile screens, and social platforms.</p>
<p>● 3:2 Ratio</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="3 to 2 ratio"
                ></p>
<p>Initially used for classic 35 mm film and still photography, aspect ratio 3:5 is still used on some laptops, tablets, and handheld game consoles. The famous example of this aspect ratio Images framed at 1080×720 pixels or 6″x4″.</p>
<p>● 5:4 Ratio</p>
<p><img

                      alt="5 to 4 ratio"
                ></p>
<p>It was commonly used for photography and art prints. For Images having dimensions, 8″x10″ and 16x20 have the 5:4 aspect ratios.</p>

<p>Like the image aspect ratios, video aspect ratios would also profoundly affect its composition and thus how your directed viewers perceive it. Some common mobile vertical video size or video aspect ratios are given below.</p>
<p>● 16:9 Ratio</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="16 to 9 ratio"
                ></p>
<p>If you have seen presentation slides, computer monitors, or widescreee seen this slimmer and more elongated rectangular-shaped 16:9 Ratio. This is the standardized widescreen aspect ratio that you see everywhere on the web. In terms of pixel common dimension for 16:9 is 1920×1080 pixels and 1280×720 pixels.</p>
<p>● 9:16 Ratio (Vertical)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="9:16 Ratio"
                ></p>
<p>When smartphones started coming with video capabilities, this Ratio became popular. Likewise, today this Ratio is trendy for social media platforms with video story capabilities.</p>
<p>The Instagram story typically consists of 1080x1920 pixels, which in terms of aspect ratio is 9:16. Most phones, such as iPhone, have a feature that allows you to record footage in both (16:9 as well as 9:16).</p>
<h3 id="Phone-aspect-ratio-vertical"><a href="#Phone-aspect-ratio-vertical" class="headerlink" title="Phone aspect ratio vertical"></a>Phone aspect ratio vertical</h3><p>Back in the day, taking aspect ratio vertical (portrait mode) footage was considered unprofessional and a sign of an amateur. But the digital revolution has changed that. Now from unforgivable sin, the vewayal mode has practically become a mainstream media sensation. Vertical style has now become the dominant format.</p>

<p>Phone aspect ratio vertical simply means taller screen than wider. The most common type is 9:16 (1080x1920 pixels), a typical vertical videos aspect ratio. Although this phone aspect ratio vertical comes in a few more shapes and sizes such as 4:5, 2:3.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Tips-to-Create-Phone-Vertical-Videos"><a href="#Part-3-Tips-to-Create-Phone-Vertical-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Tips to Create Phone Vertical Videos"></a>Part 3 Tips to Create Phone Vertical Videos</h2><p>Creating vertical videos is crucial for getting engagements and growing your brand. It is easy with a phone because most smartphones, by default, record in 9:16, which is the standard vertical aspect ratio. But with a camera, you have to manually edit to the correct aspect ratio before you shoot it.</p>
<p>You can also shoot horizontally and then change it to vertical, but it needs professional videographer expertise.</p>
<p>Who wants to rotate their phones watching videos? Well, as far as the trend, Let us see some tiny but handy tips for creating vertical phone videos.</p>
<h3 id="1-Choose-the-correct-aspect-ratio"><a href="#1-Choose-the-correct-aspect-ratio" class="headerlink" title="1. Choose the correct aspect ratio"></a>1. Choose the correct aspect ratio</h3><p>Video taller than the 1:1 aspect ratio is commonly considered Vertical video. Types of these vertical aspects ratio include 4:5 (social), 2:3 and 9:16. They are all taller than they are wide, thus vertical.</p>
<p>Choosing the correct aspect ratio for your vertical video, always think about why and where you intend to use the video. The second important thing you should consider is your plans for editing that video.</p>
<p>Cropping horizontal can be irritating and sometimes disappointing at the same time. Producing a 9:16 vertical frame at HD resolution from a horizontal HD frame may result in very pixelated and low-quality footage.</p>
<p>If, for some reason, you still want first to shoot it horizontal and then change it back to mobile vertical video size. You may need to shoot in 4K horizontally to get extra pixels to work with. It can later be cropped in the sides to 9:16 (Vertical phone aspect ratio). Plus, you won’t need to scale it anymore.</p>
<h3 id="2-Direct-your-viewer’s-eyes"><a href="#2-Direct-your-viewer’s-eyes" class="headerlink" title="2. Direct your viewer’s eyes"></a>2. Direct your viewer’s eyes</h3><p>For hooking social media viewers, you need to put your most interesting visual upfront. These include GIFs, colourful stop-motion or looping animation. Always try to match your first couple of shots with your overall brand personality.</p>
<p>3. Screen splitting into two or more</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-11.png"
                      alt="screen splitting"
                ></p>
<p>A tall vertical screen can be styled with multiple horizontal clips on top of each other. These clips must relate to your relevant content and overall look. Natural lines or patterns can help display them in the most creative ways.</p>
<h3 id="4-Be-close-to-your-subject"><a href="#4-Be-close-to-your-subject" class="headerlink" title="4. Be close to your subject"></a>4. Be close to your subject</h3><p>For producing an intimate experience with the vertical frame, you should get closer to the subject. Most of the action will be positioned to the centre as your viewers scroll. Do not let cut off or cover up your main subject by any text and make sure you leave enough room for text, emojis and stickers.</p>
<h3 id="5-Filling-the-vertical-space"><a href="#5-Filling-the-vertical-space" class="headerlink" title="5. Filling the vertical space"></a>5. Filling the vertical space</h3><p>First, make sure that your subject is vertical-friendly. Then get closer and fill the space within the vertical frame. The vertical frame can be filled through the following:</p>
<p>● Up-close shot (if the subject is personal).</p>
<p>● Raising the camera high and tilting it down (to film things like a long, empty road).</p>
<p>● Bird’s-eye view from above.</p>
<h3 id="5-Rule-of-Third"><a href="#5-Rule-of-Third" class="headerlink" title="5. Rule of Third"></a>5. Rule of Third</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-10.png"
                      alt="rule of third"
                ></p>
<p>This photography rule says not to place the main subject directly in the center of the frame. Create more dynamic composition by creating imaginary (Horizontal &amp; Vertical) lines that divide your frame into thirds.</p>
<p>You have to place your subject either on the lines or where the lines meet up. And guess what? You don’t need to draw imaginary nowadays. Most cameras and smartphones provide you with this option.</p>
<h3 id="6-Avoid-Shaking"><a href="#6-Avoid-Shaking" class="headerlink" title="6. Avoid Shaking"></a>6. Avoid Shaking</h3><p>You do not want to distract your viewers with shaky camera moments. Normal pan and 360-degree rotation are acceptable or maybe even essential. But moving side to side too quickly will make it difficult for the camera to process that information. You better use a selfie stick or gimbal.</p>
<p>Now, check out the best vertical video ratios for various social platforms.</p>

For example, if your image or video has an aspect ratio of 4:5, it simply means the width of the screen (photo or video) is four times the height of the image.</p>
<p>The vertical phone aspect ratio is the “proportional” relationship between the screen’s width and height. For example, if your image or video has an aspect ratio of 4:5, it simply means the width of the screen (photo or video) is four times the height of the image.</p>
<p>Back in the television days, you might have seen certain old pictures with black padding on either side of the screen. It was just that they were shot in different aspect ratios and your television screen had different aspect ratios.</p>
<h3 id="Aspect-Ratio-Vs-Resolution-1"><a href="#Aspect-Ratio-Vs-Resolution-1" class="headerlink" title="Aspect Ratio Vs Resolution"></a>Aspect Ratio Vs Resolution</h3><p>Remember that aspect ratio does not refer to the physical size of an image or its dimensions in pixels (resolution). So aspect ratio 3:1 does not refer to the actual width and height of the image or video; it just describes their relationship.</p>
<p>You are wrong if you think aspect ratio is just another fancy name for resolution. Think again. Check out how it is calculated.</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>| |  Aspect Ratio | Resolution                                                     |                                                                                    |<br>| ————— | ————————————————————– | ———————————————————————————- |<br>| Definition      | The Ratio of the width of an image to the height of the image. | Total number of pixels displayed on your screen (computer, cell phone, television) |<br>| Commonly Used   | ● 1:1 ● 3:1 ● 3:2 ● 4:3 ● 5:4 ● 9:1 ● 16:9                     | ● 640x480 ● 800x600 ● 1024x768                                                     |</p>
<h3 id="Aspect-Ratio-Calculator-1"><a href="#Aspect-Ratio-Calculator-1" class="headerlink" title="Aspect Ratio Calculator"></a>Aspect Ratio Calculator</h3><p>To get the resolution, you need to multiply width times the height. To get aspect ratio, the formula is: Divide the width by the height or simply divide the long side by the short side.</p>
<p>There are multiple online aspect ratio calculators available. Check out the value for both the images and the videos generated through the photo ratio calculator for your ease.</p>

<p>For example, the aspect ratio of 3:1 may be an image of 3m wide and 1m high. At the same time it can be 3 feet wide and 1 foot high. For further simplification, consider dimensions in pixels: a 6000×4000 image has 3:2 aspect ratios.</p>
<p>Always remember this small but crucial point. The aspect ratio refers to the image or video you captured or recorded and the display (or screen) in which your video or image would be displayed.</p>
<h3 id="Why-is-the-aspect-ratio-important-1"><a href="#Why-is-the-aspect-ratio-important-1" class="headerlink" title="Why is the aspect ratio important?"></a>Why is the aspect ratio important?</h3><p>In the age of web content, asking why aspect ratio is important? Some may consider it naïve. Images need to be uploaded at different aspect ratios for different uses (desktop vs. mobile or blog vs. social media). Incorrect aspect ratio affects your final image and end-user experience.</p>
<p>Choice of the wrong aspect ratio can eliminate the potential for editing (cropping and resizing). In addition, using the correct aspect ratios saves you from facing the trouble of distortion or clipping.</p>

                ></p>
<p>If you have seen a square-shaped image, it had probably a 1:1 aspect ratio. It simply means both sides (width and height of the image) are equal. It was initially the aspect ratio of square television sets. However, this is commonly used for print photos, mobile screens, and social platforms.</p>
<p>● 3:2 Ratio</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>Initially used for classic 35 mm film and still photography, aspect ratio 3:5 is still used on some laptops, tablets, and handheld game consoles. The famous example of this aspect ratio Images framed at 1080×720 pixels or 6″x4″.</p>
<p>● 5:4 Ratio</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>It was commonly used for photography and art prints. For Images having dimensions, 8″x10″ and 16x20 have the 5:4 aspect ratios.</p>

<p>Like the image aspect ratios, video aspect ratios would also profoundly affect its composition and thus how your directed viewers perceive it. Some common mobile vertical video size or video aspect ratios are given below.</p>
<p>● 16:9 Ratio</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>If you have seen presentation slides, computer monitors, or widescreee seen this slimmer and more elongated rectangular-shaped 16:9 Ratio. This is the standardized widescreen aspect ratio that you see everywhere on the web. In terms of pixel common dimension for 16:9 is 1920×1080 pixels and 1280×720 pixels.</p>
<p>● 9:16 Ratio (Vertical)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>When smartphones started coming with video capabilities, this Ratio became popular. Likewise, today this Ratio is trendy for social media platforms with video story capabilities.</p>
<p>The Instagram story typically consists of 1080x1920 pixels, which in terms of aspect ratio is 9:16. Most phones, such as iPhone, have a feature that allows you to record footage in both (16:9 as well as 9:16).</p>
<h3 id="Phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-1"><a href="#Phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-1" class="headerlink" title="Phone aspect ratio vertical"></a>Phone aspect ratio vertical</h3><p>Back in the day, taking aspect ratio vertical (portrait mode) footage was considered unprofessional and a sign of an amateur. But the digital revolution has changed that. Now from unforgivable sin, the vewayal mode has practically become a mainstream media sensation. Vertical style has now become the dominant format.</p>

<p>Phone aspect ratio vertical simply means taller screen than wider. The most common type is 9:16 (1080x1920 pixels), a typical vertical videos aspect ratio. Although this phone aspect ratio vertical comes in a few more shapes and sizes such as 4:5, 2:3.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Tips-to-Create-Phone-Vertical-Videos-1"><a href="#Part-3-Tips-to-Create-Phone-Vertical-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Tips to Create Phone Vertical Videos"></a>Part 3 Tips to Create Phone Vertical Videos</h2><p>Creating vertical videos is crucial for getting engagements and growing your brand. It is easy with a phone because most smartphones, by default, record in 9:16, which is the standard vertical aspect ratio. But with a camera, you have to manually edit to the correct aspect ratio before you shoot it.</p>
<p>You can also shoot horizontally and then change it to vertical, but it needs professional videographer expertise.</p>
<p>Who wants to rotate their phones watching videos? Well, as far as the trend, Let us see some tiny but handy tips for creating vertical phone videos.</p>
<h3 id="1-Choose-the-correct-aspect-ratio-1"><a href="#1-Choose-the-correct-aspect-ratio-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Choose the correct aspect ratio"></a>1. Choose the correct aspect ratio</h3><p>Video taller than the 1:1 aspect ratio is commonly considered Vertical video. Types of these vertical aspects ratio include 4:5 (social), 2:3 and 9:16. They are all taller than they are wide, thus vertical.</p>
<p>Choosing the correct aspect ratio for your vertical video, always think about why and where you intend to use the video. The second important thing you should consider is your plans for editing that video.</p>
<p>Cropping horizontal can be irritating and sometimes disappointing at the same time. Producing a 9:16 vertical frame at HD resolution from a horizontal HD frame may result in very pixelated and low-quality footage.</p>
<p>If, for some reason, you still want first to shoot it horizontal and then change it back to mobile vertical video size. You may need to shoot in 4K horizontally to get extra pixels to work with. It can later be cropped in the sides to 9:16 (Vertical phone aspect ratio). Plus, you won’t need to scale it anymore.</p>
<h3 id="2-Direct-your-viewer’s-eyes-1"><a href="#2-Direct-your-viewer’s-eyes-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Direct your viewer’s eyes"></a>2. Direct your viewer’s eyes</h3><p>For hooking social media viewers, you need to put your most interesting visual upfront. These include GIFs, colourful stop-motion or looping animation. Always try to match your first couple of shots with your overall brand personality.</p>
<p>3. Screen splitting into two or more</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-11.png"
                      alt="screen splitting"
                ></p>
<p>A tall vertical screen can be styled with multiple horizontal clips on top of each other. These clips must relate to your relevant content and overall look. Natural lines or patterns can help display them in the most creative ways.</p>
<h3 id="4-Be-close-to-your-subject-1"><a href="#4-Be-close-to-your-subject-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Be close to your subject"></a>4. Be close to your subject</h3><p>For producing an intimate experience with the vertical frame, you should get closer to the subject. Most of the action will be positioned to the centre as your viewers scroll. Do not let cut off or cover up your main subject by any text and make sure you leave enough room for text, emojis and stickers.</p>
<h3 id="5-Filling-the-vertical-space-1"><a href="#5-Filling-the-vertical-space-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Filling the vertical space"></a>5. Filling the vertical space</h3><p>First, make sure that your subject is vertical-friendly. Then get closer and fill the space within the vertical frame. The vertical frame can be filled through the following:</p>
<p>● Up-close shot (if the subject is personal).</p>
<p>● Raising the camera high and tilting it down (to film things like a long, empty road).</p>
<p>● Bird’s-eye view from above.</p>
<h3 id="5-Rule-of-Third-1"><a href="#5-Rule-of-Third-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Rule of Third"></a>5. Rule of Third</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-10.png"
                      alt="rule of third"
                ></p>
<p>This photography rule says not to place the main subject directly in the center of the frame. Create more dynamic composition by creating imaginary (Horizontal &amp; Vertical) lines that divide your frame into thirds.</p>
<p>You have to place your subject either on the lines or where the lines meet up. And guess what? You don’t need to draw imaginary nowadays. Most cameras and smartphones provide you with this option.</p>
<h3 id="6-Avoid-Shaking-1"><a href="#6-Avoid-Shaking-1" class="headerlink" title="6. Avoid Shaking"></a>6. Avoid Shaking</h3><p>You do not want to distract your viewers with shaky camera moments. Normal pan and 360-degree rotation are acceptable or maybe even essential. But moving side to side too quickly will make it difficult for the camera to process that information. You better use a selfie stick or gimbal.</p>
<p>Now, check out the best vertical video ratios for various social platforms.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Phone-Aspect-Ratio-Vertical-2"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Phone-Aspect-Ratio-Vertical-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical?"></a>Part 1 What is Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical?</h2><p>The vertical phone aspect ratio is the “proportional” relationship between the screen’s width and height. For example, if your image or video has an aspect ratio of 4:5, it simply means the width of the screen (photo or video) is four times the height of the image.</p>
<p>The vertical phone aspect ratio is the “proportional” relationship between the screen’s width and height. For example, if your image or video has an aspect ratio of 4:5, it simply means the width of the screen (photo or video) is four times the height of the image.</p>
<p>Back in the television days, you might have seen certain old pictures with black padding on either side of the screen. It was just that they were shot in different aspect ratios and your television screen had different aspect ratios.</p>
<h3 id="Aspect-Ratio-Vs-Resolution-2"><a href="#Aspect-Ratio-Vs-Resolution-2" class="headerlink" title="Aspect Ratio Vs Resolution"></a>Aspect Ratio Vs Resolution</h3><p>Remember that aspect ratio does not refer to the physical size of an image or its dimensions in pixels (resolution). So aspect ratio 3:1 does not refer to the actual width and height of the image or video; it just describes their relationship.</p>
<p>You are wrong if you think aspect ratio is just another fancy name for resolution. Think again. Check out how it is calculated.</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>| |  Aspect Ratio | Resolution                                                     |                                                                                    |<br>| ————— | ————————————————————– | ———————————————————————————- |<br>| Definition      | The Ratio of the width of an image to the height of the image. | Total number of pixels displayed on your screen (computer, cell phone, television) |<br>| Commonly Used   | ● 1:1 ● 3:1 ● 3:2 ● 4:3 ● 5:4 ● 9:1 ● 16:9                     | ● 640x480 ● 800x600 ● 1024x768                                                     |</p>
<h3 id="Aspect-Ratio-Calculator-2"><a href="#Aspect-Ratio-Calculator-2" class="headerlink" title="Aspect Ratio Calculator"></a>Aspect Ratio Calculator</h3><p>To get the resolution, you need to multiply width times the height. To get aspect ratio, the formula is: Divide the width by the height or simply divide the long side by the short side.</p>
<p>There are multiple online aspect ratio calculators available. Check out the value for both the images and the videos generated through the photo ratio calculator for your ease.</p>

<p>For example, the aspect ratio of 3:1 may be an image of 3m wide and 1m high. At the same time it can be 3 feet wide and 1 foot high. For further simplification, consider dimensions in pixels: a 6000×4000 image has 3:2 aspect ratios.</p>
<p>Always remember this small but crucial point. The aspect ratio refers to the image or video you captured or recorded and the display (or screen) in which your video or image would be displayed.</p>
<h3 id="Why-is-the-aspect-ratio-important-2"><a href="#Why-is-the-aspect-ratio-important-2" class="headerlink" title="Why is the aspect ratio important?"></a>Why is the aspect ratio important?</h3><p>In the age of web content, asking why aspect ratio is important? Some may consider it naïve. Images need to be uploaded at different aspect ratios for different uses (desktop vs. mobile or blog vs. social media). Incorrect aspect ratio affects your final image and end-user experience.</p>
<p>Choice of the wrong aspect ratio can eliminate the potential for editing (cropping and resizing). In addition, using the correct aspect ratios saves you from facing the trouble of distortion or clipping.</p>

                ></p>
<p>If you have seen a square-shaped image, it had probably a 1:1 aspect ratio. It simply means both sides (width and height of the image) are equal. It was initially the aspect ratio of square television sets. However, this is commonly used for print photos, mobile screens, and social platforms.</p>
<p>● 3:2 Ratio</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="3 to 2 ratio"
                ></p>
<p>Initially used for classic 35 mm film and still photography, aspect ratio 3:5 is still used on some laptops, tablets, and handheld game consoles. The famous example of this aspect ratio Images framed at 1080×720 pixels or 6″x4″.</p>
<p>● 5:4 Ratio</p>
<p><img

                      alt="5 to 4 ratio"
                ></p>
<p>It was commonly used for photography and art prints. For Images having dimensions, 8″x10″ and 16x20 have the 5:4 aspect ratios.</p>

<p>Like the image aspect ratios, video aspect ratios would also profoundly affect its composition and thus how your directed viewers perceive it. Some common mobile vertical video size or video aspect ratios are given below.</p>
<p>● 16:9 Ratio</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>If you have seen presentation slides, computer monitors, or widescreee seen this slimmer and more elongated rectangular-shaped 16:9 Ratio. This is the standardized widescreen aspect ratio that you see everywhere on the web. In terms of pixel common dimension for 16:9 is 1920×1080 pixels and 1280×720 pixels.</p>
<p>● 9:16 Ratio (Vertical)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="9:16 Ratio"
                ></p>
<p>When smartphones started coming with video capabilities, this Ratio became popular. Likewise, today this Ratio is trendy for social media platforms with video story capabilities.</p>
<p>The Instagram story typically consists of 1080x1920 pixels, which in terms of aspect ratio is 9:16. Most phones, such as iPhone, have a feature that allows you to record footage in both (16:9 as well as 9:16).</p>
<h3 id="Phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-2"><a href="#Phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-2" class="headerlink" title="Phone aspect ratio vertical"></a>Phone aspect ratio vertical</h3><p>Back in the day, taking aspect ratio vertical (portrait mode) footage was considered unprofessional and a sign of an amateur. But the digital revolution has changed that. Now from unforgivable sin, the vewayal mode has practically become a mainstream media sensation. Vertical style has now become the dominant format.</p>

<p>Phone aspect ratio vertical simply means taller screen than wider. The most common type is 9:16 (1080x1920 pixels), a typical vertical videos aspect ratio. Although this phone aspect ratio vertical comes in a few more shapes and sizes such as 4:5, 2:3.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Tips-to-Create-Phone-Vertical-Videos-2"><a href="#Part-3-Tips-to-Create-Phone-Vertical-Videos-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Tips to Create Phone Vertical Videos"></a>Part 3 Tips to Create Phone Vertical Videos</h2><p>Creating vertical videos is crucial for getting engagements and growing your brand. It is easy with a phone because most smartphones, by default, record in 9:16, which is the standard vertical aspect ratio. But with a camera, you have to manually edit to the correct aspect ratio before you shoot it.</p>
<p>You can also shoot horizontally and then change it to vertical, but it needs professional videographer expertise.</p>
<p>Who wants to rotate their phones watching videos? Well, as far as the trend, Let us see some tiny but handy tips for creating vertical phone videos.</p>
<h3 id="1-Choose-the-correct-aspect-ratio-2"><a href="#1-Choose-the-correct-aspect-ratio-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Choose the correct aspect ratio"></a>1. Choose the correct aspect ratio</h3><p>Video taller than the 1:1 aspect ratio is commonly considered Vertical video. Types of these vertical aspects ratio include 4:5 (social), 2:3 and 9:16. They are all taller than they are wide, thus vertical.</p>
<p>Choosing the correct aspect ratio for your vertical video, always think about why and where you intend to use the video. The second important thing you should consider is your plans for editing that video.</p>
<p>Cropping horizontal can be irritating and sometimes disappointing at the same time. Producing a 9:16 vertical frame at HD resolution from a horizontal HD frame may result in very pixelated and low-quality footage.</p>
<p>If, for some reason, you still want first to shoot it horizontal and then change it back to mobile vertical video size. You may need to shoot in 4K horizontally to get extra pixels to work with. It can later be cropped in the sides to 9:16 (Vertical phone aspect ratio). Plus, you won’t need to scale it anymore.</p>
<h3 id="2-Direct-your-viewer’s-eyes-2"><a href="#2-Direct-your-viewer’s-eyes-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Direct your viewer’s eyes"></a>2. Direct your viewer’s eyes</h3><p>For hooking social media viewers, you need to put your most interesting visual upfront. These include GIFs, colourful stop-motion or looping animation. Always try to match your first couple of shots with your overall brand personality.</p>
<p>3. Screen splitting into two or more</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-11.png"
                      alt="screen splitting"
                ></p>
<p>A tall vertical screen can be styled with multiple horizontal clips on top of each other. These clips must relate to your relevant content and overall look. Natural lines or patterns can help display them in the most creative ways.</p>
<h3 id="4-Be-close-to-your-subject-2"><a href="#4-Be-close-to-your-subject-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Be close to your subject"></a>4. Be close to your subject</h3><p>For producing an intimate experience with the vertical frame, you should get closer to the subject. Most of the action will be positioned to the centre as your viewers scroll. Do not let cut off or cover up your main subject by any text and make sure you leave enough room for text, emojis and stickers.</p>
<h3 id="5-Filling-the-vertical-space-2"><a href="#5-Filling-the-vertical-space-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Filling the vertical space"></a>5. Filling the vertical space</h3><p>First, make sure that your subject is vertical-friendly. Then get closer and fill the space within the vertical frame. The vertical frame can be filled through the following:</p>
<p>● Up-close shot (if the subject is personal).</p>
<p>● Raising the camera high and tilting it down (to film things like a long, empty road).</p>
<p>● Bird’s-eye view from above.</p>
<h3 id="5-Rule-of-Third-2"><a href="#5-Rule-of-Third-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Rule of Third"></a>5. Rule of Third</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-10.png"
                      alt="rule of third"
                ></p>
<p>This photography rule says not to place the main subject directly in the center of the frame. Create more dynamic composition by creating imaginary (Horizontal &amp; Vertical) lines that divide your frame into thirds.</p>
<p>You have to place your subject either on the lines or where the lines meet up. And guess what? You don’t need to draw imaginary nowadays. Most cameras and smartphones provide you with this option.</p>
<h3 id="6-Avoid-Shaking-2"><a href="#6-Avoid-Shaking-2" class="headerlink" title="6. Avoid Shaking"></a>6. Avoid Shaking</h3><p>You do not want to distract your viewers with shaky camera moments. Normal pan and 360-degree rotation are acceptable or maybe even essential. But moving side to side too quickly will make it difficult for the camera to process that information. You better use a selfie stick or gimbal.</p>
<p>Now, check out the best vertical video ratios for various social platforms.</p>

For example, if your image or video has an aspect ratio of 4:5, it simply means the width of the screen (photo or video) is four times the height of the image.</p>
<p>The vertical phone aspect ratio is the “proportional” relationship between the screen’s width and height. For example, if your image or video has an aspect ratio of 4:5, it simply means the width of the screen (photo or video) is four times the height of the image.</p>
<p>Back in the television days, you might have seen certain old pictures with black padding on either side of the screen. It was just that they were shot in different aspect ratios and your television screen had different aspect ratios.</p>
<h3 id="Aspect-Ratio-Vs-Resolution-3"><a href="#Aspect-Ratio-Vs-Resolution-3" class="headerlink" title="Aspect Ratio Vs Resolution"></a>Aspect Ratio Vs Resolution</h3><p>Remember that aspect ratio does not refer to the physical size of an image or its dimensions in pixels (resolution). So aspect ratio 3:1 does not refer to the actual width and height of the image or video; it just describes their relationship.</p>
<p>You are wrong if you think aspect ratio is just another fancy name for resolution. Think again. Check out how it is calculated.</p>
<p>“</p>

<h3 id="Aspect-Ratio-Calculator-3"><a href="#Aspect-Ratio-Calculator-3" class="headerlink" title="Aspect Ratio Calculator"></a>Aspect Ratio Calculator</h3><p>To get the resolution, you need to multiply width times the height. To get aspect ratio, the formula is: Divide the width by the height or simply divide the long side by the short side.</p>
<p>There are multiple online aspect ratio calculators available. Check out the value for both the images and the videos generated through the photo ratio calculator for your ease.</p>

<p>For example, the aspect ratio of 3:1 may be an image of 3m wide and 1m high. At the same time it can be 3 feet wide and 1 foot high. For further simplification, consider dimensions in pixels: a 6000×4000 image has 3:2 aspect ratios.</p>
<p>Always remember this small but crucial point. The aspect ratio refers to the image or video you captured or recorded and the display (or screen) in which your video or image would be displayed.</p>
<h3 id="Why-is-the-aspect-ratio-important-3"><a href="#Why-is-the-aspect-ratio-important-3" class="headerlink" title="Why is the aspect ratio important?"></a>Why is the aspect ratio important?</h3><p>In the age of web content, asking why aspect ratio is important? Some may consider it naïve. Images need to be uploaded at different aspect ratios for different uses (desktop vs. mobile or blog vs. social media). Incorrect aspect ratio affects your final image and end-user experience.</p>
<p>Choice of the wrong aspect ratio can eliminate the potential for editing (cropping and resizing). In addition, using the correct aspect ratios saves you from facing the trouble of distortion or clipping.</p>

                ></p>
<p>If you have seen a square-shaped image, it had probably a 1:1 aspect ratio. It simply means both sides (width and height of the image) are equal. It was initially the aspect ratio of square television sets. However, this is commonly used for print photos, mobile screens, and social platforms.</p>
<p>● 3:2 Ratio</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="3 to 2 ratio"
                ></p>
<p>Initially used for classic 35 mm film and still photography, aspect ratio 3:5 is still used on some laptops, tablets, and handheld game consoles. The famous example of this aspect ratio Images framed at 1080×720 pixels or 6″x4″.</p>
<p>● 5:4 Ratio</p>
<p><img

                      alt="5 to 4 ratio"
                ></p>
<p>It was commonly used for photography and art prints. For Images having dimensions, 8″x10″ and 16x20 have the 5:4 aspect ratios.</p>

<p>Like the image aspect ratios, video aspect ratios would also profoundly affect its composition and thus how your directed viewers perceive it. Some common mobile vertical video size or video aspect ratios are given below.</p>
<p>● 16:9 Ratio</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>If you have seen presentation slides, computer monitors, or widescreee seen this slimmer and more elongated rectangular-shaped 16:9 Ratio. This is the standardized widescreen aspect ratio that you see everywhere on the web. In terms of pixel common dimension for 16:9 is 1920×1080 pixels and 1280×720 pixels.</p>
<p>● 9:16 Ratio (Vertical)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>When smartphones started coming with video capabilities, this Ratio became popular. Likewise, today this Ratio is trendy for social media platforms with video story capabilities.</p>
<p>The Instagram story typically consists of 1080x1920 pixels, which in terms of aspect ratio is 9:16. Most phones, such as iPhone, have a feature that allows you to record footage in both (16:9 as well as 9:16).</p>
<h3 id="Phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-3"><a href="#Phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-3" class="headerlink" title="Phone aspect ratio vertical"></a>Phone aspect ratio vertical</h3><p>Back in the day, taking aspect ratio vertical (portrait mode) footage was considered unprofessional and a sign of an amateur. But the digital revolution has changed that. Now from unforgivable sin, the vewayal mode has practically become a mainstream media sensation. Vertical style has now become the dominant format.</p>

<p>Phone aspect ratio vertical simply means taller screen than wider. The most common type is 9:16 (1080x1920 pixels), a typical vertical videos aspect ratio. Although this phone aspect ratio vertical comes in a few more shapes and sizes such as 4:5, 2:3.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Tips-to-Create-Phone-Vertical-Videos-3"><a href="#Part-3-Tips-to-Create-Phone-Vertical-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Tips to Create Phone Vertical Videos"></a>Part 3 Tips to Create Phone Vertical Videos</h2><p>Creating vertical videos is crucial for getting engagements and growing your brand. It is easy with a phone because most smartphones, by default, record in 9:16, which is the standard vertical aspect ratio. But with a camera, you have to manually edit to the correct aspect ratio before you shoot it.</p>
<p>You can also shoot horizontally and then change it to vertical, but it needs professional videographer expertise.</p>
<p>Who wants to rotate their phones watching videos? Well, as far as the trend, Let us see some tiny but handy tips for creating vertical phone videos.</p>
<h3 id="1-Choose-the-correct-aspect-ratio-3"><a href="#1-Choose-the-correct-aspect-ratio-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Choose the correct aspect ratio"></a>1. Choose the correct aspect ratio</h3><p>Video taller than the 1:1 aspect ratio is commonly considered Vertical video. Types of these vertical aspects ratio include 4:5 (social), 2:3 and 9:16. They are all taller than they are wide, thus vertical.</p>
<p>Choosing the correct aspect ratio for your vertical video, always think about why and where you intend to use the video. The second important thing you should consider is your plans for editing that video.</p>
<p>Cropping horizontal can be irritating and sometimes disappointing at the same time. Producing a 9:16 vertical frame at HD resolution from a horizontal HD frame may result in very pixelated and low-quality footage.</p>
<p>If, for some reason, you still want first to shoot it horizontal and then change it back to mobile vertical video size. You may need to shoot in 4K horizontally to get extra pixels to work with. It can later be cropped in the sides to 9:16 (Vertical phone aspect ratio). Plus, you won’t need to scale it anymore.</p>
<h3 id="2-Direct-your-viewer’s-eyes-3"><a href="#2-Direct-your-viewer’s-eyes-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Direct your viewer’s eyes"></a>2. Direct your viewer’s eyes</h3><p>For hooking social media viewers, you need to put your most interesting visual upfront. These include GIFs, colourful stop-motion or looping animation. Always try to match your first couple of shots with your overall brand personality.</p>
<p>3. Screen splitting into two or more</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-11.png"
                      alt="screen splitting"
                ></p>
<p>A tall vertical screen can be styled with multiple horizontal clips on top of each other. These clips must relate to your relevant content and overall look. Natural lines or patterns can help display them in the most creative ways.</p>
<h3 id="4-Be-close-to-your-subject-3"><a href="#4-Be-close-to-your-subject-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Be close to your subject"></a>4. Be close to your subject</h3><p>For producing an intimate experience with the vertical frame, you should get closer to the subject. Most of the action will be positioned to the centre as your viewers scroll. Do not let cut off or cover up your main subject by any text and make sure you leave enough room for text, emojis and stickers.</p>
<h3 id="5-Filling-the-vertical-space-3"><a href="#5-Filling-the-vertical-space-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Filling the vertical space"></a>5. Filling the vertical space</h3><p>First, make sure that your subject is vertical-friendly. Then get closer and fill the space within the vertical frame. The vertical frame can be filled through the following:</p>
<p>● Up-close shot (if the subject is personal).</p>
<p>● Raising the camera high and tilting it down (to film things like a long, empty road).</p>
<p>● Bird’s-eye view from above.</p>
<h3 id="5-Rule-of-Third-3"><a href="#5-Rule-of-Third-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Rule of Third"></a>5. Rule of Third</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-10.png"
                      alt="rule of third"
                ></p>
<p>This photography rule says not to place the main subject directly in the center of the frame. Create more dynamic composition by creating imaginary (Horizontal &amp; Vertical) lines that divide your frame into thirds.</p>
<p>You have to place your subject either on the lines or where the lines meet up. And guess what? You don’t need to draw imaginary nowadays. Most cameras and smartphones provide you with this option.</p>
<h3 id="6-Avoid-Shaking-3"><a href="#6-Avoid-Shaking-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Avoid Shaking"></a>6. Avoid Shaking</h3><p>You do not want to distract your viewers with shaky camera moments. Normal pan and 360-degree rotation are acceptable or maybe even essential. But moving side to side too quickly will make it difficult for the camera to process that information. You better use a selfie stick or gimbal.</p>
<p>Now, check out the best vertical video ratios for various social platforms.</p>

<p>Text-to-speech (TTS) is a type of assistive technology that reads digital text aloud. It’s sometimes called “read aloud” technology. This technology has evolved to the point of being inculcated or introduced directly to some video editing applications without having to visit a separate text-to-speech application or software for support. This article therefore aims at discussing ten video makers that have inbuilt the text-to-speech feature.</p>

<p>FEATURES</p>
<p>After reviewing both versions (Android and iOS) of CapCut, we found that the app is indeed easy to use and includes a ton of attractive features designed for TikTok users. Would we recommend it to you? Yes, definitely, but with some caveats.</p>
<ul>
<li>Split function: This is similar to trimming where you have to separate the clip in order to define your desired part of the clip. Your clip can be further extended after splitting, so it’s just a process of simple trimming in editing.</li>
<li>Video overlay: This feature helps you place a video on another video. Those who do this often are those who have reaction channels, online teachers and gamers. This feature helps the viewers to simultaneously comprehend explanations the main video content alongside the reaction or explanation.</li>
<li>Speed control: This feature aids speed ramping. You can slow down your video and increase the speed just as you want. One thing to have in mind is when you plan to edit such a video, you have to shoot in a high resolution and high frame rate like 30-60fps so as to avoid the amateurish look.</li>
<li>Reverse video: The reverse feature helps you to rewind your clip to create the effect you have pictured in your mind while shooting.</li>
<li>Music library: CapCut comes with an impressive collection of royalty-free music and sound effects that can really make a huge difference to your videos. The tracks have a high quality and you can effortlessly insert them into your video to create the feel you desire.</li>
<li>Filters: Choose from various filters to soften or sharpen your videos and make them more professional-looking. There are color-based and season-based filters, as well as a range of beautification tools to enhance video quality. Filters can also be used effectively if you have multiple clips that have color variations or different contrast and brightness levels. Since you can’t edit most of these in CapCut, you can avoid having to use a desktop editor by choosing the right filters and applying them to all your clips to bring some uniformity.</li>
<li>Effects: There’s a collection of effects you can select from to appeal to the visual cravings of your audience. This will add colour to your content as it makes your viewers involved in the video. These effects include split-screen, retro, comic, party, dreamy, and so on. These effects will make your video look fresh and professionally edited.</li>
<li>Stickers and text: Stickers could be fun to use due to their expressive nature. Your choice as a content creator will go a long way in determining the fascination of your content. CapCut has therefore had you covered when it comes to adding fun features to your content to make it more interactive and exciting. Stickers and texts are therefore engaging tools you can employ to drive the fantasy of your audience.

You can make your video captivating by adding features such as filters, stickers, speed changes, background music, effects, split, reverse and more to make your wonderful moments more polished and professional.</p>
<p>FEATURES</p>
<p>After reviewing both versions (Android and iOS) of CapCut, we found that the app is indeed easy to use and includes a ton of attractive features designed for TikTok users. Would we recommend it to you? Yes, definitely, but with some caveats.</p>
<ul>
<li>Split function: This is similar to trimming where you have to separate the clip in order to define your desired part of the clip. Your clip can be further extended after splitting, so it’s just a process of simple trimming in editing.</li>
<li>Video overlay: This feature helps you place a video on another video. Those who do this often are those who have reaction channels, online teachers and gamers. This feature helps the viewers to simultaneously comprehend explanations the main video content alongside the reaction or explanation.</li>
<li>Speed control: This feature aids speed ramping. You can slow down your video and increase the speed just as you want. One thing to have in mind is when you plan to edit such a video, you have to shoot in a high resolution and high frame rate like 30-60fps so as to avoid the amateurish look.</li>
<li>Reverse video: The reverse feature helps you to rewind your clip to create the effect you have pictured in your mind while shooting.</li>
<li>Music library: CapCut comes with an impressive collection of royalty-free music and sound effects that can really make a huge difference to your videos. The tracks have a high quality and you can effortlessly insert them into your video to create the feel you desire.</li>
<li>Filters: Choose from various filters to soften or sharpen your videos and make them more professional-looking. There are color-based and season-based filters, as well as a range of beautification tools to enhance video quality. Filters can also be used effectively if you have multiple clips that have color variations or different contrast and brightness levels. Since you can’t edit most of these in CapCut, you can avoid having to use a desktop editor by choosing the right filters and applying them to all your clips to bring some uniformity.</li>
<li>Effects: There’s a collection of effects you can select from to appeal to the visual cravings of your audience. This will add colour to your content as it makes your viewers involved in the video. These effects include split-screen, retro, comic, party, dreamy, and so on. These effects will make your video look fresh and professionally edited.</li>
<li>Stickers and text: Stickers could be fun to use due to their expressive nature. Your choice as a content creator will go a long way in determining the fascination of your content. CapCut has therefore had you covered when it comes to adding fun features to your content to make it more interactive and exciting. Stickers and texts are therefore engaging tools you can employ to drive the fantasy of your audience. Also, it creates room for more details to be added without necessarily having to introduce more audio contents especially. With this feature, you can literally do more with less using CapCut.</li>

<p>FEATURES</p>
<p>After reviewing both versions (Android and iOS) of CapCut, we found that the app is indeed easy to use and includes a ton of attractive features designed for TikTok users. Would we recommend it to you? Yes, definitely, but with some caveats.</p>
<ul>
<li>Split function: This is similar to trimming where you have to separate the clip in order to define your desired part of the clip. Your clip can be further extended after splitting, so it’s just a process of simple trimming in editing.</li>
<li>Video overlay: This feature helps you place a video on another video. Those who do this often are those who have reaction channels, online teachers and gamers. This feature helps the viewers to simultaneously comprehend explanations the main video content alongside the reaction or explanation.</li>
<li>Speed control: This feature aids speed ramping. You can slow down your video and increase the speed just as you want. One thing to have in mind is when you plan to edit such a video, you have to shoot in a high resolution and high frame rate like 30-60fps so as to avoid the amateurish look.</li>
<li>Reverse video: The reverse feature helps you to rewind your clip to create the effect you have pictured in your mind while shooting.</li>
<li>Music library: CapCut comes with an impressive collection of royalty-free music and sound effects that can really make a huge difference to your videos. The tracks have a high quality and you can effortlessly insert them into your video to create the feel you desire.</li>
<li>Filters: Choose from various filters to soften or sharpen your videos and make them more professional-looking. There are color-based and season-based filters, as well as a range of beautification tools to enhance video quality. Filters can also be used effectively if you have multiple clips that have color variations or different contrast and brightness levels. Since you can’t edit most of these in CapCut, you can avoid having to use a desktop editor by choosing the right filters and applying them to all your clips to bring some uniformity.</li>
<li>Effects: There’s a collection of effects you can select from to appeal to the visual cravings of your audience. This will add colour to your content as it makes your viewers involved in the video. These effects include split-screen, retro, comic, party, dreamy, and so on. These effects will make your video look fresh and professionally edited.</li>
<li>Stickers and text: Stickers could be fun to use due to their expressive nature. Your choice as a content creator will go a long way in determining the fascination of your content. CapCut has therefore had you covered when it comes to adding fun features to your content to make it more interactive and exciting. Stickers and texts are therefore engaging tools you can employ to drive the fantasy of your audience. Also, it creates room for more details to be added without necessarily having to introduce more audio contents especially. With this feature, you can literally do more with less using CapCut.</li>

<h2 id="Capture-the-moment-and-Cut-3"><a href="#Capture-the-moment-and-Cut-3" class="headerlink" title="Capture the moment and Cut"></a>Capture the moment and Cut</h2><p>CapCut is a free all-in-one video editing app that helps you create amazing videos. It is a mobile app for iOS and Android devices which is easy to use in terms of creating your content. It makes your cutting, reversing and speed change easier than ever when you get it right to produce incredible results as you share on social media. You can make your video captivating by adding features such as filters, stickers, speed changes, background music, effects, split, reverse and more to make your wonderful moments more polished and professional.</p>
<p>FEATURES</p>
<p>After reviewing both versions (Android and iOS) of CapCut, we found that the app is indeed easy to use and includes a ton of attractive features designed for TikTok users. Would we recommend it to you? Yes, definitely, but with some caveats.</p>
<ul>
<li>Split function: This is similar to trimming where you have to separate the clip in order to define your desired part of the clip. Your clip can be further extended after splitting, so it’s just a process of simple trimming in editing.</li>
<li>Video overlay: This feature helps you place a video on another video. Those who do this often are those who have reaction channels, online teachers and gamers. This feature helps the viewers to simultaneously comprehend explanations the main video content alongside the reaction or explanation.</li>
<li>Speed control: This feature aids speed ramping. You can slow down your video and increase the speed just as you want. One thing to have in mind is when you plan to edit such a video, you have to shoot in a high resolution and high frame rate like 30-60fps so as to avoid the amateurish look.</li>
<li>Reverse video: The reverse feature helps you to rewind your clip to create the effect you have pictured in your mind while shooting.</li>
<li>Music library: CapCut comes with an impressive collection of royalty-free music and sound effects that can really make a huge difference to your videos. The tracks have a high quality and you can effortlessly insert them into your video to create the feel you desire.</li>
<li>Filters: Choose from various filters to soften or sharpen your videos and make them more professional-looking. There are color-based and season-based filters, as well as a range of beautification tools to enhance video quality. Filters can also be used effectively if you have multiple clips that have color variations or different contrast and brightness levels. Since you can’t edit most of these in CapCut, you can avoid having to use a desktop editor by choosing the right filters and applying them to all your clips to bring some uniformity.</li>
<li>Effects: There’s a collection of effects you can select from to appeal to the visual cravings of your audience. This will add colour to your content as it makes your viewers involved in the video. These effects include split-screen, retro, comic, party, dreamy, and so on. These effects will make your video look fresh and professionally edited.</li>
<li>Stickers and text: Stickers could be fun to use due to their expressive nature. Your choice as a content creator will go a long way in determining the fascination of your content. CapCut has therefore had you covered when it comes to adding fun features to your content to make it more interactive and exciting. Stickers and texts are therefore engaging tools you can employ to drive the fantasy of your audience. Also, it creates room for more details to be added without necessarily having to introduce more audio contents especially. With this feature, you can literally do more with less using CapCut.</li>

<p>At the same time, it is intriguing and always draws the audience’s attention. In this article, you will learn to shoot and edit the video for reverse effects using Filmora. But first, we will learn what does video reverse effect mean. So let us get into this!</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Video-Reverse-Effect"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Video-Reverse-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Video Reverse Effect?"></a>Part 1. What Is Video Reverse Effect?</h2><p>It is a special video effect in which a motion of things starts in the backward direction. This unique effect is used to intrigue the audience.</p>
<p>For example, if a bullet is fired from a gun. With the reverse effect, you can rewind the footage, and the shot goes back into the gun. So today, you can easily rewind fast action scenes and get a wow reaction from the audience.</p>
<h3 id="Famous-Examples-of-Reverse-Effect-in-Films"><a href="#Famous-Examples-of-Reverse-Effect-in-Films" class="headerlink" title="Famous Examples of Reverse Effect in Films"></a>Famous Examples of Reverse Effect in Films</h3><p><strong>1- Demolition of a Wall (1896)</strong></p>
<p>Filmmakers first used this striking effect in 1896 in a 90 seconds film, “Demolition of a wall.” Louis Lumiere was the one who made that video. Below is shown an image from the film.</p>

<p><strong>2- Tenet (2020)</strong></p>
<p>It is a viral film by Christopher Nolan, which was a great success. He explained the concept of reverse entropy, in which you start moving back chronologically in time instead of forward. This concept is all shown through this special video reverse effect. Unfortunately, the audience had difficulty digesting this unique concept, which generated an awful response.</p>

How To Shoot Video Reverse Effect?</h2><p>The reverse effect is unique, so special attention should be paid while filming a video. This section will cover some of the crucial prerequisites to film a video.</p>
<h3 id="Steady-Camera"><a href="#Steady-Camera" class="headerlink" title="Steady Camera"></a>Steady Camera</h3><p>It would be best to have your camera placed on a steady surface or mounted on a tripod stand to lock the focus. We will split the area and perform different tasks to make it look smooth. The audience will not get the idea that you completed the tasks separately. And it helps in the editing process as well.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<h3 id="A-Spacious-Area"><a href="#A-Spacious-Area" class="headerlink" title="A Spacious Area"></a>A Spacious Area</h3><p>You will need a spacious area in which you will perform different tasks. Make sure your camera stands still while shooting all the frames of video. In an ample space, it becomes easier to do movements freely. It also helps prevent glitches in the final product.</p>
<h3 id="Splitting-of-Area-into-Portions"><a href="#Splitting-of-Area-into-Portions" class="headerlink" title="Splitting of Area into Portions"></a>Splitting of Area into Portions</h3><p>Now you have to split your area into portions. Each task is in its part of the frame, and actions in one frame should not pass over into another. You will do one activity per portion. It makes the editing process a lot easier. Finally, we get all three videos to merge and make it look like a single video.</p>
