Although there are several QuickTime format files that you may come across and play across the platform, it only converts any video file into MOV format, which is the dedicated file format potentially designed by Apple. To understand the method to convert any QuickTime video format to MOV format, follow the steps shown below:</p>
<p>Step 1: You need to open the appropriate video across QuickTime to convert it accordingly. Once opened, tap on the “File” tab, and select “Export as” across the available options.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="access export as option"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: You need to select an appropriate resolution from the available options according to the video quality that you want the video to be saved in on the preceding menu. QuickTime player will show low-quality resolutions for the high-quality video but not vice versa.</p>

                      alt="choose video quality"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: A new window opens that requires you to set up the name and location for the video. Add the file extension “.mov” at the end of the name of the video to convert it into MOV format.</p>

Although there are several QuickTime format files that you may come across and play across the platform, it only converts any video file into MOV format, which is the dedicated file format potentially designed by Apple. To understand the method to convert any QuickTime video format to MOV format, follow the steps shown below:</p>
<p>Step 1: You need to open the appropriate video across QuickTime to convert it accordingly. Once opened, tap on the “File” tab, and select “Export as” across the available options.</p>

Two basic techniques can be implemented to play videos with QuickTime. The first method to play videos with QuickTime are featured as follows:</p>
<p>Step 1: You need to open QuickTime Player across your Mac. For that, proceed across Launchpad to access the application.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/guide-about-quicktime-player-1.jpg"
                      alt="select quicktime player"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Once the player is launched, you can simply select any video across the window that opens up. Once selected, tap “Open” to play it across QuickTime.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/guide-about-quicktime-player-2.jpg"
                      alt="tap on open button"
                ></p>
<p>Sounds easy, right? However, if you have multiple videos to open or have other video players installed in your Mac, you should consider following this second approach. If QuickTime Player is not your default video player, it is important to follow the steps below for opening any video across QuickTime.</p>
<p>Step 1: Open Finder on your device and proceed to locate the video that you wish to open across QuickTime. On finding the video, click on the video while holding the “Control” button on the keyboard. This opens a drop-down menu.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>Step 2: In the “Open With” section across the menu, you will find the option of QuickTime Player. Tap on the option to open the video across QuickTime.</p>

While the QuickTime video format allows you to play different videos across the platform, it also helps users record screens of their choice. To understand the step-by-step procedure, you need to follow the steps displayed below. Come along and learn more about it.</p>
<p>Step 1: Open QuickTime Player on your device and tap on the “File” tab on the top of the screen. Select the option of “New Screen Recording” from the available options to initiate screen recording.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>Step 2: The next window opens up, which involves managing the screen recording settings. You need to set up the screen area recorded in the process initially.</p>

<p>Step 3: After setting the screen area, tap on “Options” to specify the microphone settings, the location where the recording will be saved, the timer, and other significant options that are important for screen recording. Click on the “Record” button to start.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 4: Once you have recorded the appropriate screen, click on the “Stop” sign appearing on the top of the window to conclude recording and save it across the decided location.</p>

Although there are several QuickTime format files that you may come across and play across the platform, it only converts any video file into MOV format, which is the dedicated file format potentially designed by Apple. To understand the method to convert any QuickTime video format to MOV format, follow the steps shown below:</p>
<p>Step 1: You need to open the appropriate video across QuickTime to convert it accordingly. Once opened, tap on the “File” tab, and select “Export as” across the available options.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="access export as option"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: You need to select an appropriate resolution from the available options according to the video quality that you want the video to be saved in on the preceding menu. QuickTime player will show low-quality resolutions for the high-quality video but not vice versa.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="choose video quality"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: A new window opens that requires you to set up the name and location for the video. Add the file extension “.mov” at the end of the name of the video to convert it into MOV format.</p>

Of course, each artist’s ability differs, and so does art as well, but to start out, you do not need much. You need, though, careful planning and knowing the exact scale of your art.</p>
<p>You can break the creation of pixel art in Minecraft into four different steps:</p>
<h3 id="1-Choose-an-image-that-you-like-2"><a href="#1-Choose-an-image-that-you-like-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Choose an image that you like"></a>1. Choose an image that you like</h3><p>It is important that you reference the original work and can easily access it, as you might need to peek often while building your own art. The best thing to do is when you are starting to copy an image and work on it, rather than start it from scratch, as it takes an enormous amount of time and you need to be an expert to do it.</p>
<h3 id="2-Break-the-image-down-into-single-color-sections-2"><a href="#2-Break-the-image-down-into-single-color-sections-2" class="headerlink" title="2.

You need to be looking at your original piece constantly to know if you are going in the right direction. Also, take all the colors and try to group them. Deconstructing the original image into colored shapes is a process that will help you outline the shape and color of the original design.</p>
<h3 id="3-Obtain-the-necessary-resources-2"><a href="#3-Obtain-the-necessary-resources-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Obtain the necessary resources"></a>3. Obtain the necessary resources</h3><p>You can start this step by opening Minecraft and start collecting blocks that you think will be useful for your pixel art. It does not matter if you play in Survival, Hardcore, or Adventure mode. The process is the same. It is ideal, though, that you work on creative mode when making pixel art, as the game gives you unlimited resources. You are also able to fly in this mode, making it easier to pick up blocks, and there is no risk of your art being destroyed.</p>
<h3 id="4-Start-building-2"><a href="#4-Start-building-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Start building"></a>4. Start building</h3><p>Now you can start building your masterpiece.
