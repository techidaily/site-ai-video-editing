The mask is the portion of the video you’ve chosen to pick, either with a template or a custom frame. The mask then becomes isolated, and you may modify it as desired to produce your intended effect.</p>
<p>Masks may be used to do some fantastic things with your videos.

<h3 id="Different-types-of-masking-1"><a href="#Different-types-of-masking-1" class="headerlink" title="Different types of masking"></a>Different types of masking</h3><p>There are three primary types of masking: rotoscoping, chroma-keying, and motion tracking.</p>
<p>Rotoscoping: Rotoscoping is the process of manually tracing an object in a video frame by frame to create a mask. This can be a time-consuming process, but it allows for very precise control over the masked area.</p>
<p>Chroma-keying: Chroma-keying is a type of masking that makes use of color to isolate a particular area of the frame. For example, this is often used to remove a green or blue screen from the footage, but can also be used to isolate other colors.</p>
<p>Motion tracking: Motion tracking is a masking technique that allows you to track the movement of an object in a video clip. This is often used to add special effects, such as explosions, to a video.</p>

<p>To get started, simply drag and drop your MOV file onto the interface of Filmora. Alternatively, click on the “Import” button in the upper left corner to browse and load the MOV file from your hard drive or external storage device. A third option is to right-click on the video in the media library and choose “Import Media Files” from the drop-down menu. This will open up a new window where you can select your desired video file.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mov-to-gif-converters-9.jpg"
                      alt="import media files in wondershare filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Now that you have successfully imported your MOV file into Filmora, let’s look at how to proceed with making a GIF out of it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Trim to shorten the video</strong></p>
<p>Next, you will need to trim the video. This is optional, but important if you want to make a GIF from a video. A longer video means a bigger file size and an increased loading time for your final GIF, so try to keep it as short as possible!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mov-to-gif-converters-10.jpg"
                      alt="trim the video in wondershare filmora"
                ></p>
<p>To trim your video, add another start and endpoint by clicking on the scissors icon below. You can also put them in manually by typing in the time (in seconds) into the box provided.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Export as GIF</strong></p>
<p>Click on the Export button to open up the Export dialog box. From here, you can choose how you want your file exported from a number of options including GIF under the Formats tab. Under the Video tab, select the video quality settings that best suit your requirements. You can also set the frame rate and resolution for your GIF image file at this point. Once you are done, click on Save to specify a location for your file as well as a name for it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="export mov to gif in wondershare filmora"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Save the GIF file</strong></p>
<p>Click “Convert” to start the MOV to GIF conversion.</p>
<p>When it’s done, click “Open Folder”, and you’ll see the generated GIF file there, which could be shared with others via social platforms such as Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook directly or used for other purposes.</p>

<p>To get started, simply drag and drop your MOV file onto the interface of Filmora. Alternatively, click on the “Import” button in the upper left corner to browse and load the MOV file from your hard drive or external storage device. A third option is to right-click on the video in the media library and choose “Import Media Files” from the drop-down menu. This will open up a new window where you can select your desired video file.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="import media files in wondershare filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Now that you have successfully imported your MOV file into Filmora, let’s look at how to proceed with making a GIF out of it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Trim to shorten the video</strong></p>
<p>Next, you will need to trim the video. This is optional, but important if you want to make a GIF from a video. A longer video means a bigger file size and an increased loading time for your final GIF, so try to keep it as short as possible!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="trim the video in wondershare filmora"
                ></p>
<p>To trim your video, add another start and endpoint by clicking on the scissors icon below. You can also put them in manually by typing in the time (in seconds) into the box provided.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Export as GIF</strong></p>
<p>Click on the Export button to open up the Export dialog box. From here, you can choose how you want your file exported from a number of options including GIF under the Formats tab. Under the Video tab, select the video quality settings that best suit your requirements. You can also set the frame rate and resolution for your GIF image file at this point. Once you are done, click on Save to specify a location for your file as well as a name for it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="export mov to gif in wondershare filmora"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Save the GIF file</strong></p>
<p>Click “Convert” to start the MOV to GIF conversion.</p>
<p>When it’s done, click “Open Folder”, and you’ll see the generated GIF file there, which could be shared with others via social platforms such as Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook directly or used for other purposes.</p>

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid GoPro Video Editor?</em></strong></p>
<p>You can choose free or paid softwares depending on your requirements and budget. If a free software meets your requirements then stay on it otherwise move towards a paid alternative. If you have a GoPro and you make videos just for fun then use a free and simple video editor. Even if you are an experienced video editor, I would recommend you to go for free video editors which I have mentioned above as they are quite powerful and professional software but if you are harvesting a good amount of money from this field then you can upgrade to pro versions of these free softwares or get a paid software from start. As almost all of these softwares are professional and can get your job done, so it’s better to choose one, which is comfortable for you to work on.</p>

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid GoPro Video Editor?</em></strong></p>
<p>You can choose free or paid softwares depending on your requirements and budget. If a free software meets your requirements then stay on it otherwise move towards a paid alternative. If you have a GoPro and you make videos just for fun then use a free and simple video editor. Even if you are an experienced video editor, I would recommend you to go for free video editors which I have mentioned above as they are quite powerful and professional software but if you are harvesting a good amount of money from this field then you can upgrade to pro versions of these free softwares or get a paid software from start. As almost all of these softwares are professional and can get your job done, so it’s better to choose one, which is comfortable for you to work on.</p>

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid GoPro Video Editor?</em></strong></p>
<p>You can choose free or paid softwares depending on your requirements and budget. If a free software meets your requirements then stay on it otherwise move towards a paid alternative. If you have a GoPro and you make videos just for fun then use a free and simple video editor. Even if you are an experienced video editor, I would recommend you to go for free video editors which I have mentioned above as they are quite powerful and professional software but if you are harvesting a good amount of money from this field then you can upgrade to pro versions of these free softwares or get a paid software from start. As almost all of these softwares are professional and can get your job done, so it’s better to choose one, which is comfortable for you to work on.</p>

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid GoPro Video Editor?</em></strong></p>
<p>You can choose free or paid softwares depending on your requirements and budget. If a free software meets your requirements then stay on it otherwise move towards a paid alternative. If you have a GoPro and you make videos just for fun then use a free and simple video editor. Even if you are an experienced video editor, I would recommend you to go for free video editors which I have mentioned above as they are quite powerful and professional software but if you are harvesting a good amount of money from this field then you can upgrade to pro versions of these free softwares or get a paid software from start. As almost all of these softwares are professional and can get your job done, so it’s better to choose one, which is comfortable for you to work on.</p>
<p>FAQs about GoPro Video Editing:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) Does GoPro has its own video editor?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, GoPro has its own video editor “Quik”. It is available on mobile phones and desktops both. It is simple and easy to use. It provides basic features to edit your video. But the main disadvantage of this desktop software is that it supports only GoPro videos, you can’t import files from other devices. Although this isn’t the issue with Quik mobile app, here you can import videos from other devices also.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) Can I make videos for social media with a GoPro?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>It was basically made for recording sports and action videos. But as the market is revolutionized and new models are released it has covered a wide range of the video industry like vlogging, travel and cooking videos e.t.c. As new models of GoPros are waterproof, you can get some amazing underwater shots for your Instagram.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) What is GoPro media format?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>GoPro export files in popular file format MP4. MP4 is the most common file format and is supported by almost all the video editors. While it is efficient and takes less storage but isn’t supported in many devices.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) How do I transfer files from my GoPro to Mac?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p> You can transfer your GoPro files through 3 methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eject the SD card from your GoPro and connect it to your Mac using a SD card adapter to transfer files.</li>
<li>Connect your GoPro to Mac through USB connector and use “iphoto” or any other photo importer to import files.</li>
</ul>
