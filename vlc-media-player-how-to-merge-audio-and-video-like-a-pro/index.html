This technique gives your videos some cinematic impression by painting over them.</p>
<p>With color grading, you can adjust your video’s color balance, saturation, contrast, luminance, black level, etc. It helps to evoke the particular emotions or moods that you want your videos to exude.</p>

<h4 id="1-Does-LumaFusion-Have-Color-Grading"><a href="#1-Does-LumaFusion-Have-Color-Grading" class="headerlink" title="1. Does LumaFusion Have Color Grading?"></a>1. Does LumaFusion Have Color Grading?</h4><p>In answering this question, it’s essential to understand the difference between color correction and color grading. Both editing techniques have vital differentiating characteristics, so it’s wrong to use them interchangeably.</p>
<p>Color correction ensures that videos look as natural to the human eye as possible. If there’s a technical color error, for example, due to bad lighting, color correction helps fix that.</p>
<p>However, the aim of color grading isn’t fixing color mistakes but using colors to convey a mood, atmosphere, or style. Some videographers classify color correction as the first phase in the color grading process.</p>
<p>Generally, you can use LumaFusion to color correct your footage. However, you can’t color grade with the app except you decide to tamper with the color presets tab’s color sliders. Even at that, you wouldn’t get the perfect results you want.</p>
<p>Fortunately, LumaFusion allows you to import and apply LUT (look-up tables). With LumaFusion LUTs, you can color grade your footage to your satisfaction.</p>

Color correction ensures that your video doesn’t remain flat or unexciting.</p>
<p>○ Create Your LUTs</p>
<p>LUT allows you to save specific color grades to use anytime you need them. This helps to save time by ensuring that you don’t develop color spaces all over again when working on various footage. You can also download as many free LUTs as you like.</p>
<p>○ Bring In a LUT</p>
<p>After creating LUTs, import and apply them to your LumaFusion. Next, blend or adjust your LUt by shifting the slider to get your desired effects. It’s that simple!</p>

<p>Here’s how t go o about it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Apply your first LUT</li>
<li>Export the LUT</li>
<li>Access rendered movies</li>
<li>Apply the second LUT</li>
</ol>
<p>There is numerous manipulation you can do with LUT. For example, you can merge two or more LUTs into one.</p>

This technique gives your videos some cinematic impression by painting over them.</p>
<p>With color grading, you can adjust your video’s color balance, saturation, contrast, luminance, black level, etc. It helps to evoke the particular emotions or moods that you want your videos to exude.</p>
<p>These are the essential things to note about color grading in LumaFusion:</p>

Does LumaFusion Have Color Grading?</h4><p>In answering this question, it’s essential to understand the difference between color correction and color grading. Both editing techniques have vital differentiating characteristics, so it’s wrong to use them interchangeably.</p>
<p>Color correction ensures that videos look as natural to the human eye as possible. If there’s a technical color error, for example, due to bad lighting, color correction helps fix that.</p>
<p>However, the aim of color grading isn’t fixing color mistakes but using colors to convey a mood, atmosphere, or style. Some videographers classify color correction as the first phase in the color grading process.</p>
<p>Generally, you can use LumaFusion to color correct your footage. However, you can’t color grade with the app except you decide to tamper with the color presets tab’s color sliders. Even at that, you wouldn’t get the perfect results you want.</p>
<p>Fortunately, LumaFusion allows you to import and apply LUT (look-up tables). With LumaFusion LUTs, you can color grade your footage to your satisfaction.</p>

Color correction ensures that your video doesn’t remain flat or unexciting.</p>
<p>○ Create Your LUTs</p>
<p>LUT allows you to save specific color grades to use anytime you need them. This helps to save time by ensuring that you don’t develop color spaces all over again when working on various footage. You can also download as many free LUTs as you like.</p>
<p>○ Bring In a LUT</p>
<p>After creating LUTs, import and apply them to your LumaFusion. Next, blend or adjust your LUt by shifting the slider to get your desired effects. It’s that simple!</p>

Can I Use Multiple LUTs in LumaFusion?</h4><p>The short answer is a big YES. You can apply multiple LUTs in LumaFusion.</p>
<p>Here’s how t go o about it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Apply your first LUT</li>
<li>Export the LUT</li>
<li>Access rendered movies</li>
<li>Apply the second LUT</li>
</ol>

If yes, you are familiar with discord nitro and all the advantages that come with it. And if you are not a user, you probably are confused about discord Nitro. Let’s start with basic information on discord nitro and its use. Discord Nitro is the genre version of discord with multiple features, making it a worthy option. It enhances your experience with discord voice, text, video, and most importantly, creating profile pictures.</p>
<p>The Nitro version promotes <strong>animated discord profile pics.</strong> It is a great option but, what do you do when you can’t afford it? Is it still possible to get <strong>cool animated discord profile pics?</strong> Yes. You can comfortably get a <strong>profile discord GIF</strong> without Discord Nitro. And you are lucky since this section will cover this necessary topic.</p>
<p>Of course, we have to thank content writer Ubaid Ullah for the article on how to get Discord GIF profile without nitro. After all, it is one of our reference points.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Create a GIF or download one that meets your taste from different websites. Currently, we have many sites offering free GIFs; hence you don’t have to worry about copyright issues. Some top websites to consider are Giphy, Gifer, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Look for a site that can translate a GIF document to the APNG file. Don’t worry about this step since you can always google the top options. We currently have the ezgif site but technology changes every day; hence you can expect rising websites.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Let’s use the ezgif website. Upon accessing it, ensure that you settle for the APNG maker icon. It is on the top left of the website.</p>

                      alt="how to get discord gif profile pic"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Check on the Crossfade Frames option. Note that you need to choose images with at most thirty frames. Finally, click on the Make APNG option</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Download the final file and save it on your PC with the name you wish</p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Upload on Discord</p>
<p><strong>Important things to note when uploading GIFs on Discord</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Discord only allows a file that is at least 8MBs. So, if yours isn’t, you can compress it via different websites.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A gif with nitro is neater, but a GIF without nitro works better than having an image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Even without discord Nitro, you still have access to the <strong>cool animated discord profile pics if you have a discord server.</strong> Suppose you have an <strong>animated discord profile</strong>, and then we can only see one frame without discord nitro.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Create a GIF or download one that meets your taste from different websites. Currently, we have many sites offering free GIFs; hence you don’t have to worry about copyright issues. Some top websites to consider are Giphy, Gifer, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Look for a site that can translate a GIF document to the APNG file. Don’t worry about this step since you can always google the top options. We currently have the ezgif site but technology changes every day; hence you can expect rising websites.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Let’s use the ezgif website. Upon accessing it, ensure that you settle for the APNG maker icon. It is on the top left of the website.</p>

<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Upload on Discord</p>
<p><strong>Important things to note when uploading GIFs on Discord</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Discord only allows a file that is at least 8MBs. So, if yours isn’t, you can compress it via different websites.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A gif with nitro is neater, but a GIF without nitro works better than having an image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Even without discord Nitro, you still have access to the <strong>cool animated discord profile pics if you have a discord server.</strong> Suppose you have an <strong>animated discord profile</strong>, and then we can only see one frame without discord nitro.</p>

<h2 id="6-Best-Methods-to-Make-a-Video-Longer"><a href="#6-Best-Methods-to-Make-a-Video-Longer" class="headerlink" title="6 Best Methods to Make a Video Longer"></a>6 Best Methods to Make a Video Longer</h2><p>These days when you head on to social media, you can easily find 4-5 seconds video clips on the internet. However, many social media platforms like YouTube, Instagram, and other videos sharing platforms require you to make your video longer to meet the site’s minimum length requirements. So, for example, although Instagram’s minimum length is 3 seconds, you might want to find ways to engage your audience longer.</p>
<p>This article will describe the best ways to make a video longer. We’ll also offer a bonus tip on how you can edit your video to make it look better and attract more audience. On that note, let’s take a look.</p>
<p><strong>6 Best Methods to Make a Video Longer</strong></p>
<p>There are many methods out there to make your video longer. This section will touch on the six best methods to make a video longer.</p>
<p><strong>Loop the Video</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/make-video-longer-1.jpg"
                      alt="make-video-longer-"
                ></p>
<p>One of the best ways to make your video longer for most social media platforms is to loop the video. When you replay the video several times in a single row, it helps to multiply its length. An example is taking a 2-second video and looping it 4x. This automatically makes it into an 8-second video clip. With looping, you can simply replay the action of the clip rather than altering it in any way.</p>
<p>Many video editing software today allows you to loop your video for free. You have to upload the video and choose how many times you would like to loop it, and the software will get to work.</p>
<p><strong>Slow Down the Video Speed</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/make-video-longer-2.jpg"
                      alt="make-video-longer-"
                ></p>
<p>We would all agree that slow-motion makes everything seem longer automatically. You can utilize the same technique when you want to make a video longer. When you slow down a video clip, every second lasts longer. Using the slow-motion effect on a 3-second video will make the video 6 or even 9 seconds longer.</p>
<p><strong>Add an Intro and Outro</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/make-video-longer-3.jpg"
                      alt="make-video-longer-"
                ></p>
<p>Intro and outro are scenes you add before and after the video; these scenes are popular in YouTube videos. More generally, an intro is like a trailer. It shows the audience what the video is about, and the outro scene is usually used to show more information about the video maker. Adding an intro and outro to your video can add 2-4 seconds to your video clips.</p>
<p>It’s quite easy to add an intro and outro to any video. You can create them separately and then merge them with your video. The intro must be something relevant to the video clip; an example is adding a fast photo slideshow to the beginning of your video or a black frame. Relevant intro and outro scenes will make your video longer and maybe more engaging.</p>
<p><strong>Add Images to the Video</strong></p>
<p>This is another trick that most bloggers use to make their videos longer. It is an old trick in the book and makes your video significantly longer, depending on the number of videos you’re adding. A single picture can add a second or two to your video. You can simply use a video editor to merge the video clip and pictures into one seamless file.</p>
<p><strong>Boomerang Your Video</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/make-video-longer-4.jpg"
                      alt="make-video-longer-"
                ></p>
<p>If you have plans to upload your media to Instagram, then a top feature you can use to make your video longer is the boomerang feature. Instagram introduced the Boomerang feature to play short video clips forward and then repeat their reverse. So by using the Boomerang feature, you don’t only add a memory effect to your video, but you also make your video longer.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can manually append your video clip to a reversed version; this option allows you to make a boomerang from an existing clip. Apart from Instagram, you can utilize many other editing tools to create a boomerang from an existing video.</p>
<p><strong>Add More Content to Your Video Clip</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/make-video-longer-5.jpg"
                      alt="make-video-longer-"
                ></p>
<p>Another step you can take is to add more materials to your video. This doesn’t necessarily mean you have to get your camera out and start shooting more scenes to add to your video. Instead, you can simply access online media libraries and get amazing materials from there that are relevant to your video clip.</p>
<p>Today, most professional video editors offer you access to royalty-free photos and music material. You can simply browse through their collections and pick materials relevant to your video. For example, you could add a soundtrack and videos or GIFs that make your videos engaging. Adding extra content to your video clip can make it longer by 10 seconds.</p>

<p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>
<p>Social media platforms are great for gaining recognition and promoting your brand. However, there are times when you don’t meet the right video length, and you would like to make your video longer. With the six methods explained above, you can make your video as long as you want and also make your video more engaging. Additionally, you can use Wondershare Filmora to make your video more professional-looking. It offers you hundreds of effects and filters you can use to optimize your video.</p>
<p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> If your video is short and you need to make it longer, this article gives you six methods to make a video longer and optimize them.</p>
<p>One of the best ways to make your video longer for most social media platforms is to loop the video. When you replay the video several times in a single row, it helps to multiply its length. An example is taking a 2-second video and looping it 4x. This automatically makes it into an 8-second video clip. With looping, you can simply replay the action of the clip rather than altering it in any way.</p>
<p>Many video editing software today allows you to loop your video for free. You have to upload the video and choose how many times you would like to loop it, and the software will get to work.</p>
<p><strong>Slow Down the Video Speed</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="make-video-longer-"
                ></p>
<p>We would all agree that slow-motion makes everything seem longer automatically. You can utilize the same technique when you want to make a video longer. When you slow down a video clip, every second lasts longer. Using the slow-motion effect on a 3-second video will make the video 6 or even 9 seconds longer.</p>
<p><strong>Add an Intro and Outro</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="make-video-longer-"
                ></p>
<p>Intro and outro are scenes you add before and after the video; these scenes are popular in YouTube videos. More generally, an intro is like a trailer. It shows the audience what the video is about, and the outro scene is usually used to show more information about the video maker. Adding an intro and outro to your video can add 2-4 seconds to your video clips.</p>
<p>It’s quite easy to add an intro and outro to any video. You can create them separately and then merge them with your video. The intro must be something relevant to the video clip; an example is adding a fast photo slideshow to the beginning of your video or a black frame. Relevant intro and outro scenes will make your video longer and maybe more engaging.</p>
<p><strong>Add Images to the Video</strong></p>
<p>This is another trick that most bloggers use to make their videos longer. It is an old trick in the book and makes your video significantly longer, depending on the number of videos you’re adding. A single picture can add a second or two to your video. You can simply use a video editor to merge the video clip and pictures into one seamless file.</p>
<p><strong>Boomerang Your Video</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
