<p>Step 2: Right-click on the video.</p>
<p>Step 3: Select ‘Rotate 90 CW’ or click Ctrl + Alt + Right to rotate the video 90 degrees clockwise.</p>

<p>Step 4: Select ‘Rotate 90 CCW’ or click Ctrl + Alt + Left to rotate the video 90 degrees counterclockwise.</p>
<p>Step 5: Repeat the steps until you are satisfied. Note: It can only rotate the video in the degrees of multiples of 90.</p>
<p>Step 6: The video is now rotated.</p>
<p>Filmora’s rotate filter is very similar to Kdenlive’s. However, there are a few differences. For example…</p>
<p>- you can use the rotate filter on clips that are already rotated</p>
<p>- you can change the rotation orientation of your clip.</p>
<p>If you need to rotate your video clip in a different direction, or if you want to create a 360-degree rotation, follow the below steps:</p>
<p>Click on the ‘Edit’ option in the tool above the timeline.</p>

                ></p>
<p>The rotate filter is a great way to quickly rotate your video clip. However, it does have some limitations. For example, you can’t…</p>
<p>- use the rotate filter on clips that are already rotated</p>
<p>- use the rotate filter to create a 360-degree rotation</p>
<p>- change the rotation orientation of your clip.</p>
<p>If you need to rotate your video clip in a different direction, or if you want to create a 360-degree rotation, you can change the project settings. The rotate filter can be used to rotate your video clip in 90-degree increments. If you need to rotate your video clip by a different amount, you can change the project settings. To change the project settings…</p>

The rotate filter is a video effect that allows you to rotate your video clip around its vertical and horizontal axes.</p>
<p>To apply the rotate filter…</p>
<p>Step 1: Import your video clip into Filmora.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-kdenlive-11.png"
                      alt="rotate-video-kdenlive"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Right-click on the video.</p>
<p>Step 3: Select ‘Rotate 90 CW’ or click Ctrl + Alt + Right to rotate the video 90 degrees clockwise.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-kdenlive-12.png"
                      alt="rotate-video-kdenlive"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4: Select ‘Rotate 90 CCW’ or click Ctrl + Alt + Left to rotate the video 90 degrees counterclockwise.</p>
<p>Step 5: Repeat the steps until you are satisfied. Note: It can only rotate the video in the degrees of multiples of 90.</p>
<p>Step 6: The video is now rotated.</p>
<p>Filmora’s rotate filter is very similar to Kdenlive’s. However, there are a few differences. For example…</p>
<p>- you can use the rotate filter on clips that are already rotated</p>
<p>- you can change the rotation orientation of your clip.</p>
<p>If you need to rotate your video clip in a different direction, or if you want to create a 360-degree rotation, follow the below steps:</p>
<p>Click on the ‘Edit’ option in the tool above the timeline.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="rotate-video-kdenlive"
                ></p>
<p>Select the ‘Transform’ option, then go to ‘Rotate’</p>

                      alt="rotate-video-kdenlive"
                ></p>
<p>Use the slider to set the amount of rotation you need.</p>

                      alt="rotate-video-kdenlive"
                ></p>
<p>The project settings allow you to rotate your video clip in any direction you need.</p>
<p>Both Filmora and Kdenlive offer a rotate filter that allows you to rotate your video clip by a certain amount. However, only Filmora offers the ability to rotate your video clip in any direction you need. Additionally, Filmora offers a wide range of features that can be used to create professional-quality videos. If you need to rotate your video clip in a different direction, or if you want to create a 360-degree rotation, Filmora is the best option.</p>

                      alt="download and install filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2</p>
<p>After installing, the editor will start automatically. When it does, click on the <strong>“New Project”</strong> button to finally open the editor.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/filmora-video-editor.png"
                      alt="filmora video editor"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3</p>
<p>From the upper-left side of the screen, click the highlighted text to import media. This is where you insert your video files into the editor. Once the folder opens, select the videos you want to import and click “<strong>Open”.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="import media and open"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4</p>
<p>Drag your first clip to the timeline. Then, move the Playhead to where you want to start your transition.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="drag clip to timeline in filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5</p>
<p>Take a snapshot of this frame.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/take-snapshot-in-filmora.png"
                      alt="take snapshot in filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 6</p>
<p>Split the footage and delete the part on the right side of the Playhead.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="split footage in filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 7</p>
<p>Without moving the Playhead, simply drag the snapshot you took earlier. Right-click on the snapshot in the timeline and click on “<strong>Duration”.</strong> Then, set the duration to <strong>1 second</strong>. Finally, click “<strong>OK</strong>”.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-snapshot-duration-filmora.png"
                      alt="change snapshot duration filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 8</p>
<p>Open your browser and go to the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://picsart.com/photo-effects/photo-to-cartoon" >Picsart photo effects editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Upload the same snapshot we made in Filmora and apply the “Comic” preset on it. Then, download the photo and import it back into Filmora.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/comic-preset-picsart.png"
                      alt="comic preset picsart"
                ></p>
<p>Step 9</p>
<p>Drag the snapshot with the Comic preset to the Timeline and set its duration to 1 second as well.</p>
<p>Step 10</p>
<p>Repeat the same process with the second clip. Take a snapshot, add the Comic effect, and import it back into Filmora. But this time, align the clips as follows: Add the snapshot with the comic preset first, then the snapshot without any effects, and then the video. It should look like this.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/second-clip.png"
                      alt="second clip"
                ></p>
<p>Step 11</p>
<p>Go to the Transitions tab and drag the “Color Distance” transition between the first and second snapshot on your Timeline. Then, right-click on the transition box in the timeline and select “<strong>Edit Properties</strong>”. From there, change the duration of the transition to 1 second and click “<strong>OK</strong>”.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="transition in filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 12</p>
<p>Drag the “<strong>Push</strong>” transition between the next two snapshots. Set its duration to 1 second as well by right clicking the transition and going to “Edit Properties”.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="push transition in filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 13</p>
<p>Place the last transition between the last two snapshots in your timeline. This time, we’re going to use the “<strong>Evaporate</strong>” transition. Set its duration to 1 second as well.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="evaporate transition filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 14</p>
<p>The final step is to render the video. Click this button and you will finally be done.</p>

<p>Step 9</p>
<p>Drag the snapshot with the Comic preset to the Timeline and set its duration to 1 second as well.</p>
<p>Step 10</p>
<p>Repeat the same process with the second clip. Take a snapshot, add the Comic effect, and import it back into Filmora. But this time, align the clips as follows: Add the snapshot with the comic preset first, then the snapshot without any effects, and then the video. It should look like this.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 13</p>
<p>Place the last transition between the last two snapshots in your timeline. This time, we’re going to use the “<strong>Evaporate</strong>” transition. Set its duration to 1 second as well.</p>

Talking of the most recent add-ons to the already long list of utilities, storyboards have emerged as a revolution in the field of motion graphic customization and design.</p>
<p>Diving a bit deeper into understanding the credibility of storyboards, let us move ahead with having an insight of different aspects and elements of the same in the upcoming sections of this article:</p>
<p><strong>What is a Storyboard?</strong></p>
<p>Attempting to define a <strong>storyboard</strong>, you can regard the utility as a sequential setup of sketches, images, elements and illustrations that create a road map to address a video editing task. Dividing the entire process into a series of individual processes, the aforesaid facility caters to ease out the video creation task.</p>
<p>Moving ahead to draft a technical explanation of storyboards, they are a collection of chronologically arranged drawings, supplemented with video customization elements, such as dialogues, camera direction and other allied detailing. The fundamental merit of these visual arrangements lies in the sequential and scene unfolding of a video footage.</p>
<p>This in turn, works to simplify the film creation process, while ensuring the latter’s cohesiveness and facilitating the elimination of errors and inconsistencies. It is a common mistake to regard storyboards as a midway and optional utility, these trial and error representations are quite essential to ensure a flawless video output in the final stage of design. The facility works additionally to minimize unnecessary production delays, while significantly cutting down on the overall creation cost.</p>
<p>Having a visibility more or less similar to a comic strip, storyboards have a varying scale of design, ranging from being modestly simple to explicitly complex, in cohesion with the specific creation requirements. These visual scripts are mostly hand crafted, through there are a host of storyboard creation software packages and programs available in the IT design market, as well as across the web.</p>
<p>Extending our discussion a bit further, let us have a walk-through of the essential storyboard categories and types in what follows next:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Traditional Storyboards</strong></p>
<p>These are a logically placed sequence of hand crafted drawings in ink or pencil for representing the video filming chronology, prior to the start of the actual creation process. You can conveniently observe the sequential arrangement of your video elements through these storyboards by placing them at a suitable space, like your studio wall.</p>
<p>You are granted the liberty to add as much detailing to these drawings as you wish, while using them for filming either a single or a series of film shots. These easily editable storyboards are often supplemented with written text notes for describing the events of a specific scene.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Thumbnail Storyboards</strong></p>
<p>These are rather small storyboards, mostly of a postage stamp size, that depict a sequence of the video elements and scenes on separate paper pieces. Owing to their miniature size, these storyboards are relatively easier to craft, require a lesser creation time and have much fewer details in comparison to their traditional counterparts.</p>
<p>This category of storyboards comes credible in catering a quick jot down of video creation ideas, before you proceed to analyze each element in a more comprehensive manner through the traditional alternatives.</p>

While the utility works to define a sequential arrangement of shots and elements in a specific video scene, the real effort lies in converting a text centered movie or scene script into a storyboard. Talking of the ways to address this concern, let us discuss about these storyboard essentials in some detail in what follows next:</p>
<p><strong>What Comes First – Script or Storyboard?</strong></p>
<p>Before beginning to comment on the sequence of the aforesaid elements within a film production process, let us first proceed to have an understanding of the terms in a fundamental sense. A script is essentially a text based document that presents a cumulative picture of the video story by unveiling the latter’s storyline and theme. Storyboards on the other hand, are pictorial representations of sequentially arranged shots of the movie with a much more comprehensive detailing.</p>
<p>Going through the above definitions, the obvious and logical sequence of filming out a video is quite clear with scripts preceding the storyboards. Talking a bit on the credibility aspect of these video production stages, the film’s script caters to provide an elementary insight into some of the most essential visual commands. Crafting a storyboard on the other hand, is dedicated towards depicting a detailed follow through of each shot in line with the events described in the script.</p>
<p>Working towards a classic and professional video production task, hence demands a drafting of the latter’s script, which is then succeeded by crafting a storyboard. This facilitates a seamless and easy video creation process with lesser ambiguities. Having talked enough about scripts and storyboards, let us now move ahead with creating storyboards from a film script in the following section:</p>
<p><strong>User’s Guide to Transform a Script into a Storyboard</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Identify and Pen Down an Amazing Content Idea</strong></p>

<p><strong>Step 2: Let’s Start Storyboarding!</strong></p>
<p>Move ahead to planning the sequential placement of shots and scenes of the story in line with the script that you have just created. It is a great idea to pick an array of 4-6 movement shots for a particular scene, so that you can have a sufficient cell spacing to expand the detailing of shot elements. This further caters to a convenient and spatial arrangement of the cells on a standard sized paper.</p>
<p>You can now start to create your storyboard by adding labels to the scenes, penning down the directions, including the specific character dialogues and suitable images.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3: Prepare a Layout of Your Storyboards</strong></p>
<p>When you are done with adding all the elements of the script into the storyboard cells, proceed to lay them out in a specific pattern. This step comes quite handy in checking for the continuity and detailing accuracy of the depicted shots. You can further, improvise the elements if needed, or advance to the next step if everything seems fine.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4: Revise Your Craft</strong></p>

In an otherwise case however, you may need to make a revision of the crafted storyboard for a much more detailed and comprehensive observation. You can work to include an elusive paly of effects, lighting cues, background music and characters, camera motions, and a series of additional elements that seem to uplift your creation.</p>
<p>Paying attention to the aspect or revising your storyboards caters to a much more improvised and professionally sound presentation of your video production idea in front of the target audience.

<p><strong>How Can I Get Better at Storyboarding?</strong></p>
<p>Speaking in the light of film production assets and utilities, storyboarding is more of a creative art rather than a customary process or production stage. While it requires consistent effort and practice to master the craft, adhering to some handy tips and tricks can be of great help to improve your skills at creating expressive and finely detailed storyboards.</p>
<p>Heading towards sorting the aforesaid query, the following section presents a concise description of a few amazing and unique storyboard creation guidelines and tricks to present the storyboarding craft at its best:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Stop Aiming to Become a Perfectionist</strong></p>
<p>Considering the fact that you are crafting the storyboard just for the purpose of depicting a sequence of video shots, do not aim at defining every element in comprehensive detail. Instead of making a fresh attempt to depict every minor change, pay more attention towards highlighting the significant points of action within a particular scene.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Prefer Numbering the Storyboard Panels</strong></p>
<p>Since the storyboard you are creating works as a blueprint for the video creation team, it should be convenient to understand and navigate through. Presenting the cells of your storyboard in a numbered sequence tends to provide an easy follow through of the same to the rest of your viewers.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Explore Your Imagination</strong></p>
<p>Your storyboard happens to be the inaugural representation of your video production idea and script in front of the potential audience. You should hence, proceed with the latter’s crafting process while keeping a close reference with the drafted script. Also, it becomes greatly important to add the imaginative element to your creation to avoid creating an bland and customary impression on the audience.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Feedback Has a Great Importance</strong></p>
<p>Make sure to showcase your storyboard to your project investors, prior to beginning with the film creation process. This will aid you with an escape from the unnecessary changes that can pop out from the audience at the last minute, leading to an unwanted financial expense. Pay attention to gather and work on the feedback of the viewers and start the actual creation process only after everything seems to be well settled.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Enjoy Your Work</strong></p>
<p>Enjoying the different aspects of your work is the key to achieve mastery at your craft and a welcoming response from the audience. Accepted that the storyboarding process is mind straining and time consuming, but taking on the challenge with a fun centered attitude will let your hard work shine on in front of the viewers.</p>
<p><strong>Creating Storyboards with Wondershare Filmora</strong></p>

<p>Browsing through the heap of alternatives across the web and the IT market, you can conveniently choose to work with the Wondershare <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> to address the concern.

<p>When aiming to quickly address the concern of creating storyboards, picking up an online template is a better option in comparison to the traditional pencil and paper drawing. As of working with the web based alternatives, you can add sketches, scripts and notes within the storyboard cells to make them more impressive and detailed.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>What should be the ideal expanse of a storyboard?</strong></p>
<p>There is no hard and fast rule to decide the optimum number of cells or pages for your storyboard. The page count may have variations in line with the content and detailing of the scenes they are crafted to showcase.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Is it essential to include every shot within the storyboard?</strong></p>
<p>On a general note, every shot within your script does not require an inclusion within the storyboard. The answer to this query however, largely depends on the intensity of detailing you wish to add and the diversity of ideas and elements you want to incorporate within the storyboard of a specific film scene.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>What are the essentials of a good storyboard?</strong></p>
<p>When attempting to create a good storyboard, pay attention to the fluent transition of the text centered ideas into pictorial representations. Your video script should possess the right quantity of information to make anyone easily understand the content depiction without having a prior walk-through of your script. Abstain from creating an information overflow either, lest you would end up hiding away the relevant details.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>What are the major parts of a storyboard?</strong></p>
<p>A well-crafted storyboard comprises of 4 important elements. There are namely, the subject of the shot or scene, a suitable and cohesive background, a properly angled camera shot of the main character within the scene and a responsive camera movement.</p>
