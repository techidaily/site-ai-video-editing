<p>There are two ways to achieve this goal, one is manually through settings whereas the second way is using hotkeys. Let’s discuss both by understanding how to increase QuickTime player speed manually.</p>
<h3 id="Manually-Setting-Up-Quicktime-player-speed"><a href="#Manually-Setting-Up-Quicktime-player-speed" class="headerlink" title="Manually Setting Up Quicktime player speed"></a>Manually Setting Up Quicktime player speed</h3><ul>
<li>Open the Quicktime player installed on your computer.</li>
<li>Embedding video within the interface is recommended.</li>
<li>Go to the Toolbar and choose the Windows tab from the drop-down menu.</li>
<li>To access the A&#x2F;V controls, press the A&#x2F;V Controls button. There will be a dialogue box that appears.</li>
<li>Locate the Playback Speed option and adjust the speed of the movie by increasing or decreasing it.</li>

</ul>

<li>There isn’t a special hotkey for Quicktime that allows you to speed up or slow down the video. Using your mouse and keyboard, on the other hand, you may do the task in an instant.</li>
<li>Open the video in the Quicktime Player on your computer by clicking on it.</li>
<li>Play the video clip, and then hit the “OPTIONS” key on your keyboard to stop it.</li>
<li>Press the Fast Forward button on the player and the left mouse button at the same time. It will speed up the pace at which the video is played back.</li>

<ul>
<li><p>Increasing the speed is accomplished by repeatedly clicking until the desired speed is achieved.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li><p>If you come across anything you like and want to view it again, you may stop the video by pressing the space bar twice. However, pressing the spacebar will cause the playing speed to be reset.</p>

Verifying your QuickTime installation is the most obvious way to find out whether it has decoded all of the video files. Let’s investigate the issue to its root.</p>
<h3 id="Updating-Your-Quicktime-to-the-Latest-Version"><a href="#Updating-Your-Quicktime-to-the-Latest-Version" class="headerlink" title="Updating Your Quicktime to the Latest Version"></a>Updating Your Quicktime to the Latest Version</h3><p>The user must carefully study the QuickTime player. For some reason, your QuickTime behaviour is out of whack.</p>
<p>People often neglect to keep their QuickTime software up-to-date, which results in problems with video playback, such as no sound or stuttering, among many other things. To fix this issue, just download and install the most latest release of QuickTime player.</p>
<h3 id="Examine-the-System-and-Driver"><a href="#Examine-the-System-and-Driver" class="headerlink" title="Examine the System and Driver"></a>Examine the System and Driver</h3><p>Faulty speakers, audio issues in the system, and update failures will ultimately cause media playback difficulties.</p>
<p>To find the root cause, you should first check internally to see whether your speakers are working correctly. Speaking straight to Siri and hearing her reaction is the fastest and most straightforward option.</p>
<p>Another reason you may be hearing no sound on QuickTime is because of a recent system update. Apple, as we all know, often releases new operating systems, and you must keep track of the most current versions of updates in order to keep your system running effectively.</p>
<p>You just need to ensure that your machine is running the most recent version. As a result, your system will resume regular functioning, and QuickTime will be immediately fixed and restored.</p>
<h3 id="Inspect-if-the-File-is-Corrupted-or-not"><a href="#Inspect-if-the-File-is-Corrupted-or-not" class="headerlink" title="Inspect if the File is Corrupted or not"></a>Inspect if the File is Corrupted or not</h3><p>Checking the file to see whether it has been corrupted is a good idea regardless of whether QuickTime and your system are up and running. To make matters worse, the lack of sound in QuickTime will be the consequence of a corrupted video file.</p>
<p>Try opening the file in a different programme or player to see if the issue may be resolved. If this is the case, your source video file is either destroyed or corrupted. You may wish to consider regaining access to the file in this situation. The likelihood of your file being corrupted by malware or a virus is relatively high. Remember to be patient if this does happen to you.</p>
<p>It is necessary to use third-party repair programmes to successfully fix the file. Consequently, using third-party software to recover and restore the source file should be considered if you are in a situation where the source file is crucial and do not have a backup. As we’ll see, there are a number of options available, including Filmora.</p>

<li>Then select Audio from the dialogue box.</li>

Verifying your QuickTime installation is the most obvious way to find out whether it has decoded all of the video files. Let’s investigate the issue to its root.</p>

For some reason, your QuickTime behaviour is out of whack.</p>
<p>People often neglect to keep their QuickTime software up-to-date, which results in problems with video playback, such as no sound or stuttering, among many other things. To fix this issue, just download and install the most latest release of QuickTime player.</p>
<h3 id="Examine-the-System-and-Driver-1"><a href="#Examine-the-System-and-Driver-1" class="headerlink" title="Examine the System and Driver"></a>Examine the System and Driver</h3><p>Faulty speakers, audio issues in the system, and update failures will ultimately cause media playback difficulties.</p>
<p>To find the root cause, you should first check internally to see whether your speakers are working correctly. Speaking straight to Siri and hearing her reaction is the fastest and most straightforward option.</p>
<p>Another reason you may be hearing no sound on QuickTime is because of a recent system update. Apple, as we all know, often releases new operating systems, and you must keep track of the most current versions of updates in order to keep your system running effectively.</p>
<p>You just need to ensure that your machine is running the most recent version. As a result, your system will resume regular functioning, and QuickTime will be immediately fixed and restored.</p>

To make matters worse, the lack of sound in QuickTime will be the consequence of a corrupted video file.</p>
<p>Try opening the file in a different programme or player to see if the issue may be resolved. If this is the case, your source video file is either destroyed or corrupted. You may wish to consider regaining access to the file in this situation. The likelihood of your file being corrupted by malware or a virus is relatively high. Remember to be patient if this does happen to you.</p>
<p>It is necessary to use third-party repair programmes to successfully fix the file. Consequently, using third-party software to recover and restore the source file should be considered if you are in a situation where the source file is crucial and do not have a backup. As we’ll see, there are a number of options available, including Filmora.</p>

Verifying your QuickTime installation is the most obvious way to find out whether it has decoded all of the video files. Let’s investigate the issue to its root.</p>

For some reason, your QuickTime behaviour is out of whack.</p>
<p>People often neglect to keep their QuickTime software up-to-date, which results in problems with video playback, such as no sound or stuttering, among many other things. To fix this issue, just download and install the most latest release of QuickTime player.</p>
<h3 id="Examine-the-System-and-Driver-2"><a href="#Examine-the-System-and-Driver-2" class="headerlink" title="Examine the System and Driver"></a>Examine the System and Driver</h3><p>Faulty speakers, audio issues in the system, and update failures will ultimately cause media playback difficulties.</p>
<p>To find the root cause, you should first check internally to see whether your speakers are working correctly. Speaking straight to Siri and hearing her reaction is the fastest and most straightforward option.</p>
<p>Another reason you may be hearing no sound on QuickTime is because of a recent system update. Apple, as we all know, often releases new operating systems, and you must keep track of the most current versions of updates in order to keep your system running effectively.</p>
<p>You just need to ensure that your machine is running the most recent version. As a result, your system will resume regular functioning, and QuickTime will be immediately fixed and restored.</p>

To make matters worse, the lack of sound in QuickTime will be the consequence of a corrupted video file.</p>
<p>Try opening the file in a different programme or player to see if the issue may be resolved. If this is the case, your source video file is either destroyed or corrupted. You may wish to consider regaining access to the file in this situation. The likelihood of your file being corrupted by malware or a virus is relatively high. Remember to be patient if this does happen to you.</p>
<p>It is necessary to use third-party repair programmes to successfully fix the file. Consequently, using third-party software to recover and restore the source file should be considered if you are in a situation where the source file is crucial and do not have a backup. As we’ll see, there are a number of options available, including Filmora.</p>

Verifying your QuickTime installation is the most obvious way to find out whether it has decoded all of the video files. Let’s investigate the issue to its root.</p>

For some reason, your QuickTime behaviour is out of whack.</p>
<p>People often neglect to keep their QuickTime software up-to-date, which results in problems with video playback, such as no sound or stuttering, among many other things. To fix this issue, just download and install the most latest release of QuickTime player.</p>
<h3 id="Examine-the-System-and-Driver-3"><a href="#Examine-the-System-and-Driver-3" class="headerlink" title="Examine the System and Driver"></a>Examine the System and Driver</h3><p>Faulty speakers, audio issues in the system, and update failures will ultimately cause media playback difficulties.</p>
<p>To find the root cause, you should first check internally to see whether your speakers are working correctly. Speaking straight to Siri and hearing her reaction is the fastest and most straightforward option.</p>
<p>Another reason you may be hearing no sound on QuickTime is because of a recent system update. Apple, as we all know, often releases new operating systems, and you must keep track of the most current versions of updates in order to keep your system running effectively.</p>
<p>You just need to ensure that your machine is running the most recent version. As a result, your system will resume regular functioning, and QuickTime will be immediately fixed and restored.</p>

To make matters worse, the lack of sound in QuickTime will be the consequence of a corrupted video file.</p>
<p>Try opening the file in a different programme or player to see if the issue may be resolved. If this is the case, your source video file is either destroyed or corrupted. You may wish to consider regaining access to the file in this situation. The likelihood of your file being corrupted by malware or a virus is relatively high. Remember to be patient if this does happen to you.</p>
<p>It is necessary to use third-party repair programmes to successfully fix the file. Consequently, using third-party software to recover and restore the source file should be considered if you are in a situation where the source file is crucial and do not have a backup. As we’ll see, there are a number of options available, including Filmora.</p>

<h2 id="How-Long-Does-It-Take-To-Edit-A-Video"><a href="#How-Long-Does-It-Take-To-Edit-A-Video" class="headerlink" title="How Long Does It Take To Edit A Video"></a>How Long Does It Take To Edit A Video</h2><p>If you want to put together the pieces for online videos the number one thing most of the time takes is <strong>editing.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Why does editing take so much time and what to do for that?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Too many choices.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>It completely depends upon how many choices you are giving yourself while editing a video. It takes time to make choices. For example, if your friend asks you to buy a card (any card) from the store. You go into the store and start searching cards from more than 50000 cards, it takes time. On the other hand, if your friend asks you to buy a card for his uncle’s pet dog. This time it becomes easier for you to go straight and choose from the pet cards without moving around the birthday and anniversary cards.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Amount of footage.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>It depends upon how much footage you have on your edit and what kind of content you are editing. Some of the content is really complex and takes a lot of time like V-logging but at the same time, you may have content that requires very less edit or zero edit.</p>
<p>The video editing will become a slit and a quick process for you compared to what it was a few years back. But there are a few key things that really speed up the editing process.</p>
<p>I am going to discuss from beginning to end how to edit a video.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Outline</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You should take a paper and write down what you are going to say about your video. It would make your editing easy because you have already structured your content.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Avoid distractions</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>While editing you make a <strong>flow state</strong> in which the editing process becomes easier. But when you got distracted it takes a lot of time to get back to that flow state.</p>
<ul>
<li>My <strong>kids</strong> are my big distraction so, I usually start my editing process after they go to bed. (You can set yours).</li>
<li>Keep your <strong>phone</strong> away because it is another distraction that consumes most of your time.</li>
<li>Don’t keep <strong>re-watching</strong> your video all the time. Usually, people edit the first clip and before starting to edit the second clip they watch the first clip. After that, they edit the second clip and then re-watch the first and the second clip. It is also wasting a lot of your time. Do it at the end.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="How-to-Edit-Video-Faster-with-the-Best-Video-Editor"><a href="#How-to-Edit-Video-Faster-with-the-Best-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="How to Edit Video Faster with the Best Video Editor"></a><strong>How to Edit Video Faster with the Best Video Editor</strong></h2><p>Filmora 11 is one of the easiest to learn and one of the most beginner-friendly apps.

Davinci Resolve for Mac."></a><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Davinci Resolve for Mac.</strong></h2><p>The Davinci Resolve is the most professional video editing software on Mac. It is absolutely ridiculous that it is giving access to you for free. Along with this, it is very professional video editing software that people used to create Hollywood movies and that kind of stuff. It provides a very easy and professional interphase that anyone can use without having training.</p>
<ul>
<li>The controls and features in the software are amazing and can edit videos <strong>frame by frame.</strong></li>

<p>That’s why the Davinci Resolve has got its name as a <strong>finishing application</strong> of movies. People come in and color grade their videos. As it is a very powerful software hence if you are working with an old computer and that’s not really a powerful computer, the Davinci Resolve would not be going to work properly for you.</p>
<p>It completely depends upon how many choices you are giving yourself while editing a video. It takes time to make choices. For example, if your friend asks you to buy a card (any card) from the store. You go into the store and start searching cards from more than 50000 cards, it takes time. On the other hand, if your friend asks you to buy a card for his uncle’s pet dog. This time it becomes easier for you to go straight and choose from the pet cards without moving around the birthday and anniversary cards.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Amount of footage.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>It depends upon how much footage you have on your edit and what kind of content you are editing. Some of the content is really complex and takes a lot of time like V-logging but at the same time, you may have content that requires very less edit or zero edit.</p>
<p>The video editing will become a slit and a quick process for you compared to what it was a few years back. But there are a few key things that really speed up the editing process.</p>
<p>I am going to discuss from beginning to end how to edit a video.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Outline</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You should take a paper and write down what you are going to say about your video. It would make your editing easy because you have already structured your content.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Avoid distractions</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>While editing you make a <strong>flow state</strong> in which the editing process becomes easier. But when you got distracted it takes a lot of time to get back to that flow state.</p>
<ul>
<li>My <strong>kids</strong> are my big distraction so, I usually start my editing process after they go to bed. (You can set yours).</li>
<li>Keep your <strong>phone</strong> away because it is another distraction that consumes most of your time.</li>
<li>Don’t keep <strong>re-watching</strong> your video all the time. Usually, people edit the first clip and before starting to edit the second clip they watch the first clip. After that, they edit the second clip and then re-watch the first and the second clip. It is also wasting a lot of your time. Do it at the end.</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s why the Davinci Resolve has got its name as a <strong>finishing application</strong> of movies. People come in and color grade their videos. As it is a very powerful software hence if you are working with an old computer and that’s not really a powerful computer, the Davinci Resolve would not be going to work properly for you.</p>
<p>It completely depends upon how many choices you are giving yourself while editing a video. It takes time to make choices. For example, if your friend asks you to buy a card (any card) from the store. You go into the store and start searching cards from more than 50000 cards, it takes time. On the other hand, if your friend asks you to buy a card for his uncle’s pet dog. This time it becomes easier for you to go straight and choose from the pet cards without moving around the birthday and anniversary cards.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Amount of footage.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>It depends upon how much footage you have on your edit and what kind of content you are editing. Some of the content is really complex and takes a lot of time like V-logging but at the same time, you may have content that requires very less edit or zero edit.</p>
<p>The video editing will become a slit and a quick process for you compared to what it was a few years back. But there are a few key things that really speed up the editing process.</p>
<p>I am going to discuss from beginning to end how to edit a video.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Outline</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You should take a paper and write down what you are going to say about your video. It would make your editing easy because you have already structured your content.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Avoid distractions</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>While editing you make a <strong>flow state</strong> in which the editing process becomes easier. But when you got distracted it takes a lot of time to get back to that flow state.</p>
<ul>
<li>My <strong>kids</strong> are my big distraction so, I usually start my editing process after they go to bed. (You can set yours).</li>
<li>Keep your <strong>phone</strong> away because it is another distraction that consumes most of your time.</li>
<li>Don’t keep <strong>re-watching</strong> your video all the time. Usually, people edit the first clip and before starting to edit the second clip they watch the first clip. After that, they edit the second clip and then re-watch the first and the second clip. It is also wasting a lot of your time. Do it at the end.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is an important feature you should know.</p>
<ul>
<li>Select the video and hit the <strong>speed</strong></li>
<li>You can select <strong>slow, fast, normal,</strong> and the most interesting one is <strong>speed ramping.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Speed ramping</strong> allows you to set automatically made patterns to slow down then fast again slow. It will create a cinematic effect in the video. But this feature is only for paid users.</li>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-SRT"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-SRT" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is SRT?"></a>Part 1: What is SRT?</h2><p>An SRT is one of the most common formats used in subtitling or captioning files. ‘SRT’ refers to a ‘SubRip Subtitle’ file, which originated from the DVD-ripping software by the same name. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubRip" >SubRip <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> would extract or rip subtitles and timings from live video, recorded video, and DVDs.</p>
<p>SRT has four major components:</p>
<ol>
<li>A numeric counter indicates the number or position of the subtitle.</li>
<li>A Start and end time of the subtitle which is separated by the characters.</li>
<li>A Subtitle in one or more lines.</li>
<li>A blank line indicates the ending of the subtitle.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that you know about SRT let’s understand why you should convert your Word file to SRT.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Why-Should-You-Convert-Word-to-SRT"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Should-You-Convert-Word-to-SRT" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Why Should You Convert Word to SRT?"></a>Part 2: Why Should You Convert Word to SRT?</h2><p>Most subtitles on the Internet are distributed in SRT format. Moreover, media players, lecture capture software, and video recording software are compatible with the SRT format.</p>
<p>Also, user frequently asks from forum like:</p>
<p>“I received a docx. file with subtitles already translated and the corresponding YouTube video URL. I was asked to proofread and then embed the subtitles into the video.”</p>
<p>To solve this, you can not only save it as a TXT document and change the file extension to .SRT, but also, a much easier way, convert subtitles from Microsoft Word files to SRT format through a easy-to-use SRT converter.</p>

<h3 id="Timestamp-issue"><a href="#Timestamp-issue" class="headerlink" title="Timestamp issue"></a>Timestamp issue</h3><p>Timestamps identify the exact point in an audio or video where the given text was spoken.</p>
<p>Now we know what a timestamp is and why it’s important. Let’s find out how to add timestamps in the SRT file.</p>
<p><strong>How to add timestamps</strong>:</p>
<p>There are two ways to add timestamps in the file.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Either add timestamps manually in the word document.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>To write timecodes, the format used is Hours:minutes:seconds,milliseconds and milliseconds being rounded to 3 decimal places. Separate each timestamp with a two-hash arrow (written as - -&gt;) and a blank line indicates the next caption sequence. After saving, these files are named with .srt extension.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Or edit the SRT file after creating it using a video editor which has the ability to edit SRT.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You can also edit the SRT file after creating it by using video editing software such as <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.happyscribe.com/" >Happy Scribe’s <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

<p>In any of the two cases mantioned above, you need to convert Word document in to SRT. Let’s find out how can you do that without using any software.</p>

<p>If you do not see the extension in the name of the file,</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the top menu in Windows Explorer</li>
<li>Go to view</li>

<h3 id="Timestamp-issue-1"><a href="#Timestamp-issue-1" class="headerlink" title="Timestamp issue"></a>Timestamp issue</h3><p>Timestamps identify the exact point in an audio or video where the given text was spoken.</p>
<p>Now we know what a timestamp is and why it’s important. Let’s find out how to add timestamps in the SRT file.</p>
<p><strong>How to add timestamps</strong>:</p>
<p>There are two ways to add timestamps in the file.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Either add timestamps manually in the word document.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>To write timecodes, the format used is Hours:minutes:seconds,milliseconds and milliseconds being rounded to 3 decimal places. Separate each timestamp with a two-hash arrow (written as - -&gt;) and a blank line indicates the next caption sequence. After saving, these files are named with .srt extension.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Or edit the SRT file after creating it using a video editor which has the ability to edit SRT.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You can also edit the SRT file after creating it by using video editing software such as <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.happyscribe.com/" >Happy Scribe’s <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It has audio-to-text&#x2F;video-to-text feature that includes multiple timestamps options.</p>

It also supports language conversion between English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, etc. It’s an easy process.</p>
<p>In any of the two cases mantioned above, you need to convert Word document in to SRT. Let’s find out how can you do that without using any software.</p>
<p>Follow the below steps to convert a word file to SRT without any software.</p>

<p>If you do not see the extension in the name of the file,</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the top menu in Windows Explorer</li>
<li>Go to view</li>
<li>Click on the check box for “File name extensions”</li>
</ol>
