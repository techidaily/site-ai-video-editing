                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Import Clips on DaVinci Resolve Timeline</strong></p>
<p>After installing the software on your PC or MAC operating systems, open DaVinci Resolve and import two or more clips on the timeline.</p>
<p>For example, you can see two different video clips on the timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Slide Clips and Select</strong></p>
<p>In the next step, slide both clips together, so there’s no gap left between them. And then, using your mouse, select both clips, like this:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>Make sure that all clips are on the same timeline.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Merge Clips</strong></p>
<p>Once you have selected all the clips, right-click anywhere on the selection. And choose the “New Compound” option from the list of options.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>Now, rename the clip and hit the “Create” button.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>DaVinci Resolve will merge the clips within a blink of an eye, as seen in this screenshot.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>You can see that within a few steps, you can easily merge videos using DaVinci Resolve. However, you should know that this software requires a heavy system to work smoothly. And sometimes, the quality and result are not up to the mark.</p>
<p>That is why most video editors prefer Filmora by Wondershare when editing and merging videos. So, let’s see how you can use Filmora to do the same task in the next part.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-An-Easier-Way-to-Merge-Clips-in-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Part-3-An-Easier-Way-to-Merge-Clips-in-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: An Easier Way to Merge Clips in Wondershare Filmora"></a>Part 3: An Easier Way to Merge Clips in Wondershare Filmora</h2><p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a powerful tool for video editing.

<p><strong>Step 1: Download and Open Filmora</strong></p>
<p>Go to Filmora’s official website and download the latest version for your MAC or Windows.</p>

                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-clips-davinci-7.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>Run the setup and let the system complete the installation. Depending on the version, more or less, the software will look like this as you will open it on your system.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-clips-davinci-8.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Import Your Videos to Merge</strong></p>
<p>Click on the “Import Media Files Here” button to choose the videos you want to merge.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-clips-davinci-9.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>For instance, here, you can see two different video clips on the timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-clips-davinci-10.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Place Videos on the Same Timeline to Merge</strong></p>
<p>First of all, you must plan the order of the clips because it will help you place the video clips correctly.</p>
<p>So, use your mouse and select the clip.</p>
<p>For example, you can see that there are two clips below. The first clip is named “Islands,” and the second clip is called “Beach.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-clips-davinci-11.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>Then, move the selected clip (“second clip” is selected for demonstration) and place it right next to the first clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-clips-davinci-12.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>You must keep in mind that there shouldn’t be any gap between the clips.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-clips-davinci-13.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>Or else the final result will have a “black space” between the clips.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-clips-davinci-14.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Export Your File</strong></p>
<p>When you are done merging clips on the timeline, click on the “Export” button to save the combined video in your system.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-clips-davinci-15.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>

                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Import Your Videos to Merge</strong></p>
<p>Click on the “Import Media Files Here” button to choose the videos you want to merge.</p>

                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>For instance, here, you can see two different video clips on the timeline.</p>

                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Place Videos on the Same Timeline to Merge</strong></p>
<p>First of all, you must plan the order of the clips because it will help you place the video clips correctly.</p>
<p>So, use your mouse and select the clip.</p>
<p>For example, you can see that there are two clips below. The first clip is named “Islands,” and the second clip is called “Beach.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>Then, move the selected clip (“second clip” is selected for demonstration) and place it right next to the first clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>You must keep in mind that there shouldn’t be any gap between the clips.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>Or else the final result will have a “black space” between the clips.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Export Your File</strong></p>
<p>When you are done merging clips on the timeline, click on the “Export” button to save the combined video in your system.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p><strong>Step 2: Import Clips on DaVinci Resolve Timeline</strong></p>
<p>After installing the software on your PC or MAC operating systems, open DaVinci Resolve and import two or more clips on the timeline.</p>
<p>For example, you can see two different video clips on the timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Slide Clips and Select</strong></p>
<p>In the next step, slide both clips together, so there’s no gap left between them. And then, using your mouse, select both clips, like this:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>Make sure that all clips are on the same timeline.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Merge Clips</strong></p>
<p>Once you have selected all the clips, right-click anywhere on the selection. And choose the “New Compound” option from the list of options.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p>You can see that within a few steps, you can easily merge videos using DaVinci Resolve. However, you should know that this software requires a heavy system to work smoothly. And sometimes, the quality and result are not up to the mark.</p>
<p>That is why most video editors prefer Filmora by Wondershare when editing and merging videos. So, let’s see how you can use Filmora to do the same task in the next part.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-An-Easier-Way-to-Merge-Clips-in-Wondershare-Filmora-3"><a href="#Part-3-An-Easier-Way-to-Merge-Clips-in-Wondershare-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: An Easier Way to Merge Clips in Wondershare Filmora"></a>Part 3: An Easier Way to Merge Clips in Wondershare Filmora</h2><p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a powerful tool for video editing.

<p>Compared to DaVinci Resolve, Filmora requires fewer tools to combine multiple videos in a single frame. So, without further waiting, let’s learn how to merge clips in Filmora.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Download and Open Filmora</strong></p>
<p>Go to Filmora’s official website and download the latest version for your MAC or Windows.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-clips-davinci-7.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>Run the setup and let the system complete the installation. Depending on the version, more or less, the software will look like this as you will open it on your system.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-clips-davinci-8.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Import Your Videos to Merge</strong></p>
<p>Click on the “Import Media Files Here” button to choose the videos you want to merge.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-clips-davinci-9.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>For instance, here, you can see two different video clips on the timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-clips-davinci-10.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Place Videos on the Same Timeline to Merge</strong></p>
<p>First of all, you must plan the order of the clips because it will help you place the video clips correctly.</p>
<p>So, use your mouse and select the clip.</p>
<p>For example, you can see that there are two clips below. The first clip is named “Islands,” and the second clip is called “Beach.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-clips-davinci-11.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>Then, move the selected clip (“second clip” is selected for demonstration) and place it right next to the first clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-clips-davinci-12.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>You must keep in mind that there shouldn’t be any gap between the clips.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-clips-davinci-13.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>Or else the final result will have a “black space” between the clips.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-clips-davinci-14.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Export Your File</strong></p>
<p>When you are done merging clips on the timeline, click on the “Export” button to save the combined video in your system.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-clips-davinci-15.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>You can merge several clips in just four steps without wasting your time looking around for options and losing the video quality.</p>

<p>Text-to-speech (TTS) is a type of assistive technology that reads digital text aloud. It’s sometimes called “read aloud” technology. This technology has evolved to the point of being inculcated or introduced directly to some video editing applications without having to visit a separate text-to-speech application or software for support. This article therefore aims at discussing ten video makers that have inbuilt the text-to-speech feature.</p>

<p>FEATURES</p>
<p>After reviewing both versions (Android and iOS) of CapCut, we found that the app is indeed easy to use and includes a ton of attractive features designed for TikTok users. Would we recommend it to you? Yes, definitely, but with some caveats.</p>
<ul>
<li>Split function: This is similar to trimming where you have to separate the clip in order to define your desired part of the clip. Your clip can be further extended after splitting, so it’s just a process of simple trimming in editing.</li>
<li>Video overlay: This feature helps you place a video on another video. Those who do this often are those who have reaction channels, online teachers and gamers. This feature helps the viewers to simultaneously comprehend explanations the main video content alongside the reaction or explanation.</li>
<li>Speed control: This feature aids speed ramping. You can slow down your video and increase the speed just as you want. One thing to have in mind is when you plan to edit such a video, you have to shoot in a high resolution and high frame rate like 30-60fps so as to avoid the amateurish look.</li>
<li>Reverse video: The reverse feature helps you to rewind your clip to create the effect you have pictured in your mind while shooting.</li>
<li>Music library: CapCut comes with an impressive collection of royalty-free music and sound effects that can really make a huge difference to your videos. The tracks have a high quality and you can effortlessly insert them into your video to create the feel you desire.</li>
<li>Filters: Choose from various filters to soften or sharpen your videos and make them more professional-looking. There are color-based and season-based filters, as well as a range of beautification tools to enhance video quality. Filters can also be used effectively if you have multiple clips that have color variations or different contrast and brightness levels. Since you can’t edit most of these in CapCut, you can avoid having to use a desktop editor by choosing the right filters and applying them to all your clips to bring some uniformity.</li>
<li>Effects: There’s a collection of effects you can select from to appeal to the visual cravings of your audience. This will add colour to your content as it makes your viewers involved in the video. These effects include split-screen, retro, comic, party, dreamy, and so on. These effects will make your video look fresh and professionally edited.</li>
<li>Stickers and text: Stickers could be fun to use due to their expressive nature. Your choice as a content creator will go a long way in determining the fascination of your content. CapCut has therefore had you covered when it comes to adding fun features to your content to make it more interactive and exciting. Stickers and texts are therefore engaging tools you can employ to drive the fantasy of your audience. Also, it creates room for more details to be added without necessarily having to introduce more audio contents especially. With this feature, you can literally do more with less using CapCut.</li>

<p>Text-to-speech (TTS) is a type of assistive technology that reads digital text aloud. It’s sometimes called “read aloud” technology. This technology has evolved to the point of being inculcated or introduced directly to some video editing applications without having to visit a separate text-to-speech application or software for support. This article therefore aims at discussing ten video makers that have inbuilt the text-to-speech feature.</p>

It is a mobile app for iOS and Android devices which is easy to use in terms of creating your content. It makes your cutting, reversing and speed change easier than ever when you get it right to produce incredible results as you share on social media. You can make your video captivating by adding features such as filters, stickers, speed changes, background music, effects, split, reverse and more to make your wonderful moments more polished and professional.</p>
<p>FEATURES</p>
<p>After reviewing both versions (Android and iOS) of CapCut, we found that the app is indeed easy to use and includes a ton of attractive features designed for TikTok users. Would we recommend it to you? Yes, definitely, but with some caveats.</p>
<ul>
<li>Split function: This is similar to trimming where you have to separate the clip in order to define your desired part of the clip. Your clip can be further extended after splitting, so it’s just a process of simple trimming in editing.</li>
<li>Video overlay: This feature helps you place a video on another video. Those who do this often are those who have reaction channels, online teachers and gamers. This feature helps the viewers to simultaneously comprehend explanations the main video content alongside the reaction or explanation.</li>
<li>Speed control: This feature aids speed ramping. You can slow down your video and increase the speed just as you want. One thing to have in mind is when you plan to edit such a video, you have to shoot in a high resolution and high frame rate like 30-60fps so as to avoid the amateurish look.</li>
<li>Reverse video: The reverse feature helps you to rewind your clip to create the effect you have pictured in your mind while shooting.</li>
<li>Music library: CapCut comes with an impressive collection of royalty-free music and sound effects that can really make a huge difference to your videos. The tracks have a high quality and you can effortlessly insert them into your video to create the feel you desire.</li>
<li>Filters: Choose from various filters to soften or sharpen your videos and make them more professional-looking. There are color-based and season-based filters, as well as a range of beautification tools to enhance video quality. Filters can also be used effectively if you have multiple clips that have color variations or different contrast and brightness levels. Since you can’t edit most of these in CapCut, you can avoid having to use a desktop editor by choosing the right filters and applying them to all your clips to bring some uniformity.</li>
<li>Effects: There’s a collection of effects you can select from to appeal to the visual cravings of your audience. This will add colour to your content as it makes your viewers involved in the video. These effects include split-screen, retro, comic, party, dreamy, and so on. These effects will make your video look fresh and professionally edited.</li>
<li>Stickers and text: Stickers could be fun to use due to their expressive nature. Your choice as a content creator will go a long way in determining the fascination of your content. CapCut has therefore had you covered when it comes to adding fun features to your content to make it more interactive and exciting. Stickers and texts are therefore engaging tools you can employ to drive the fantasy of your audience. Also, it creates room for more details to be added without necessarily having to introduce more audio contents especially. With this feature, you can literally do more with less using CapCut.</li>

You can make your video captivating by adding features such as filters, stickers, speed changes, background music, effects, split, reverse and more to make your wonderful moments more polished and professional.</p>
<p>FEATURES</p>
<p>After reviewing both versions (Android and iOS) of CapCut, we found that the app is indeed easy to use and includes a ton of attractive features designed for TikTok users. Would we recommend it to you? Yes, definitely, but with some caveats.</p>
<ul>
<li>Split function: This is similar to trimming where you have to separate the clip in order to define your desired part of the clip. Your clip can be further extended after splitting, so it’s just a process of simple trimming in editing.</li>
<li>Video overlay: This feature helps you place a video on another video. Those who do this often are those who have reaction channels, online teachers and gamers. This feature helps the viewers to simultaneously comprehend explanations the main video content alongside the reaction or explanation.</li>
<li>Speed control: This feature aids speed ramping. You can slow down your video and increase the speed just as you want. One thing to have in mind is when you plan to edit such a video, you have to shoot in a high resolution and high frame rate like 30-60fps so as to avoid the amateurish look.</li>
<li>Reverse video: The reverse feature helps you to rewind your clip to create the effect you have pictured in your mind while shooting.</li>
<li>Music library: CapCut comes with an impressive collection of royalty-free music and sound effects that can really make a huge difference to your videos. The tracks have a high quality and you can effortlessly insert them into your video to create the feel you desire.</li>
<li>Filters: Choose from various filters to soften or sharpen your videos and make them more professional-looking. There are color-based and season-based filters, as well as a range of beautification tools to enhance video quality. Filters can also be used effectively if you have multiple clips that have color variations or different contrast and brightness levels. Since you can’t edit most of these in CapCut, you can avoid having to use a desktop editor by choosing the right filters and applying them to all your clips to bring some uniformity.</li>
<li>Effects: There’s a collection of effects you can select from to appeal to the visual cravings of your audience. This will add colour to your content as it makes your viewers involved in the video. These effects include split-screen, retro, comic, party, dreamy, and so on. These effects will make your video look fresh and professionally edited.</li>
<li>Stickers and text: Stickers could be fun to use due to their expressive nature. Your choice as a content creator will go a long way in determining the fascination of your content. CapCut has therefore had you covered when it comes to adding fun features to your content to make it more interactive and exciting. Stickers and texts are therefore engaging tools you can employ to drive the fantasy of your audience. Also, it creates room for more details to be added without necessarily having to introduce more audio contents especially. With this feature, you can literally do more with less using CapCut.</li>

<p>FEATURES</p>
<p>After reviewing both versions (Android and iOS) of CapCut, we found that the app is indeed easy to use and includes a ton of attractive features designed for TikTok users. Would we recommend it to you? Yes, definitely, but with some caveats.</p>
<ul>
<li>Split function: This is similar to trimming where you have to separate the clip in order to define your desired part of the clip. Your clip can be further extended after splitting, so it’s just a process of simple trimming in editing.</li>
<li>Video overlay: This feature helps you place a video on another video. Those who do this often are those who have reaction channels, online teachers and gamers. This feature helps the viewers to simultaneously comprehend explanations the main video content alongside the reaction or explanation.</li>
<li>Speed control: This feature aids speed ramping. You can slow down your video and increase the speed just as you want. One thing to have in mind is when you plan to edit such a video, you have to shoot in a high resolution and high frame rate like 30-60fps so as to avoid the amateurish look.</li>
<li>Reverse video: The reverse feature helps you to rewind your clip to create the effect you have pictured in your mind while shooting.</li>
<li>Music library: CapCut comes with an impressive collection of royalty-free music and sound effects that can really make a huge difference to your videos. The tracks have a high quality and you can effortlessly insert them into your video to create the feel you desire.</li>
<li>Filters: Choose from various filters to soften or sharpen your videos and make them more professional-looking. There are color-based and season-based filters, as well as a range of beautification tools to enhance video quality. Filters can also be used effectively if you have multiple clips that have color variations or different contrast and brightness levels. Since you can’t edit most of these in CapCut, you can avoid having to use a desktop editor by choosing the right filters and applying them to all your clips to bring some uniformity.</li>
<li>Effects: There’s a collection of effects you can select from to appeal to the visual cravings of your audience. This will add colour to your content as it makes your viewers involved in the video. These effects include split-screen, retro, comic, party, dreamy, and so on. These effects will make your video look fresh and professionally edited.</li>
<li>Stickers and text: Stickers could be fun to use due to their expressive nature. Your choice as a content creator will go a long way in determining the fascination of your content. CapCut has therefore had you covered when it comes to adding fun features to your content to make it more interactive and exciting. Stickers and texts are therefore engaging tools you can employ to drive the fantasy of your audience. Also, it creates room for more details to be added without necessarily having to introduce more audio contents especially. With this feature, you can literally do more with less using CapCut.</li>

You know, those cool shake effects that you may have seen on an amateur or professional video on the web? Well, if you have, then you probably thought it was impossible. The camera shake effect is a technique applied to the clips where shaky camera movements cause the image to appear more cinematic and real. Applying a camera shake effect is to hide your flaws when shooting a video.</p>
<p>Camera shake is often mistaken for poor cinematography. It can enhance your video. For instance, if you’re filming something like a car chase or any other scene where there’s lots of movement and action, the inclusion of a camera shake can help make it more realistic.</p>
<p>A camera shake effect can be an excellent way of adding a sense of realism to your videos. Whether you’re making a video that’s meant to be taken as a real scene, such as one depicting a robbery, or one that’s supposed to be shot in a documentary style, such as making a movie, you can use this as an effective tool. You can consider adding camera shakes to your videos due to the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>This camera shake effect makes your video more creative. If you want to make, your video different from those other businesses produce, adding this effect will be a good idea.</li>
<li>Your audience will be able to relate better to your video if they’ve seen similar videos before.</li>
<li>Adding a camera shake to your video will make it more interesting and engaging for your viewers.</li>
<li>It’s a great way to mask any mistakes you might have made during the video production. After all, we aren’t perfect humans, so we can’t make perfect videos every time!”</li>
<li>You can use camera shakes to simulate the feeling of being in an environment that is free from control (such as being on a boat).</li>
<li>You can use them to create a sense of urgency for the viewer&#x2F;audience by adding motion blur to the sequence.</li>

Adjust the frame rate of your Composition</h3><p>In order to make the overall effect more “choppy,” you can reduce the frame rate of the video by going to Composition&gt; Composition settings. After Effects uses a frame rate of 24.5, you can go as low as “8” if you want a choppy feel.</p>
<p><img

<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Make-a-Material-Transparent-in-Blender"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Make-a-Material-Transparent-in-Blender" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to Make a Material Transparent in Blender"></a>Part 2 How to Make a Material Transparent in Blender</h2><p>Blender is a top class graphic modulation tool; you can use to play with your editing creativity to your heart’s content, catering to a variety of design requirements, while adhering to a distinguished professional outlook. If you are pondering over the perfect task choice to start your editing journey with Blender, you can begin with making a material transparent in the software.</p>
<p>When beginning to create transparent artworks in Blender, you need to be familiar with the Transparent BSDF node. Here’s a quick explanation:</p>
<p><strong>Transparent BSDF Node</strong></p>
<p>When working with Blender, you get to access a variety of graphic nodes that cater to specific design purposes. Likewise, the transparent BSDF, as the name suggests, is an exclusive transparency creation graphic node that is essential to make materials transparent in Blender. Talking of the specific node function, it is there to facilitate the control of different transparency modes, in cohesion with specific user requirements.</p>
<p>Browse through the following section for a guided tutorial to make a material transparent using Blender:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p>Prepare a suitable BSDF material by selecting any image from your device and applying it to the object in the Blender’s viewport.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p>To start working with the Transparent BSDF node, you first need to insert the same into the node tree amongst the Principle BSDF and the Mix Shader nodes. To do this, you need to select ‘Add’ or press ‘Ctrl + A’, followed by locating the same in the ‘Shader’ submenu. Do not forget to add the ‘Mix Shader’ node, which is again, present in the ‘Shader’ submenu, to the node tree.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p>
<p>Plug in the Transparent BSDF output into the top Shader input of the Mix Shader, while dragging the latter into the connecting link between the Material Output and Principle BSDF nodes. This enables the Mix Shader node to pass through the two output generating nodes. The resultant ‘Transparency Effect’ can be seen on the viewpoint object within a few seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong></p>
<p>Make an additional connection of two fresh nodes into the node tree as follows:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Transparent BSDF output to the Mix Shader input</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Principal BSDF output to the Mix Shader input</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Mix Shader output to the Surface input</p>
<p>This will finally fetch a transparent material output for the selected image object.</p>

If you are pondering over the perfect task choice to start your editing journey with Blender, you can begin with making a material transparent in the software.</p>
<p>When beginning to create transparent artworks in Blender, you need to be familiar with the Transparent BSDF node. Here’s a quick explanation:</p>
<p><strong>Transparent BSDF Node</strong></p>
<p>When working with Blender, you get to access a variety of graphic nodes that cater to specific design purposes. Likewise, the transparent BSDF, as the name suggests, is an exclusive transparency creation graphic node that is essential to make materials transparent in Blender. Talking of the specific node function, it is there to facilitate the control of different transparency modes, in cohesion with specific user requirements.</p>
<p>Browse through the following section for a guided tutorial to make a material transparent using Blender:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p>Prepare a suitable BSDF material by selecting any image from your device and applying it to the object in the Blender’s viewport.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p>To start working with the Transparent BSDF node, you first need to insert the same into the node tree amongst the Principle BSDF and the Mix Shader nodes. To do this, you need to select ‘Add’ or press ‘Ctrl + A’, followed by locating the same in the ‘Shader’ submenu. Do not forget to add the ‘Mix Shader’ node, which is again, present in the ‘Shader’ submenu, to the node tree.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p>
<p>Plug in the Transparent BSDF output into the top Shader input of the Mix Shader, while dragging the latter into the connecting link between the Material Output and Principle BSDF nodes. This enables the Mix Shader node to pass through the two output generating nodes. The resultant ‘Transparency Effect’ can be seen on the viewpoint object within a few seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong></p>
<p>Make an additional connection of two fresh nodes into the node tree as follows:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Transparent BSDF output to the Mix Shader input</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Principal BSDF output to the Mix Shader input</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Mix Shader output to the Surface input</p>
<p>This will finally fetch a transparent material output for the selected image object.</p>

If you are pondering over the perfect task choice to start your editing journey with Blender, you can begin with making a material transparent in the software.</p>
<p>When beginning to create transparent artworks in Blender, you need to be familiar with the Transparent BSDF node. Here’s a quick explanation:</p>
<p><strong>Transparent BSDF Node</strong></p>
<p>When working with Blender, you get to access a variety of graphic nodes that cater to specific design purposes. Likewise, the transparent BSDF, as the name suggests, is an exclusive transparency creation graphic node that is essential to make materials transparent in Blender. Talking of the specific node function, it is there to facilitate the control of different transparency modes, in cohesion with specific user requirements.</p>
<p>Browse through the following section for a guided tutorial to make a material transparent using Blender:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p>Prepare a suitable BSDF material by selecting any image from your device and applying it to the object in the Blender’s viewport.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p>To start working with the Transparent BSDF node, you first need to insert the same into the node tree amongst the Principle BSDF and the Mix Shader nodes. To do this, you need to select ‘Add’ or press ‘Ctrl + A’, followed by locating the same in the ‘Shader’ submenu. Do not forget to add the ‘Mix Shader’ node, which is again, present in the ‘Shader’ submenu, to the node tree.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p>
<p>Plug in the Transparent BSDF output into the top Shader input of the Mix Shader, while dragging the latter into the connecting link between the Material Output and Principle BSDF nodes. This enables the Mix Shader node to pass through the two output generating nodes. The resultant ‘Transparency Effect’ can be seen on the viewpoint object within a few seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong></p>
<p>Make an additional connection of two fresh nodes into the node tree as follows:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Transparent BSDF output to the Mix Shader input</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Principal BSDF output to the Mix Shader input</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Mix Shader output to the Surface input</p>
<p>This will finally fetch a transparent material output for the selected image object.</p>

<p><strong>Making Transparent Background Images in Filmora</strong></p>

<p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Import Image File</strong></p>
<p>When you are done with the installation, launch the software and navigate to the ’Import’ tab in its welcome interface. Click and tap ‘Import Media File’ from the dropdown that appears to import the desired image to Filmora’s media library.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Blender-tips-how-to-make-blender-render-transparent-background-8.JPG"
                      alt="Filmora- Media Import Interface"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Drag to Timeline</strong></p>
<p>The next step is to drag your image selection from the software’s media library to its editor timeline. Either right click the image and select ‘Insert’ option from the submenu that appears, or use the conventional ‘Drag and Drop’ method to accomplish this task.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Blender-tips-how-to-make-blender-render-transparent-background-9.JPG"
                      alt="Filmora- Image Timeline Dragging"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Transparency Adjustments</strong></p>
<p>Once the image reaches the timeline, tap the same to see the ‘Settings’ tab get opened. Navigate through the tab options until you find ‘Chroma Key Settings’. Enable the ‘Chroma Key’ with a right side toggle to see your selected image get transparent with a ‘Green’ color in the background.</p>
<p>An alternative to the above method is to hit the ‘Color Picker’ option to the right of the ‘Select Color’ tab and navigate to a desired section of the image to make it transparent with a single click.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Blender-tips-how-to-make-blender-render-transparent-background-10.JPG"
                      alt="Filmora- Image Transparency Adjustments"
                ></p>
<p>If you observe partial transparency in the resultant image background, consider making additional adjustments in ’Chroma Key’ setting parameters like, offset, edge thickness, tolerance, edge feather, etc., to ensure that the image background is totally transparent. When the final artwork makes you happy, tap ‘OK’.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Filmora- Additional Chroma Key Settings"
                ></p>
<p>**Step 4: Time to Export!**Your creation is now all set for a media export to your favorite social media handles. Just click on the ‘Export’ tab in the top right of the software timeline and that’s it!</p>
