<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Ray-Tracing"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Ray-Tracing" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Ray Tracing?"></a>Part 1. What Is Ray Tracing?</h2><p>Ray Tracing is a powerful rendering technique that can create incredibly realistic lighting and shadows. By tracing the path of light, algorithms can simulate the way that light interacts with virtual objects in a computer-generated world.</p>
<p>This results in more lifelike shadows, reflections, and translucence. Ray Tracing has been responsible for the dramatic increase in realism we’ve seen in video games over the years, and its benefits are only becoming more apparent as technology improves.</p>
<p>In simple words, Ray Tracing is a computer graphics technique for generating realistic images and works by tracing the light’s path from the camera through the scene. This allows for accurate simulations of light interactions, such as reflection, refraction, and shadows.</p>

<h2 id="Part-2-Overview-Of-Ray-Tracing"><a href="#Part-2-Overview-Of-Ray-Tracing" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Overview Of Ray Tracing"></a>Part 2. Overview Of Ray Tracing</h2><p>In this part, we will explain what Ray Tracing is from the following sides and for your better understanding.</p>
<h3 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h3><p>Albrecht Dürer first gave the idea of Ray Tracing in the 16th century through his invention, the Dürer’s door. However, it was not until 1968 that Arthur Appel used a computer for the first time to create a shaded picture through Ray Tracing.</p>
<p>First conceptualized in 1969, Ray Tracing is a common technique used to create computer-generated graphics for movies and TV shows today. This is because studios can use the processing power of multiple computers to get the job done quickly and efficiently. However, even with this extra processing power, Ray Tracing can be a long and difficult process.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges, Ray Tracing is becoming increasingly popular due to computer hardware and software advances. And as technology continues to improve, we can expect to see even more realistic images in the future.</p>
<h3 id="Advantages"><a href="#Advantages" class="headerlink" title="Advantages"></a>Advantages</h3><p>Here’re some advantages of Ray Tracing:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Realistic Rendering:</strong> Ray Tracing can create more realistic images than those created with traditional rendering techniques. This is because it calculates the light path more accurately, resulting in more realistic shadows, refraction, and reflections.</li>

How Does Ray Tracing Work?</h2><p>Ray Tracking uses the process of denoising. The algorithm starts with the camera and traces the shades of shadows and lights.</p>
<p>Ray Tracing uses machine learning to fill in the gaps to form a realistic image. The brighter the scene, the higher the graphics quality; the higher the quality, the more expensive it is. This is why Ray Tracing didn’t become popular in the video game industry until recently.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-Ray-Tracing-In-Adobe-After-Effects"><a href="#Part-4-Ray-Tracing-In-Adobe-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Ray Tracing In Adobe After Effects"></a>Part 4. Ray Tracing In Adobe After Effects</h2><p>After the introduction of Ray Tracing, we will combine it with a popular video editor - Adobe After Effects to see how it works. Adobe After Effects is a useful and powerful tool for creating visual effects and animated graphics. Adobe introduced Ray Tracing or <strong>Ray-Traced 3D</strong> feature in After Effect to help graphic designers create photorealistic 3D images and render light and shadow. This feature was added in 2012 with the release of After Effects CS 6.</p>

<p>However, the Ray Tracing feature was later removed from After Effects in 2020 due to multiple reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Ray Tracing tool always faced bugs and glitches.</li>
<li>This feature did not work correctly if you were not using Adobe Media Encoder.</li>
<li>NVIDIA would change the standards from time to time.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Functions"><a href="#Functions" class="headerlink" title="Functions"></a>Functions</h3><p>Though as mentioned above, the Ray Tracing feature was removed in 2020, its advanced 3D features are still worth of introducing. Here’re some functions of <strong>Ray Traced 3D After Effects:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ray Traced allows you to generate and place multiple lights.</li>
<li>You can set a material option for 3D layers.</li>
<li>Moreover, you can control how shadows are cast.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="How-Does-It-Work"><a href="#How-Does-It-Work" class="headerlink" title="How Does It Work"></a>How Does It Work</h3><p>3D Ray Tracing in After Effects works by giving your text and paths more depth. Extruded layers have a z-axis depth, making them three-dimensional. This extra dimension is viewable from all angles, even when the layer is rotated. In contrast, non-extruded layers have zero depth on the z-axis. So, they will disappear if you try to rotate them 90 degrees on the x or y-axis.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Ray-Tracing-1"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Ray-Tracing-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Ray Tracing?"></a>Part 1. What Is Ray Tracing?</h2><p>Ray Tracing is a powerful rendering technique that can create incredibly realistic lighting and shadows. By tracing the path of light, algorithms can simulate the way that light interacts with virtual objects in a computer-generated world.</p>
<p>This results in more lifelike shadows, reflections, and translucence. Ray Tracing has been responsible for the dramatic increase in realism we’ve seen in video games over the years, and its benefits are only becoming more apparent as technology improves.</p>
<p>In simple words, Ray Tracing is a computer graphics technique for generating realistic images and works by tracing the light’s path from the camera through the scene. This allows for accurate simulations of light interactions, such as reflection, refraction, and shadows.</p>

Overview Of Ray Tracing</h2><p>In this part, we will explain what Ray Tracing is from the following sides and for your better understanding.</p>
<h3 id="History-1"><a href="#History-1" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h3><p>Albrecht Dürer first gave the idea of Ray Tracing in the 16th century through his invention, the Dürer’s door. However, it was not until 1968 that Arthur Appel used a computer for the first time to create a shaded picture through Ray Tracing.</p>
<p>First conceptualized in 1969, Ray Tracing is a common technique used to create computer-generated graphics for movies and TV shows today. This is because studios can use the processing power of multiple computers to get the job done quickly and efficiently. However, even with this extra processing power, Ray Tracing can be a long and difficult process.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges, Ray Tracing is becoming increasingly popular due to computer hardware and software advances. And as technology continues to improve, we can expect to see even more realistic images in the future.</p>
<h3 id="Advantages-1"><a href="#Advantages-1" class="headerlink" title="Advantages"></a>Advantages</h3><p>Here’re some advantages of Ray Tracing:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Realistic Rendering:</strong> Ray Tracing can create more realistic images than those created with traditional rendering techniques. This is because it calculates the light path more accurately, resulting in more realistic shadows, refraction, and reflections.</li>
<li><strong>Anti-aliasing And Depth Of Field:</strong> Ray Tracing can help you quickly get the anti-aliasing and depth of field effects.</li>
</ol>

Don’t worry! We got you covered through this article which will guide you through the different things which you must learn before editing the first draft of your video.</p>
<h3 id="Start-a-video-project"><a href="#Start-a-video-project" class="headerlink" title="Start a video project"></a>Start a video project</h3><p>Your smartphone and digital camera can let you record multiple videos but what now? You head out to edit your first draft by choosing a suitable platform or software and then you can surely lay back and see the software doing wonders to your raw videos. By starting off with editing, you choose your video editing preferences and then you just let the video editing tools do the magic.</p>
<h3 id="Get-to-know-the-video-editing-software-workspace"><a href="#Get-to-know-the-video-editing-software-workspace" class="headerlink" title="Get to know the video editing software workspace"></a>Get to know the video editing software workspace</h3><p>Video editing software offer customizable workspaces for different editing tasks. The software workspace streamlines routine actions you take with clips, like editing clips, making DVD and Blu-ray menus, and sharing movies. By placing panels in the layout that best matches your working style, you can personalize your workspace. The additional panels adjust automatically to fit the window as you rearrange them. For various jobs, such as one for editing and one for preview, you can build and store multiple workspaces.</p>
<h3 id="Understand-the-timeline"><a href="#Understand-the-timeline" class="headerlink" title="Understand the timeline"></a>Understand the timeline</h3><p>The timeline of your video is the backbone of your digital video editing process. It’s called a timeline because the various pieces of video will be lined up horizontally. In a video editing software, the timeline is where you arrange your video clips and plan out all the modifications you want to do. As you work, you will see every single one of your video and audio clips, effects, and transitions sorted chronologically from beginning to end. All the fundamentals of video editing, including reordering, trimming, and enhancing your footage, are available. To preview how your adjustments will turn out, you can also play your project at any point in the timeline.</p>
<h3 id="Add-clips-to-timeline"><a href="#Add-clips-to-timeline" class="headerlink" title="Add clips to timeline"></a>Add clips to timeline</h3><p>When you have grasped the idea behind a timeline, the next step you need to follow is to add clips into your timeline. Before adding clips to your timeline, it is suggested that you label each clip. Although it does seem like a lot of work, it will be easier to locate all of the clips later on if you’re working on a large project. after the footages are gathered and named, add important clips in the beginning of the timeline to begin establishing the video’s overall structure and order.</p>
<h3 id="Editing-tools"><a href="#Editing-tools" class="headerlink" title="Editing tools"></a>Editing tools</h3><p>Besides basic cutting, trimming and cropping, video editing software offer multiple professional editing tools which enhance the outlook your videos and make them 10x better. For example, instead of cutting up a clip into a bunch of small clips and unwanted gaps, use the Ripple Edit tool keep your timeline clean. This means when a clip is trimmed, it causes a ripple effect throughout the rest of your timeline, shifting all other clips into a new timeline position.</p>
<p>Similarly, when working with lengthy timelines, the Razor tool is also really helpful because you can select the clip you wish to cut by dragging your razor over it. So, the Razor cut is the tool to use if you need to make a lot of cuts in your videos quickly.</p>
<h3 id="Syncing-audio-and-video"><a href="#Syncing-audio-and-video" class="headerlink" title="Syncing audio and video"></a>Syncing audio and video</h3><p>You already know how annoying it can be if audio and video don’t sync while you’re listening to a podcast or viewing a YouTube vlog. The video editing software offer helpful manual and auto sync tools.

<h2 id="How-to-Blur-Part-of-a-Video-Using-OpenShot"><a href="#How-to-Blur-Part-of-a-Video-Using-OpenShot" class="headerlink" title="How to Blur Part of a Video Using OpenShot"></a>How to Blur Part of a Video Using OpenShot</h2><p>Designed for Windows, Mac, and Linux, OpenShot is a free, open-source, and cross-platform video editor. While there’s no predefined function or filter in this tool to help you blur part of a video, OpenShot has another way of blurring static parts of your video: it uses an image.</p>
<p>OpenShot blur part of video is free, and you’ll use its open-source programs as a base program for the edition of the video and GIMP Image Manipulation software to edit photos. Follow the guide below to learn how to blur out something in a video using OpenShot.</p>
<p>Step 1: Download OpenShot and install it on your device.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-12.png"
                      alt="blur part of a video using openshot"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Take a screenshot from your video, where the part you want to blur is easily visible. You can do this by going to a relevant frame and utilizing Save Current Frame with a camera icon, located on the right side of the video preview window in a standard program configuration.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-11.png"
                      alt="blur part of a video using openshot"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: Be sure to save your video screenshot on your computer.</p>
<p>Step 4: Since you have exported a relevant frame from your video as a screenshot, you need to open it in a photo editor that can handle PNG pics and transparency, like the GIMP Image Manipulation program. Use any selection tool to select the area of the picture you want to blur on the video. Depending on your preferences, you can choose the free select tool, the ellipse select tool, or the rectangle select tool.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-13.png"
                      alt="blur part of a video using openshot - select blur area"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5: In the blur filters submenu, open the Pixelize tool and adjust the options that suit your preferences. You can use CTRL-Z to cancel the operation, and repeat it until you find the best combination of blurring settings.</p>
<p>Step 6: When you are satisfied with blurring, right-click on the blurred area and select Invert in the Select submenu; this will allow you to select the entire part of the frame that has not been blurred, which is the part you would like to get rid of because you will only have to use the blurred part of your video overlay where necessary.</p>
<p>Step 7: Now, cut the section of the picture you do not want to keep. You can do this by using CTRL-X. The blurred filter for your video is now ready.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-14.png"
                      alt="blur part of a video using openshot - cut unwanted section"
                ></p>
<p>Step 8: If after cutting you notice a plain color rather than a checkerboard canvas representing transparency, use CTRL-Z to cancel the cut. Then, use CTRL-I to invert the selection again to get control of the blurred selection again, and copy or cut it using CTRL-X or CTRL-C.</p>
<p>Step 9: Create another image using CTRL-N, and ensure you have navigated to the advanced options and selected transparency as the fill-in color, and paste your selection there.</p>
<p>Step 10: You now have a perfect photo with full transparency, which is represented by a checkerboard canvas, except for the section of the video frames you would like to blur that should be pixelized.</p>
<p>Step 11: Use the Export option under the File menu to export the photo to your PC as a . PNG file. To save a picture with a transparency channel, you need to use the . PNG extension.</p>
<p>Step 12: Now return to OpenShot video editor and import the generated picture with a pixelized portion in the OpenShot video project. Next, add the picture as an overlay track. Make sure it’s above the video track.</p>
<p>Step 13: If the program asks you to import the photo as an image sequence, select the NO option because you need to import a still photo, and not a video sequence.</p>
<p>Step 14: The picture will be displayed before the video, blurring only the portion of the video where you modified the frame. The other parts of the video won’t be touched. You can make adjustments to ensure the picture track is only displayed at required moments. And that’s how to blur part of a video using OpenShot.</p>

While there’s no predefined function or filter in this tool to help you blur part of a video, OpenShot has another way of blurring static parts of your video: it uses an image.</p>
<p>OpenShot blur part of video is free, and you’ll use its open-source programs as a base program for the edition of the video and GIMP Image Manipulation software to edit photos. Follow the guide below to learn how to blur out something in a video using OpenShot.</p>
<p>Step 1: Download OpenShot and install it on your device.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-12.png"
                      alt="blur part of a video using openshot"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Take a screenshot from your video, where the part you want to blur is easily visible. You can do this by going to a relevant frame and utilizing Save Current Frame with a camera icon, located on the right side of the video preview window in a standard program configuration.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-11.png"
                      alt="blur part of a video using openshot"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: Be sure to save your video screenshot on your computer.</p>
<p>Step 4: Since you have exported a relevant frame from your video as a screenshot, you need to open it in a photo editor that can handle PNG pics and transparency, like the GIMP Image Manipulation program. Use any selection tool to select the area of the picture you want to blur on the video. Depending on your preferences, you can choose the free select tool, the ellipse select tool, or the rectangle select tool.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-13.png"
                      alt="blur part of a video using openshot - select blur area"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5: In the blur filters submenu, open the Pixelize tool and adjust the options that suit your preferences. You can use CTRL-Z to cancel the operation, and repeat it until you find the best combination of blurring settings.</p>
<p>Step 6: When you are satisfied with blurring, right-click on the blurred area and select Invert in the Select submenu; this will allow you to select the entire part of the frame that has not been blurred, which is the part you would like to get rid of because you will only have to use the blurred part of your video overlay where necessary.</p>
<p>Step 7: Now, cut the section of the picture you do not want to keep. You can do this by using CTRL-X. The blurred filter for your video is now ready.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-14.png"
                      alt="blur part of a video using openshot - cut unwanted section"
                ></p>
<p>Step 8: If after cutting you notice a plain color rather than a checkerboard canvas representing transparency, use CTRL-Z to cancel the cut. Then, use CTRL-I to invert the selection again to get control of the blurred selection again, and copy or cut it using CTRL-X or CTRL-C.</p>
<p>Step 9: Create another image using CTRL-N, and ensure you have navigated to the advanced options and selected transparency as the fill-in color, and paste your selection there.</p>
<p>Step 10: You now have a perfect photo with full transparency, which is represented by a checkerboard canvas, except for the section of the video frames you would like to blur that should be pixelized.</p>
<p>Step 11: Use the Export option under the File menu to export the photo to your PC as a . PNG file. To save a picture with a transparency channel, you need to use the . PNG extension.</p>
<p>Step 12: Now return to OpenShot video editor and import the generated picture with a pixelized portion in the OpenShot video project. Next, add the picture as an overlay track. Make sure it’s above the video track.</p>
<p>Step 13: If the program asks you to import the photo as an image sequence, select the NO option because you need to import a still photo, and not a video sequence.</p>
<p>Step 14: The picture will be displayed before the video, blurring only the portion of the video where you modified the frame. The other parts of the video won’t be touched. You can make adjustments to ensure the picture track is only displayed at required moments. And that’s how to blur part of a video using OpenShot.</p>

<h2 id="How-to-Blur-Part-of-a-Video-Using-OpenShot-3"><a href="#How-to-Blur-Part-of-a-Video-Using-OpenShot-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Blur Part of a Video Using OpenShot"></a>How to Blur Part of a Video Using OpenShot</h2><p>Designed for Windows, Mac, and Linux, OpenShot is a free, open-source, and cross-platform video editor. While there’s no predefined function or filter in this tool to help you blur part of a video, OpenShot has another way of blurring static parts of your video: it uses an image.</p>
<p>OpenShot blur part of video is free, and you’ll use its open-source programs as a base program for the edition of the video and GIMP Image Manipulation software to edit photos. Follow the guide below to learn how to blur out something in a video using OpenShot.</p>
<p>Step 1: Download OpenShot and install it on your device.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-12.png"
                      alt="blur part of a video using openshot"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Take a screenshot from your video, where the part you want to blur is easily visible. You can do this by going to a relevant frame and utilizing Save Current Frame with a camera icon, located on the right side of the video preview window in a standard program configuration.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-11.png"
                      alt="blur part of a video using openshot"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: Be sure to save your video screenshot on your computer.</p>
<p>Step 4: Since you have exported a relevant frame from your video as a screenshot, you need to open it in a photo editor that can handle PNG pics and transparency, like the GIMP Image Manipulation program. Use any selection tool to select the area of the picture you want to blur on the video. Depending on your preferences, you can choose the free select tool, the ellipse select tool, or the rectangle select tool.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-13.png"
                      alt="blur part of a video using openshot - select blur area"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5: In the blur filters submenu, open the Pixelize tool and adjust the options that suit your preferences. You can use CTRL-Z to cancel the operation, and repeat it until you find the best combination of blurring settings.</p>
<p>Step 6: When you are satisfied with blurring, right-click on the blurred area and select Invert in the Select submenu; this will allow you to select the entire part of the frame that has not been blurred, which is the part you would like to get rid of because you will only have to use the blurred part of your video overlay where necessary.</p>
<p>Step 7: Now, cut the section of the picture you do not want to keep. You can do this by using CTRL-X. The blurred filter for your video is now ready.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-14.png"
                      alt="blur part of a video using openshot - cut unwanted section"
                ></p>
<p>Step 8: If after cutting you notice a plain color rather than a checkerboard canvas representing transparency, use CTRL-Z to cancel the cut. Then, use CTRL-I to invert the selection again to get control of the blurred selection again, and copy or cut it using CTRL-X or CTRL-C.</p>
<p>Step 9: Create another image using CTRL-N, and ensure you have navigated to the advanced options and selected transparency as the fill-in color, and paste your selection there.</p>
<p>Step 10: You now have a perfect photo with full transparency, which is represented by a checkerboard canvas, except for the section of the video frames you would like to blur that should be pixelized.</p>
<p>Step 11: Use the Export option under the File menu to export the photo to your PC as a . PNG file. To save a picture with a transparency channel, you need to use the . PNG extension.</p>
<p>Step 12: Now return to OpenShot video editor and import the generated picture with a pixelized portion in the OpenShot video project. Next, add the picture as an overlay track. Make sure it’s above the video track.</p>
<p>Step 13: If the program asks you to import the photo as an image sequence, select the NO option because you need to import a still photo, and not a video sequence.</p>
<p>Step 14: The picture will be displayed before the video, blurring only the portion of the video where you modified the frame. The other parts of the video won’t be touched. You can make adjustments to ensure the picture track is only displayed at required moments. And that’s how to blur part of a video using OpenShot.</p>
