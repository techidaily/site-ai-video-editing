<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Make-Cloth-Appearance"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Make-Cloth-Appearance" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Make Cloth Appearance"></a>Part 2: How to Make Cloth Appearance</h2><p>Let’s start with the first one. Before you start, make sure you put the camera on a tripod or a steady surface, so it doesn’t move while filming.</p>
<p>Step1 For the first shot, you must throw a jacket on a stool. Make sure it lands on the stool or wherever your talent is going to sit.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_1.jpg"
                      alt="throw a jacket on a stool"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Make a shot of your talent appearing from where the jacket landed. You can add some acting skills to make this shot more realistic.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_2.jpg"
                      alt="make a shot of your talent appearing"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 Download Filmora to edit your footage. You can get started by going to their official website.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_3.jpg"
                      alt="download filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 Now split the first clip on the frame where your jacket lands on the stool. Place it on the first track.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_4.jpg"
                      alt="split the first clip on the frame"
                ></p>
<p>Step5 Trim the second shot until the talents start acting and place it on the second track to match the first clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_5.jpg"
                      alt="trim the second shot"
                ></p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Make-an-Explosion-Appearance"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Make-an-Explosion-Appearance" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Make an Explosion Appearance"></a>Part 3: How to Make an Explosion Appearance</h2><p>Step1 This effect is the easiest. You need to film the empty plate with just a background. Then let the talent enter the frame and jump into the place.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_6.jpg"
                      alt="let the talent enter the frame"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Now import the clip into Filmora and place it onto the first video track.</p>
<p>Step3 Freeze the frame of the empty plate with just the background and extend it as necessary. Place the clip onto the second video track and trim it until the action of the talent jump starts.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_7.jpg"
                      alt="freeze the frame of the empty plate"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 Delete the rest on the left. The trick is to use some explosion or smoke effect to hide the transition.</p>
<p>Step5 Use the green screen sample in the default menu here. Add some smoke effects available in film stock. Place it on the third video track and move it to hide the transition.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="use the green screen sample"
                ></p>
<h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Make-Roof-Appearance"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Make-Roof-Appearance" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Make Roof Appearance"></a>Part 4: How to Make Roof Appearance</h2><p>The last trick here is combining the techniques from the two previous effects.</p>
<p>Step1 First, record the empty plate with just a background. Let the talent jump in the frame and set up a green screen for the talent to jump in front of it. It will look like they’re falling from the ceiling.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_9.jpg"
                      alt="record the empty plate"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Now import the clip into Filmora again. Follow the steps from the second example so we have the subject appearing on the screen like this.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_10.jpg"
                      alt="import the clip into filmora again"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 Add the green screenshot onto the third video track.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_11.jpg"
                      alt="add the green screenshot onto the third video track"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 Double-click on it, activate the setting window and then key out the background using the chroma key feature.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_12.jpg"
                      alt="activate the setting window "
                ></p>
<p>Step5 Move the clip until it covers only the first frame of the appearing clip. Now keyframe the following subject from the outer frame to the final position.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_13.jpg"
                      alt="move the clip"
                ></p>
<p>Step6 Now search for some smoke effects and put it upside down. So it looks like the ceiling is broken when the subject falls. Then add some camera shake to the fall.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_14.jpg"
                      alt="search for some smoke effects"
                ></p>
<p>Step7 Drag the camera shake effect back to the top track and shorten it to an ideal length. You can also add some sound effects if you want to this video.</p>

<p>Intellectuals frequently complain that everyone has attention deficit disorder due to the Internet. According to studies, we only have an attention span of 8 seconds today. You need a punchy, concise message to keep viewers watching your video.</p>
<p><strong>2. Don’t Forget to Smile</strong></p>
<p>Individuals who smile frequently are perceived to be more confident and successful. Therefore, showing your audience that you are confident in your company and services is the best method to gain their trust.</p>
<p><strong>3. Look into the Camera</strong></p>
<p>Direct eye contact with the camera lens is essential. Although it may seem enticing, your sole audience is the person directly in front of you when you’re speaking.</p>
<p>Be mindful of the camera’s confined area. Bring it up to eye level and keep your gaze there rather than elsewhere.</p>
<h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>There are several fantastic camera effects that you can experiment with in your videos. While some are well-known, others are less well-known and often used. We have mentioned the three fun ways to appear on camera above. We suggest using video editing software like Filmora to use these effects more effectively. You can use these appearance effects to create an atmosphere, make your story more understandable, or spice up the video.</p>
