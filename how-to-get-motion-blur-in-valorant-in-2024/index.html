Thus, to create <strong>motion blur Valorant</strong>, you can modify the settings of the recorder while recording your gameplay. To use the recording settings for creating a motion blur effect, here are useful instructions:</p>
<p>Step1 Before recording your gameplay, open your recorder and head to its settings. From there, go to the “Output” section and change the video format to MP4. Once done, make sure to select “NIVIDIA” as your encoder. Moreover, choose “CQP” as your rate control and set 20 as the value of the CQ level.</p>

                      alt="set the output settings"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 On the same window, select your preset as “Max Performance” and profile as “High.” Now go to the “Video” tab and select the value of base resolution and output resolution as “1920x1080”. Choose the numerator as 300 and the denominator as 1. Make sure that the minimum value of the numerator should not less than 180.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step3 Now head to the “Advanced” tab and select process priority as “Below Normal.” Now head to the “Recording” section below and select the filename formatting according to your need. You can also adjust the settings of the stream display and automatically reconnect, preferably. Once done with all the recorder settings, click on the “OK” button.</p>

It all started when I filmed a certain place during a trip and somebody told me to upload it on YouTube. At first, I was hesitant doing that because I have no clue of what is YouTube. So, I did research and got curious, so I decided to upload the video. Time went by and I started to learn how to vlog.</p>

<li>The body of the vlog – the part wherein you’re explaining everything in depth, elaborating things about the topic you chose to share. In this part, you can insert the so called <strong>“<strong>call of action</strong>“</strong> - wherein you can tell your viewers to subscribe, to like and comment something about your vlog you’re tackling.

It’s a hobby that at the same time, I’m learning something new on the process. And also, with the help of vlogging, I’m starting to gain my self-esteem that I forgot for many years back.</p>

<p>What Have I Encountered on the Way</p>
<p>It’s not easy to become a Youtuber, because you, yourself is the only one that you’ve got. You are the director – managing everything all at once. The artist (youtuber) - the one who’s going to talk in front of the camera. The scriptwriter – the one who’s in charge of the whole story of the video and even the editor- the one who’ll edit the video afterwards.</p>
<p>On YouTube platform, you have to be consistent. It doesn’t mean that you need to upload a video thrice in a week, but even a video will do. After all, it’s quality over quantity. You’ll have to think what kind of video you’ll upload because you need to give your viewers or audiences something significant out of your vlog. YouTube is the second largest search engine next to Google, so most of the people are searching for answers to their questions. Or even searching solutions to their problems. So, if you have something to offer, why not share it for free.</p>
<p>If you’re a new YouTuber, you don’t need to have high-end equipment’s for vlogging. Anyone can start up by using his&#x2F;her mobile phone. I used to vlog using my Samsung S-6. Mobile phone nowadays, can record a high-definition resolution. You can add a tripod so that your phone can be sturdy during your filming session. Just film during day time so that you can minimize yourself from buying a ring light. A lavalier microphone can be a useful add-on so that your viewers or audiences can hear your voice clearly.</p>
<h2 id="4-What-to-Do-As-a-YouTuber"><a href="#4-What-to-Do-As-a-YouTuber" class="headerlink" title="4. What to Do As a YouTuber"></a>4. What to Do As a YouTuber</h2><p>As a Youtuber, you should find your own niche. Something that you’re passionate about. Something denoting products, services, or interests that appeal to a small, specialized section of the population. Something that you’re a hundred percent that you can deliver to them loud and clear.</p>

<p>What to Do As a YouTuber</p>
<p>As a YouTuber, you should be yourself in front of the camera. At first it will be awkward, but in time you’ll get used to it. Speak with your heart and not with your mind because when you start to think of the things that you need to say, you’ll get distracted. But when you speak whatever is in your heart at that very moment, you can create miracles and wonders.</p>
<p>It’s okay that you stutter once in a while. Even a reporter experiencing that kind of phenomena and besides, no one is perfect. Everything that you said unnecessarily can be omitted during the editing process. During editing, the first thing that you need to do is to put all the raw videos in your video editor’s timeline. Cut all the unnecessary part specially the so called, <strong>“<strong>dead air</strong>“</strong> or the part that you’re starting to think and not to talk at all. And your viewers can only see are all dead silence. After that you can add your personal touch. You can add your watermark (your trademark in other words), lower third green screens, subtitle if necessary (the hardest part to be honest) if you’re doing it manually. Some cool stickers, effects and transitions.</p>

It has a user-friendly interface that even a person with zero experience on editing can fully understand it’s incredible features easily.</p>

<p>Text-to-speech (TTS) is a type of assistive technology that reads digital text aloud. It’s sometimes called “read aloud” technology. This technology has evolved to the point of being inculcated or introduced directly to some video editing applications without having to visit a separate text-to-speech application or software for support. This article therefore aims at discussing ten video makers that have inbuilt the text-to-speech feature.</p>

<p>FEATURES</p>
<p>After reviewing both versions (Android and iOS) of CapCut, we found that the app is indeed easy to use and includes a ton of attractive features designed for TikTok users. Would we recommend it to you? Yes, definitely, but with some caveats.</p>
<ul>
<li>Split function: This is similar to trimming where you have to separate the clip in order to define your desired part of the clip. Your clip can be further extended after splitting, so it’s just a process of simple trimming in editing.</li>
<li>Video overlay: This feature helps you place a video on another video. Those who do this often are those who have reaction channels, online teachers and gamers. This feature helps the viewers to simultaneously comprehend explanations the main video content alongside the reaction or explanation.</li>
<li>Speed control: This feature aids speed ramping. You can slow down your video and increase the speed just as you want. One thing to have in mind is when you plan to edit such a video, you have to shoot in a high resolution and high frame rate like 30-60fps so as to avoid the amateurish look.</li>
<li>Reverse video: The reverse feature helps you to rewind your clip to create the effect you have pictured in your mind while shooting.</li>
<li>Music library: CapCut comes with an impressive collection of royalty-free music and sound effects that can really make a huge difference to your videos. The tracks have a high quality and you can effortlessly insert them into your video to create the feel you desire.</li>
<li>Filters: Choose from various filters to soften or sharpen your videos and make them more professional-looking. There are color-based and season-based filters, as well as a range of beautification tools to enhance video quality. Filters can also be used effectively if you have multiple clips that have color variations or different contrast and brightness levels. Since you can’t edit most of these in CapCut, you can avoid having to use a desktop editor by choosing the right filters and applying them to all your clips to bring some uniformity.</li>
<li>Effects: There’s a collection of effects you can select from to appeal to the visual cravings of your audience. This will add colour to your content as it makes your viewers involved in the video. These effects include split-screen, retro, comic, party, dreamy, and so on. These effects will make your video look fresh and professionally edited.</li>
<li>Stickers and text: Stickers could be fun to use due to their expressive nature. Your choice as a content creator will go a long way in determining the fascination of your content. CapCut has therefore had you covered when it comes to adding fun features to your content to make it more interactive and exciting. Stickers and texts are therefore engaging tools you can employ to drive the fantasy of your audience. Also, it creates room for more details to be added without necessarily having to introduce more audio contents especially. With this feature, you can literally do more with less using CapCut.</li>

<h2 id="Capture-the-moment-and-Cut-1"><a href="#Capture-the-moment-and-Cut-1" class="headerlink" title="Capture the moment and Cut"></a>Capture the moment and Cut</h2><p>CapCut is a free all-in-one video editing app that helps you create amazing videos. It is a mobile app for iOS and Android devices which is easy to use in terms of creating your content. It makes your cutting, reversing and speed change easier than ever when you get it right to produce incredible results as you share on social media. You can make your video captivating by adding features such as filters, stickers, speed changes, background music, effects, split, reverse and more to make your wonderful moments more polished and professional.</p>
<p>FEATURES</p>
<p>After reviewing both versions (Android and iOS) of CapCut, we found that the app is indeed easy to use and includes a ton of attractive features designed for TikTok users. Would we recommend it to you? Yes, definitely, but with some caveats.</p>
<ul>
<li>Split function: This is similar to trimming where you have to separate the clip in order to define your desired part of the clip. Your clip can be further extended after splitting, so it’s just a process of simple trimming in editing.</li>
<li>Video overlay: This feature helps you place a video on another video. Those who do this often are those who have reaction channels, online teachers and gamers. This feature helps the viewers to simultaneously comprehend explanations the main video content alongside the reaction or explanation.</li>
<li>Speed control: This feature aids speed ramping. You can slow down your video and increase the speed just as you want. One thing to have in mind is when you plan to edit such a video, you have to shoot in a high resolution and high frame rate like 30-60fps so as to avoid the amateurish look.</li>
<li>Reverse video: The reverse feature helps you to rewind your clip to create the effect you have pictured in your mind while shooting.</li>
<li>Music library: CapCut comes with an impressive collection of royalty-free music and sound effects that can really make a huge difference to your videos. The tracks have a high quality and you can effortlessly insert them into your video to create the feel you desire.</li>
<li>Filters: Choose from various filters to soften or sharpen your videos and make them more professional-looking. There are color-based and season-based filters, as well as a range of beautification tools to enhance video quality. Filters can also be used effectively if you have multiple clips that have color variations or different contrast and brightness levels. Since you can’t edit most of these in CapCut, you can avoid having to use a desktop editor by choosing the right filters and applying them to all your clips to bring some uniformity.</li>
<li>Effects: There’s a collection of effects you can select from to appeal to the visual cravings of your audience. This will add colour to your content as it makes your viewers involved in the video. These effects include split-screen, retro, comic, party, dreamy, and so on. These effects will make your video look fresh and professionally edited.</li>
<li>Stickers and text: Stickers could be fun to use due to their expressive nature. Your choice as a content creator will go a long way in determining the fascination of your content. CapCut has therefore had you covered when it comes to adding fun features to your content to make it more interactive and exciting. Stickers and texts are therefore engaging tools you can employ to drive the fantasy of your audience. Also, it creates room for more details to be added without necessarily having to introduce more audio contents especially. With this feature, you can literally do more with less using CapCut.</li>

<p>Text-to-speech (TTS) is a type of assistive technology that reads digital text aloud. It’s sometimes called “read aloud” technology. This technology has evolved to the point of being inculcated or introduced directly to some video editing applications without having to visit a separate text-to-speech application or software for support. This article therefore aims at discussing ten video makers that have inbuilt the text-to-speech feature.</p>

It is a mobile app for iOS and Android devices which is easy to use in terms of creating your content. It makes your cutting, reversing and speed change easier than ever when you get it right to produce incredible results as you share on social media. You can make your video captivating by adding features such as filters, stickers, speed changes, background music, effects, split, reverse and more to make your wonderful moments more polished and professional.</p>
<p>FEATURES</p>
<p>After reviewing both versions (Android and iOS) of CapCut, we found that the app is indeed easy to use and includes a ton of attractive features designed for TikTok users. Would we recommend it to you? Yes, definitely, but with some caveats.</p>
<ul>
<li>Split function: This is similar to trimming where you have to separate the clip in order to define your desired part of the clip. Your clip can be further extended after splitting, so it’s just a process of simple trimming in editing.</li>
<li>Video overlay: This feature helps you place a video on another video. Those who do this often are those who have reaction channels, online teachers and gamers. This feature helps the viewers to simultaneously comprehend explanations the main video content alongside the reaction or explanation.</li>
<li>Speed control: This feature aids speed ramping. You can slow down your video and increase the speed just as you want. One thing to have in mind is when you plan to edit such a video, you have to shoot in a high resolution and high frame rate like 30-60fps so as to avoid the amateurish look.</li>
<li>Reverse video: The reverse feature helps you to rewind your clip to create the effect you have pictured in your mind while shooting.</li>
<li>Music library: CapCut comes with an impressive collection of royalty-free music and sound effects that can really make a huge difference to your videos. The tracks have a high quality and you can effortlessly insert them into your video to create the feel you desire.</li>
<li>Filters: Choose from various filters to soften or sharpen your videos and make them more professional-looking. There are color-based and season-based filters, as well as a range of beautification tools to enhance video quality. Filters can also be used effectively if you have multiple clips that have color variations or different contrast and brightness levels. Since you can’t edit most of these in CapCut, you can avoid having to use a desktop editor by choosing the right filters and applying them to all your clips to bring some uniformity.</li>
<li>Effects: There’s a collection of effects you can select from to appeal to the visual cravings of your audience. This will add colour to your content as it makes your viewers involved in the video. These effects include split-screen, retro, comic, party, dreamy, and so on. These effects will make your video look fresh and professionally edited.</li>
<li>Stickers and text: Stickers could be fun to use due to their expressive nature. Your choice as a content creator will go a long way in determining the fascination of your content. CapCut has therefore had you covered when it comes to adding fun features to your content to make it more interactive and exciting. Stickers and texts are therefore engaging tools you can employ to drive the fantasy of your audience. Also, it creates room for more details to be added without necessarily having to introduce more audio contents especially. With this feature, you can literally do more with less using CapCut.</li>

This technology has evolved to the point of being inculcated or introduced directly to some video editing applications without having to visit a separate text-to-speech application or software for support. This article therefore aims at discussing ten video makers that have inbuilt the text-to-speech feature.</p>

It is a mobile app for iOS and Android devices which is easy to use in terms of creating your content. It makes your cutting, reversing and speed change easier than ever when you get it right to produce incredible results as you share on social media. You can make your video captivating by adding features such as filters, stickers, speed changes, background music, effects, split, reverse and more to make your wonderful moments more polished and professional.</p>
<p>FEATURES</p>
<p>After reviewing both versions (Android and iOS) of CapCut, we found that the app is indeed easy to use and includes a ton of attractive features designed for TikTok users. Would we recommend it to you? Yes, definitely, but with some caveats.</p>
<ul>
<li>Split function: This is similar to trimming where you have to separate the clip in order to define your desired part of the clip. Your clip can be further extended after splitting, so it’s just a process of simple trimming in editing.</li>
<li>Video overlay: This feature helps you place a video on another video. Those who do this often are those who have reaction channels, online teachers and gamers. This feature helps the viewers to simultaneously comprehend explanations the main video content alongside the reaction or explanation.</li>
<li>Speed control: This feature aids speed ramping. You can slow down your video and increase the speed just as you want. One thing to have in mind is when you plan to edit such a video, you have to shoot in a high resolution and high frame rate like 30-60fps so as to avoid the amateurish look.</li>
<li>Reverse video: The reverse feature helps you to rewind your clip to create the effect you have pictured in your mind while shooting.</li>
<li>Music library: CapCut comes with an impressive collection of royalty-free music and sound effects that can really make a huge difference to your videos. The tracks have a high quality and you can effortlessly insert them into your video to create the feel you desire.</li>
<li>Filters: Choose from various filters to soften or sharpen your videos and make them more professional-looking. There are color-based and season-based filters, as well as a range of beautification tools to enhance video quality. Filters can also be used effectively if you have multiple clips that have color variations or different contrast and brightness levels. Since you can’t edit most of these in CapCut, you can avoid having to use a desktop editor by choosing the right filters and applying them to all your clips to bring some uniformity.</li>
<li>Effects: There’s a collection of effects you can select from to appeal to the visual cravings of your audience. This will add colour to your content as it makes your viewers involved in the video. These effects include split-screen, retro, comic, party, dreamy, and so on. These effects will make your video look fresh and professionally edited.</li>
<li>Stickers and text: Stickers could be fun to use due to their expressive nature. Your choice as a content creator will go a long way in determining the fascination of your content. CapCut has therefore had you covered when it comes to adding fun features to your content to make it more interactive and exciting. Stickers and texts are therefore engaging tools you can employ to drive the fantasy of your audience. Also, it creates room for more details to be added without necessarily having to introduce more audio contents especially. With this feature, you can literally do more with less using CapCut.</li>

While using TikTok, you may find the need to highlight a certain section of the video that you’ve recorded to make it visible to users. It may be something that needs to be shown out of curiosity. To understand <strong>how to zoom in on TikTok after recording,</strong> go through the detailed steps presented as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> You need to start the process of downloading and installing TikTok on your device. Launch it on your phone and proceed by clicking the “+” icon on the bottom of the screen to record or create a new video across TikTok.</p>

                ></p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Find yourselves on the editing page of TikTok with a list of multiple editing options across the screen. Click on the “Effects” button and find the “Zoom” effect across the available list. To find the effect, let the editor cursor of the video reach the point where you want to add the Zoom in effect. Once it reaches the point of the video, hold the “Zoom” effect button for the specific time that you want to add the effect to your video. You can then conclude editing your video on TikTok and proceed to save it.</p>

<li>This puts you in more control of the video rather than improvising the need to zoom in on a video during recording.</li>
<li>Zoom into the specific part or portion of the video that you find necessary for covering the purpose. You cannot perform such actions while recording a video since the recording is quite restricted across a device.</li>
<li>Adding zoom in effect across the video gives it a proper effect that enhances the quality rather than depreciating it.</li>

<li>If you put in a zoom in effect on your video, this cannot be reverted back or zoomed out.</li>
<li>The frame rate of the video is heavily damaged by using such effects across your recorded video. As this is done through the software, there is a guaranteed decrease in the quality output of the video.</li>

This, however, had its disadvantages which have been featured above. As you are aware of these drawbacks, it is necessary for you to go through other options that are proficient and better for users on a similar scale.</p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> has made its name as a video editor in the market. With simple tools like adding zoom in effects across videos, it makes it software accessible for all users. Find out <strong>how to zoom in on TikTok</strong> using Wondershare Filmora with the steps exclaimed as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Download and Install Wondershare Filmora</strong></p>
<p>For starters, you need to download and install the latest version of Wondershare Filmora across your computer. Once installed, launch the platform and click on “New Project” to start working on a project from scratch.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="create a new filmora project"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Upload Video</strong></p>
<p>As a new canvas opens on your front, you need to click on the “Arrow Head” icon under the “Media” tab to import the video file from TikTok that needs to be zoomed in.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/zoom-in-on-tiktok-videos-5.jpg"
                      alt="import tiktok video"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Cut Video Part to Slow Zoom</strong></p>
<p>Dissect the specific part of the video that you want to put in the slow zoom feature from Filmora. Take the red indicator across the timeline to the point where you want to start the specific part. Click the split icon on the red line to divide the video. Drag the indicator to the point where you want to end the specific part of the video for the slow zoom feature.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="split the tiktok video"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Set the Speed of the Clip</strong></p>
<p>Select the split part of the video and find the “Speed” icon on the edit menu at the top of the timeline. Select an appropriate speed that you want to work according to. You can find speeds as low as 0.5x in the ‘Slow’ section and speeds as high as 2x in the ‘Fast’ section.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="set your tiktok video speed"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Add Animation Keyframes</strong></p>
<p>To add animation keyframes, right-click on a certain clip of the TikTok video and select the “Add Animation” button from the option of “Animation” in the drop-down menu. Go across the “Customize” section in the “Animation” tab across the menu that opens up and move the indicator where you want to create a keyframe. Click on “Add’ and find a keyframe added to the video. Move the indicator further along the clip to add another animation, as two keyframes create an animation keyframe.</p>

                      alt="add animation keyframe to video"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Scale Clip Edge</strong></p>
<p>Once you are done adjusting your TikTok video, it is time to scale the clip according to your required settings. Double-click on the video to open a new set of settings on your front. Proceed by opening the menu of “Transform” across the menu. Find the “Scale” option in the provided list and adjust the scale settings as required. Once you are done, click on the “Export” button to conclude the process.</p>
