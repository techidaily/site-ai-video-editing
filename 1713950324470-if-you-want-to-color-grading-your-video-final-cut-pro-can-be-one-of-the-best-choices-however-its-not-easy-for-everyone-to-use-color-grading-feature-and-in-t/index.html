However, It’s Not Easy for Everyone to Use Color Grading Feature, and in This Guide We’ll Show You How to Do That"></a>If You Want to Color Grading Your Video, Final Cut Pro Can Be One of the Best Choices. However, It’s Not Easy for Everyone to Use Color Grading Feature, and in This Guide We’ll Show You How to Do That</h2><p>Have you ever questioned the purpose of those odd video scopes or how to build super grades from the start in Final Cut Pro? In contrast to editing talents, color grading is a technical and difficult ability that takes practice.</p>
<p>In order to help, we decided to compile a thorough beginner’s article to color grading in Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p>With that said, let’s begin!</p>
<h2 id="1-Discover-how-you-color-grade-in-Final-Cut-Pro"><a href="#1-Discover-how-you-color-grade-in-Final-Cut-Pro" class="headerlink" title="1. Discover how you color grade in Final Cut Pro"></a>1. Discover how you color grade in Final Cut Pro</h2><p>Color grading may be a tedious and time-consuming operation, therefore it’s a skill set that calls for a lot of patience. Some editors won’t conduct any color grading or correction beyond the bare minimum. But even mundane-looking film may look remarkable if you know how to give it a dramatic touch.</p>
<p>A more cinematic grade requires a number of procedures, and there is no one method that works for all situations. We’ll therefore walk you through the process of creating a cinematic color grade in Final Cut Pro, but depending on your material, you might need to add or omit some phases.</p>
<h5 id="Step1Filming"><a href="#Step1Filming" class="headerlink" title="Step1Filming"></a>Step1Filming</h5><p>Since the raw video is essential for producing a cinematic image, an outstanding grade begins with the camera.</p>
<p>Use the greatest quality settings your camera offers while recording your video; the more information in your picture, the more you can manipulate it during grading.</p>
<p>While it may seem preferable to shoot with as much color as you can, using a duller color profile is very necessary. Your camera will have color settings, and although the washed-out, drab appearance may not inspire confidence in you, it will offer you a lot more editing possibility.</p>
<h5 id="Step2Create-a-color-profile"><a href="#Step2Create-a-color-profile" class="headerlink" title="Step2Create a color profile"></a>Step2Create a color profile</h5><p>After importing your film, you may be concerned about the general dull look of your recordings. The reason for that is because you have not yet matched the color profile of your sequence to the one of your camera. To start on this process, it goes as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>Drag your clip onto your timeline and make sure it is selected. Click on the Inspector icon.</li>
<li>Then click on the Information tab of the clip.</li>
<li>Navigate all the way down through the options to find the Color LUT option.</li>
<li>Then choose the Color profile that matches your clip based on the camera it is filmed with.</li>
<li>You’re done!</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="Step3Checking-the-scopes"><a href="#Step3Checking-the-scopes" class="headerlink" title="Step3Checking the scopes"></a>Step3Checking the scopes</h5><p>The Scopes in Final Cut Pro are panels that display the color information of your shots. They are quite complicated and can be difficult to comprehend if you did not use them ever before. You can activate Video Scopes by clicking View &gt; Show in Viewer &gt; Video Scopes from the View menu. The three components of grading are the highlights, mid-tones, and shadows. Your highlights are shown at the top and your shadows are at the bottom in all grading tools and scopes.</p>
<h2 id="2-Include-Color-Wheels"><a href="#2-Include-Color-Wheels" class="headerlink" title="2. Include Color Wheels"></a>2. Include Color Wheels</h2><p>Now that your setup is complete, you can begin grading your footage. Grading is done in multiple layers stacked on top of each other. It may take multiple levels to create the desired look. Follow the instructions below to modify your settings to match your clip if you want to give your footage a cinematic look.</p>
<p>You may access a wider range of color manipulation tools with the built-in color wheels, exposure adjustments, including isolation of color selection, RGB modifications across tone ranges, and simple masking.</p>
<h2 id="3-Color-board"><a href="#3-Color-board" class="headerlink" title="3. Color board"></a>3. Color board</h2><p>A vertical color spectrum is shown on the Color Board, and it is intersected by a horizontal line that features four nodes. These are the ranges of the footage that are designated as the Highlights, Midtones, and Shadows, respectively.</p>
<p>Adjusting a node to a new color space has an immediate and noticeable impact on the corresponding section of the image. If you move above the horizontal line, it will increase, and if you go below the line, it will decrease.</p>
<p>You also have control over the Saturation and Exposure settings. These are wonderful to have if you want to increase the contrast in your photographs and make particular colors more vivid or muted.</p>
<h2 id="4-Masks"><a href="#4-Masks" class="headerlink" title="4. Masks"></a>4. Masks</h2><p>Using the Shape Masks feature, each of these individual effects can be perfect for particular regions of your footage. In addition, by utilizing a Color Mask, you can alter the appearance of a specific color. It is possible to apply multiple iterations of each color adjustment to a clip and find it listed under the Effect heading.</p>
<p>The order can be changed by dragging and dropping, and either method can be disabled or enabled. Utilizing keyframes allows for the effects of color grading to be specifically timed as well. Last but not least, keep in mind that the quality and color sample depth of the clips determine how much of an overall adjustment you are capable of making to a color.</p>
<h2 id="5-Color-Curves"><a href="#5-Color-Curves" class="headerlink" title="5. Color Curves"></a>5. Color Curves</h2><p>If you are experienced with more advanced picture editing software, such as Adobe Photoshop, you will benefit greatly from using color curves. Adjustments can be made independently to both the Luma (the brightest areas) and the primary composite colors (red, blue, and green).</p>
<h2 id="6-Match-Colors"><a href="#6-Match-Colors" class="headerlink" title="6. Match Colors"></a>6. Match Colors</h2><p>Match Color is an additional choice that may be made from the improvement’s menu. This function will try to replicate the visual style of one video clip in another. First, choose the clip whose color you want to change, click on that clip that has the desired appearance, and last, choose Match Color.</p>
<p>You will still be able to utilize these settings as shortcuts even after you have gained more experience with manual grading and are comfortable making finer adjustments manually. It is important to keep in mind that while using Final Cut Pro X for color grading, effects can be layered on top of one another.</p>
<p>It’s not likely that a single tool or adjustment will solve an issue or produce the desired result; rather, it’s more likely that a number of different impacts will be required. In the same way that different visual effects in Final Cut Pro X may be toggled on and off, any layers that you add to a clip can have their visibility controlled from the Inspector window.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In Final Cut Pro X, you may choose from a wide variety of grading plugins, ranging from more affordable solutions like FCPeffects to more expensive ones like Magic Bullet Looks, which are designed specifically for feature film-style grades.</p>
<p>Additionally, there is a variety of stand-alone applications for color grading, such as DaVinci Resolve and FilmConvert. You might be comfortable with their gear, but you should also know that their professional-grade color package includes some rather complex editing options.</p>
<p>Beginning to experiment with all of Final Cut Pro X’s functions and determining which ones are most useful to you is the best method to gain an understanding of the program’s color grading capabilities. If you don’t currently have a project that requires your attention, you can download stock footage and experiment with it.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Object-Tracking"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Object-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Object Tracking?"></a>Part 1. What Is Object Tracking?</h2><p>Object Tracking determines the location of an object in a video and can be used for a variety of purposes, including surveillance, security, traffic control, digital forensics, anomaly detection, gesture recognition, visual surveillance, human-computer interaction, augmented reality, and robot vision.</p>
<p>Even though it may seem easy for an average person, object tracking is quite complex for computers because they have to analyze a set of frames and estimate the object’s trajectory based on numbers instead of images.</p>
<p>Because of how complicated it is, Object Tracking is considered one of the most difficult tasks in computer vision. Even though it’s a challenge, it’s not impossible to accomplish.</p>
<p>And there are two levels of Object Tracking that you should learn about:</p>
<h3 id="1-SOT-MOT"><a href="#1-SOT-MOT" class="headerlink" title="1. SOT &amp; MOT"></a>1. SOT &amp; MOT</h3><ol>
<li><strong>Single Object Tracking (SOT):</strong> SOT is a tracking algorithm that creates advanced appearance models and&#x2F;or motion models to manage difficult issues like out-of-plane rotations, illumination variations, or scale changes.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple Object Tracking (MOT):</strong> MOT tracks every part of a video and is mainly concerned with mid-level tasks and serves as a foundation for high-level tasks.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="2-The-Difference-Between-Tracking-And-Detection"><a href="#2-The-Difference-Between-Tracking-And-Detection" class="headerlink" title="2. The Difference Between Tracking And Detection"></a>2. The Difference Between Tracking And Detection</h3><p>After knowing what Object Tracking is, there is another concept you should also be aware of - Object Detection.</p>
<p>The Object Tracking and Object Detection are two important methods in computer vision. Object Tracking tracks the position of a given object in an image in real-time, while Object Detection identifies and localizes objects in an image or video. That is the difference.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Types-Of-Object-Tracking"><a href="#Part-2-Types-Of-Object-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Types Of Object Tracking"></a>Part 2. Types Of Object Tracking</h2><h3 id="Image-Tracking"><a href="#Image-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Image Tracking"></a>Image Tracking</h3><p>Image tracking allows users to interact with digital content more naturally and helps users move and interact with digital objects in the same manner as they will with real-world physical objects.</p>
<p>Image tracking can be used in various augmented reality (AR) applications, such as AR gaming, shopping, and navigation. Moreover, you can also use it for educational purposes, such as teaching anatomy or providing instructions for a difficult task.</p>
<h3 id="Video-Tracking"><a href="#Video-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Video Tracking"></a>Video Tracking</h3><p>Video tracking is the process of tracking objects in a video sequence and can be used for various applications, such as detecting and counting objects in a scene, understanding their motions, and recognizing activities.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-What-Are-The-Difficulties-Of-Object-Tracking"><a href="#Part-3-What-Are-The-Difficulties-Of-Object-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. What Are The Difficulties Of Object Tracking?"></a>Part 3. What Are The Difficulties Of Object Tracking?</h2><p>As what has been mentioned above, the use of object tracking is versatile. However, there are some challenges associated with Object Tracking, such as:</p>
<p><strong>Background Clutter:</strong> The background can impact extracting an object’s features. If the background is more densely populated, detecting or tracking the object of interest can be more difficult.</p>
<p><strong>Occlusion:</strong> This is a phenomenon where the object being tracked is affected by the background or foreground. This causes the tracking algorithm to get confused due to multiple objects coming close together, hence, losing track of the object.</p>
<p><strong>Varying spatial scales:</strong> Varying spatial scales refer to the target object being of a different size or shape, which can confuse the algorithm, leading to errors.</p>
<p><strong>Training and Tracking Speed:</strong> If the object is moving too fast or is too small, it can be difficult to track. Therefore, the tracking module has to be designed to track, identify, and localize objects in a matter of seconds.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-Stages-Of-The-Object-Tracking-Process"><a href="#Part-4-Stages-Of-The-Object-Tracking-Process" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Stages Of The Object Tracking Process"></a>Part 4. Stages Of The Object Tracking Process</h2><p>After the introduction of object tracking technically, let’s learn about its mechanism of it from two sides: periods of the working process and the way it tracks.</p>
<h3 id="1-Stages-Of-The-Object-Tracking-Process"><a href="#1-Stages-Of-The-Object-Tracking-Process" class="headerlink" title="1. Stages Of The Object Tracking Process"></a>1. Stages Of The Object Tracking Process</h3><p>Following are the stages of the Object Tracking process:</p>
<p><strong>Target Initialization</strong></p>
<p>Target initialization is the first step in Object Tracking and involves defining the targets or objects of interest and drawing a bounding box around them in the initial frame. After that, the tracker has to detect the position of the object in the frame while drawing the bounding box.</p>
<p><strong>Appearance Modeling</strong></p>
<p>Appearance modeling is important for understanding how an object will look under different circumstances. If the object being tracked changes appearance due to different lighting, angle, or speed, the tracking algorithm may lose its information and the object itself. Therefore, it has to be conducted to let the algorithm detect the changes and distortion.</p>
<p><strong>Motion Estimation</strong></p>
<p>Motion estimation entails the capacity of the model to anticipate an object’s future position with precision.</p>
<p><strong>Target Positioning</strong></p>
<p>Motion estimation is a process of approximating the most likely region where an object could be present. After the object’s location is approximated, a visual model can be used to determine the target’s location more accurately.</p>
<h3 id="2-Methods-Of-Object-Tracking"><a href="#2-Methods-Of-Object-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="2. Methods Of Object Tracking"></a>2. Methods Of Object Tracking</h3><p>Here’re some methods of Object Tracking:</p>
<p><strong>OpenCV-Based Object Tracking</strong></p>
<p><strong>OpenCV Object Tracking</strong> method is widely used because it offers several built-in functions designed specifically for this purpose, such as GOTURN, MIL, MediandFlow, and CSRT. The tracker type you select will depend on your specific application design. Each tracker has its pros and cons, so there is not a single type of tracker ideal for all applications.</p>
<p><strong>MDNet</strong></p>
<p>Multi-Domain Convolutional Neural Network Tracker is a convolutional neural-based visual tracker and has won the VOT2015 challenge. Moreover, it is composed of domain-specific layers, branches, and multiple shared layers.</p>
<p>The MDNetT tracker is a deep neural network that is trained on numerous Object Tracking datasets. The tracker is designed to work in multiple domains, including video, text, and images.</p>
<p><strong>DeepSort</strong></p>
<p>DeepSort algorithm can track objects in real-time and uses YOLO v3 to compute the bounding boxes around the objects in a frame.</p>
<p>DeepSort uses Kalman filter from Simple Online and Realtime Tracking algorithm and an identification model, ReID to interlink bounding boxes and object tracks.</p>
<p><strong>ROLO</strong></p>
<p>ROLO is a novel Object Tracking method that uses recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to learn object-specific Spatio-temporal representations. This method works with YOLO, an object detection algorithm, and an LTSM for determining the trajectory of an object.</p>

The powerful backup: OpenCV</h2><p>We have demonstrated how powerful OpenCV Tracking is and how it works. However, do you wonder what OpenCV is? How it supports the tracking goals being achieved? In this part, we will focus on OpenCV and help you better understand the the underlying mechanisms.</p>
<h3 id="1-What-Is-OpenCV"><a href="#1-What-Is-OpenCV" class="headerlink" title="1. What Is OpenCV?"></a>1. What Is OpenCV?</h3><p>OpenCV is a powerful library that allows you to perform image processing, deep learning, machine learning, and computer vision tasks on live video feeds. Moreover, it can be used to detect objects, track their movements, and recognize faces.</p>
<p>It can help process the data that have videos and images and has been used in various applications, such as object recognition and detection, autonomous cars, robots, medical image analysis, automated surveillance, and anomaly detection.</p>

<p>The MDNetT tracker is a deep neural network that is trained on numerous Object Tracking datasets. The tracker is designed to work in multiple domains, including video, text, and images.</p>
<p><strong>DeepSort</strong></p>
<p>DeepSort algorithm can track objects in real-time and uses YOLO v3 to compute the bounding boxes around the objects in a frame.</p>
<p>DeepSort uses Kalman filter from Simple Online and Realtime Tracking algorithm and an identification model, ReID to interlink bounding boxes and object tracks.</p>
<p><strong>ROLO</strong></p>
<p>ROLO is a novel Object Tracking method that uses recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to learn object-specific Spatio-temporal representations. This method works with YOLO, an object detection algorithm, and an LTSM for determining the trajectory of an object.</p>

<h3 id="3-Implementation-In-Python-And-OpenCV-1"><a href="#3-Implementation-In-Python-And-OpenCV-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Implementation In Python And OpenCV"></a>3. Implementation In Python And OpenCV</h3><p>Now, after theoretical explanation of OpenCV and OpenCV Tracking, let’s learn <strong>Object Tracking OpenCV Python</strong> with coding and our simple and step-by-step instructions:</p>
<p><strong>Install The Dependencies</strong></p>
<p>Install the <em>pycharm</em> app on your PC, and launch it. Create a new project and go to <strong>Terminal.</strong> Install the <em>opencv-contrib-python</em> package by pasting the following command into the <strong>Terminal.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Set Up the Trackers</strong></p>
<p>Now, create a Jupyter-notebook and set up the trackers with this code:</p>
<p><strong>Tasks:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>cv2. version returns the OpenCV library version number.</li>
<li>Save the name of the eight trackers.</li>
<li>Check the list for the version you are working on and create a tracker object based on the number.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Capture The Video Input</strong></p>
<p>For capturing the video input, write the following lines of code:</p>
<p><strong>Tasks:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use the VideoCapture class to capture a video via the webcam or get a saved one from your PC.</li>
<li>In VideoCapture - line 2, give the path to your video.</li>
<li>Comment on the second line to use the webcam for tracking and uncomment the third one.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Creating The Bounding Box And Initializing The Tracker</strong></p>
<p>Define an initial random bounding box or select the choices for the object you want to track with the following code:</p>
<p><strong>Start The Tracker And Check The Output</strong></p>
<p>Finally, write the below code lines to start the tracker:</p>
<p><strong>Tasks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Read each video frame.</li>
<li>Start the timer and, through the tracker, determine the trajectory of the object.</li>
<li>Use the trajectory to draw the bounding box.</li>
<li>The program will start tracking. Afterward, press the space bar to stop tracking.</li>
</ul>
<p>Video – Object Tracking with Opencv and Python</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-4"><a href="#Conclusion-4" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In this article, we’ve discussed Object Tracking in detail and how it compares with Object Detection. Furthermore, we explored the methods used for tracking objects and provided complete guidance on the OpenCV Tracking method and its built-in functionalities.</p>
<p>Hopefully, you find this guide helpful, and you can now track objects in real-time without any issues.</p>
