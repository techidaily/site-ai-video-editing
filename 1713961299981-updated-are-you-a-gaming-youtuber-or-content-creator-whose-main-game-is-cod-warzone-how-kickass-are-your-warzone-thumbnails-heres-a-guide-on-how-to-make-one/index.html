But how can you ensure it looks good on YouTube? That’s a good question. Actually, the YouTube help center gave pointers on how your video thumbnail should be. These are the five important things you should know about:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Warzone thumbnail size should be at least 640 pixels wide.</li>
<li>YouTube thumbnail dimensions use an aspect ratio of 16:9.</li>

<li>The best size for YouTube video thumbnails is 1280 pixels by 720 pixels.</li>
<li>The supported image formats are JPG, PNG, and GIF.</li>

It shows the player pointing their gun upwards. Flying in the sky are many fighter planes (obviously edited.) Then, a sepia filter is applied to make it look like a shot from past real-world wars. It is cool and sure to attract the attention of the COD: Warzone demographics.</p>

It has attracted more than 12 million views. Admittedly, the title and the video concept are already enough to attract many viewers. But we can’t say that the thumbnail did not help. It’s actually really good.</p>
<p>The thumbnail shows a screenshot from Warzone. A player’s character is in the middle, with his back facing the camera. The words “AFK. Don’t shoot!” are written on the wall he is facing. The character is viewed through a sniper scope. It’s more “funny” than cool. But for what the video is about, it works fantastic.</p>

Again, the title likely is the main reason why it got that many views. But for sure, people did not read that long title at first. They were drawn to it by the thumbnail.</p>
<p>The thumbnail shows a clear-as-crystal screenshot of a team of 4 players on the battlefield. At the top left corner is the PS5 logo. Then, at the bottom left is an icon that says the video is in 4K UHD. If you’re also uploading 4K Warzone videos, you can try doing this. Users are attracted to videos that are eye-pleasing.</p>

It shows the player pointing their gun upwards. Flying in the sky are many fighter planes (obviously edited.) Then, a sepia filter is applied to make it look like a shot from past real-world wars. It is cool and sure to attract the attention of the COD: Warzone demographics.</p>

It has attracted more than 12 million views. Admittedly, the title and the video concept are already enough to attract many viewers. But we can’t say that the thumbnail did not help. It’s actually really good.</p>
<p>The thumbnail shows a screenshot from Warzone. A player’s character is in the middle, with his back facing the camera. The words “AFK. Don’t shoot!” are written on the wall he is facing. The character is viewed through a sniper scope. It’s more “funny” than cool. But for what the video is about, it works fantastic.</p>

Again, the title likely is the main reason why it got that many views. But for sure, people did not read that long title at first. They were drawn to it by the thumbnail.</p>
<p>The thumbnail shows a clear-as-crystal screenshot of a team of 4 players on the battlefield. At the top left corner is the PS5 logo. Then, at the bottom left is an icon that says the video is in 4K UHD. If you’re also uploading 4K Warzone videos, you can try doing this. Users are attracted to videos that are eye-pleasing.</p>

<p>Nothing is more satisfying than seeing the final cut of a video and realizing that everything we filmed is crystal clear, with vibrant colors and balanced light. Unfortunately, whether you are editing on your own or collaborating with a team, this can be difficult to achieve because color problems often occur. Unlike photo editors, where one photo can easily be fixed without affecting the rest of an album, video editing requires adjusting to fix one problem. We’ll look at three different methods to correct color distortion in videos.</p>

<h2 id="What-Is-Color-Distortion"><a href="#What-Is-Color-Distortion" class="headerlink" title="What Is Color Distortion"></a>What Is Color Distortion</h2><p>Color distortion, also called chromatic aberration (CA), happens when the camera’s lens cannot resolve the wavelengths of light that it is recording. It occurs due to dispersion, which is when the lens elements’ refractive index varies with the light wavelength.</p>
<p>The refractive index of transparent materials often reduces with increasing wavelength. Because a lens’ focal length depends on the index of refraction, this variation in refraction index affects focusing.</p>
<p>There are two types of CA: transverse (lateral) and axial (longitudinal). Axial aberration happens when different wavelengths of light focus at different distances from a lens (focus shift). Essentially, longitudinal aberration is often at long focal lengths.</p>
<p>On the other hand, transverse aberration happens when different wavelengths focus at different places in the focal plane due to the magnification or distortion of the lens varying with wavelength. Ideally, transverse aberration is often at short focal lengths.</p>
<p>The two types of CA have different characteristics, and they may occur together. Axial chromatic aberration occurs throughout an image, and you can reduce it by stopping down, hence increasing the depth of the field so that although the different wavelengths are focusing at different distances, they’re still in acceptable focus.</p>
<p>When it comes to transverse chromatic aberration, it doesn’t occur in the middle of the image, and it increases towards the edge. What’s more? Stopping down does not affect it.</p>
<h2 id="How-will-Color-Distortion-Affect-Your-Videos"><a href="#How-will-Color-Distortion-Affect-Your-Videos" class="headerlink" title="How will Color Distortion Affect Your Videos?"></a>How will Color Distortion Affect Your Videos?</h2><p>Colour distortion displays itself as “fringes” of color on the boundaries separating bright and dark parts of the image in a video. Color distortion can also occur when adding effects to a video, such as the use of a green screen. By using the green screen to replace the real thing, the colors in the video can appear a little off.</p>

<p>Nothing is more satisfying than seeing the final cut of a video and realizing that everything we filmed is crystal clear, with vibrant colors and balanced light. Unfortunately, whether you are editing on your own or collaborating with a team, this can be difficult to achieve because color problems often occur. Unlike photo editors, where one photo can easily be fixed without affecting the rest of an album, video editing requires adjusting to fix one problem. We’ll look at three different methods to correct color distortion in videos.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-1"><a href="#In-this-article-1" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What Is Color Distortion</a></p>

<h2 id="What-Is-Color-Distortion-1"><a href="#What-Is-Color-Distortion-1" class="headerlink" title="What Is Color Distortion"></a>What Is Color Distortion</h2><p>Color distortion, also called chromatic aberration (CA), happens when the camera’s lens cannot resolve the wavelengths of light that it is recording. It occurs due to dispersion, which is when the lens elements’ refractive index varies with the light wavelength.</p>
<p>The refractive index of transparent materials often reduces with increasing wavelength. Because a lens’ focal length depends on the index of refraction, this variation in refraction index affects focusing.</p>
<p>There are two types of CA: transverse (lateral) and axial (longitudinal). Axial aberration happens when different wavelengths of light focus at different distances from a lens (focus shift). Essentially, longitudinal aberration is often at long focal lengths.</p>
<p>On the other hand, transverse aberration happens when different wavelengths focus at different places in the focal plane due to the magnification or distortion of the lens varying with wavelength. Ideally, transverse aberration is often at short focal lengths.</p>
<p>The two types of CA have different characteristics, and they may occur together. Axial chromatic aberration occurs throughout an image, and you can reduce it by stopping down, hence increasing the depth of the field so that although the different wavelengths are focusing at different distances, they’re still in acceptable focus.</p>
<p>When it comes to transverse chromatic aberration, it doesn’t occur in the middle of the image, and it increases towards the edge. What’s more? Stopping down does not affect it.</p>
<h2 id="How-will-Color-Distortion-Affect-Your-Videos-1"><a href="#How-will-Color-Distortion-Affect-Your-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="How will Color Distortion Affect Your Videos?"></a>How will Color Distortion Affect Your Videos?</h2><p>Colour distortion displays itself as “fringes” of color on the boundaries separating bright and dark parts of the image in a video. Color distortion can also occur when adding effects to a video, such as the use of a green screen. By using the green screen to replace the real thing, the colors in the video can appear a little off.</p>

You’ll see the video editing window. Select the Color panel; you’ll see several parameters that you can tweak.</p>
<ul>
<li>Contrast allows you to control the difference in brightness and color in different areas of your video image. The Brightness setting lets you customize the overall darkness or lightness of the video image.</li>
<li>With the Saturation setting, you can make the colors in your video image appear more inconspicuous or saturated.</li>
<li>If the color in your video image is set too high, it will look oversaturated. The colors will be washed out and muted if it’s set to low. The Tint control in Filmora allows you to adjust the balance between these two chroma channels.</li>
<li>Additionally, you can employ Hollywood film-looking color sets for videos from Sparta 300, Walking Dead, Game of Thrones, Star Wars, and much more.</li>

Unfortunately, whether you are editing on your own or collaborating with a team, this can be difficult to achieve because color problems often occur. Unlike photo editors, where one photo can easily be fixed without affecting the rest of an album, video editing requires adjusting to fix one problem. We’ll look at three different methods to correct color distortion in videos.</p>

<h2 id="What-Is-Color-Distortion-2"><a href="#What-Is-Color-Distortion-2" class="headerlink" title="What Is Color Distortion"></a>What Is Color Distortion</h2><p>Color distortion, also called chromatic aberration (CA), happens when the camera’s lens cannot resolve the wavelengths of light that it is recording. It occurs due to dispersion, which is when the lens elements’ refractive index varies with the light wavelength.</p>
<p>The refractive index of transparent materials often reduces with increasing wavelength. Because a lens’ focal length depends on the index of refraction, this variation in refraction index affects focusing.</p>
<p>There are two types of CA: transverse (lateral) and axial (longitudinal). Axial aberration happens when different wavelengths of light focus at different distances from a lens (focus shift). Essentially, longitudinal aberration is often at long focal lengths.</p>
<p>On the other hand, transverse aberration happens when different wavelengths focus at different places in the focal plane due to the magnification or distortion of the lens varying with wavelength. Ideally, transverse aberration is often at short focal lengths.</p>
<p>The two types of CA have different characteristics, and they may occur together. Axial chromatic aberration occurs throughout an image, and you can reduce it by stopping down, hence increasing the depth of the field so that although the different wavelengths are focusing at different distances, they’re still in acceptable focus.</p>
<p>When it comes to transverse chromatic aberration, it doesn’t occur in the middle of the image, and it increases towards the edge. What’s more? Stopping down does not affect it.</p>

Color distortion can also occur when adding effects to a video, such as the use of a green screen. By using the green screen to replace the real thing, the colors in the video can appear a little off.</p>

You can also select your video and drag and drop the effect you want to the Video Effects selection under the Effects Control Panel. Here are some of the color correction effects you can apply:</p>
<p>Brightness and Contrast Effect: With this effect, you can adjust the contrast and brightness of your video. Using this effect allows you to make adjustments to all pixel values in your video image at once — mid-tones, shadows, and highlights.</p>
<p>Color Balance Effect: This effect changes the amount of blue, green, and red in the shadow, highlights of an image, and mid-tones. Preserve Luminosity preserves the average brightness of your video image and changes the color. It maintains the tonal balance in your video image.</p>

<p>The software provides <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >non-destructive and non-linear editing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of QuickTime-compatible video formats. These include 8K, 5K, 4K, 2K, XDCAM (via plug-in), P2 MXF (DVCProHD), HDV, and DV film formats. Final Cut Pro can also import projects from iMovie for iPadOS and iOS. It also comes with multiple color correction tools, such as color wheels, video scopes, and sliders and curves.</p>
<p>With that in mind, let’s look at how to correct color distortion in videos using Final Cut Pro.</p>
<h3 id="Step-1-Open-Your-Video-in-Final-Cut-Pro-3"><a href="#Step-1-Open-Your-Video-in-Final-Cut-Pro-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 1. Open Your Video in Final Cut Pro"></a>Step 1.

                ></p>
<p>Go to the Window panel and select the Workspaces option. Then, choose the Color &amp; Effects option. Here, you can adjust a range of scopes, including the Luma Waveform, Vectorscope, and RGB Overlay.</p>

<h3 id="Step-3-Correct-the-Color-3"><a href="#Step-3-Correct-the-Color-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3. Correct the Color"></a>Step 3. Correct the Color</h3><p>Head to the color panel and click the drop-down menu next to No Corrections. Select Color Wheels, where you’ll be able to control various parts of your video clips individually.</p>

                ></p>
<p>The Shadows wheel allows you to control the darker shades of your footage, Highlights controls the bright shades of your footage, and the Midtones wheel allows you to adjust the Luma channels in the middle of your video clip. The Master wheel allows you to adjust hue, saturation, and Luma channel (exposure).</p>

<p>In addition to the color wheels, you’ll find more controls below that help you adjust the white balance.</p>

Once you click ‘Export,’ you’ll be saving the file to your hard drive. Once it’s done, click ‘Save.’ The file will automatically be saved on your desktop.</p>
