The same process is applicable to still photos as well. You can take a photo with a green screen background and replace the screen with any photo as per your preference and requirement. You will need a high-quality photo editor to add green screen effects to your photo. There is no better photo editor in the world than Adobe Photoshop.</p>
<p>First, you have to opt for remove green screen Photoshop and then add anything you want in place of the green screen. The difference between Chroma key Photoshop and any other photo editor is that you can pay attention to details and remove the entire green screen halo effect around the main subject or object on the photo. Therefore, there will be no jittery green edges and green patches to disturb the overall photo quality. Here are the steps to use green screen effect in Adobe Photoshop.</p>
<h2 id="1-How-To-Use-Green-Screen-in-Photoshop"><a href="#1-How-To-Use-Green-Screen-in-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="1. How To Use Green Screen in Photoshop?"></a>1.

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Bring a black-and-white effect on your image through the option in After effects</strong></p>
<p>The Black-and-White effect on the images has been one of the most popular trends and styles one chooses to edit. And in order to make your efforts minimal and the quality of with the finest, the After Effects has a “Black &amp; white” option as well.</p>
<p>So, if you want to edit your pictures in the black and white filter, you can readily do so in the highest quality and with the least effort. Open the “Colour Contrast” feature in After Effects and click on its drop-down box. The fourth option is the one that is below the “Auto Levels” option, and you will find the “Black &amp; White” option present.</p>
<p>Click on that option, and you will find your image edited in the black-white hues, in the most impeccable shade, light, shadow and effect.</p>
