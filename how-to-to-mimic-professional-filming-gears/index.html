<p>Here is a guide on <strong>how to freeze-frame in Sony Vegas</strong></p>

                     lazyload

                      alt="Download and Import File"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Paste and Copy Video Parts</strong></p>
<p>Drag&#x2F;drop the imported file on the timeline, where you can stretch or zoom it. Now you can either play the video or move and stop the timeline marker where you wish to freeze the frame. After placing the marker, press S on the keyboard to split the video into two pieces. Then, copy and paste.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Copy and Paste"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Reduce the Velocity to 0%.</strong></p>
<p>Right-click on the pasted video segment and choose Insert&#x2F;Remove Envelope&gt;Velocity from the context menu. It will draw a light green border around the pasted video segment. Set to 0 percent Velocity by right-clicking on that green box. It will freeze the extra part, making it look like a frozen frame.</p>

Remove the audio segment from the timeline by clicking on it and deleting it. You can pick Delete from the right-click drop-down menu or use the Delete key on your keyboard.</p>
<p>After that, attach the second part.</p>
