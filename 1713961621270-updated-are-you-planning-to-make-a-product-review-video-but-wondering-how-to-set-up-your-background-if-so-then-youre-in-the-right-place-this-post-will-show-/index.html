<p><strong>File -&gt; Scripts -&gt; Load Files into Stack</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p><strong>File -&gt; Scripts -&gt; Load Files into Stack</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/How-to-create-photoshop-gif-the-100%25-easy-way-2.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop- File Stack Loading"

<p><strong>File -&gt; Scripts -&gt; Load Files into Stack</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
