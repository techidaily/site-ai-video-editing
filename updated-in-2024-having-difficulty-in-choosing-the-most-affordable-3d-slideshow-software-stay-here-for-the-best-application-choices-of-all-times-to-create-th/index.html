<p>Have you ever had a video with good audio but poor visual quality? Maybe it was a recorded talk, and the presenter was sitting in front of a poorly lit screen, or it might as well be your own home video. There are many reasons why your video could look dark and unappealing. Brightening a video is a great way to remove your editing mistakes and add some artistic flair to your videos. Some editing software has this option built-in, but if you use Windows 10 to edit, it’s hard to find out how to brighten a video in Windows 10 without the help of additional software.</p>
<p>We sometimes know video quality can affect the way content is perceived. That can be particularly frustrating, especially with all the hi-res content online now. Are you in a situation where you need to brighten up a video that has been recorded in low light? If so, look no further. It’s now a breeze to adjust the brightness of your videos on Windows 10. This article will show you how to brighten a video windows 10.</p>

Windows 10 has an easy-to-use video editing app. This is handy for simple home video editing, but it doesn’t work well for professional movie making. Windows Movie Maker was how we edited video in the old days of Windows XP and Vista. Today, Movie Maker is still available on Windows 10, but the new video editor is built-in to the operating system.</p>
<p>You can use it to trim videos or create your own home movies and slideshows. You can even have it create videos automatically by taking photos as you go. Forget about buying expensive editing software. With Windows 10, you have a free video editor built into the operating system where you can trim videos, create home movies, and even create automatic montages. You’ll be surprised at what you can do without ever leaving the Windows 10 Photos app.</p>
<p>Some people say that windows video editor has a very simple interface and it only has very basic features. In this case, having something is more important than not having anything at all. Also, you should keep in mind that not everyone needs a fully-fledged <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Some people have to do just basic tasks like trimming a video and increasing the brightness of a video. It is not feasible for them to purchase expensive video editing software for that purpose.

Windows 10 has an easy-to-use video editing app. This is handy for simple home video editing, but it doesn’t work well for professional movie making. Windows Movie Maker was how we edited video in the old days of Windows XP and Vista. Today, Movie Maker is still available on Windows 10, but the new video editor is built-in to the operating system.</p>
<p>You can use it to trim videos or create your own home movies and slideshows. You can even have it create videos automatically by taking photos as you go. Forget about buying expensive editing software. With Windows 10, you have a free video editor built into the operating system where you can trim videos, create home movies, and even create automatic montages. You’ll be surprised at what you can do without ever leaving the Windows 10 Photos app.</p>

<p>Have you ever had a video with good audio but poor visual quality? Maybe it was a recorded talk, and the presenter was sitting in front of a poorly lit screen, or it might as well be your own home video. There are many reasons why your video could look dark and unappealing. Brightening a video is a great way to remove your editing mistakes and add some artistic flair to your videos. Some editing software has this option built-in, but if you use Windows 10 to edit, it’s hard to find out how to brighten a video in Windows 10 without the help of additional software.</p>
<p>We sometimes know video quality can affect the way content is perceived. That can be particularly frustrating, especially with all the hi-res content online now. Are you in a situation where you need to brighten up a video that has been recorded in low light? If so, look no further. It’s now a breeze to adjust the brightness of your videos on Windows 10. This article will show you how to brighten a video windows 10.</p>

Windows 10 has an easy-to-use video editing app. This is handy for simple home video editing, but it doesn’t work well for professional movie making. Windows Movie Maker was how we edited video in the old days of Windows XP and Vista. Today, Movie Maker is still available on Windows 10, but the new video editor is built-in to the operating system.</p>
<p>You can use it to trim videos or create your own home movies and slideshows. You can even have it create videos automatically by taking photos as you go. Forget about buying expensive editing software. With Windows 10, you have a free video editor built into the operating system where you can trim videos, create home movies, and even create automatic montages. You’ll be surprised at what you can do without ever leaving the Windows 10 Photos app.</p>
<p>Some people say that windows video editor has a very simple interface and it only has very basic features. In this case, having something is more important than not having anything at all. Also, you should keep in mind that not everyone needs a fully-fledged <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Some people have to do just basic tasks like trimming a video and increasing the brightness of a video. It is not feasible for them to purchase expensive video editing software for that purpose. So the Windows 10 video editor is the best in this case.</p>
