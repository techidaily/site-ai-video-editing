They are a great way to show the passage of time, but editing them on a computer is not an easy task. Editing time-lapse videos on a computer is not an easy task because it requires you to have the right software and know how to use it.</p>
<p>It can be quite time-consuming and tedious work, which is why we need a proper editing program that can help us through this process. It’s just about learning the basics of editing and then adding a few effects to make your video more interesting. Here are some tips on how you can edit time-lapse videos on your computer:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first thing you need to do is download and install a video editor for your computer.</li>
<li>Import the timelapse footage into the video editing program that you have downloaded and installed, such as Adobe Premiere Pro or Sony Vegas Pro, etc.</li>
<li>Now you need to trim out any unwanted footage at the beginning or end of the clip so that what remains is just what you want to show in your final video.</li>
<li>The next step is to add transitions between scenes, such as fades, wipes, dissolves, or cuts between shots - this will help transition between scenes smoothly and seamlessly without any abrupt jumps in time or space between them while also adding an extra level of polish.</li>
</ul>
<p>Time-lapse videos can help you produce stunning results, no matter what your creative goals may be. If you want to create a time-lapse video, there are many things you need to consider.

And if you’re using a DSLR camera, there is a chance that your time-lapse videos are in MOV format. If that’s the case, then you’re in luck.

<p>This cool effect enables you to show a dream-like scene where two mirrored footages appear within the same frame using the Masking feature. But why stop there?</p>
<p>Keep reading to find out how you can use this style of effect to spice up your daily vlog bumper intro or even for your upcoming sci-fi content.</p>

<h2 id="Preparing-the-footage"><a href="#Preparing-the-footage" class="headerlink" title="Preparing the footage"></a>Preparing the footage</h2><p>There are not many restrictions on preparing the footage for this effect. However, depending on the results you’re aiming for, you might need to consider a few things.</p>
<p>First, a wider view and some camera panning, or tilting will deliver a better result as it provides angle variations. This will later enhance the dynamic of the scene, making it feels even more uncanny.</p>
<p>Then, while you’re at it, you need to also figure out the purpose of the video itself. If you want to upload it to certain platforms where vertical videos are more popular, you will want to work on that as well. When you’re shooting your footage, make sure that you’re taking it at the correct angle that would fit the ratio you’re aiming for.</p>
<p>Last but not least, consider the length of the footage. If you’re planning to make a bumper video, you might want a quick yet comprehensive shot of the objects you want to highlight. You can always trim and adjust the timing later, but it is better to also plan it early.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Move the playhead to the beginning of the first video footage and add a keyframe by clicking on the Add button. Set the rotation of this keyframe at 0 and the scale at 100.</p>

                      alt="move the playhead to the beginning and click add"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: Now move the playhead to the end of the video footage and add another keyframe. This time, set the rotation to 20 and adjust the scale number to 115.</p>

                      alt="move the playhead to the end and click add"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4: Do Steps 1 to 3 to the second video footage. Don’t forget to preview the result to see if both footages are rotated properly.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="previewing the result"
                ></p>
