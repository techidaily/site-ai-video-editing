How to Add Freeze Frame Video Effect on PC</h2><p>If you are a computer user and you are looking for a video editor to add freeze frame effect to your video, we recommend Wondershare Filmora. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is extremely popular among video creators for its wide range of video effects as well as its intuitive user interface. Adding freeze frame effect is super easy in Filmora and here are the steps to follow.</p>
<p>Step1Download and install Filmora for Windows PC. Launch Filmora and click on New Project button.</p>
<p>Step2Import your video clip under Project Media and then drop it into Timeline.</p>
<p>Step3Play the video and pause it where you want to freeze frame. Click on Snapshot icon to take photo of the frame. You will find the photo you have taken just now under Media library. In the meantime, you should split the video clip where you paused it to make space for the still image to get added and stay frozen.</p>
<p>Drag and drop the image on Timeline and stretch it to the duration up to which you want the frame to stay frozen. This image should be on top of the video clip in Timeline. You should place the image exactly where you paused the video.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>What is the significance of a clean verbatim?</strong></p>
<p>A clean verbatim caters to a convenient readability of your audio-visual files through a slight customization process. This one is an accurately rendered transcription that keeps all the essential information within the recording, while eliminating the undesired, noisy background audio.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>What is the usage credibility of speech to text programs for students?</strong></p>
<p>The speech to text converter programs are greatly beneficial for students in the sense that the latter works to remove a series of hindrances, like handwriting and speed matching difficulties, or transcription of thoughts during brainstorming sessions.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Does working with a speech to text conversion facility require an internet connection?</strong></p>
<p>The requirement of internet connectivity is rather selective with respect to the specific converter program or application you are working with. While some of them may require you to remain online throughout the transcription process, other may work well in the offline mode of operation.</p>
