                      alt="iMovie Slideshow Creator- Designing the Title Slide"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Include Still Images</strong></p>
<p>Browse through the locally saved images within your device gallery and add the desired ones at a specific point in the editor timeline using the ‘Drag and Drop’ method. A green colored indicative light will mark the spot where the images are being dropped. You are free to drop all the images at the same time and sort them at a later stage. Do not close the image folder in your device until you have imported all the stills.</p>
<p>The images can be alternatively added to the timeline by selecting the required ones from the iOS device’s Photo Booth or iPhoto account. All you need to do is navigate to and hit the ‘Photo’ button to drop the selected images in the ‘Photos’ box at the bottom right corner of the software workspace.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="iMovie Slideshow Creator- Adding Images to the Presentation"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Adjust Image Pans and Transitions</strong></p>
<p>Having included the desired images within the slideshow project, it is now time to improvise them with classic and enhanced looks. You can adhere to the task by making suitable changes under the ‘Video Adjustments’, ‘Crop Tool’ and ‘Clock’ options. Drag the cursor to a desired slide to see all the 3 options pop up at the top your slide screen.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/How-to-make-a-video-slideshow-in-imovie-4.JPG"
                      alt="iMovie Slideshow Creator- Making Image Pan and Transition Adjustments"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Video Adjustment Tool</strong></p>
<p>Using the ‘Video Adjustment’ option, you are granted the liberty to adjust the brightness, contrast, white point, exposure, saturation and levels of the added images. If your images have an appreciable quality by default, you can skip this step.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Crop Tool</strong></p>
<p>Consider working with the ‘Crop Tool’ to zoom or pan the system camera across a selected slide. Click on the ‘Fit’ option to set the image within a chosen frame size; however you need to be cautious lest using the tool may render an incorrectly cropped image. Select the ‘Crop’ option to adjust the image aspect ratio according to your specific size constraints.</p>
<p>The ‘Ken Burns’ tool, you can rely on this one to spark the slideshow images with the coolest zoom and pan effects. The tool is represented by ‘Red and Green’ boxes above the ‘Video Preview’ box in the editor timeline. You can easily move and resize the boxes using the ‘Hand’ and the ‘Cross Hair’ tools respectively. When you are satisfied with your work, hit ‘Done’ to return and confirm the changes, or click on the next presentation slide to crop and pan the same.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Clock Tool</strong></p>
<p>The ‘Clock’ icon lets you adjust the screen time of each slide, assigning a preset minimum duration of 0.25 seconds to each slide. Setting a play duration somewhere between 2-2.5 seconds would be an optimal choice. Avoid choosing shorter slide duration unless it becomes an obvious requirement, lest the audience may find it hard to process the contents.</p>
<p>Prefer adjusting the screen time separately for each slide, in case you have a large project with more than 50 slides. It is instead, advisable to time the entire project under one time frame, while setting a longer screen time for the title slide.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Add an Upbeat Background Audio</strong></p>
<p>Adding background music to your presentation slides is pretty simple, with you having to just position the audio files within the desired slides using the ‘Drag and Drop’ method. The slides containing music pieces will have a ‘Light Green’ highlighting box under them. To correct a wrong placement, drag the audio file across the individual slides and drop at the correct space. You can further, modify the length of the audio clips by extending and trimming them.</p>
<p>To import audio files from your online iTunes account, navigate to and click within the ‘Music and Sound Effects’ box at the bottom right corner of the editor timeline. You can also clip the music file to start playing the background audio from a certain point within the track. To do this, take the cursor to the end of the track and drag the red indicator line to the point where you wish the audio to end at or begin playing from.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Share Your Presentation</strong></p>
<p>Run a mock slideshow in the ‘Preview’ box to ensure that every element of the presentation is at its specified place. When all looks good, navigate to the ‘Functions Toolbar’ at the top and hit the ‘Share’ tab to select a media sharing platform of your choice. You can even choose to export your slideshow directly from the editor timeline via QuickTime.</p>

A green colored indicative light will mark the spot where the images are being dropped. You are free to drop all the images at the same time and sort them at a later stage. Do not close the image folder in your device until you have imported all the stills.</p>
<p>The images can be alternatively added to the timeline by selecting the required ones from the iOS device’s Photo Booth or iPhoto account. All you need to do is navigate to and hit the ‘Photo’ button to drop the selected images in the ‘Photos’ box at the bottom right corner of the software workspace.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Adjust Image Pans and Transitions</strong></p>
<p>Having included the desired images within the slideshow project, it is now time to improvise them with classic and enhanced looks. You can adhere to the task by making suitable changes under the ‘Video Adjustments’, ‘Crop Tool’ and ‘Clock’ options. Drag the cursor to a desired slide to see all the 3 options pop up at the top your slide screen.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Video Adjustment Tool</strong></p>
<p>Using the ‘Video Adjustment’ option, you are granted the liberty to adjust the brightness, contrast, white point, exposure, saturation and levels of the added images. If your images have an appreciable quality by default, you can skip this step.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Crop Tool</strong></p>
<p>Consider working with the ‘Crop Tool’ to zoom or pan the system camera across a selected slide. Click on the ‘Fit’ option to set the image within a chosen frame size; however you need to be cautious lest using the tool may render an incorrectly cropped image. Select the ‘Crop’ option to adjust the image aspect ratio according to your specific size constraints.</p>
<p>The ‘Ken Burns’ tool, you can rely on this one to spark the slideshow images with the coolest zoom and pan effects. The tool is represented by ‘Red and Green’ boxes above the ‘Video Preview’ box in the editor timeline. You can easily move and resize the boxes using the ‘Hand’ and the ‘Cross Hair’ tools respectively. When you are satisfied with your work, hit ‘Done’ to return and confirm the changes, or click on the next presentation slide to crop and pan the same.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Clock Tool</strong></p>
<p>The ‘Clock’ icon lets you adjust the screen time of each slide, assigning a preset minimum duration of 0.25 seconds to each slide. Setting a play duration somewhere between 2-2.5 seconds would be an optimal choice. Avoid choosing shorter slide duration unless it becomes an obvious requirement, lest the audience may find it hard to process the contents.</p>
<p>Prefer adjusting the screen time separately for each slide, in case you have a large project with more than 50 slides. It is instead, advisable to time the entire project under one time frame, while setting a longer screen time for the title slide.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Add an Upbeat Background Audio</strong></p>
<p>Adding background music to your presentation slides is pretty simple, with you having to just position the audio files within the desired slides using the ‘Drag and Drop’ method. The slides containing music pieces will have a ‘Light Green’ highlighting box under them. To correct a wrong placement, drag the audio file across the individual slides and drop at the correct space. You can further, modify the length of the audio clips by extending and trimming them.</p>
<p>To import audio files from your online iTunes account, navigate to and click within the ‘Music and Sound Effects’ box at the bottom right corner of the editor timeline. You can also clip the music file to start playing the background audio from a certain point within the track. To do this, take the cursor to the end of the track and drag the red indicator line to the point where you wish the audio to end at or begin playing from.</p>

                ></p>

When all looks good, navigate to the ‘Functions Toolbar’ at the top and hit the ‘Share’ tab to select a media sharing platform of your choice. You can even choose to export your slideshow directly from the editor timeline via QuickTime.</p>

When you are satisfied with your work, hit ‘Done’ to return and confirm the changes, or click on the next presentation slide to crop and pan the same.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Clock Tool</strong></p>
<p>The ‘Clock’ icon lets you adjust the screen time of each slide, assigning a preset minimum duration of 0.25 seconds to each slide. Setting a play duration somewhere between 2-2.5 seconds would be an optimal choice. Avoid choosing shorter slide duration unless it becomes an obvious requirement, lest the audience may find it hard to process the contents.</p>
<p>Prefer adjusting the screen time separately for each slide, in case you have a large project with more than 50 slides. It is instead, advisable to time the entire project under one time frame, while setting a longer screen time for the title slide.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Add an Upbeat Background Audio</strong></p>
<p>Adding background music to your presentation slides is pretty simple, with you having to just position the audio files within the desired slides using the ‘Drag and Drop’ method. The slides containing music pieces will have a ‘Light Green’ highlighting box under them. To correct a wrong placement, drag the audio file across the individual slides and drop at the correct space. You can further, modify the length of the audio clips by extending and trimming them.</p>
<p>To import audio files from your online iTunes account, navigate to and click within the ‘Music and Sound Effects’ box at the bottom right corner of the editor timeline. You can also clip the music file to start playing the background audio from a certain point within the track. To do this, take the cursor to the end of the track and drag the red indicator line to the point where you wish the audio to end at or begin playing from.</p>

<p>Color is abundant in our life. Our moods, sensations, and perceptions, as well as our decision-making processes, are all influenced by color. Emotion evokes by color. It affects our perception, eliciting subconscious or conscious responses in the human brain. Color is perhaps the most robust tool at your disposal as a designer because of its influential and communicative nature.</p>

<p>Although not everyone is born with a keen sense of color or a natural aptitude for graphic design, there are methods and principles you can employ to select the best <strong>color that matches together</strong> to make a strong impression and achieve your desired effect. Fortunately, we’ve got you backed up. The ten best <strong>colors that match everything</strong> are listed below to help you create your next design.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-4"><a href="#In-this-article-4" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [What is a color combination?](#Part 1)</p>

<p>04 [How to apply color combinations to your designs?](#Part 4)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Color-Combination"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Color-Combination" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Color Combination?"></a>Part 1 What is Color Combination?</h2><p>Color Theory is an art when it comes to playing with colors. It explains how people perceive color and the visual effects of colors mixing, pairing, and contrasting with one another. Designers use a color wheel and considerable collected knowledge about human psychology, society, and more to pick the perfect <strong>colors that match everything</strong>. Color is a crucial, if not the most important, feature of design since it may affect the meaning of the text, how people move across a layout, and how they feel. You may be more intentional in generating graphics that affect you if you understand color theory.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Types-of-Color-Combinations"><a href="#Part-2-Types-of-Color-Combinations" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Types of Color Combinations"></a>Part 2 Types of Color Combinations</h2><p>Learning how different <strong>colors match together</strong> is essential for successful color combinations. Studying the color wheel and color harmonies (what works, what doesn’t, and how color communicates) will help you blend colors, establish a stronger brand, and share more effectively with your designers and printers.</p>
<p><strong>The color wheel contains:?</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Three primary colors (red, yellow, and blue),?</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Three secondary colors (purple, green, and orange), and?</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Six tertiary colors (colors generated when you mix primary colors), plus (colors created from primary and secondary colors, such as blue-green or red-violet).</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/matching-color-combinations-02.JPG"
                      alt="color wheel"
                ></p>
<p>Draw a line over the core of the wheel to separate the warm colors (reds, oranges, and yellows) from the cool colors (blues, greens, and purples) (blues, greens, purples).</p>
<p>Warm colors are connected with activity, brightness, and vigor, whereas cold colors are associated with tranquility, peace, and serenity. So when you hold that color has a temperature, you can see how its use might influence your message.</p>
<p>On the color wheel, complementary hues are opposites. They may make artwork jump because of the great contrast between the two hues, but overusing them can get tiring.</p>
<p>Analogous hues are next to each other. Therefore, one color will dominate, one will support, and another will accent when developing a similar color scheme.</p>
<p>Triadic hues are energetic and vibrant, evenly dispersed throughout the color wheel. They provide visual contrast and harmony, allowing everything to shine as the overall image comes to life.</p>
<p>You can build a variety of grand color schemes by using the color wheel. Finding the perfect color combination for the right occasion is vital.</p>

<p>Although not everyone is born with a keen sense of color or a natural aptitude for graphic design, there are methods and principles you can employ to select the best <strong>color that matches together</strong> to make a strong impression and achieve your desired effect. Fortunately, we’ve got you backed up. The ten best <strong>colors that match everything</strong> are listed below to help you create your next design.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Color-Combination-1"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Color-Combination-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Color Combination?"></a>Part 1 What is Color Combination?</h2><p>Color Theory is an art when it comes to playing with colors. It explains how people perceive color and the visual effects of colors mixing, pairing, and contrasting with one another. Designers use a color wheel and considerable collected knowledge about human psychology, society, and more to pick the perfect <strong>colors that match everything</strong>. Color is a crucial, if not the most important, feature of design since it may affect the meaning of the text, how people move across a layout, and how they feel. You may be more intentional in generating graphics that affect you if you understand color theory.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Types-of-Color-Combinations-1"><a href="#Part-2-Types-of-Color-Combinations-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Types of Color Combinations"></a>Part 2 Types of Color Combinations</h2><p>Learning how different <strong>colors match together</strong> is essential for successful color combinations. Studying the color wheel and color harmonies (what works, what doesn’t, and how color communicates) will help you blend colors, establish a stronger brand, and share more effectively with your designers and printers.</p>
<p><strong>The color wheel contains:?</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Three primary colors (red, yellow, and blue),?</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Three secondary colors (purple, green, and orange), and?</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Six tertiary colors (colors generated when you mix primary colors), plus (colors created from primary and secondary colors, such as blue-green or red-violet).</p>

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="color wheel"
                ></p>
<p>Draw a line over the core of the wheel to separate the warm colors (reds, oranges, and yellows) from the cool colors (blues, greens, and purples) (blues, greens, purples).</p>
<p>Warm colors are connected with activity, brightness, and vigor, whereas cold colors are associated with tranquility, peace, and serenity. So when you hold that color has a temperature, you can see how its use might influence your message.</p>
<p>On the color wheel, complementary hues are opposites. They may make artwork jump because of the great contrast between the two hues, but overusing them can get tiring.</p>
<p>Analogous hues are next to each other. Therefore, one color will dominate, one will support, and another will accent when developing a similar color scheme.</p>
<p>Triadic hues are energetic and vibrant, evenly dispersed throughout the color wheel. They provide visual contrast and harmony, allowing everything to shine as the overall image comes to life.</p>
<p>You can build a variety of grand color schemes by using the color wheel. Finding the perfect color combination for the right occasion is vital.</p>

<p>The pink color family is your best pick if you’re looking for a design that shouts “approachable.” These colors are distinct enough to provide visual interest to the design while remaining similar sufficient to maintain an innocent appearance. When you add maroon to the mix, you reduce the chance of appearing foolish while also exuding just the appropriate amount of professionalism. Hot Pink and Maroon are my top picks for a <strong>color that matches light pink</strong>.</p>

<p>Although not everyone is born with a keen sense of color or a natural aptitude for graphic design, there are methods and principles you can employ to select the best <strong>color that matches together</strong> to make a strong impression and achieve your desired effect. Fortunately, we’ve got you backed up. The ten best <strong>colors that match everything</strong> are listed below to help you create your next design.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Color-Combination-2"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Color-Combination-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Color Combination?"></a>Part 1 What is Color Combination?</h2><p>Color Theory is an art when it comes to playing with colors. It explains how people perceive color and the visual effects of colors mixing, pairing, and contrasting with one another. Designers use a color wheel and considerable collected knowledge about human psychology, society, and more to pick the perfect <strong>colors that match everything</strong>. Color is a crucial, if not the most important, feature of design since it may affect the meaning of the text, how people move across a layout, and how they feel. You may be more intentional in generating graphics that affect you if you understand color theory.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Types-of-Color-Combinations-2"><a href="#Part-2-Types-of-Color-Combinations-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Types of Color Combinations"></a>Part 2 Types of Color Combinations</h2><p>Learning how different <strong>colors match together</strong> is essential for successful color combinations. Studying the color wheel and color harmonies (what works, what doesn’t, and how color communicates) will help you blend colors, establish a stronger brand, and share more effectively with your designers and printers.</p>
<p><strong>The color wheel contains:?</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Three primary colors (red, yellow, and blue),?</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Three secondary colors (purple, green, and orange), and?</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Six tertiary colors (colors generated when you mix primary colors), plus (colors created from primary and secondary colors, such as blue-green or red-violet).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/matching-color-combinations-02.JPG"
                      alt="color wheel"
                ></p>
<p>Draw a line over the core of the wheel to separate the warm colors (reds, oranges, and yellows) from the cool colors (blues, greens, and purples) (blues, greens, purples).</p>
<p>Warm colors are connected with activity, brightness, and vigor, whereas cold colors are associated with tranquility, peace, and serenity. So when you hold that color has a temperature, you can see how its use might influence your message.</p>
<p>On the color wheel, complementary hues are opposites. They may make artwork jump because of the great contrast between the two hues, but overusing them can get tiring.</p>
<p>Analogous hues are next to each other. Therefore, one color will dominate, one will support, and another will accent when developing a similar color scheme.</p>
<p>Triadic hues are energetic and vibrant, evenly dispersed throughout the color wheel. They provide visual contrast and harmony, allowing everything to shine as the overall image comes to life.</p>
<p>You can build a variety of grand color schemes by using the color wheel. Finding the perfect color combination for the right occasion is vital.</p>

<p>Yellow is the ultimate attention-getter, and it provides a young backdrop for the commanding navy. The equally electrifying Blue <strong>color that matches with Yellow</strong> dazzles the senses. It’s one of those color schemes mainly used for parties and casual gatherings. It helps instill a sense of purpose and energy in a design by contributing to enthusiasm.</p>

                ></p>
<p>The vibrant orange contrasts wonderfully with the dark black, providing a sense of mystery and suspense. Black is one of my favorite <strong>colors that match with orange.</strong></p>
<h3 id="03Lime-Green-and-Purple-2"><a href="#03Lime-Green-and-Purple-2" class="headerlink" title="03Lime Green and Purple"></a>03Lime Green and Purple</h3><p><img

                      alt="colors that match with brown"
                ></p>
<p>This fantastic color combination is ideal for creating a design that shouts spontaneity and dependability. The perfect tag-team, marigold yellow, catches the eye while dark brown keeps it. Yellow is yet another favorite pick of <strong>color that matches dark brown</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="05Lavender-and-Indigo-2"><a href="#05Lavender-and-Indigo-2" class="headerlink" title="05Lavender and Indigo"></a>05Lavender and Indigo</h3><p><img

                ></p>
<p>Indigo, a dramatic color associated with the arts, is intuitive and forceful. It creates an exciting backdrop for the softer purple shade.</p>
<h3 id="06Turquoise-Blue-and-Purple-2"><a href="#06Turquoise-Blue-and-Purple-2" class="headerlink" title="06Turquoise Blue and Purple"></a>06Turquoise Blue and Purple</h3><p><img

                ></p>
<p>The imaginative purple and waterleaf turquoise combination create an overall sensation of limitless possibilities. These colors are ideal for communication-related businesses, such as teachers, trainers, and media communication. Purple is the choice of many designers, and this <strong>color matches turquoise blue</strong> perfectly.</p>

                      alt="colors that match with pink"
                ></p>
<p>The pink color family is your best pick if you’re looking for a design that shouts “approachable.” These colors are distinct enough to provide visual interest to the design while remaining similar sufficient to maintain an innocent appearance. When you add maroon to the mix, you reduce the chance of appearing foolish while also exuding just the appropriate amount of professionalism. Hot Pink and Maroon are my top picks for a <strong>color that matches light pink</strong>.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Although desert sand beige is one of the least-used design colors, it will make you stand out if you use it. For fashion or interior design brands, the tones of desert sand and emperor gray work nicely together.</p>
<h3 id="09Dark-Sea-Green-and-Deep-Forest-Green-2"><a href="#09Dark-Sea-Green-and-Deep-Forest-Green-2" class="headerlink" title="09Dark Sea Green and Deep Forest Green"></a>09Dark Sea Green and Deep Forest Green</h3><p><img

                ></p>
<p>Forest green is a color that conjures up images of nature just by its name. This adaptable color connects with growth, and it looks cool and fresh when coupled with lighter seafoam green.</p>

<p>Although not everyone is born with a keen sense of color or a natural aptitude for graphic design, there are methods and principles you can employ to select the best <strong>color that matches together</strong> to make a strong impression and achieve your desired effect. Fortunately, we’ve got you backed up. The ten best <strong>colors that match everything</strong> are listed below to help you create your next design.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Color-Combination-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Color-Combination-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Color Combination?"></a>Part 1 What is Color Combination?</h2><p>Color Theory is an art when it comes to playing with colors. It explains how people perceive color and the visual effects of colors mixing, pairing, and contrasting with one another. Designers use a color wheel and considerable collected knowledge about human psychology, society, and more to pick the perfect <strong>colors that match everything</strong>. Color is a crucial, if not the most important, feature of design since it may affect the meaning of the text, how people move across a layout, and how they feel. You may be more intentional in generating graphics that affect you if you understand color theory.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Types-of-Color-Combinations-3"><a href="#Part-2-Types-of-Color-Combinations-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Types of Color Combinations"></a>Part 2 Types of Color Combinations</h2><p>Learning how different <strong>colors match together</strong> is essential for successful color combinations. Studying the color wheel and color harmonies (what works, what doesn’t, and how color communicates) will help you blend colors, establish a stronger brand, and share more effectively with your designers and printers.</p>
<p><strong>The color wheel contains:?</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Three primary colors (red, yellow, and blue),?</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Three secondary colors (purple, green, and orange), and?</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Six tertiary colors (colors generated when you mix primary colors), plus (colors created from primary and secondary colors, such as blue-green or red-violet).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/matching-color-combinations-02.JPG"
                      alt="color wheel"
                ></p>
<p>Draw a line over the core of the wheel to separate the warm colors (reds, oranges, and yellows) from the cool colors (blues, greens, and purples) (blues, greens, purples).</p>
<p>Warm colors are connected with activity, brightness, and vigor, whereas cold colors are associated with tranquility, peace, and serenity. So when you hold that color has a temperature, you can see how its use might influence your message.</p>
<p>On the color wheel, complementary hues are opposites. They may make artwork jump because of the great contrast between the two hues, but overusing them can get tiring.</p>
<p>Analogous hues are next to each other. Therefore, one color will dominate, one will support, and another will accent when developing a similar color scheme.</p>
<p>Triadic hues are energetic and vibrant, evenly dispersed throughout the color wheel. They provide visual contrast and harmony, allowing everything to shine as the overall image comes to life.</p>
<p>You can build a variety of grand color schemes by using the color wheel. Finding the perfect color combination for the right occasion is vital.</p>
