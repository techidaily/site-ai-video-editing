<p>Many companies use voiceovers to communicate vital concepts and emotions to their customers. Podcasts, audio&#x2F;video advertising, corporate training films, online courses, games, and animations are all examples of where they might be found.</p>
<p>Without voiceovers, such material would be uninteresting to the viewer. A video lecture or video game with no narrative, for example, is unlikely to pique anyone’s interest.</p>
<p>Good voiceovers, on the other hand, are not inexpensive to make.</p>
<p>Despite the high cost, your self-made voiceovers may still be of poor quality. Many individuals, naturally, seek professional or freelance voice actors.</p>
<p>Hiring voice actors ($300 to $1500 for a 5-minute voiceover narration) is also not the most cost-effective long-term solution. Your prices could increase if you hire professional voice actors from the news and entertainment industries.</p>
<p>There are resources available. Voice over generators is available online. Most software products come in both free and premium versions, which you can pick from depending on your needs. These programs will swiftly help you reach your text to audio transformation goals, whether you’re a YouTube content maker in need of an informative voiceover or a disabled person looking for a user-friendly text-to-speech converter.</p>
<p>Yes! That’s correct. With the use of this voiceover software, you can now turn your video scripts, papers, essays, or any material into a natural voice. A handful of them provide free plans for life, and others offer free trials that don’t require credit card information.</p>
<p>Furthermore, these techniques eliminate the risk of piracy and copyright violation.</p>
<p>So, let’s simplify things by identifying the top 10 and analyzing each of them.</p>

<p>The Personal plan gives access to all of the platform’s features as well as 30 monthly voiceover downloads, which should be enough for most people.</p>
<p>Upgrade to the Freelancer plan to get up to 90 voiceovers each month if you need more. Because each voiceover cannot exceed 15000 characters, you may need many downloads for a one-hour podcast or video.</p>
<p>You will have to pay an additional $69.99 per month per voice for voice cloning. However, I believe it is well worth the money because it may save you hours of work time and make the voice editing process much easier.</p>

<p>Synthesia is the fourth stage cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval</p>
<p>Synthesia stands apart from the rest of the software on this list. It’s a video maker that also has an AI presenter.</p>
<p>This is because Synthesia will generate a professional-looking video for you and add an AI presenter who will deliver narration based on the material you provided, thus acting as a voiceover.</p>
<p>Features</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Avatars - Users can use this unique tool to add an AI presenter to their films. There are many pre-built avatars to pick from.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Video with AI Presenter — Once you’ve chosen your avatar, all you have to do now is fill in your script. Synthesia allows you to make videos up to 2.5 hours long.</p>
</li>
<li><p>From text to video For the first time, turn plain words into a professional-looking video.</p>
</li>
<li><p>There are more than 60 languages available. We now support over 60 distinct languages.</p>
</li>
<li><p>There are over 45 AI avatars. Synthesia comes with 40+ avatars right out of the box.</p>
</li>
<li><p>These are Avatars that are unique to you.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Uploads of audio are possible using synthesis.</p>
</li>
<li><p>There is Music available for the background.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Ability to do your Downloads in MP4</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Pricing</p>
<p>Synthesia offers two pricing options.</p>
<p>$30 per month for personal use (monthly billing)</p>
<p>Enterprise – Individualized Pricing</p>
<p>However, you must pay for add-ons if you want the following features.</p>
<p>Synthesia API – beginning at $49 per month. Custom Avatar – $1000 one-time.</p>
<p>The Personal plan includes all features save the two advanced capabilities mentioned above and actual voice. As a result, you can make up to 10 minutes of video per month.</p>
<p>Assume you’ve exhausted your video credits. More credits can be purchased for $30 for ten credits. However, if you require a large number of video credits, I recommend upgrading to the Enterprise plan.</p>
<p>This plan includes real-time voice, audio uploads, and other premium features (copywriting, video editing, etc.)</p>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>Only video producers can use it. If you’re a podcaster, you’ll be disappointed with the tool.</li>
<li>Custom avatars are very expensive, but they are required if you wish to use Synthesia movies in paid advertising campaigns.</li>

                ></p>
<p>Murf.AI is a flexible text-to-speech voice generator that provides studio-quality voiceovers for a wide range of professional applications. The tool has a large voice library with over 115 distinct voices in 15 languages. Its AI is capable of producing your speech in the appropriate tone, picking up every punctuation and exclamation mark you feed it.</p>
<p>It also has a grammatical assistant, so you can create proofread scripts that will only improve your voiceover work. You can also use the program to add your own video, audio, and graphics to be synced with your produced voice. With its enterprise plan, the tool also has a powerful collaboration capability.</p>
<p>Pricing</p>
<ul>
<li>Murf now offers three paid pricing options: (all pricing is for yearly plans).</li>
<li>Monthly Basic – $13</li>
<li>-$26 per month for Pro</li>
<li>Enterprise – monthly fees start at $83</li>
</ul>
<p>The Basic package includes full HD video quality and practically all capabilities (excluding voice editing). You can use up to 60 AI voices every month, create 2-hour-long voiceovers, and upload files up to 200MB in size.</p>
<p>For most users, I believe this plan is adequate. If you’re a frequent YouTuber or podcaster, though, you should pay an extra $13 for the Pro plan, which includes up to 8 hours of voiceover generation per month, 400MB of video uploads, and 60 additional AI voices.</p>
<p>Collaboration capabilities, single sign-on, an account manager, and a configurable voice generating limit would be included in the Enterprise package. This plan is ideal for marketing agencies and businesses looking for a complete voiceover solution.</p>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>Developers, according to several critics, should add more languages. Murf has many fewer AI voices in the library than his competitors.</li>

                ></p>
<p>Play. Ht is a web-based voice generator that allows you to generate high-quality text-to-speech. Because of its basic user interface, the platform is exceptionally simple to use. It has a text box on the home page where you may input your text, choose the language, gender, and voice style, and choose the conversion speed.</p>
<p>Features</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Customization — To fully customize the voiceover, highlight the words. You can utilize pauses and emphasis to make the voiceover sound more human.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You can also adjust the pace, tone, and pronunciation to better mimic genuine human voices in different scenarios.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Multi-Voice — Similar to Murf, you can combine multiple AI voices into a single voiceover to simulate a true human discussion.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Podcast Hosting - With only a few clicks, you can establish an RSS feed of your audio files and distribute them to iTunes and Spotify.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Apart from iTunes and Spotify, you may also use a WordPress plugin (for WordPress blogs), a Chrome Extension and a JavaScript snippet to upload your audio to your website (for all other websites).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Sounds Analytics - Play. It will gather information on all audio. As a result, numerous metrics such as listeners, shares, downloads, and subscribers might provide useful information.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Pricing</p>
<p>Play. ht has four pricing tiers as of August 2021. (all pricing below is for yearly plans).</p>
<p>$14.25 per month for personal use</p>
<p>$29.25 per month for professionals</p>
<p>$74.25 per month in Growth</p>
<p>$149.25 per month for business</p>
<p>Commercial rights, premium voice collecting, or podcast hosting are not included in the Personal plan, which severely limits the practical use of the voices. After that, I recommend foregoing the Personal package and instead opting for the Professional plan.</p>
<p>All important features are available with the Professional package (commercial rights included.) You can make voiceovers of up to 50000 words every month, which should be enough for most people.</p>
<p>If you require additional words, choose the Growth (200000 words per month) or Business plans (500000 words per month).</p>
<p>Both plans include team access and a pronunciation library, but the Business plan adds the ability to rebrand or resell your voiceovers.</p>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>Other than English and European languages, voices made in other languages are not flawless.</li>
<li>There isn’t a built-in video editor for adding voiceovers to videos.</li>

<p>Final Thoughts</p>
<p>As you can see, there are numerous free voiceover generators available online. Most software products come in both free and premium versions, which you can pick from depending on your needs. These programs will swiftly help you reach your text to audio transformation goals, whether you’re a YouTube content maker in need of an informative voiceover or a disabled person looking for a user-friendly text-to-speech converter.</p>

<p>Many companies use voiceovers to communicate vital concepts and emotions to their customers. Podcasts, audio&#x2F;video advertising, corporate training films, online courses, games, and animations are all examples of where they might be found.</p>
<p>Without voiceovers, such material would be uninteresting to the viewer. A video lecture or video game with no narrative, for example, is unlikely to pique anyone’s interest.</p>
<p>Good voiceovers, on the other hand, are not inexpensive to make.</p>
<p>Despite the high cost, your self-made voiceovers may still be of poor quality. Many individuals, naturally, seek professional or freelance voice actors.</p>
<p>Hiring voice actors ($300 to $1500 for a 5-minute voiceover narration) is also not the most cost-effective long-term solution. Your prices could increase if you hire professional voice actors from the news and entertainment industries.</p>
<p>There are resources available. Voice over generators is available online. Most software products come in both free and premium versions, which you can pick from depending on your needs. These programs will swiftly help you reach your text to audio transformation goals, whether you’re a YouTube content maker in need of an informative voiceover or a disabled person looking for a user-friendly text-to-speech converter.</p>
<p>Yes! That’s correct. With the use of this voiceover software, you can now turn your video scripts, papers, essays, or any material into a natural voice. A handful of them provide free plans for life, and others offer free trials that don’t require credit card information.</p>
<p>Furthermore, these techniques eliminate the risk of piracy and copyright violation.</p>

<p>Resemble gives you four alternative ways to create synthetic voices. You can use the API to generate voices, record up to 50 samples immediately on the online platform, choose from a large number of voice actors, or submit raw audio without a script.</p>

<p>Lovo.ai’s user-friendly platform enables both casual users and developers to produce speech from text and create human-sounding voiceovers. Over 180 voice styles in 33 languages are available on the platform. The site is also regularly updated with new voices every day, giving consumers a wide range of options.</p>
<p>In just 15 minutes, the tool can generate personalized voices. On this platform, converting text to speech requires only three simple steps. Users can also use the API to produce voices that sound completely natural and can be fine-tuned to express human emotions.</p>

<p>Cons</p>

<li>While the UI&#x2F;UX is simple to use, it feels a little bland and dull.”</li>
<li>The number of voices available for each language is somewhat restricted. More voice samples are available.”</li>
<li>I don’t like it when software decides what a line or a sentence is and how it affects the oversight and voiceover.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Pricing</p>
<p>Lovo.ai now offers two pricing options: (all pricing is for annual plans).</p>
<p>$34.99 per month for personal</p>
<p>$99.99 per month for Freelancer</p>
<p>The Personal plan gives access to all of the platform’s features as well as 30 monthly voiceover downloads, which should be enough for most people.</p>
<p>Upgrade to the Freelancer plan to get up to 90 voiceovers each month if you need more. Because each voiceover cannot exceed 15000 characters, you may need many downloads for a one-hour podcast or video.</p>
<p>You will have to pay an additional $69.99 per month per voice for voice cloning. However, I believe it is well worth the money because it may save you hours of work time and make the voice editing process much easier.</p>

<p>Synthesia offers two pricing options.</p>
<p>$30 per month for personal use (monthly billing)</p>
<p>Enterprise – Individualized Pricing</p>
<p>However, you must pay for add-ons if you want the following features.</p>
<p>Synthesia API – beginning at $49 per month. Custom Avatar – $1000 one-time.</p>
<p>The Personal plan includes all features save the two advanced capabilities mentioned above and actual voice. As a result, you can make up to 10 minutes of video per month.</p>
<p>Assume you’ve exhausted your video credits. More credits can be purchased for $30 for ten credits. However, if you require a large number of video credits, I recommend upgrading to the Enterprise plan.</p>
<p>This plan includes real-time voice, audio uploads, and other premium features (copywriting, video editing, etc.)</p>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>Only video producers can use it. If you’re a podcaster, you’ll be disappointed with the tool.</li>
<li>Custom avatars are very expensive, but they are required if you wish to use Synthesia movies in paid advertising campaigns.</li>

<p>Murf.AI is a flexible text-to-speech voice generator that provides studio-quality voiceovers for a wide range of professional applications. The tool has a large voice library with over 115 distinct voices in 15 languages. Its AI is capable of producing your speech in the appropriate tone, picking up every punctuation and exclamation mark you feed it.</p>
<p>It also has a grammatical assistant, so you can create proofread scripts that will only improve your voiceover work. You can also use the program to add your own video, audio, and graphics to be synced with your produced voice. With its enterprise plan, the tool also has a powerful collaboration capability.</p>
<p>Pricing</p>
<ul>
<li>Murf now offers three paid pricing options: (all pricing is for yearly plans).</li>
<li>Monthly Basic – $13</li>
<li>-$26 per month for Pro</li>
<li>Enterprise – monthly fees start at $83</li>
</ul>
<p>The Basic package includes full HD video quality and practically all capabilities (excluding voice editing). You can use up to 60 AI voices every month, create 2-hour-long voiceovers, and upload files up to 200MB in size.</p>
<p>For most users, I believe this plan is adequate. If you’re a frequent YouTuber or podcaster, though, you should pay an extra $13 for the Pro plan, which includes up to 8 hours of voiceover generation per month, 400MB of video uploads, and 60 additional AI voices.</p>
<p>Collaboration capabilities, single sign-on, an account manager, and a configurable voice generating limit would be included in the Enterprise package. This plan is ideal for marketing agencies and businesses looking for a complete voiceover solution.</p>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>Developers, according to several critics, should add more languages. Murf has many fewer AI voices in the library than his competitors.</li>

<p>Play. Ht is a web-based voice generator that allows you to generate high-quality text-to-speech. Because of its basic user interface, the platform is exceptionally simple to use. It has a text box on the home page where you may input your text, choose the language, gender, and voice style, and choose the conversion speed.</p>
<p>Features</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Customization — To fully customize the voiceover, highlight the words. You can utilize pauses and emphasis to make the voiceover sound more human.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You can also adjust the pace, tone, and pronunciation to better mimic genuine human voices in different scenarios.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Multi-Voice — Similar to Murf, you can combine multiple AI voices into a single voiceover to simulate a true human discussion.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Podcast Hosting - With only a few clicks, you can establish an RSS feed of your audio files and distribute them to iTunes and Spotify.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Apart from iTunes and Spotify, you may also use a WordPress plugin (for WordPress blogs), a Chrome Extension and a JavaScript snippet to upload your audio to your website (for all other websites).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Sounds Analytics - Play. It will gather information on all audio. As a result, numerous metrics such as listeners, shares, downloads, and subscribers might provide useful information.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Pricing</p>
<p>Play. ht has four pricing tiers as of August 2021. (all pricing below is for yearly plans).</p>
<p>$14.25 per month for personal use</p>
<p>$29.25 per month for professionals</p>
<p>$74.25 per month in Growth</p>
<p>$149.25 per month for business</p>
<p>Commercial rights, premium voice collecting, or podcast hosting are not included in the Personal plan, which severely limits the practical use of the voices. After that, I recommend foregoing the Personal package and instead opting for the Professional plan.</p>
<p>All important features are available with the Professional package (commercial rights included.) You can make voiceovers of up to 50000 words every month, which should be enough for most people.</p>
<p>If you require additional words, choose the Growth (200000 words per month) or Business plans (500000 words per month).</p>
<p>Both plans include team access and a pronunciation library, but the Business plan adds the ability to rebrand or resell your voiceovers.</p>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>Other than English and European languages, voices made in other languages are not flawless.</li>
<li>There isn’t a built-in video editor for adding voiceovers to videos.</li>

<p>Final Thoughts</p>
<p>As you can see, there are numerous free voiceover generators available online. Most software products come in both free and premium versions, which you can pick from depending on your needs. These programs will swiftly help you reach your text to audio transformation goals, whether you’re a YouTube content maker in need of an informative voiceover or a disabled person looking for a user-friendly text-to-speech converter.</p>

<p>Many companies use voiceovers to communicate vital concepts and emotions to their customers. Podcasts, audio&#x2F;video advertising, corporate training films, online courses, games, and animations are all examples of where they might be found.</p>
<p>Without voiceovers, such material would be uninteresting to the viewer. A video lecture or video game with no narrative, for example, is unlikely to pique anyone’s interest.</p>
<p>Good voiceovers, on the other hand, are not inexpensive to make.</p>
<p>Despite the high cost, your self-made voiceovers may still be of poor quality. Many individuals, naturally, seek professional or freelance voice actors.</p>
<p>Hiring voice actors ($300 to $1500 for a 5-minute voiceover narration) is also not the most cost-effective long-term solution. Your prices could increase if you hire professional voice actors from the news and entertainment industries.</p>
<p>There are resources available. Voice over generators is available online. Most software products come in both free and premium versions, which you can pick from depending on your needs. These programs will swiftly help you reach your text to audio transformation goals, whether you’re a YouTube content maker in need of an informative voiceover or a disabled person looking for a user-friendly text-to-speech converter.</p>
<p>Yes! That’s correct. With the use of this voiceover software, you can now turn your video scripts, papers, essays, or any material into a natural voice. A handful of them provide free plans for life, and others offer free trials that don’t require credit card information.</p>
<p>Furthermore, these techniques eliminate the risk of piracy and copyright violation.</p>
<p>So, let’s simplify things by identifying the top 10 and analyzing each of them.</p>

<p>Lovo.ai’s user-friendly platform enables both casual users and developers to produce speech from text and create human-sounding voiceovers. Over 180 voice styles in 33 languages are available on the platform. The site is also regularly updated with new voices every day, giving consumers a wide range of options.</p>
<p>In just 15 minutes, the tool can generate personalized voices. On this platform, converting text to speech requires only three simple steps. Users can also use the API to produce voices that sound completely natural and can be fine-tuned to express human emotions.</p>

<li>While the UI&#x2F;UX is simple to use, it feels a little bland and dull.”</li>
<li>The number of voices available for each language is somewhat restricted. More voice samples are available.”</li>
<li>I don’t like it when software decides what a line or a sentence is and how it affects the oversight and voiceover.”</li>

<p>Pricing</p>
<p>Lovo.ai now offers two pricing options: (all pricing is for annual plans).</p>
<p>$34.99 per month for personal</p>
<p>$99.99 per month for Freelancer</p>
<p>The Personal plan gives access to all of the platform’s features as well as 30 monthly voiceover downloads, which should be enough for most people.</p>
<p>Upgrade to the Freelancer plan to get up to 90 voiceovers each month if you need more. Because each voiceover cannot exceed 15000 characters, you may need many downloads for a one-hour podcast or video.</p>
<p>You will have to pay an additional $69.99 per month per voice for voice cloning. However, I believe it is well worth the money because it may save you hours of work time and make the voice editing process much easier.</p>

<p>The Basic package includes full HD video quality and practically all capabilities (excluding voice editing). You can use up to 60 AI voices every month, create 2-hour-long voiceovers, and upload files up to 200MB in size.</p>
<p>For most users, I believe this plan is adequate. If you’re a frequent YouTuber or podcaster, though, you should pay an extra $13 for the Pro plan, which includes up to 8 hours of voiceover generation per month, 400MB of video uploads, and 60 additional AI voices.</p>
<p>Collaboration capabilities, single sign-on, an account manager, and a configurable voice generating limit would be included in the Enterprise package. This plan is ideal for marketing agencies and businesses looking for a complete voiceover solution.</p>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>Developers, according to several critics, should add more languages. Murf has many fewer AI voices in the library than his competitors.</li>

<p>Play. Ht is a web-based voice generator that allows you to generate high-quality text-to-speech. Because of its basic user interface, the platform is exceptionally simple to use. It has a text box on the home page where you may input your text, choose the language, gender, and voice style, and choose the conversion speed.</p>
<p>Features</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Customization — To fully customize the voiceover, highlight the words. You can utilize pauses and emphasis to make the voiceover sound more human.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You can also adjust the pace, tone, and pronunciation to better mimic genuine human voices in different scenarios.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Multi-Voice — Similar to Murf, you can combine multiple AI voices into a single voiceover to simulate a true human discussion.</p>

<li><p>Podcast Hosting - With only a few clicks, you can establish an RSS feed of your audio files and distribute them to iTunes and Spotify.</p>

<li><p>Sounds Analytics - Play. It will gather information on all audio. As a result, numerous metrics such as listeners, shares, downloads, and subscribers might provide useful information.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Pricing</p>
<p>Play. ht has four pricing tiers as of August 2021. (all pricing below is for yearly plans).</p>
<p>$14.25 per month for personal use</p>
<p>$29.25 per month for professionals</p>
<p>$74.25 per month in Growth</p>
<p>$149.25 per month for business</p>
<p>Commercial rights, premium voice collecting, or podcast hosting are not included in the Personal plan, which severely limits the practical use of the voices. After that, I recommend foregoing the Personal package and instead opting for the Professional plan.</p>
<p>All important features are available with the Professional package (commercial rights included.) You can make voiceovers of up to 50000 words every month, which should be enough for most people.</p>
<p>If you require additional words, choose the Growth (200000 words per month) or Business plans (500000 words per month).</p>
<p>Both plans include team access and a pronunciation library, but the Business plan adds the ability to rebrand or resell your voiceovers.</p>
<p>Cons</p>

<li>Other than English and European languages, voices made in other languages are not flawless.</li>
<li>There isn’t a built-in video editor for adding voiceovers to videos.</li>

<p>Final Thoughts</p>
<p>As you can see, there are numerous free voiceover generators available online. Most software products come in both free and premium versions, which you can pick from depending on your needs. These programs will swiftly help you reach your text to audio transformation goals, whether you’re a YouTube content maker in need of an informative voiceover or a disabled person looking for a user-friendly text-to-speech converter.</p>
<p><img

<p>Many companies use voiceovers to communicate vital concepts and emotions to their customers. Podcasts, audio&#x2F;video advertising, corporate training films, online courses, games, and animations are all examples of where they might be found.</p>
<p>Without voiceovers, such material would be uninteresting to the viewer. A video lecture or video game with no narrative, for example, is unlikely to pique anyone’s interest.</p>
<p>Good voiceovers, on the other hand, are not inexpensive to make.</p>
<p>Despite the high cost, your self-made voiceovers may still be of poor quality. Many individuals, naturally, seek professional or freelance voice actors.</p>
<p>Hiring voice actors ($300 to $1500 for a 5-minute voiceover narration) is also not the most cost-effective long-term solution. Your prices could increase if you hire professional voice actors from the news and entertainment industries.</p>
<p>There are resources available. Voice over generators is available online. Most software products come in both free and premium versions, which you can pick from depending on your needs. These programs will swiftly help you reach your text to audio transformation goals, whether you’re a YouTube content maker in need of an informative voiceover or a disabled person looking for a user-friendly text-to-speech converter.</p>
<p>Yes! That’s correct. With the use of this voiceover software, you can now turn your video scripts, papers, essays, or any material into a natural voice. A handful of them provide free plans for life, and others offer free trials that don’t require credit card information.</p>
<p>Furthermore, these techniques eliminate the risk of piracy and copyright violation.</p>
<p>So, let’s simplify things by identifying the top 10 and analyzing each of them.</p>

The platform can also produce a personalized voice that you can use as a voice assistant for Alexa, Google, and other services. The technique can also be used by call centres to clone their agents’ voices and customize them.</p>
<p>Resemble gives you four alternative ways to create synthetic voices. You can use the API to generate voices, record up to 50 samples immediately on the online platform, choose from a large number of voice actors, or submit raw audio without a script.</p>

<p>Lovo.ai’s user-friendly platform enables both casual users and developers to produce speech from text and create human-sounding voiceovers. Over 180 voice styles in 33 languages are available on the platform. The site is also regularly updated with new voices every day, giving consumers a wide range of options.</p>
<p>In just 15 minutes, the tool can generate personalized voices. On this platform, converting text to speech requires only three simple steps. Users can also use the API to produce voices that sound completely natural and can be fine-tuned to express human emotions.</p>
<p>Features</p>

<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>While the UI&#x2F;UX is simple to use, it feels a little bland and dull.”</li>
<li>The number of voices available for each language is somewhat restricted. More voice samples are available.”</li>
<li>I don’t like it when software decides what a line or a sentence is and how it affects the oversight and voiceover.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Pricing</p>
<p>Lovo.ai now offers two pricing options: (all pricing is for annual plans).</p>
<p>$34.99 per month for personal</p>
<p>$99.99 per month for Freelancer</p>
<p>The Personal plan gives access to all of the platform’s features as well as 30 monthly voiceover downloads, which should be enough for most people.</p>
<p>Upgrade to the Freelancer plan to get up to 90 voiceovers each month if you need more. Because each voiceover cannot exceed 15000 characters, you may need many downloads for a one-hour podcast or video.</p>
<p>You will have to pay an additional $69.99 per month per voice for voice cloning. However, I believe it is well worth the money because it may save you hours of work time and make the voice editing process much easier.</p>

<p>Cons</p>
<ul>

<p>The Basic package includes full HD video quality and practically all capabilities (excluding voice editing). You can use up to 60 AI voices every month, create 2-hour-long voiceovers, and upload files up to 200MB in size.</p>
<p>For most users, I believe this plan is adequate. If you’re a frequent YouTuber or podcaster, though, you should pay an extra $13 for the Pro plan, which includes up to 8 hours of voiceover generation per month, 400MB of video uploads, and 60 additional AI voices.</p>

<p>Pricing</p>
<p>Play. ht has four pricing tiers as of August 2021. (all pricing below is for yearly plans).</p>
<p>$14.25 per month for personal use</p>
<p>$29.25 per month for professionals</p>
<p>$74.25 per month in Growth</p>
<p>$149.25 per month for business</p>
<p>Commercial rights, premium voice collecting, or podcast hosting are not included in the Personal plan, which severely limits the practical use of the voices. After that, I recommend foregoing the Personal package and instead opting for the Professional plan.</p>
<p>All important features are available with the Professional package (commercial rights included.) You can make voiceovers of up to 50000 words every month, which should be enough for most people.</p>
<p>If you require additional words, choose the Growth (200000 words per month) or Business plans (500000 words per month).</p>
<p>Both plans include team access and a pronunciation library, but the Business plan adds the ability to rebrand or resell your voiceovers.</p>
<p>Cons</p>

<li>Other than English and European languages, voices made in other languages are not flawless.</li>
<li>There isn’t a built-in video editor for adding voiceovers to videos.</li>

<p>Instagram is a social media site owned by Facebook. However, its main focus is on sharing videos and photos. It also allows users to put up stories that only last 24 hours. Stories allow you to highlight some crucial aspects of your life. These stories could be made up of photos, texts, and videos. However, each story slide can only take up to 15 seconds of video.</p>
<p>Most times, your video would be longer than that. If you upload a video longer than the accepted 15 seconds, Instagram automatically trims it to 15 seconds. However, the resulting video might not be the parts you want to show to your audience. Maybe there’s a particular section you would like your followers to see. That’s why video cutters enter the picture.</p>
<p>A good video splitter to cut video for Instagram on Mac is necessary when you’re creating video content for your Instagram page. In addition, the video editing tool you choose must maintain the quality and the safety of the file. Therefore, we’ve selected the best tools to cut videos for Instagram on Mac. Next, we’ll explore these tools, highlighting their best features, cons, and how you can use them. On that note, let’s dive in.</p>

<p><strong>Which Should I Choose, Free or Paid Instagram Video Cutter?</strong></p>
<p>Now that you know the best free and paid video cutters to cut Instagram videos, you’re probably wondering what the ideal option is. With so many options, you must make the right decision for your project. You need to consider several factors before you decide if a paid or free Instagram video cutter is the best option for you.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Budget</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When deciding between a paid or free Instagram cutter, one crucial factor is how much you’re willing to pay. If your budget is really low and doesn’t fit into any paid options, you can simply go for a free option. However, if the price isn’t an issue for you, going for a paid option is best because it offers you more editing features to enhance your video.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ease of Use</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You should also consider how easy it is to use the video cutter. Some paid options are for professionals and can be challenging to understand. However, most free options offer poor performance times. The last thing Instagram users want is to devote hours to figure out where each tool is on the software. However, there are paid options with an intuitive interface that makes it easy to cut your Instagram video.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Customer Support</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You also need to consider whether customer support will be available when you need it. Some free options have no customer support to turn to. Instead, consider a video cutter that will offer helpful and responsive customer support when picking.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Video Format Support</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Before choosing a paid or free option, you need to consider if it would support the video format you prefer. You might be using different video formats, and you want to ensure you’re not limited to select options. You also want a video cutter that offers various output formats.</p>
<p><strong>FAQs about Cut Video For Instagram</strong></p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Various tools are available to help you cut a video for Instagram on Mac. Therefore, just refer to the paid and free tools listed above whenever you need a video cutter. These video cutters are highly recommended and ensure the quality isn’t affected while cutting the video. When deciding which is the best option for you, free or paid, the factors listed will help you decide. Suppose you’re looking specifically for a video cutter that offers you all the features you need to enhance your video while providing an intuitive user interface. In that case, Wondershare Filmora is the ideal choice.</p>
<p>Instagram is a social media site owned by Facebook. However, its main focus is on sharing videos and photos. It also allows users to put up stories that only last 24 hours. Stories allow you to highlight some crucial aspects of your life. These stories could be made up of photos, texts, and videos. However, each story slide can only take up to 15 seconds of video.</p>
<p>Most times, your video would be longer than that. If you upload a video longer than the accepted 15 seconds, Instagram automatically trims it to 15 seconds. However, the resulting video might not be the parts you want to show to your audience. Maybe there’s a particular section you would like your followers to see. That’s why video cutters enter the picture.</p>
<p>A good video splitter to cut video for Instagram on Mac is necessary when you’re creating video content for your Instagram page. In addition, the video editing tool you choose must maintain the quality and the safety of the file. Therefore, we’ve selected the best tools to cut videos for Instagram on Mac. Next, we’ll explore these tools, highlighting their best features, cons, and how you can use them. On that note, let’s dive in.</p>

<p><strong>Which Should I Choose, Free or Paid Instagram Video Cutter?</strong></p>
<p>Now that you know the best free and paid video cutters to cut Instagram videos, you’re probably wondering what the ideal option is. With so many options, you must make the right decision for your project. You need to consider several factors before you decide if a paid or free Instagram video cutter is the best option for you.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Budget</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When deciding between a paid or free Instagram cutter, one crucial factor is how much you’re willing to pay. If your budget is really low and doesn’t fit into any paid options, you can simply go for a free option. However, if the price isn’t an issue for you, going for a paid option is best because it offers you more editing features to enhance your video.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ease of Use</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You should also consider how easy it is to use the video cutter. Some paid options are for professionals and can be challenging to understand. However, most free options offer poor performance times. The last thing Instagram users want is to devote hours to figure out where each tool is on the software. However, there are paid options with an intuitive interface that makes it easy to cut your Instagram video.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Customer Support</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You also need to consider whether customer support will be available when you need it. Some free options have no customer support to turn to. Instead, consider a video cutter that will offer helpful and responsive customer support when picking.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Video Format Support</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Before choosing a paid or free option, you need to consider if it would support the video format you prefer. You might be using different video formats, and you want to ensure you’re not limited to select options. You also want a video cutter that offers various output formats.</p>
<p><strong>FAQs about Cut Video For Instagram</strong></p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Various tools are available to help you cut a video for Instagram on Mac. Therefore, just refer to the paid and free tools listed above whenever you need a video cutter. These video cutters are highly recommended and ensure the quality isn’t affected while cutting the video. When deciding which is the best option for you, free or paid, the factors listed will help you decide. Suppose you’re looking specifically for a video cutter that offers you all the features you need to enhance your video while providing an intuitive user interface. In that case, Wondershare Filmora is the ideal choice.</p>
<p>Instagram is a social media site owned by Facebook. However, its main focus is on sharing videos and photos. It also allows users to put up stories that only last 24 hours. Stories allow you to highlight some crucial aspects of your life. These stories could be made up of photos, texts, and videos. However, each story slide can only take up to 15 seconds of video.</p>
<p>Most times, your video would be longer than that. If you upload a video longer than the accepted 15 seconds, Instagram automatically trims it to 15 seconds. However, the resulting video might not be the parts you want to show to your audience. Maybe there’s a particular section you would like your followers to see. That’s why video cutters enter the picture.</p>
<p>A good video splitter to cut video for Instagram on Mac is necessary when you’re creating video content for your Instagram page. In addition, the video editing tool you choose must maintain the quality and the safety of the file. Therefore, we’ve selected the best tools to cut videos for Instagram on Mac. Next, we’ll explore these tools, highlighting their best features, cons, and how you can use them. On that note, let’s dive in.</p>

<p><strong>Which Should I Choose, Free or Paid Instagram Video Cutter?</strong></p>
<p>Now that you know the best free and paid video cutters to cut Instagram videos, you’re probably wondering what the ideal option is. With so many options, you must make the right decision for your project. You need to consider several factors before you decide if a paid or free Instagram video cutter is the best option for you.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Budget</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When deciding between a paid or free Instagram cutter, one crucial factor is how much you’re willing to pay. If your budget is really low and doesn’t fit into any paid options, you can simply go for a free option. However, if the price isn’t an issue for you, going for a paid option is best because it offers you more editing features to enhance your video.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ease of Use</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You should also consider how easy it is to use the video cutter. Some paid options are for professionals and can be challenging to understand. However, most free options offer poor performance times. The last thing Instagram users want is to devote hours to figure out where each tool is on the software. However, there are paid options with an intuitive interface that makes it easy to cut your Instagram video.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Customer Support</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You also need to consider whether customer support will be available when you need it. Some free options have no customer support to turn to. Instead, consider a video cutter that will offer helpful and responsive customer support when picking.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Video Format Support</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Before choosing a paid or free option, you need to consider if it would support the video format you prefer. You might be using different video formats, and you want to ensure you’re not limited to select options. You also want a video cutter that offers various output formats.</p>
<p><strong>FAQs about Cut Video For Instagram</strong></p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Various tools are available to help you cut a video for Instagram on Mac. Therefore, just refer to the paid and free tools listed above whenever you need a video cutter. These video cutters are highly recommended and ensure the quality isn’t affected while cutting the video. When deciding which is the best option for you, free or paid, the factors listed will help you decide. Suppose you’re looking specifically for a video cutter that offers you all the features you need to enhance your video while providing an intuitive user interface. In that case, Wondershare Filmora is the ideal choice.</p>
<p>Instagram is a social media site owned by Facebook. However, its main focus is on sharing videos and photos. It also allows users to put up stories that only last 24 hours. Stories allow you to highlight some crucial aspects of your life. These stories could be made up of photos, texts, and videos. However, each story slide can only take up to 15 seconds of video.</p>
<p>Most times, your video would be longer than that. If you upload a video longer than the accepted 15 seconds, Instagram automatically trims it to 15 seconds. However, the resulting video might not be the parts you want to show to your audience. Maybe there’s a particular section you would like your followers to see. That’s why video cutters enter the picture.</p>
<p>A good video splitter to cut video for Instagram on Mac is necessary when you’re creating video content for your Instagram page. In addition, the video editing tool you choose must maintain the quality and the safety of the file. Therefore, we’ve selected the best tools to cut videos for Instagram on Mac. Next, we’ll explore these tools, highlighting their best features, cons, and how you can use them. On that note, let’s dive in.</p>

<p><strong>Which Should I Choose, Free or Paid Instagram Video Cutter?</strong></p>
<p>Now that you know the best free and paid video cutters to cut Instagram videos, you’re probably wondering what the ideal option is. With so many options, you must make the right decision for your project. You need to consider several factors before you decide if a paid or free Instagram video cutter is the best option for you.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Budget</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When deciding between a paid or free Instagram cutter, one crucial factor is how much you’re willing to pay. If your budget is really low and doesn’t fit into any paid options, you can simply go for a free option. However, if the price isn’t an issue for you, going for a paid option is best because it offers you more editing features to enhance your video.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ease of Use</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You should also consider how easy it is to use the video cutter. Some paid options are for professionals and can be challenging to understand. However, most free options offer poor performance times. The last thing Instagram users want is to devote hours to figure out where each tool is on the software. However, there are paid options with an intuitive interface that makes it easy to cut your Instagram video.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Customer Support</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You also need to consider whether customer support will be available when you need it. Some free options have no customer support to turn to. Instead, consider a video cutter that will offer helpful and responsive customer support when picking.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Video Format Support</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Before choosing a paid or free option, you need to consider if it would support the video format you prefer. You might be using different video formats, and you want to ensure you’re not limited to select options. You also want a video cutter that offers various output formats.</p>
<p><strong>FAQs about Cut Video For Instagram</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How do you post long videos on Instagram without splitting?</strong> Instagram allows users to post long videos on the app, as long as 60 seconds. Alternatively, you can use the IGTV to upload long clips on Instagram without splitting.</li>
<li><strong>What is multi-capture on Instagram:</strong> This tool allows you to create and share multiple photos on your stories.</li>
<li><strong>How do I split the video into two parts for Instagram on Mac?</strong> The paid and free video cutters shared above will help you split a video into two parts for Instagram on Mac. Simply pick the option that fits your preference.</li>
<li><strong>Why can’t I split a video on iMovie?</strong> Maybe your iMovie software is experiencing a glitch; you can simply restart the software. Alternately, move the clip to the center row if you find the option greyed out. Moving the clip should help fix the issue.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Various tools are available to help you cut a video for Instagram on Mac. Therefore, just refer to the paid and free tools listed above whenever you need a video cutter. These video cutters are highly recommended and ensure the quality isn’t affected while cutting the video. When deciding which is the best option for you, free or paid, the factors listed will help you decide. Suppose you’re looking specifically for a video cutter that offers you all the features you need to enhance your video while providing an intuitive user interface.
