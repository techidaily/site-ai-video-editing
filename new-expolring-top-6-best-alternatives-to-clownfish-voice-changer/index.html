<ul>
<li>For adding text, go to the “Titles” from the top bar and add the title you like to the panel.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-11.png"
                      alt="adding the channel text"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Now double-click this layer and add the text you want. You can also change the color of the text, scale it down and place it where ever you want.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-12.png"
                      alt="editing the channel text"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Now, let’s add another title for the subscribe button. You have to place it on the red layer.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-13.png"
                      alt="subscribe button text added"
                ></p>
<p>We can’t finish our structure without icons, can we? So let’s move on to them.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Add icons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hit the “Element” from the top bar and search for the “Bell” icon. You will find the short animations of the bell. Add the suitable one to the panel.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-14.png"
                      alt="adding a bell icon"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Now find a suitable place in the animation, stop it at that point, right-click on the element layer and add a freeze frame.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-15.png"
                      alt="adding a freezeframe of the bell icon"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>You can also extend the freeze frame and remove the other parts. Then reduce its size and place it beside the “Subscribe” text.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-16.png"
                      alt="adjust the bell icon"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Similarly, add “Thumbs Up” and “Mouse Cursor” icons on the panel.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-17.png"
                      alt="thumbs up and mouse cursor icons added"
                ></p>
<p>Finally, our structure is finished. Now let’s start animating.</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Animate-the-graphics"><a href="#Step3-Animate-the-graphics" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Animate the graphics"></a>Step3 Animate the graphics</h5><p>First, we’ll make it so that all these graphics come in from below the view.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the white layer first and double-click on it. Then hit the “Animation” option and scroll down. Here add a new keyframe by clicking “Add.” Now move the playhead to the beginning and place the white color layer out of the frame.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-18.png"
                      alt="adding a new keyframe on the white color layer"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Now, do the same for channel photos and icons. The whole animation will look like this.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-19.gif"
                      alt="successfully animated the graphics"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>As you can see, the text appears before the color layers. Let’s correct it. Double-click the text layer. Select the” Type Writer’ form and hit the “Advanced option.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-20.png"
                      alt="selecting type writer style for text"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Here, you can adjust the text with the color layers.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-21.png"
                      alt="adjusting the speed of the text"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>After adjusting both the channel name and subscribe button texts, your animation will appear like this.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-22.gif"
                      alt="the speed of the text adjusted"
                ></p>
<p>If you’ve managed so far, then that’s great. We have done most of the work. Now we need to animate the graphics of the mouse cursor so that it clicks on the bell icon, thumb icon, and our subscribe button. The process is somewhat similar because we will need to add different keyframes. But still, let’s see it in detail.</p>
<h5 id="Step4-Animate-the-mouse-cursor"><a href="#Step4-Animate-the-mouse-cursor" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Animate the mouse cursor"></a>Step4 Animate the mouse cursor</h5><ul>
<li>Go to the “Mouse Cursor” icon layer and double-click on it. First, place the icon on the “Thumbs Up” so that when it animates in, it goes directly to the said icon. Then you have to add another keyframe after some time. And when you add a third one, place the “Mouse Cursor” icon on the subscribe button text.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-23.png"
                      alt="adding new keyframes on the mouse cursor icon"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Then add a similar pair of keyframes with some space from the last one and place the “Mouse Cursor” icon on the “Bell” icon.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-24.png"
                      alt="mouse curson on the bell icon"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>The last keyframe we have to add will place this “Mouse Cursor” icon out of our view. After that, you need to adjust these keyframes to set the speed of the moving “Mouse Cursor’ icon according to your taste.</li>
</ul>
<p>The final product up till now will be like this.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="successfully animated the mouse cursor icon"
                ></p>
<p>We are nearing our end, guys. Now we just need to make the graphics animate out of our view, and our work will be done. So let’s dive right into it.</p>
<h5 id="Step5-Animate-the-graphics-out"><a href="#Step5-Animate-the-graphics-out" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Animate the graphics out"></a>Step5 Animate the graphics out</h5><p>The process of animating out your graphics is like how we animated in our video. We just need to reverse those steps. So here’s how it’s done.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the white color layer and double-click on it to open its properties.</li>
<li>Now, from the “Animation” option, add a new keyframe a little before the end of the video.</li>
<li>After that, you have to add another keyframe at the end of your video. But in this keyframe, place the white color layer out of your view. Like this,</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="removed the white color layer from the frame"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Repeat the same steps for the red color layer, channel image layer, and icons layer.</li>
<li>After it’s done, the whole graphics will look like this.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="animated the color, image, and icons layers"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>The only thing that remains is to fix the text layers. For this, double-click on the channel text layer and go to the “Advanced” settings, just like before.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="click on the advanced option"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>From here, fix the text speed and end with your other graphic elements. After it’s done, we will do the same for the “Subscribe” button text.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adjust the text with your graphics"
                ></p>
<p>Finally, our graphic is completed. “Export” it from the software to your computer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="completed subscribe channel graphics"
                ></p>
<p>Whenever you want to use this graphic on your video, you have to import it first and enable the “Green Screen” option. It will remove the green background color. Then you can upload your video and place this graphic on it to add to the video. And that’s all.</p>

Here, we can make the structure of Subscribe channel graphics using different colors, icons, texts, and channel photos. We’ll start by adding color layers.</p>
<p><strong>1. Add color layers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the “Media” on the top left corner of the interface and Click on “Sample Color.” Here find the Green color and add it in the panel below as the first video layer by the drag-n-drop function.</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                      alt="adding a bright green color layer"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>We will key this layer at the end, so make sure not to use any other green graphics for your animation.</li>
<li>Let’s lock this layer because we will no longer use it. For this, click on the “Lock” icon on the layer’s left side.</li>
<li>Add white and red colors and stack them on top of the green color layer.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-4.png"
                      alt="white and red color layers added"
                ></p>
<p>After adding all three color layers, it’s time to crop these layers to make the structure of our graphic.</p>
<h5 id="Crop-the-Color-Layers-1"><a href="#Crop-the-Color-Layers-1" class="headerlink" title="Crop the Color Layers"></a><strong>Crop the Color Layers</strong></h5><ul>
<li>Go to the “Effects” tab from the top bar and search for the “Crop” effect. Then drag the effect and add it to the white and red layers on the panel.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<ul>
<li>First, click on the “Eye” icon beside the red color layer to hide it. Then double-click the white layer to see its properties. When the properties appear, select “Effects” from there.</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                ></p>
<ul>
<li>You can also enable the safe zones from the display settings on the right side of the panel. After that, crop the white layer first, then show the red layer and crop it too. It will look like this.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="enabling the safe zones"
                ></p>
<p>That’s it, folks. Our color backgrounds are here. Now we have to add our channel photo to this. So let’s move on to see how to do it.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Add a channel photo</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To add the channel photo, you can upload the image. Here we are going to use some images from the stock media. No matter the image, drop it down on the panel above the red color layer.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adding an image"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Now double-click on the image layer, and from the properties, go to the “Mask” option and select the circle. You can also select any other shape you like.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="select a shape for our image"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>After that, scroll down and make the circle even by matching all numbers. Then scale it down and place it on the left corner of the white layer.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adjusting the channel image"
                ></p>
<p>It’s done. Let’s add our channel text now.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Add texts</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For adding text, go to the “Titles” from the top bar and add the title you like to the panel.</li>

<ul>
<li>Now double-click this layer and add the text you want. You can also change the color of the text, scale it down and place it where ever you want.</li>
</ul>

                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Now, let’s add another title for the subscribe button. You have to place it on the red layer.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="subscribe button text added"
                ></p>
<p>We can’t finish our structure without icons, can we? So let’s move on to them.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Add icons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hit the “Element” from the top bar and search for the “Bell” icon. You will find the short animations of the bell. Add the suitable one to the panel.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adding a bell icon"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Now find a suitable place in the animation, stop it at that point, right-click on the element layer and add a freeze frame.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adding a freezeframe of the bell icon"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>You can also extend the freeze frame and remove the other parts. Then reduce its size and place it beside the “Subscribe” text.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adjust the bell icon"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Similarly, add “Thumbs Up” and “Mouse Cursor” icons on the panel.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="thumbs up and mouse cursor icons added"
                ></p>
<p>Finally, our structure is finished. Now let’s start animating.</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Animate-the-graphics-1"><a href="#Step3-Animate-the-graphics-1" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Animate the graphics"></a>Step3 Animate the graphics</h5><p>First, we’ll make it so that all these graphics come in from below the view.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the white layer first and double-click on it. Then hit the “Animation” option and scroll down. Here add a new keyframe by clicking “Add.” Now move the playhead to the beginning and place the white color layer out of the frame.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adding a new keyframe on the white color layer"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Now, do the same for channel photos and icons. The whole animation will look like this.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="successfully animated the graphics"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>As you can see, the text appears before the color layers. Let’s correct it. Double-click the text layer. Select the” Type Writer’ form and hit the “Advanced option.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="selecting type writer style for text"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Here, you can adjust the text with the color layers.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-21.png"
                      alt="adjusting the speed of the text"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>After adjusting both the channel name and subscribe button texts, your animation will appear like this.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="the speed of the text adjusted"
                ></p>
<p>If you’ve managed so far, then that’s great. We have done most of the work. Now we need to animate the graphics of the mouse cursor so that it clicks on the bell icon, thumb icon, and our subscribe button. The process is somewhat similar because we will need to add different keyframes. But still, let’s see it in detail.</p>
<h5 id="Step4-Animate-the-mouse-cursor-1"><a href="#Step4-Animate-the-mouse-cursor-1" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Animate the mouse cursor"></a>Step4 Animate the mouse cursor</h5><ul>
<li>Go to the “Mouse Cursor” icon layer and double-click on it. First, place the icon on the “Thumbs Up” so that when it animates in, it goes directly to the said icon. Then you have to add another keyframe after some time. And when you add a third one, place the “Mouse Cursor” icon on the subscribe button text.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-23.png"
                      alt="adding new keyframes on the mouse cursor icon"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Then add a similar pair of keyframes with some space from the last one and place the “Mouse Cursor” icon on the “Bell” icon.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="mouse curson on the bell icon"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>The last keyframe we have to add will place this “Mouse Cursor” icon out of our view. After that, you need to adjust these keyframes to set the speed of the moving “Mouse Cursor’ icon according to your taste.</li>
</ul>
<p>The final product up till now will be like this.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="successfully animated the mouse cursor icon"
                ></p>
<p>We are nearing our end, guys. Now we just need to make the graphics animate out of our view, and our work will be done. So let’s dive right into it.</p>
<h5 id="Step5-Animate-the-graphics-out-1"><a href="#Step5-Animate-the-graphics-out-1" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Animate the graphics out"></a>Step5 Animate the graphics out</h5><p>The process of animating out your graphics is like how we animated in our video. We just need to reverse those steps. So here’s how it’s done.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the white color layer and double-click on it to open its properties.</li>
<li>Now, from the “Animation” option, add a new keyframe a little before the end of the video.</li>
<li>After that, you have to add another keyframe at the end of your video. But in this keyframe, place the white color layer out of your view. Like this,</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="removed the white color layer from the frame"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Repeat the same steps for the red color layer, channel image layer, and icons layer.</li>
<li>After it’s done, the whole graphics will look like this.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="animated the color, image, and icons layers"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>The only thing that remains is to fix the text layers. For this, double-click on the channel text layer and go to the “Advanced” settings, just like before.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="click on the advanced option"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>From here, fix the text speed and end with your other graphic elements. After it’s done, we will do the same for the “Subscribe” button text.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adjust the text with your graphics"
                ></p>
<p>Finally, our graphic is completed. “Export” it from the software to your computer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="completed subscribe channel graphics"
                ></p>
<p>Whenever you want to use this graphic on your video, you have to import it first and enable the “Green Screen” option. It will remove the green background color. Then you can upload your video and place this graphic on it to add to the video. And that’s all.</p>

<p>Do you use QuickTime player to watch music videos, movies, and TV shows? Well, you may find it interesting that the QuickTime player allows you to add subtitles. As there are multiple methods through which you can add subtitles in QuickTime, we are going to discuss them one by one in this blog. So, let’s start our discussion!</p>

It’s up to you whether you want to view them while playing the video or not. If you are playing a video with embedded subtitles in the QuickTime player but are somehow unable to view the subtitles, it’s probably because the subtitles feature is turned off. So, you need to enable the subtitles by following certain steps.</p>

With QuickTime player, it is quite easy to add external subtitles files and watch movies and TV shows with subtitles of your choice. However, you first need to download an appropriate subtitles file for a video from a reliable website and then load it onto the QuickTime player.</p>
<p>While downloading subtitles for the QuickTime player, keep in mind that you need subtitles in .QT file format.</p>

<p>Step2 Navigate to the directory where you have downloaded the subtitles file.</p>
<p>Step3 Right-click the file and select the “Open with QuickTime” option.</p>
<p>Step4 You will be able to see the subtitles. Select all the subtitles, right-click and select “Copy”.</p>

In other words, you can use the iPad as an extension to the Mac. The iPad displays the subtitles while the video plays on the Mac.</p>
<p>While using an iPad as an extension to your Mac, there are certain things you need to keep in mind. They are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>To ensure a proper connection between the Mac and iPad, place both devices within 10 meters of each other.</li>
<li>To allow synchronization between the two devices, it is important that both of them are signed into one single iCloud account.</li>
<li>You also need to check the operating systems of both devices to make sure they connect with each other. To be precise, your Mac needs to run macOS Catalina or later versions, while your iPad should run iPadOS 13 or later versions.</li>
</ul>
<p>If all three conditions specified above are met, you can proceed to connect your iPad with Mac OS and watch subtitles on the iPad.</p>

In other words, you can use the iPad as an extension to the Mac. The iPad displays the subtitles while the video plays on the Mac.</p>
<p>While using an iPad as an extension to your Mac, there are certain things you need to keep in mind. They are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>To ensure a proper connection between the Mac and iPad, place both devices within 10 meters of each other.</li>
<li>To allow synchronization between the two devices, it is important that both of them are signed into one single iCloud account.</li>
<li>You also need to check the operating systems of both devices to make sure they connect with each other. To be precise, your Mac needs to run macOS Catalina or later versions, while your iPad should run iPadOS 13 or later versions.</li>
</ul>
<p>If all three conditions specified above are met, you can proceed to connect your iPad with Mac OS and watch subtitles on the iPad.</p>
