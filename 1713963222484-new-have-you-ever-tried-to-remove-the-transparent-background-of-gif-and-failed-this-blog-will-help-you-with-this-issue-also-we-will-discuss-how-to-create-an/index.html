<p><strong>Step 2: Set Up The Project</strong></p>

<p>For a better outcome, the frame-by-frame deletion of the GIF background is advisable. It might be a little time-consuming but it is the most appropriate and accurate approach. So, delete the background from each frame independently.</p>
<p>To move from one frame of the GIF to another, hold and move the blue arrow having a red line.</p>

But it can also be used to remove the background of an animated GIF. Here, we will discuss the step-by-step approach to removing an animated GIF background.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Import The GIF File</strong></p>
<p>This can be done in 2 ways. One is clicking and dragging the file from the file location on the computer, into Photoshop. The second way is to click on the “File” menu of Photoshop. Then tap on “Open” and double click on the desired GIF file.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="import file photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Set Up The Project</strong></p>
<p>It is required to edit each frame separately for deleting the background of an animated GIF (<strong>gif remove bg</strong>). For this:</p>
<p>Find the “Video Group” option on the right side of Photoshop. Right-click on it and tap on the “Ungroup layers” option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/why-your-transparent-gif-Is-hard-to-remove-and-how-to-do-with-It-2.jpg"
                      alt="ungroup video photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>This will give you the video layer, which you want to edit. Right-click on “layer 1” and tap on the “Convert to smart object” option. Again right-click on “Layer 1” and click on “Edit Contents”.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="converted to so photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>You will get a new Photoshop tap for the editing of GIF files. Just freely close the original tab.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Begin The Editing Part</strong></p>
<p>Find the blue line called the Timeline at the bottom of the screen. This Timeline will help you to edit the GIF. To make your editing easy, you can zoom on the frames with the help of a slider located at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>For a better outcome, the frame-by-frame deletion of the GIF background is advisable. It might be a little time-consuming but it is the most appropriate and accurate approach. So, delete the background from each frame independently.</p>
<p>To move from one frame of the GIF to another, hold and move the blue arrow having a red line.</p>
<p>\</p>

                      alt="move frame by frame photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Delete The Transparent GIF Background</strong></p>
<p>Now, delete the background of each frame of your GIF. To delete the background of any particular frame, click on that frame. For this, you can either use a “Quick Selection Tool” or a “Polygonal Lasso Tool”. You will get the final result that will be background free.</p>

But it can also be used to remove the background of an animated GIF. Here, we will discuss the step-by-step approach to removing an animated GIF background.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Import The GIF File</strong></p>
<p>This can be done in 2 ways. One is clicking and dragging the file from the file location on the computer, into Photoshop. The second way is to click on the “File” menu of Photoshop. Then tap on “Open” and double click on the desired GIF file.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/why-your-transparent-gif-Is-hard-to-remove-and-how-to-do-with-It-1.jpg"
                      alt="import file photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Set Up The Project</strong></p>
<p>It is required to edit each frame separately for deleting the background of an animated GIF (<strong>gif remove bg</strong>). For this:</p>
<p>Find the “Video Group” option on the right side of Photoshop. Right-click on it and tap on the “Ungroup layers” option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/why-your-transparent-gif-Is-hard-to-remove-and-how-to-do-with-It-2.jpg"
                      alt="ungroup video photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>This will give you the video layer, which you want to edit. Right-click on “layer 1” and tap on the “Convert to smart object” option. Again right-click on “Layer 1” and click on “Edit Contents”.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/why-your-transparent-gif-Is-hard-to-remove-and-how-to-do-with-It-3.jpg"
                      alt="converted to so photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>You will get a new Photoshop tap for the editing of GIF files. Just freely close the original tab.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Begin The Editing Part</strong></p>
<p>Find the blue line called the Timeline at the bottom of the screen. This Timeline will help you to edit the GIF. To make your editing easy, you can zoom on the frames with the help of a slider located at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>For a better outcome, the frame-by-frame deletion of the GIF background is advisable. It might be a little time-consuming but it is the most appropriate and accurate approach. So, delete the background from each frame independently.</p>
<p>To move from one frame of the GIF to another, hold and move the blue arrow having a red line.</p>
<p>\</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Delete The Transparent GIF Background</strong></p>
<p>Now, delete the background of each frame of your GIF. To delete the background of any particular frame, click on that frame. For this, you can either use a “Quick Selection Tool” or a “Polygonal Lasso Tool”. You will get the final result that will be background free.</p>
