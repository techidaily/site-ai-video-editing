<p>Step 3</p>
<p>Double-click on the Default Title once more and simply change the text color to anything other than black this time. Then, click <strong>OK</strong> and take another snapshot. After this, delete the Default Title from the Timeline.</p>

<p>Step 5</p>
<p>For the next step, you need to download a simple <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.pngfind.com/mpng/ihbooTJ%5Feffect-gfx-png-black-vignette-png-transparent-png/" >Vignette png image <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Then, import the Vignette image into Filmora. Go to <strong>My Media</strong> and click on <strong>Import Media.</strong> Import it and drag the image to the Timeline. Then, move that clip to Track 3.</p>

<p>Step 8</p>
<p>Place the Playhead at the beginning of the clip. Go to <strong>My Media</strong> and drag the Black snapshot to Track 5. Double-click on it → go to <strong>Animation</strong> and change the settings to look like this. Then, move the Playhead to 9 seconds. Here, change the <strong>X-axis</strong> to “<strong>150”</strong> and the <strong>Scale</strong> to <strong>75%.</strong></p>

<p>Step 9</p>
<p>Now, place the Playhead at the starting point and drag the colored snapshot in Track 6. Double-click on it and change the <strong>Scale</strong> to <strong>50%</strong>. Then, move the Playhead to 9 seconds again and change the <strong>Scale</strong> to <strong>75%.</strong> Click <strong>OK.</strong></p>
<p>Step 10</p>
<p>Go to <strong>Sample Color</strong> and drag “Gradient 4” to Track 7 on the Timeline. Double-click on it → go to the <strong>Video</strong> tab → change the Blending Mode to <strong>Overlay</strong> → decrease the Opacity to <strong>25%.</strong> Click <strong>OK.</strong></p>

<p>Step 12</p>
<p>Increase the Line’s length to be almost as long as the screen. Then adjust its position until half of the Line is visible on the screen. Like this.</p>

<p>Step 14</p>
<p>Now, select the Default Title on Track 9, double-click it, and go to the <strong>Animation</strong> tab. Move the Playhead at the starting point of the Timeline and add a keyframe. Then, move the Playhead to the end of the clip. Drag the <strong>X-axis</strong> position to the right until the Line shape moves all the way to the right side of the screen.</p>
<p>Do the same for the Default Title on Track 8. But this time, drag the <strong>X-axis</strong> position toward the other side. When you’re done, press <strong>OK.</strong></p>

<p>Step 5</p>
<p>For the next step, you need to download a simple <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.pngfind.com/mpng/ihbooTJ%5Feffect-gfx-png-black-vignette-png-transparent-png/" >Vignette png image <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Then, import the Vignette image into Filmora. Go to <strong>My Media</strong> and click on <strong>Import Media.</strong> Import it and drag the image to the Timeline. Then, move that clip to Track 3.</p>

<p>Step 8</p>
<p>Place the Playhead at the beginning of the clip. Go to <strong>My Media</strong> and drag the Black snapshot to Track 5. Double-click on it → go to <strong>Animation</strong> and change the settings to look like this. Then, move the Playhead to 9 seconds. Here, change the <strong>X-axis</strong> to “<strong>150”</strong> and the <strong>Scale</strong> to <strong>75%.</strong></p>

<p>Step 12</p>
<p>Increase the Line’s length to be almost as long as the screen. Then adjust its position until half of the Line is visible on the screen. Like this.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>Step 13</p>

<p>Step 14</p>
<p>Now, select the Default Title on Track 9, double-click it, and go to the <strong>Animation</strong> tab. Move the Playhead at the starting point of the Timeline and add a keyframe. Then, move the Playhead to the end of the clip. Drag the <strong>X-axis</strong> position to the right until the Line shape moves all the way to the right side of the screen.</p>
<p>Do the same for the Default Title on Track 8. But this time, drag the <strong>X-axis</strong> position toward the other side. When you’re done, press <strong>OK.</strong></p>

<li>Click on the sample videos tab, and a new <strong>window</strong> will appear on the library screen.</li>
<li>Here you will find almost more than <strong>20 videos.</strong></li>
