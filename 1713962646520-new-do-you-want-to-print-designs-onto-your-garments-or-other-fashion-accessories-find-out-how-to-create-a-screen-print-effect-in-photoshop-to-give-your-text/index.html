                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/creating-new-document-in-photoshop-to-use-screen-print-effect.png"
                      alt="click create new"
                ></p>
<p>Now, click the <strong>“File”</strong> option in the top toolbar, and from the drop-down menu, select <strong>“Open.”</strong> Next, choose the image you want to apply the screen print effect by browsing to its location on your computer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/adding-object-image-in-photoshop-to-create-screen-print-effect.png"
                      alt="click the file option"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Next, click the <strong>“Lasso”</strong> tool from the left-side menu to create the selection around the object in the image.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/selecting-object-via-lasso-tool-to-create-screen-print-effect-in-Photoshop.png"
                      alt="click the lasso tool"
                ></p>
<p>Press the <strong>CMD&#x2F;Ctrl + C</strong> on your computer’s keyboard to copy the selection. Next, click the “<strong>Layer</strong>“ option in the top toolbar, select “<strong>New</strong>,” and click “<strong>Layer via Copy</strong>.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/new-layer-via-copy-to-create-screen-print-effect-in-photoshop.png"
                      alt="click layer via copy"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 Now, hide the background layer in the <strong>“Layers”</strong> panel on the right-hand side, and you will get your object without any BG. Click the <strong>“Image”</strong> option in the top toolbar and select <strong>“Adjustments.”</strong></p>
<p>Click <strong>“Threshold…”</strong> from the drop-down menu, and set the <strong>“Threshold level.”</strong> Alternatively, you can click <strong>“Cmd&#x2F;ctrl+Shift+U”</strong> on the keyboard to desaturate the image.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="click threshold"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 Next, select the <strong>“Magic Eraser Tool”</strong> from the left-side menu and remove the white parts to smooth down the background. Afterward, choose the <strong>“Move Tool”</strong> from the menu and drag your object to a new layer.</p>
<p>To add the background image, click <strong>“File”</strong> and select <strong>“Open.”</strong> Next, select the file and again click <strong>“Open.”</strong></p>
<p>Step5 Select the object using the <strong>“Move Tool”</strong> and drag it to the background image layer. If the thing is too large and you want to resize it, select the object using the <strong>“CMD&#x2F;Ctrl”</strong> key and click <strong>“Edit”</strong> from the top toolbar. From the drop-down menu, choose <strong>“Transform”</strong> and click <strong>“Scale.”</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="select the object using the move tool"
                ></p>
<p>Next, drag the handles to adjust the size of the object on the Background image.</p>
<p>Step6 Click the <strong>“T”</strong> icon from the left-hand side menu and set the font style, color, and size. You can also click the <strong>“3D”</strong> option to convert your text to a three-dimensional form.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/adding-text-to-the-canvas-in-photoshop.png"
                      alt="click t icon"
                ></p>
<p>Try removing the left-out white patches on the object using the <strong>“Magic Eraser Tool”</strong> to give a polished look to the print screen effect. Once you are satisfied, click the <strong>“File”</strong> option from the top toolbar panel and select <strong>“Save As.”</strong></p>
<p>Type in the file name and select the file type from the drop-down menu next to <strong>“Save As Type.”</strong> Choose the storage location, click <strong>“Save”</strong> to export your final project, and you’re done!</p>

<h2 id="Tips-for-a-Fantastic-Logo-Intro"><a href="#Tips-for-a-Fantastic-Logo-Intro" class="headerlink" title="Tips for a Fantastic Logo Intro"></a>Tips for a Fantastic Logo Intro</h2><p>We hope the comprehensive guide above was easy to follow and inspired you to try your hand at creating your own logo reveal video. Without further ado, let’s discuss some tips for a fantastic logo intro.</p>
<ul>
<li>Start by conducting ample research to find as many intro videos as possible before attempting to make your own. Watching and learning will allow you to figure out what works and what you shouldn’t do. You might also discover many resources to make a fantastic intro video you missed.</li>
<li>Understand what message your company intends to send and tailor your intro video to portray it as accurately as possible. For instance, you could create a fun video to relay that your brand is easygoing.</li>
<li>It wouldn’t be a great idea to show your entire logo all at once. You could create anticipation by showing tiny bits of your logo in each frame till the final logo covers the screen.</li>
<li>Design your video in a manner that keeps your audience glued to the screen. The dynamism will keep the viewer watching because they don’t want to miss what comes next.</li>
<li>Though it is not mandatory, you could end the video on a dark background, such as pitch black, to ensure your logo is clearly visible to your audience.</li>
<li>The most important tip is to keep the video short, so you don’t bore your audience. The average attention span for most viewers is shorter than 15 seconds, meaning any video longer than that will cause them to click away from your video.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="People-Also-Ask"><a href="#People-Also-Ask" class="headerlink" title="People Also Ask"></a>People Also Ask</h2><p>Before we bid you goodbye, let’s answer some commonly asked questions about template intro logo and logo reveals.</p>
<h3 id="Q1-What-Is-a-Logo-Intro"><a href="#Q1-What-Is-a-Logo-Intro" class="headerlink" title="Q1. What Is a Logo Intro?"></a>Q1. What Is a Logo Intro?</h3><p>You have probably seen a logo intro before, even though you didn’t know what you were looking at. A logo intro is a short clip of a company’s logo that features before a movie.</p>
<p>Recently, companies have started warming up to logo intros to create a lasting impression on their visitors and prospective clients. You could use a logo intro to portray your unique character and encapsulate what you stand for. In addition, a logo intro is a sure way to gain a competitive advantage over your rivals.</p>
<h3 id="Q2-What-Is-a-Logo-Reveal"><a href="#Q2-What-Is-a-Logo-Reveal" class="headerlink" title="Q2. What Is a Logo Reveal?"></a>Q2. What Is a Logo Reveal?</h3><p>Contrary to the logo intro that features at the beginning of the clip, a logo reveal comes at the tail end. This short animation is a depiction of your logo, which helps cement your marketing strategy and display your brand in a more interactive manner.</p>
<p>A logo reveal is also known as a logo stinger or sting. Since the average attention span of Internet users is pretty short, it would be a great idea to keep the logo reveal to a maximum of 10 seconds. The shorter the video, the higher the chance your audience will grasp your message and remember your brand.</p>
<h3 id="Q3-What-Are-the-5-Rules-of-a-Good-Logo"><a href="#Q3-What-Are-the-5-Rules-of-a-Good-Logo" class="headerlink" title="Q3. What Are the 5 Rules of a Good Logo?"></a>Q3. What Are the 5 Rules of a Good Logo?</h3><p>You cannot create an unforgettable logo reveal without designing the logo first. Since your company logo appears on almost anything concerning your business, it would be wise to make a valiant effort to ensure it fits the bill. Below are some of the qualities of a good logo.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rules-of-good-logo.jpg"
                      alt="5 rules of a good logo"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Unique</strong></p>
<p>It would be a shame if your logo looked like someone else’s. Ensure your logo is your own creation and can easily be associated with your brand. Copying someone else’s logo could make your audience mistake you for someone else.</p>
<p><strong>Simple</strong></p>
<p>Complex logos are hard to recognize. They are also much harder to enlarge or reduce. It would help to incorporate strong lines and letters into your logo as opposed to thinner ones.</p>
<p><strong>Versatile</strong></p>
<p>Your logo should look good with or without colour. If you must add colour, ensure you don’t exceed four colours in the design. Remember that printing your logo when it contains too many colours becomes an expensive affair.</p>
<p><strong>Scalability</strong></p>
<p>It would help to ensure that your logo looks good in a big or small size. Remember that you will use your logo on letterheads and perhaps on large banners.</p>
<p><strong>Balanced</strong></p>
<p>Lastly, you should ensure that no element within your logo overpowers the rest. Ensure you keep all the elements in the centre because an asymmetrical logo with all the details in the corner doesn’t look aesthetically pleasing.</p>
<h3 id="Q4-What-Are-the-7-Elements-of-a-Good-Logo"><a href="#Q4-What-Are-the-7-Elements-of-a-Good-Logo" class="headerlink" title="Q4. What Are the 7 Elements of a Good Logo?"></a>Q4. What Are the 7 Elements of a Good Logo?</h3><p>The seven elements of a good logo include the following.</p>

                      alt="7 elements of a good logo"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Simplicity</strong></p>
<p>A simple design is far more superior to an overly complicated one. You could draw inspiration from brands like Nike.</p>
<p><strong>Memorability</strong></p>
<p>A good logo is one that your audience can remember off-head. Simple doesn’t always have to mean simplistic.</p>
<p><strong>Timelessness</strong></p>
<p>Trends come and go, but a timeless logo will remain appropriate in the years to come. It is not uncommon for some brands to retain their logos for more than a decade.</p>
<p><strong>Relevance</strong></p>
<p>It would be wise to ensure your logo relates to your industry in one way or the other.</p>
<p><strong>High-quality typography</strong></p>
<p>The wrong font on your logo can negatively impact your business. Your typography should also be easy to read from afar.</p>
<p><strong>Well-balanced colors</strong></p>
<p>Your choice of colors can subconsciously influence your target audience’s buying decisions and how they perceive you. For instance, blue communicates honesty and reliability, while yellow elicits feelings of happiness.</p>
<p><strong>Versatility</strong></p>
<p>Lastly, it would be wise to ensure that you can use your logo in numerous instances, like on a letterhead or on your social media platforms.</p>
