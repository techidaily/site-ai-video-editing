<h3 id="1-On-the-Fusion-Page"><a href="#1-On-the-Fusion-Page" class="headerlink" title="1. On the Fusion Page"></a>1. On the Fusion Page</h3><p>DaVinci has separate pages, like the Fusion page, for different uses. If you want to learn how to add a motion blur effect on the fusion page, check the following instructions carefully.</p>
<h3 id="What-is-the-Fusion-Page-in-DaVinci"><a href="#What-is-the-Fusion-Page-in-DaVinci" class="headerlink" title="What is the Fusion Page in DaVinci?"></a>What is the Fusion Page in DaVinci?</h3><p>On the Fusion page, you can use captivating visual effects to add a new perspective to your videos.

<p>So, by merging images, effects, and animations together, you can create a vibrant effect of your own efficiently. To add <strong>DaVinci Resolve motion blur</strong> on the fusion page, here are the simple steps:</p>
<p>Step1 Navigate to the DaVinci Resolve tool and upload your video. Now open the fusion page and press “Shift” and “Spacebar.” On the search box, type “Motion” and select “Motion Blur” from the results. After selecting it, tap on the “Add” button.</p>

Written in C&#x2F;C++ and built with Qt, OBS Studio provides real-time capture, scene composition, recording, encoding, and broadcasting via the Real Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP).It can stream Videos to any RTMP supporting destination including YouTube, Twitch, Instagram and Facebook.</p>
<p>You only need one green screen software – OBS. The reason why OBS is the most recommended for streaming is because once you have set it up properly, you can do literally anything you can think of with the software (either with or without added plug-ins).</p>
<h2 id="Chroma-Key-Settings-in-OBS"><a href="#Chroma-Key-Settings-in-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Chroma Key Settings in OBS"></a>Chroma Key Settings in OBS</h2><p>Chroma keying has become incredibly popular nowadays. People use it not just for gaming, but also in Zoom conferences, live interviews, talk shows, etc. Although it may feel complicated at first glance, setting up Chroma Key in OBS Studio is actually incredibly easy.</p>
<p>Have a look at the simple steps you need to take to set up a green screen in OBS:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you have the following equipment prepared: a solid green background, webcam or video camera, lighting, and OBS Studio.</li>
<li>Download the latest stable version of OBS Studio from the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://obsproject.com/" >official website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and install the software. Open OBS and let the Auto-Configuration Wizard optimize the software’s settings based on your hardware.</li>
<li>Now you can add a video source.</li>
<li>Right-click on the video source you’ve created and select Filter.</li>
<li>Click the + button under the Effects Filters section and select Chroma Key.</li>
<li>Type in a name for this effect layer.</li>
<li>After you add a chroma key, OBS will automatically create and adjust the baseline settings for the filter. You can experiment with the sliders and settle when you are satisfied with the result.</li>
<li>Make sure you aren’t wearing any green or reflective material. You can double-check the performance on the preview screen.</li>
<li>If things are working smoothly, you are all set to start streaming with the green screen on.</li>
</ol>
<p>Pro tip:</p>
<p>You can follow the instructions above and live stream to multiple platforms at once with Restream. Multistreaming to platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Twitch, and LinkedIn allows you to drastically increase the audience reach and grow your followers.</p>

<li>Watch out for light flares. Use some a matte box or your trusty paw to block out any unwanted light.</li>
<li>When lighting, try to create as much separation between your subject and the green screen as you can.</li>
<li>Shutter speed: Minimize motion blur by raising your shutter speed to 1&#x2F;80 or 1&#x2F;100</li>
<li>Aperture: Setting your aperture to f4 or f5.6 will give you slightly more depth of field, which will blur and smooth out your green screen.</li>
<li>Format: Set your camera to the best recording format it has.</li>
<li>ISO: Try to avoid high ISOs.</li>

<li>Evenly light your green screen so you can get a good key.</li>
<li>Watch out for light flares. Use some a matte box or your trusty paw to block out any unwanted light.</li>
<li>When lighting, try to create as much separation between your subject and the green screen as you can.</li>
<li>Shutter speed: Minimize motion blur by raising your shutter speed to 1&#x2F;80 or 1&#x2F;100</li>
<li>Aperture: Setting your aperture to f4 or f5.6 will give you slightly more depth of field, which will blur and smooth out your green screen.</li>
<li>Format: Set your camera to the best recording format it has.</li>
<li>ISO: Try to avoid high ISOs.</li>

Skip enabling the ‘Apply to All Slides’ option here; lest the track would play at the appearance of each presentation slide.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8: Preview the Presentation</strong></p>
<p>To have a look at your efforts, navigate to the ‘Menu Bar’ at the top of the app screen and hit the ‘Slide Show’ tab. In the menu that drops down, select the ‘Start From the First Slide’ option to view the presentation from the beginning. To exit the slideshow preview, press the ‘Esc’ key from your system’s keyboard.</p>
