A raw video footage is never appealing to the eyes because of sudden cuts, unnecessary parts, and lack of eye-catching effects. That is why video editing is crucial for turning an unappealing raw video into an attention-grabbing video. As a matter of fact, the way you edit your video makes your video stand out when you are posting on social media platforms.</p>
<p>One of the most important aspects of video editing is adding transitions to video clips. When you jump from one scene to another and make sudden cuts, you need to apply some video transitions so that the move from one scene to another becomes soothing to the eyes. Different video editors have different transition effects and <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> has the best collection of transitions.

What is a Video transition effect?</h2><p>A video transition effect is the most commonly used graphical effect in video editing. A video transition effect is essential whereby you connect one shot to another, especially when you are making sudden cuts in the video. Therefore, a video transition effect sits in between two shots and connects them together smoothly so that it does not look odd to the eyes. Video editing with transitions is a common practice for short videos on social media, presentation videos, and even movies.</p>
<p>A video transition effect is effective when you are jumping from two moods and emotions in the video. It is equally useful while jumping between storylines, points of view, and timelines. Besides, you can spice up your narrative and make your video eye-catching as well as eye-soothing. There are different types of video transition effects such as fade in and out, zoom in and out, dissolve, wipe and pan.</p>

Video transitions tips and tricks</h2><p>If you want to make your video stand out by simply using video transition effects, you have to follow the following tips and tricks.</p>
<p><strong>Consistency</strong> – Amateur video editors tend to use several extravagant transitions in one video that distract and even annoy the audience. You are using video transition effects not to distract but to smoothen the video content. Therefore, you need to be consistent with the video transition effect you use. You should use one or maximum of two transition effects throughout the video so that the audience does not get distracted.</p>
<p><strong>Experiment</strong> – While it is true that you should not be using too many video transitions in one video, but you should definitely apply different video transition effects in different videos initially. This will help you to understand which transition is getting better traction, and thereafter, you can stick to it for the rest of your videos. This is particularly useful when you are making similar type of content for social media and video streaming sites.</p>
<p><strong>Out of the Box</strong> – The reason you recommended <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is that there is a huge collection of different types of transition effects. If you use the regular transitions such as fade, zoom, wipe, and dissolve, you cannot create an impression among your viewers. You have to use out of the box transitions so that your video can look and feel different even when you content is not. There are 3D effects, social media effects, and different genres of effects that can go well with your video content.</p>
<p><strong>Judicious</strong> – There is a difference between transition effects and video effects. Transition effects should last only for a fraction of a second so that there is no aftereffect in mind. On the contrary, a video effect can last as long as required in the video. Therefore, do not stretch the duration of a transition effect and keep it as short as possible. Similarly, you should not use transition effects here and there unnecessarily. It should be used only when there is a proper scope such as scene cuts, mood changes, and subject changes.</p>
<p><strong>Meaningful</strong> – Even transition effect has a meaning behind it and you should understand it and use wherever appropriate. For example, fade out effect signifies the fading of a scene or changing of mood. Similarly, a dissolve effect is appropriate when the subject is dissolved in certain thoughts or a scene is getting dissolved. That way the effect will look natural and more meaningful as well as impactful.</p>
<h2 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>Video transition effects are essential in almost all types of videos. They enhance the video content and make the transition between scenes smoother. You should choose your video editor wisely so that you can avail different types of video transition effects.

<p>Following that, move the playhead again by 15 frames ahead. Rotate the letter again and change the Y-axis value until the letter rests at the bottom of the screen. Again, you have to move the play head on the timeline to 10 frames ahead and adjust the Y-axis and Rotation values to a higher point.

Adjust the starting point for this layer to frame five from the beginning, and move the file to that starting point. In the end, cut the title length at the same position as layer one was, at 3.15 seconds.</p>
<p>Follow the process explained in the previous section for the first letter, i.e., moving the playhead at specific frames and changing the Y-axis and Rotation value multiple times.</p>
<p>After editing the second letter in the title, repeat the process of holding and dragging the default title to Track 3 in the timeline and adjusting starting position at the 10th frame. Again, follow the process of animating the letter like for Letter 1 and Letter 2. Continue doing this process for multiple more letters in your title text.</p>

While the feature is available in many other editing software, you can expect a better user experience on Filmora, especially as a beginner-level user.</p>

Different title templates, like Custom, Openers, End Credits, etc., will appear. Choose the default title of your liking and download it.</p>
<p>Next, hold the title that appears in the library window and then drag it to the first layer of the editing timeline. Clip the title short by moving the play head to the 3-second and 15 frames mark and shape the title to that length. Then, delete the rest of the part.</p>

<h2 id="Animate-the-characters-1"><a href="#Animate-the-characters-1" class="headerlink" title="Animate the characters"></a>Animate the characters</h2><p>When this part is done, in the text field, add the first letter of the text you will add to your animated introduction. After inserting the first letter only, click on the Animation tab next. Following that, you have to move the playhead on your timeline to the very front. You will see the Position parameter in the Animation settings and change the number in the Y axis until it goes out of the top frame of the video.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Next, you must move the play head to the 1-second position in the timeline. Here, you must change the number Y axis to a lower position and adjust the Rotate element as per your preference. After that, move the playhead again to 15 frames from the 1-second mark. It would be best if you changed the Y-axis position digit to 0 and adjusted the Rotation value slightly.</p>
<p>Following that, move the playhead again by 15 frames ahead. Rotate the letter again and change the Y-axis value until the letter rests at the bottom of the screen. Again, you have to move the play head on the timeline to 10 frames ahead and adjust the Y-axis and Rotation values to a higher point. Then, continue the step like this at ten frames forward, this time making the character move to the ground again. Press the OK button to complete.</p>

Adjust the starting point for this layer to frame five from the beginning, and move the file to that starting point. In the end, cut the title length at the same position as layer one was, at 3.15 seconds.</p>
<p>Follow the process explained in the previous section for the first letter, i.e., moving the playhead at specific frames and changing the Y-axis and Rotation value multiple times.</p>
<p>After editing the second letter in the title, repeat the process of holding and dragging the default title to Track 3 in the timeline and adjusting starting position at the 10th frame. Again, follow the process of animating the letter like for Letter 1 and Letter 2. Continue doing this process for multiple more letters in your title text.</p>
