<p>Repeat the same for all the split parts following the first one, changing the character to any random alphabet.

After doing this, go back to the first clip of your collection and double-click on it after selling it. Tap on the text field and give it another random letter.</p>

<p>Like with the first clip, continue doing this step for all of the next clips, except for the final clip. Then, export it in the same manner as the first clip.</p>
<p>Now that you know how to edit the first and second letters in sequence, repeat this process for all of the letters of your title to create a full clip for all of the intro title letters.

Edit the second letter clip and so on</h2><p>After exporting the first file that will ultimately become the first letter of your random letter reveal intro title, you have to make the second letter-related clip.</p>

After doing this, go back to the first clip of your collection and double-click on it after selling it. Tap on the text field and give it another random letter.</p>
