<p>1. Balance Beam</p>
<p>Ever wanted to walk across a small beam way high up in the air? Me neither, but you can make a cool effect that looks like you did. Throwing a green screen on the ground and then building a balance beam over top of it you can start recording the main shot. Strap a GoPro to your head and look down while walking across the beam.</p>
<p>2. Shrink Effect</p>
<p>Okay this one is really easy. Take some footage of a person walking in front of a green screen, ideally looking at something to be featured in the main shot to sell the effect. Then take a close up of a small object. Key out the green behind the person, take the footage and drop it over your close up, and then scale it to match. Duplicate it, mirror it horizontally to act as a reflection and then drop the opacity and add some blur to make it look more realistic. It’s a fun little trick.</p>
<p>3. Floating Object</p>
<p>This is a simple one, making an object appear to be floating. This is another two clip shot. First, take a shot with the object hanging in front of a blue screen. Then on the same location, take another shot but while pretending to levitate the hammer. Masking around the hammer will get rid of the string for hanging, key out the blue, and then dropping it on top of the other clip is all you need.</p>

<p>Save and Export: Then you can save or export the video.</p>
<p>A green screen is a green surface used as a background when filming so that any image can replace the screen behind the actor or presenter. Shooting with a green screen involves filming a person or adding visual effects in front of a solid color. Then, by digitally removing or “keying out” that color, you can drop that scene onto the background of your choice in post-production. Removing the colored background is also referred to as “chroma keying.”</p>
<p><strong>Steps with Images</strong></p>
<p>The first step is to record footage in front of a green screen so that you can import it into WeVideo as a media file. To capture footage that is optimal for the Green Screen effect, please ensure the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is ample lighting distributed evenly around you with no shadows.</li>
<li>You are in front of a <strong>solid background with no creases</strong>. Green or blue is the recommended color for your background.</li>
<li>The quality of your camera is high enough so that the footage is not pixelated or grainy. 720p HD footage or above is recommended.</li>
</ul>
<p>Step 2) Add media to the Timeline</p>
<p>Once you’ve captured the footage you want to use for the Green Screen effect, import that media file and add it to the Timeline. Remember to place the green screen footage in the Video 2 track and the clip you would like to use as the background in the Video 1 track.</p>
<p>If you are using more than two video tracks, place the green screen footage in the track above whichever track holds the background footage to ensure proper layering techniques are used.</p>
<p> Step 3) Open the clip editor</p>

<p>A green screen is a green surface used as a background when filming so that any image can replace the screen behind the actor or presenter. Shooting with a green screen involves filming a person or adding visual effects in front of a solid color. Then, by digitally removing or “keying out” that color, you can drop that scene onto the background of your choice in post-production. Removing the colored background is also referred to as “chroma keying.”</p>
<p><strong>Steps with Images</strong></p>
<p>The first step is to record footage in front of a green screen so that you can import it into WeVideo as a media file. To capture footage that is optimal for the Green Screen effect, please ensure the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is ample lighting distributed evenly around you with no shadows.</li>
<li>You are in front of a <strong>solid background with no creases</strong>. Green or blue is the recommended color for your background.</li>
<li>The quality of your camera is high enough so that the footage is not pixelated or grainy. 720p HD footage or above is recommended.</li>
</ul>
<p>Step 2) Add media to the Timeline</p>
<p>Once you’ve captured the footage you want to use for the Green Screen effect, import that media file and add it to the Timeline. Remember to place the green screen footage in the Video 2 track and the clip you would like to use as the background in the Video 1 track.</p>
<p>If you are using more than two video tracks, place the green screen footage in the track above whichever track holds the background footage to ensure proper layering techniques are used.</p>
<p> Step 3) Open the clip editor</p>
<p>Double click on the green screen clip in the Timeline to open the clip editor. In the clip editor, navigate to the Color Keying tab.</p>
<p> Step 4) Use the color picker tool</p>

<h2 id="Beginners-Guide-to-Green-Screen-Keying"><a href="#Beginners-Guide-to-Green-Screen-Keying" class="headerlink" title="Beginners Guide to Green Screen Keying"></a>Beginners Guide to Green Screen Keying</h2><p>Did they have dinner on Mars? Photographers are becoming more daring with their creations thanks to the advancement in editing software. For example, after effects green screen keying allows you to alter your image’s background during post-production.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/green-screen-key-1.jpg"
                      alt="green screen key"
                ></p>
<p>The following is all you need to know about the green screen key effect and how to apply it using different video editing software. In addition, you will discover why the effect is popular with video editors. Keep reading to find out more.</p>
<h2 id="Part1-What-is-keying-in-green-screen"><a href="#Part1-What-is-keying-in-green-screen" class="headerlink" title="Part1: What is keying in green screen?"></a>Part1: What is keying in green screen?</h2><p>Keying refers to a post-production process of separating and isolating an image’s aspects using color or brightness. Typically, filmmakers use it to remove green screens and make color corrections to add warmth to the subjects’ skin tones.</p>
<p>It involves identifying a color or brightness value that you will make transparent in the photo. In addition, you can use two types of keys during the keying process.</p>
<h3 id="Chroma-Keys"><a href="#Chroma-Keys" class="headerlink" title="Chroma Keys"></a>Chroma Keys</h3><p>These allow you to select a specific color in your image and make everything that features the color transparent. Typically, chrome keys are best for images and videos featuring lots of green or blue backgrounds.</p>
<h3 id="Luma-Keys"><a href="#Luma-Keys" class="headerlink" title="Luma Keys"></a>Luma Keys</h3><p>Alternatively, you can use luma keys to determine which backgrounds will be transparent according to the brightness level. In addition, you can use them to designate the backgrounds you want opaque in your final image.</p>
<p>So, why do filmmakers prefer using a green screen? First, green is not a natural color in human skin tones. As such, it allows you more creative freedom with your shots. In addition, most digital cameras feature more green photosites allowing you to capture more details in your shots and making it the default choice for filmmakers.</p>
<p>However, you can also use a blue screen for your shots if green is your subject’s main color scheme. This is because blue is also rare among human subjects and allows you greater flexibility than any other background alternative.</p>
<p>Using a green screen key is an important skill to learn as a filmmaker. This is because it allows you more creative freedom resulting in more iconic images and photos. Although most video editing software allows you to apply the effect easily, it still requires finesse.</p>
<p>For example, using after effects green screen keying incorrectly can result in spill issues. This is when the green light from your screen bounces back to your subject. As such, you lose some subject detail, and the image appears messy.</p>
<p>Furthermore, not all video editing software includes the green screen key tool. Therefore, always check your software details before purchasing a copy. The next section contains step-by-step guides on performing green screen keying on some of the industry’s most popular software.</p>
<h2 id="Part2-How-to-do-Green-Screen-Keying-in-After-Effects"><a href="#Part2-How-to-do-Green-Screen-Keying-in-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Part2: How to do Green Screen Keying in After Effects?"></a>Part2: How to do Green Screen Keying in After Effects?</h2><p>Adobe After Effects green screen keying tool is arguably one of the top favorites for filmmakers. It features a user-friendly interface, and several keying presets you can use to achieve incredible photo finishes. For example, the Keylight effect is an Academy Award-winning preset you can use to apply professional-quality color keying.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to do green screen keying using Adobe After Effects.</p>

                      alt="upload footage to adobe"
                ></p>
<p>Launch the program from your macOS or Windows device, and click on the <strong>New Composition From Footage</strong> option. A pop-up window with your file locations will appear and click on the footage you want to import. Ensure the footage you use is shot using a green screen background to achieve the best results.</p>
<h3 id="2-Using-the-green-screen-key-presets"><a href="#2-Using-the-green-screen-key-presets" class="headerlink" title="2. Using the green screen key presets"></a>2. Using the green screen key presets</h3><p><img

                      alt="using the green screen key presets"
                ></p>
<p>Once the footage is imported, click on the <strong>Window</strong> menu option on your workspace, and click on <strong>Effects &amp; Presets</strong> from the sub-menu. Once the panel opens, tap <strong>Animation Presets</strong> and highlight the <strong>Keylight + Key Cleaner + Advanced Spill Suppressor</strong> preset from the <strong>Image-Utilities</strong> menu.</p>
<h3 id="3-Drag-and-drop-the-preset-to-your-footage"><a href="#3-Drag-and-drop-the-preset-to-your-footage" class="headerlink" title="3. Drag and drop the preset to your footage"></a>3. Drag and drop the preset to your footage</h3><p>Then drag and drop the effect to your uploaded footage to begin the keying process. The green screen key preset applies three effects to your image:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keylight effect.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The effect allows you to select the background color you want to make transparent. First, select the green screen background by clicking on <strong>Screen Color</strong> and selecting <strong>Color Picker</strong>. Then apply the effect by clicking on the green background closest to your subject.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key cleaner effect.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The key cleaner effect sharpens your subject’s edges for a more detailed finish. In addition, you will rarely adjust its values because it automatically corresponds to the changes you make using the Keylight effect. However, you can adjust the <strong>Additional Edge Radius</strong> and <strong>Reduce Chatter</strong> options to decrease the visible noise of your image. Furthermore, you can use the <strong>Alpha Contrast</strong> adjustment to increase the sharpness of your subject’s edges.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Advanced spill suppressor.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes your green screen background can spill to your subject’s edges resulting in a messy outline. For example, you may find a green outline on your subject’s hair or clothing. The <strong>Advanced Spill Suppressor</strong> eliminates these outlines automatically. You can enable the effect by clicking the check box next to the effect from the <strong>Animation Presets</strong> panel.</p>
<h3 id="4-Apply-a-new-background"><a href="#4-Apply-a-new-background" class="headerlink" title="4. Apply a new background"></a>4. Apply a new background</h3><p>Once you apply the green screen key effect, you can add any custom background to your footage. You need to <strong>Import</strong> the file to your After Effects library and then drag &amp; drop it into your footage’s timeline.</p>
<p>Remember, you must have an active Adobe After Effects license to access the green screen keying feature. In addition, you get access to Adobe Creative Cloud, which offers access to creative asset libraries such as Behance and Adobe Fonts. Alternatively, you can check out the free 7-day trial available to all new users.</p>

<ul>

<h3 id="3-Merge-the-new-background"><a href="#3-Merge-the-new-background" class="headerlink" title="3. Merge the new background"></a>3. Merge the new background</h3><p>Once you complete the green screen keying, merging the new background is next. You do this by seamlessly positioning the background to fit your green screen footage. Then, the Filmora Chroma key tool will merge the images or footage and make it appear as one clip.</p>
<h3 id="4-Export-your-content"><a href="#4-Export-your-content" class="headerlink" title="4. Export your content"></a>4. Export your content</h3><p>Finally, you can export your content in multiple formats to suit your desired platform. For example, you can export the file in either MP4, WMV, or MOV to share on most social media platforms.</p>
<p>Please note that you need an active Filmora subscription to use Chroma Key. In addition, you can subscribe to individual and business plans depending on your requirements. However, any creations using the Filmora Individual plan require you to mention the software in their description.</p>
<h2 id="Part4-FAQs"><a href="#Part4-FAQs" class="headerlink" title="Part4: FAQs"></a>Part4: FAQs</h2><h3 id="1-Is-there-a-difference-between-chroma-keying-and-green-screening"><a href="#1-Is-there-a-difference-between-chroma-keying-and-green-screening" class="headerlink" title="1. Is there a difference between chroma keying and green screening?"></a>1. Is there a difference between chroma keying and green screening?</h3><p>No. There is no difference between chroma keying and green screening. Both processes involve you replacing a specific color in your image and replacing it with a new background. In addition, some filmmakers use the terms synonymously because green is the best color to use when chroma keying. However, you can also use other colors for your chroma keying, with blue being the next best alternative.</p>
<h3 id="2-Can-you-create-a-green-screen-video-without-using-a-green-screen-background"><a href="#2-Can-you-create-a-green-screen-video-without-using-a-green-screen-background" class="headerlink" title="2. Can you create a green screen video without using a green screen background?"></a>2. Can you create a green screen video without using a green screen background?</h3><p>Yes. It is possible to create a green screen video without a green background. Several apps, including Zoom and Tik Tok, have in-built digital green screens, which you can use to customize your creations. However, you need to have a capable device to access the function.</p>
