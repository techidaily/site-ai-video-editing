                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You don’t want all the outlines to play simultaneously. Otherwise, the outlines will not appear to be separate.</p>
<ul>
<li>To do so, stack the videos on each other on different tracks.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> The trick here will be to offset the video by a few seconds so that each video plays a little later than the other.</p>

                ></p>

<ul>
<li>Double-click on each video.</li>
<li>In the editing panel, choose compositing.</li>
<li>From there, select the “<strong>Lighten</strong>“ option.</li>

<ul>
<li>Go to the effects tab and search for “<strong>Glow</strong>.”</li>
<li>Click and <strong>drag</strong> the glow effect to each of the exported videos.</li>
</ul>

                ></p>
<p>You can make it more fun by going one step further!</p>
<ul>
<li>Double-click on each of the glow effects that you added.</li>
<li>In effect, the <strong>editing panel</strong> goes to the video effects.</li>
<li>Here, you can change the <strong>radius</strong> of the Glow effect you added.</li>
<li>Similarly, you can do it in all the other videos.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="Step9-Apply-the-Green-screen-effect"><a href="#Step9-Apply-the-Green-screen-effect" class="headerlink" title="Step9 Apply the Green screen effect"></a>Step9 Apply the Green screen effect</h5><p>We will change our green screen for the final part. Follow the last steps, and then enjoy!</p>
<ul>
<li>Move the green screen footage below them all to the top track.</li>
<li>Double-click the video to enter the editing panel.</li>
<li>Go to the chroma key (Green Screen) in the editing panel**.**</li>
<li>Click on the arrow aside from the tab.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="Step2-Add-the-Same-Video-again-1"><a href="#Step2-Add-the-Same-Video-again-1" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Add the Same Video again"></a>Step2 Add the Same Video again</h5><p>We aim to create a black background for the original video we imported above. To do so, follow the steps mentioned below.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drag</strong> and <strong>drop</strong> the same video on the timeline.</li>
<li>Make sure to drag and drop it above the original video.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h5 id="Step3-Go-into-the-Compositing-Mode-1"><a href="#Step3-Go-into-the-Compositing-Mode-1" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Go into the Compositing Mode"></a>Step3 Go into the Compositing Mode</h5><p>After adding the same video, now convert BG into a black screen. For this, follow the given steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Double</strong>-<strong>Click</strong> on the video we added later.</li>
<li>A video editing panel will open up in the <strong>Import</strong></li>
<li>Scroll down till you see the compositing tab.</li>
<li>Here will have to change the Blending mode.</li>
<li>Click on the tab ahead that is labeled “<strong>Norma</strong>“</li>
<li>A drop-down option will open up.</li>
<li>In this drop-down option, scroll below to “<strong>Difference</strong>“.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/neon-dance-effect-4.png"
                      alt="changing the blending mode to difference"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>As soon as you click on the Difference option, you will notice a change in the main play window; it will all turn to a <strong>black screen</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="Step4-Add-the-Pixelated-Edges-effect-1"><a href="#Step4-Add-the-Pixelated-Edges-effect-1" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Add the Pixelated Edges effect"></a>Step4 Add the Pixelated Edges effect</h5><p>Our target is to outline the individual in the video, so we can move on to create the Neon Highlight effect. To do so, follow these steps!</p>
<ul>
<li>First, go into the effects option that you can select from the tab above the import window.</li>
<li>In the effects panel, search for the <strong>Pixelated edges</strong></li>
<li>You will notice a search bar in the top right corner. Type “<strong>Pixelated edges,</strong>“ and you will see some effects pop up in the import window.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/neon-dance-effect-5.png"
                      alt="searching for pixelated edges effect"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Select the Pixelated edges effect. Then, click and drag it below the video that we turned to black using the <strong>Difference</strong></li>
<li>The edges of the individual dancing in the video will be outlined.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/neon-dance-effect-6.png"
                      alt="after adding a pixelated effect to the video"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step5-Change-the-outline-color-1"><a href="#Step5-Change-the-outline-color-1" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Change the outline color"></a>Step5 Change the outline color</h5><p>You may not like the default color with the Pixelated edges effect. But no worries, you can change that to whatever color you desire by following these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Double-Click on the video in which you added the <strong>effect</strong>.</li>
<li>An editing panel will pop up.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Effect</strong> option below the <strong>Video</strong></li>
<li>Here, you can see the color option.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>color</strong> and select whatever suits you the best.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/neon-dance-effect-7.png"
                      alt="change the color of the outline"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step6-Create-Multiple-Outlines-1"><a href="#Step6-Create-Multiple-Outlines-1" class="headerlink" title="Step6 Create Multiple Outlines"></a>Step6 Create Multiple Outlines</h5><p>It would help if you created multiple outlines to achieve the Neon Dance effect. These multiple outlines will be produced by exporting them multiple times with the color you want. Follow the below points to get it instantly!</p>
<ul>
<li>When you have selected the color for your outline, export the video by clicking on the <strong>Export</strong> icon in the top right corner.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/neon-dance-effect-8.png"
                      alt="export the video"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>When you have exported the video, move back to the timeline to edit again.</li>
<li>As we had selected the <strong>Blue</strong> color for reference, now choose another color you wish.</li>
<li>After changing the video, export it again.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Export as many times as you want with the color of your choice. <strong>E.g., 5 colors &#x3D; 5 exports.</strong></p>
<h5 id="Step7-Import-the-exported-videos-1"><a href="#Step7-Import-the-exported-videos-1" class="headerlink" title="Step7 Import the exported videos"></a>Step7 Import the exported videos</h5><ul>
<li>Now you have to import the videos that you exported.</li>
<li>Before doing that, first, delete the video in track 2. (The video on which we applied the <strong>Difference</strong>)</li>
<li>Now select all the exports from your library and import them onto the import window.</li>
<li>Please select all of them and drag them on the timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You don’t want all the outlines to play simultaneously. Otherwise, the outlines will not appear to be separate.</p>
<ul>
<li>To do so, stack the videos on each other on different tracks.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> The trick here will be to offset the video by a few seconds so that each video plays a little later than the other.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/neon-dance-effect-9.png"
                      alt="offset the videos by a few seconds"
                ></p>
<p>To efficiently blend the outlines with the green screen, you can change the blending mode of each of the exported videos to “<strong>Lighten</strong>.”</p>
<ul>
<li>Double-click on each video.</li>
<li>In the editing panel, choose compositing.</li>
<li>From there, select the “<strong>Lighten</strong>“ option.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/neon-dance-effect-10.png"
                      alt="change the blending mode to lighten"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step8-Add-the-Glow-effect-1"><a href="#Step8-Add-the-Glow-effect-1" class="headerlink" title="Step8 Add the Glow effect"></a>Step8 Add the Glow effect</h5><p>To make the outlines glow like Neon lights, we will need to add another effect from the effects library.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the effects tab and search for “<strong>Glow</strong>.”</li>
<li>Click and <strong>drag</strong> the glow effect to each of the exported videos.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/neon-dance-effect-11.gif"
                      alt="add the glow effect"
                ></p>
<p>You can make it more fun by going one step further!</p>
<ul>
<li>Double-click on each of the glow effects that you added.</li>
<li>In effect, the <strong>editing panel</strong> goes to the video effects.</li>
<li>Here, you can change the <strong>radius</strong> of the Glow effect you added.</li>
<li>Similarly, you can do it in all the other videos.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="Step9-Apply-the-Green-screen-effect-1"><a href="#Step9-Apply-the-Green-screen-effect-1" class="headerlink" title="Step9 Apply the Green screen effect"></a>Step9 Apply the Green screen effect</h5><p>We will change our green screen for the final part. Follow the last steps, and then enjoy!</p>
<ul>
<li>Move the green screen footage below them all to the top track.</li>
<li>Double-click the video to enter the editing panel.</li>
<li>Go to the chroma key (Green Screen) in the editing panel**.**</li>
<li>Click on the arrow aside from the tab.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will immediately see changes to your video in the main play window. Play the video from the start and notice the changes.</p>
