<p><strong>HOW TO CUT VIDEO ON MAC WITHOUT USING FFMPEG?</strong></p>
<p>What are FFmpeg and its cons for cut videos?</p>
<p>Without transcoding the media, FFmpeg can cut, trim, and extract videos. This is an excellent method for preserving original quality and avoiding generation loss.</p>
<p>Because of how keyframes work, it is impossible to cut at an exact point in time using FFmpeg without transcoding the video. As a result, you’re left with a cut at the nearest keyframe.</p>

It was released two decades ago to provide low-cost video editing software. Aside from video cutting and joining, it has some great features such as adding filters, titles, texts, and so on. You can also record your voice or live music, mix audio and video tracks, and do other things. It is simple to use and is available for both Mac and Windows users.</p>
<p>Filmora includes an instant cutter tool that can be used throughout clip import and is designed for use with large amounts of high-resolution content. As the names indicate, it is very simple and serves only one purpose. You can drag multiple clips onto its window, but only if the Merge sub-mode is enabled. Trim mode is only for trimming the ends of a single clip, and its interface only displays one clip in the left-size source tray. You can Add Segments, which creates a new clip based on your trimmed original, but you can’t split a clip explicitly.</p>

<ul>
<li>Support of chapter selections</li>
<li>Support of subtitles</li>
<li>Integrated bitrate calculator</li>
<li>Picture deinterlacing, cropping, and scaling</li>
<li>Live Video Preview</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>HandBrake has a very simple layout which makes the video converter very easy to use, even for those who are converting videos for the first time.</li>
<li>The live preview helps.</li>

<p><strong>Supported OS: Linux, BSD, Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows</strong></p>
<p>Avidemux offers three fundamental operations: cutting, encoding, and filtering. Cutting allows users to copy, paste, save, or delete a specific part of a video and is incredibly beneficial when users are only interested in a small portion of a video or want to remove commercials from a TV show that they have recorded.</p>
<p>Encoding, on the other contrary, is the way of transforming a video to various formats so that it can be played on different players. Users of Avidemux can use this feature on videos they want to use for business or archive for personal use. They could also use this to convert a video that they intend to post online.</p>
<p>Users can also use Avidemux to filter their videos, which include incorporating subtitles and color profiles, deinterlacing, resizing and sharpening the image of a video, and increasing or decreasing the overall volume of the audio.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Avidemux has task automation features that make video processing and editing quick and painless. A feature called Joblist allows users to organize their projects in a queue so that they can access their files from a single location. They can use this queue to handle videos in bulk as well.</p>

<ul>
<li>Multiple Formats</li>
<li>Video Filters</li>
<li>Advanced Interlacing</li>

<p><strong>Supported OS: Linux, BSD, Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows</strong></p>
<p>Avidemux offers three fundamental operations: cutting, encoding, and filtering. Cutting allows users to copy, paste, save, or delete a specific part of a video and is incredibly beneficial when users are only interested in a small portion of a video or want to remove commercials from a TV show that they have recorded.</p>
<p>Encoding, on the other contrary, is the way of transforming a video to various formats so that it can be played on different players. Users of Avidemux can use this feature on videos they want to use for business or archive for personal use. They could also use this to convert a video that they intend to post online.</p>
<p>Users can also use Avidemux to filter their videos, which include incorporating subtitles and color profiles, deinterlacing, resizing and sharpening the image of a video, and increasing or decreasing the overall volume of the audio.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Avidemux has task automation features that make video processing and editing quick and painless. A feature called Joblist allows users to organize their projects in a queue so that they can access their files from a single location. They can use this queue to handle videos in bulk as well.</p>

<p><strong>Supported OS: Linux, BSD, Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows</strong></p>
<p>Avidemux offers three fundamental operations: cutting, encoding, and filtering. Cutting allows users to copy, paste, save, or delete a specific part of a video and is incredibly beneficial when users are only interested in a small portion of a video or want to remove commercials from a TV show that they have recorded.</p>
<p>Encoding, on the other contrary, is the way of transforming a video to various formats so that it can be played on different players. Users of Avidemux can use this feature on videos they want to use for business or archive for personal use. They could also use this to convert a video that they intend to post online.</p>
<p>Users can also use Avidemux to filter their videos, which include incorporating subtitles and color profiles, deinterlacing, resizing and sharpening the image of a video, and increasing or decreasing the overall volume of the audio.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Avidemux has task automation features that make video processing and editing quick and painless. A feature called Joblist allows users to organize their projects in a queue so that they can access their files from a single location. They can use this queue to handle videos in bulk as well.</p>

<p><strong>Supported OS: Linux, BSD, Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows</strong></p>
<p>Avidemux offers three fundamental operations: cutting, encoding, and filtering. Cutting allows users to copy, paste, save, or delete a specific part of a video and is incredibly beneficial when users are only interested in a small portion of a video or want to remove commercials from a TV show that they have recorded.</p>
<p>Encoding, on the other contrary, is the way of transforming a video to various formats so that it can be played on different players. Users of Avidemux can use this feature on videos they want to use for business or archive for personal use. They could also use this to convert a video that they intend to post online.</p>
<p>Users can also use Avidemux to filter their videos, which include incorporating subtitles and color profiles, deinterlacing, resizing and sharpening the image of a video, and increasing or decreasing the overall volume of the audio.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Avidemux has task automation features that make video processing and editing quick and painless. A feature called Joblist allows users to organize their projects in a queue so that they can access their files from a single location. They can use this queue to handle videos in bulk as well.</p>

<p>However, let me tell you a secret that many podcastors didn’t buy any audio equipment for the launch of their podcast channel on Spotify.</p>
<p>Moreover, many writers don’t want to show their voice through recordings. This is because they couldn’t just make a recording and hand it off to a sound specialist. Besides, finding their voice through the stories they write is the routine.</p>
