Regular gear like cameras and lights are slightly cheaper, but there are plenty of ways to DIY regular items to use as film gear.</p>
<p>Making DIY film gear may not give you the same look as professional gear, but it could be a fun project and give you similar looks on a budget. In this article, let’s look at some dollar-store DIY hacks that you can use for filmmaking on a budget.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h2 id="Tip-1-Add-foreground-elements-to-improve-the-frame-of-videos"><a href="#Tip-1-Add-foreground-elements-to-improve-the-frame-of-videos" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1. Add foreground elements to improve the frame of videos"></a>Tip 1. Add foreground elements to improve the frame of videos</h2><p>Let’s start with something we can do to enhance your framing. Sometimes we want to direct our audience’s attention to a specific part of the frame. In this case, it’s the talent of placing an object in the shot’s foreground that can help us do that. While also making a more attractive frame. At the dollar store, try using something like these fake plants.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/dollar-store-film-making-hacks-2.png"
                      alt="fake plants"
                ></p>
<p>You can place it in front of your lens. Then focus on the talent behind it, giving a blurry foreground that perfectly frames the talent. Here’s how the shot looks with and without foreground elements.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/dollar-store-film-making-hacks-3.png"
                      alt="framing the subject"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Remember, you can also use a <strong>different angle</strong> than simply approaching the object from the front. You can try and use different perspectives until you find the shot or footage you are looking for.</p>
<h2 id="Tip-2-Adjust-lights-with-poster-boards"><a href="#Tip-2-Adjust-lights-with-poster-boards" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2. Adjust lights with poster boards"></a>Tip 2. Adjust lights with poster boards</h2><p>The shot below looks dark and boring because the background has no light. Here’s the shot with and without the lights.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/dollar-store-film-making-hacks-4.png"
                      alt="shot with or without lights"
                ></p>
<p>A practical light is a light that shows up on screen rather than lighting talent from off-screen. For example, some dollar stores have small LED accent lights for around three dollars.</p>
<p>Others even have lights with adhesive backings that allow you to place them all over the room—creating great lighting accents with small eye-catching pockets of light.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/dollar-store-film-making-hacks-5.png"
                      alt="lights with adhesive backings"
                ></p>
<p>On film sets, crews use a bounce to reflect light from one light source in another direction. At the dollar store, we can find something like this poster board to get a similar effect.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/dollar-store-film-making-hacks-6.png"
                      alt="use bounce to reflect light"
                ></p>
<p>By reflecting the light onto the bounce, we get softer, more spread-out light when it’s reflected. Then you will get the result in a nicer look. Using poster boards, you can do multiple things with light.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use white to bounce light.</li>
<li>Use black as a flag to shape or block light.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="use white to bounce light"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>You can also use green for a small green screen when filming a product video</li>
</ul>
<p>You might have seen how big production companies create those alienated landscapes, such as in the movie Avatar and many more.</p>
<p>The concept is recording your object in front of a green screen behind it. Then, it’s much easier to add a separately filmed background to the final footage with a video editor like Filmora.</p>

                     lazyload

Smooth audio with felt pads or socks</h2><p>Do you ever have audio pop while you are recording? It can get annoying. So, to fix the issues, we are now teaching you three practical ways.</p>
<h3 id="1-Felt-pads"><a href="#1-Felt-pads" class="headerlink" title="1. Felt pads"></a>1. Felt pads</h3><p>Felt pads with adhesive backs can be stuck onto noisy props like a coffee mug. This way, we won’t hear the mug hitting the table when we’re recording sound.</p>

<h3 id="2-Socks-as-pop-filters"><a href="#2-Socks-as-pop-filters" class="headerlink" title="2. Socks as pop filters"></a>2. Socks as pop filters</h3><p>Professionals use what they call a pop filter because a pop filter can reduce the loud pops from their mouths. But what is pop? Pops usually occur when people say words that start with the letter P or B.</p>
<p>Then what is a pop filter? You might have seen in some YouTube videos, especially live streamers, where they use a microphone with a plate on its head; that’s called a pop filter. You can purchase pricey gear like a pop filter, or we can get a pack of cheap socks at the dollar store and place them over the mic.</p>
<p>It will make your voiceover slightly quieter, but it should also get rid of the popping. So keep adding socks until you hear no more pops in your voiceover.</p>
