                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> On the bottom left, there is a project window. From there, you need to click the “New Item” tab and choose “Adjustment Layer.” Now adjust the settings of the video from the available panel. This includes “Width,” “Height,” “Timebase,” and “Pixel Aspect Ratio.” Click “OK.” after you are done with settings.</p>

There are many benefits to using LUTs. Also, there are drawbacks of LUTs that cannot be neglected. Let’s discuss both benefits and disadvantages:</p>
<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>LUTs are fast and efficient in their color grading schemas. So they can enhance upscale color resolutions in a calculated way.</li>
<li>With maximum consistency, LUTs apply color grading across the frames in the video. Hence, this provides a consistent look to the video in unique colors.</li>
<li>Using LUTs, you can carry experiments on your video through filter presets. The presets are available in different colors and styles, and you can adjust them.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Drawbacks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There is a lack of personalization in most LUT filter presets. Hence, you cannot customize the color and styles for desired looks.</li>
<li>Due to limited precision, LUTs can involve color inaccuracies in their process. This happens because LUTs follow discrete values rather than using continuous gradients.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> On the bottom left, there is a project window.

There are many benefits to using LUTs. Also, there are drawbacks of LUTs that cannot be neglected. Let’s discuss both benefits and disadvantages:</p>
<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>LUTs are fast and efficient in their color grading schemas. So they can enhance upscale color resolutions in a calculated way.</li>
<li>With maximum consistency, LUTs apply color grading across the frames in the video. Hence, this provides a consistent look to the video in unique colors.</li>
<li>Using LUTs, you can carry experiments on your video through filter presets. The presets are available in different colors and styles, and you can adjust them.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Drawbacks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There is a lack of personalization in most LUT filter presets. Hence, you cannot customize the color and styles for desired looks.</li>
<li>Due to limited precision, LUTs can involve color inaccuracies in their process. This happens because LUTs follow discrete values rather than using continuous gradients.</li>
</ul>
