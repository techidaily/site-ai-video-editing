                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/click-on-color-range.jpg"
                      alt="click on color range"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: Pick the Eyedropper tool. Hold Shift key to select the green background. You can also hold Alt key to remove any selection that you might have done by mistake. When you are perfectly ok with the selection of the green screen background, you should click on OK button.</p>

                      alt="ok button"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: Go to Select menu and click on Inverse. Now, the selection will be on the main subject instead of the background.</p>

                      alt="click on inverse"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4: If you want to see a preview of the selection in your photo, you should select Image radio button and from Selection Preview, select any option other than None.</p>

                      alt="selection preview"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5: Go to Select menu again and click on Refine Edge. Use the sliders to fine-tune the selection so that the selection is smooth on the edges of the main subject of the photo. Once done, click on OK button.</p>

<p>Step 7: Press Delete key to delete the green screen background selection.</p>
<p>Step 8: Open the replacement image which you want to put in the place of the green screen background that you have just deleted.</p>

<h2 id="What-Is-Media-Player-Classic"><a href="#What-Is-Media-Player-Classic" class="headerlink" title="What Is Media Player Classic?"></a>What Is Media Player Classic?</h2><p>In a nutshell, Media Player Classic is an open-source media player suitable for 32-bit and 64-bit Microsoft Windows. If you have used the original interface, you might notice that it resembles Windows Media Player 6.4. The only key difference is that the former is more feature-rich and provides more options. In addition, Media Player Classic is very compact and lightweight.</p>
<p><img

<p>A programmer named “Gabest’’ created and designed this platform as a closed-source application. Things changed, and he later relicensed the media player as free under the terms of the GLP-2.0 license. He released the final version, MPC 6.4.9.0, on 20th March 2006.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, development stalled in 2006, much to the disappointment of many users who had grown to love it. Gabest made a public statement in 2007 saying that Media Player Classic was not dead, just that he couldn’t work on it anymore.</p>
<h2 id="How-To-Rotate-Video-in-Media-Player-Classic"><a href="#How-To-Rotate-Video-in-Media-Player-Classic" class="headerlink" title="How To Rotate Video in Media Player Classic?"></a>How To Rotate Video in Media Player Classic?</h2><p>Media Player Classic allows you to rotate your video around three axes, X, Y, and Z. Once you are done, you can fix a video that was initially upside down or in landscape mode for a better viewing experience. Another perk of using Media Player Classic to rotate a video is that you can use shortcuts to make your work easier.</p>
<p>Before we teach you how to rotate video in windows Media Player Classic, there are a few things you should know. Unfortunately, this platform doesn’t allow you to rotate a video in its graphical user interface. You can’t also use it to edit a video. Suppose you want to add text or overwrite the original video clip. Media Player Classic can only allow you to playback a video or rotate it.</p>
<p>Here is a simple guide on how to rotate videos in Media Player Classic.</p>
<p>Step1 Launch Media Player Classic and click on the “View” tab. Select “Options” or click “O” to display the “Options” window.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/media-player-classic-options.jpg"
                      alt="options in media player classic"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Navigate to the left pane to the Player Group and click on “Keys.” If the Player Group is not expanded by the time, you launch the platform, double-click it and wait a few seconds. You can then navigate to the “PnS Rotate” command on the Keys list.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/media-player-classic-keys.jpg"
                      alt="keys in media player classic"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 Go to the “PnS Rotate+” command and double-click the “Key” field. You can then click on any key to rotate your video around the x-axis. Once you are satisfied with the results, click “…” to apply the changes you have made.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="pns rotate in media player classic"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 You can now assign shortcuts to “PnS Rotate” commands. For instance, you could assign PnS Rotate Y for rotation along the Y axis and PnS Z for rotation along the Z axis. After each axis has a shortcut, select “Apply” then “OK” to save your changes and close the Options window respectively.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="apply rotate in media player classic"
                ></p>
<p>Step5 Select “Output” on the Options window and navigate to the DirectShow Video section to confirm whether the Media Classic Player supports rotation for the rendered video. Ascertain the Rotation feature has a green check mark, which indicates that the platform promotes rotation for the video. If the video has a red X, select “Apply” and click “OK.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="output rotation in media player classic"
                ></p>
<p>Step6 Use the shortcuts you assigned to the keys in Step 4 to rotate your video as you see fit. Since the rotation occurs gradually, you might need to press the keys numerous times or press and hold to see a visible change.</p>
<p>For instance, you can rotate your video from landscape to portrait by clicking “Alt-Num 1” and “Alt-Num 3,” respectively. To revert your video to its original state, press “Alt-Num 5.”</p>

<p>You might need a better alternative to Media Classic Player to help rotate your videos. As we mentioned, Media Classic Player doesn’t allow you to change the video. The scope of this platform only extends to playing and rotating videos along three axes. In our opinion, Wondershare Filmora is an excellent alternative.</p>

<p>As you have seen, Media player Classic doesn’t have the Rotate feature per se. However, you can assign shortcuts to the keys to rotate a video along three axes as you see fit. You can also use a combination of keys like Alt and Num to change how your video sits so you can enjoy it as you like.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Wondershare Filmora has a more comprehensive Rotate feature that allows you to drag your pointer along a bar till the video sits at the correct number of degrees.</p>
<p>This platform also provides additional features, like allowing you to scale the video to fit the screen and adjusting project settings like the resolution and frame rate. If you don’t want to use the sliding bar, you can use your pointer to manually adjust the rotation by clicking on the pivot with your pointer.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, Windows Media Player is the ideal choice if you want to rotate your video and leave it at that. However, if you are looking for more advanced features, you are better off choosing Wondershare Filmora. The latter option also makes your videos look more polished like they were edited by a professional.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-4"><a href="#Conclusion-4" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Videos might be trickier to edit than photos, especially when you want to rotate them. Fortunately, developers have been working tirelessly to ensure you have many tools at your disposal to edit your videos from any device at any time.</p>
<p>If you don’t fancy editing videos on your laptop, you could download the software to your smartphone and rotate videos on the move. Technology is truly a blessing that has come to make our work easier. Hopefully, after reading this article, you can effortlessly rotate any video you encounter.</p>

<p>You might need a better alternative to Media Classic Player to help rotate your videos. As we mentioned, Media Classic Player doesn’t allow you to change the video. The scope of this platform only extends to playing and rotating videos along three axes. In our opinion, Wondershare Filmora is an excellent alternative.</p>
