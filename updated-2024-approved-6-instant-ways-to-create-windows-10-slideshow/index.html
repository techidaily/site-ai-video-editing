Obviously, it’ll be a treat for you!</p>
<p>Planning and preparing before the shoot is the key to making a music video successful. You can only achieve this after location scouting and emerging with the best one. And scheduling for big projects before the day is more important. Let’s directly move towards the things to consider before shooting!</p>
<h2 id="Location-scouting"><a href="#Location-scouting" class="headerlink" title="Location scouting"></a>Location scouting</h2><p>The pleasant and eye-catchy location always makes your music video trending or flopping. You should first go with your budget and then come up with location ideas. In the upcoming tip, we will use 3lau’s song “Tokyo” as an example.</p>

<p>If you are going with large projects, you need to consider the following requirements!</p>
<h3 id="1-Availability-of-electricity"><a href="#1-Availability-of-electricity" class="headerlink" title="1. Availability of electricity"></a>1. Availability of electricity</h3><p>You need rig lights and a large lighting setup to make your video more glow and give them aesthetic vibes. For this, make sure you choose a location where light is readily available.</p>
<h3 id="2-Separate-room"><a href="#2-Separate-room" class="headerlink" title="2. Separate room"></a>2. Separate room</h3><p>During shooting for big projects, you need room to store all gear and sensitive equipment in one place for many days.</p>

<h3 id="3-Check-the-size"><a href="#3-Check-the-size" class="headerlink" title="3. Check the size"></a>3. Check the size</h3><p>The foremost thing in choosing the location is to check the Height and Width of the studio. They should be enough to rig the lights in the studio easily and place every required thing in a decided space.</p>
<p>For Example, while shooting a 3lau song, there is a need for a bus to come into the studio easily, but there is an issue in entering the bus due to height issues of the door. Due to this, the director changed the location at the spot to sort out this issue.</p>

<li><strong>What are Instagram Reels?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Instagram Reels are short-duration, vertically-oriented videos that are displayed in the dedicated reels tab on the Instagram app. You can compare Instagram Reels with TikTok videos. The maximum duration of Instagram Reels can be of 90 seconds.</p>
<p>Instagram displays the popular Reels on Explore tab so that the Instagram Reels creators get more exposure. Since short-duration videos and apps are in trend, Instagram Reels has become the most popular section on the Instagram app.</p>
<p>Reels can be entertaining videos with popular songs in the background. They can be funny videos as well as gripping slow-motion videos. Brands promote their products and services through Reels. You can add stunning AR effects and change the speed of the video while recording Reels through the Instagram app.</p>

<li><strong>Why Should You Make Instagram Reels?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Instagram Reels have been a game-changer in the social media world. From regular video creators and social media influencers to brands and businesses, Instagram Reels has become everyone’s real deal. Here are the reasons why you should make Instagram Reels:</p>
<p><strong>Reach</strong> - The primary reason for making Instagram Reels is to reach out to the target audiences and get more followers.

Besides, Instagram Reels have better reach to your followers than regular Instagram posts.</p>
<p><strong>Engagement</strong> - The world has moved on from photos to videos. People love to check out short videos rather than still images. So naturally, when you start making Instagram reels, your followers’ engagement will increase dramatically. With more engagement, your Reels will get more exposure as people will love to share them with their friends. Of course, the content has to be top-notch so that people start to pay attention to your Reels.</p>
