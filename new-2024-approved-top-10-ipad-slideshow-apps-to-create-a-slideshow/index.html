<p><strong>User’s Guide to Create Slideshow Presentations on an iPad</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Launch the Photos Application</strong></p>
<p>Start with navigating to your iPad’s app gallery and tap on the ‘Photos’ icon frame to launch the application in your device.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Creating Automatic Slideshows from Local Images</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Random Selection</strong></p>
<p>In the app’s opening screen, navigate to and hit the left sidebar to access the different commands and media locations of the app. From the list that appears, click on the ‘Library’ tab. Once within the application’s image library, you can browse through and select the desired images according to a particular day, month and year. All the images can also be selected altogether.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Using the Memory Album</strong></p>
<p>If you wish to make a slideshow of the still memories of your recent vacation, or a cherished family event, you need to head to the left sidebar and click on the ‘For You’ tab. A gallery of a set of images related to a specific date will open up, and you can select the photos that are required to be included in the slideshow by tapping on their respective thumbnails.</p>
<p>You can even watch a slideshow at this very stage within the aforesaid ‘Memories’ image gallery. You just need to hit the ‘Play’ button at the bottom right corner of a specific memory thumbnail.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Creating an iPad Slideshow on Photos App- Photos App Memory Album"
                ></p>
<p>Slideshow presentations can additionally be created from other albums like, People &amp; Places, in a similar manner. You can further watch slideshows within a variety of media types, like, selfies, panoramas, videos and portraits. All you need to do is, head to the left sidebar and click on ‘Media Types’ within the list of available image categories.</p>

                     lazyload

                      alt="Creating an iPad Slideshow on Photos App- Selecting Different Memory Albums"
                ></p>

<p>Have you ever had a video with good audio but poor visual quality?

There are many reasons why your video could look dark and unappealing. Brightening a video is a great way to remove your editing mistakes and add some artistic flair to your videos. Some editing software has this option built-in, but if you use Windows 10 to edit, it’s hard to find out how to brighten a video in Windows 10 without the help of additional software.</p>

<p>Have you ever had a video with good audio but poor visual quality? Maybe it was a recorded talk, and the presenter was sitting in front of a poorly lit screen, or it might as well be your own home video. There are many reasons why your video could look dark and unappealing. Brightening a video is a great way to remove your editing mistakes and add some artistic flair to your videos. Some editing software has this option built-in, but if you use Windows 10 to edit, it’s hard to find out how to brighten a video in Windows 10 without the help of additional software.</p>
<p>We sometimes know video quality can affect the way content is perceived. That can be particularly frustrating, especially with all the hi-res content online now. Are you in a situation where you need to brighten up a video that has been recorded in low light? If so, look no further. It’s now a breeze to adjust the brightness of your videos on Windows 10. This article will show you how to brighten a video windows 10.</p>

Windows 10 has an easy-to-use video editing app. This is handy for simple home video editing, but it doesn’t work well for professional movie making. Windows Movie Maker was how we edited video in the old days of Windows XP and Vista. Today, Movie Maker is still available on Windows 10, but the new video editor is built-in to the operating system.</p>
<p>You can use it to trim videos or create your own home movies and slideshows. You can even have it create videos automatically by taking photos as you go. Forget about buying expensive editing software. With Windows 10, you have a free video editor built into the operating system where you can trim videos, create home movies, and even create automatic montages. You’ll be surprised at what you can do without ever leaving the Windows 10 Photos app.</p>
<p>Some people say that windows video editor has a very simple interface and it only has very basic features. In this case, having something is more important than not having anything at all.

Some people have to do just basic tasks like trimming a video and increasing the brightness of a video. It is not feasible for them to purchase expensive video editing software for that purpose.

<h2 id="YouTube-Algorithm-Hacks"><a href="#YouTube-Algorithm-Hacks" class="headerlink" title="YouTube Algorithm Hacks"></a>YouTube Algorithm Hacks</h2><p>Every day, more than 1 billion hours of YouTube videos are seen by users worldwide, including cat videos and videos for cats. The YouTube algorithm determines the videos YouTube recommends to its more than 2 billion human users (and untold numbers of feline users).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/youtube-algorithm-changes.jpg"
                      alt="youtube algorithm changes"
                ></p>
<p>The subject of how to encourage YouTube’s algorithm to promote your videos and give you more likes is crucial for marketers, influencers, and creators alike.</p>
<p>We’ll discuss what the algorithm is (and isn’t), the most recent updates for 2022, and how experts use</p>
<p>YouTube’s search and discovery tools to push their videos in front of viewers in this blog post.</p>
<p>Let’s start!</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-YouTube’s-algorithm’s-history"><a href="#Part-1-YouTube’s-algorithm’s-history" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. YouTube’s algorithm’s history"></a>Part 1. YouTube’s algorithm’s history</h2><p>The YouTube algorithm: What is it? Let’s take a quick look at how YouTube’s algorithm has evolved through time and how it functions now in order to respond to your question.</p>
<p><strong>2005 to 2011: Click-and-view optimization</strong></p>
<p>In order to crowdsource footage of Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake’s infamous Superbowl performance, according to YouTube founder Jawed Karim (a.k.a. the star of Me at the Zoo), YouTube was established in 2005. Therefore, it should not be surprising that YouTube’s algorithm for many years displayed suggested videos that had the most views or clicks. Unfortunately, this resulted in an increase in deceptive titles and thumbnails, or clickbait. User experience suffered as a result of videos that made viewers feel duped, dissatisfied, or just plain irritated.</p>
<p><strong>2012: Watch time optimization</strong></p>
<p>YouTube made changes to its recommendation engine in 2012 to account for the amount of time spent watching each video as well as the total amount of time spent on the site. According to theory, when people find videos important and engaging, they watch them for a longer period of time, possibly all the way through. Due to this, some creators tried to make their movies shorter to enhance the likelihood that viewers would watch them through, while others made their videos longer to boost overall viewing time. YouTube maintained the official line—create content your audience wants to watch, and the algorithm will reward you—while refusing to support either of these strategies. However, as anyone who has used the internet for any length of time can attest, not all time spent online is created equal. YouTube has adopted a new strategy.</p>
<p><strong>2015–2016: maximizing fulfillment</strong></p>
<p>In addition to emphasizing direct reaction metrics like Shares, Likes, and Dislikes (and, of course, the extremely cruel “not interested” button), YouTube started monitoring viewer happiness directly using user surveys in 2005. YouTube published a whitepaper titled Deep Neural Networks for YouTube Recommendations in 2016 that detailed some of the inner workings of its AI.</p>
<p><strong>2016-present: demonetization, and brand safety</strong></p>
<p>The size and popularity of YouTube have led to an increase in content moderation difficulties over time, and what the algorithm suggests is now a major topic for news outlets and the government in addition to creators and advertisers.</p>
<p>YouTube has stated that it takes seriously its obligation to promote a variety of viewpoints while limiting the spread of damaging false material. For instance, algorithm modifications implemented in the beginning of 2019 have reduced consumption of questionable content by 70%. (According to YouTube, borderline content is that which is harmful or misleading but doesn’t quite go against community standards. On the other hand, offensive material is taken down right away.)</p>
<p>Creators are impacted by this problem because they worry about unintentionally breaking the constantly evolving community rules and getting punished with strikes, demonetization, or worse. (In fact, enhancing openness for community norms for artists is one of YouTube’s priorities for 2021, according to CEO Susan Wojcicki.) Brands and advertisers are also impacted since they don’t want their name and logo to be associated with white nationalists.</p>
<p>Politicians in America are growing more concerned about the societal impact of social media algorithms like YouTube’s. Democrats introduced the “Protecting Americans from Dangerous Algorithms Act” in early 2021, and YouTube (and other platforms) have been called to testify before Senate committees about their algorithms. Let’s now discuss what is known about this hazardous beast’s mechanism.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-will-YouTube’s-algorithm-function-in-2022"><a href="#Part-2-How-will-YouTube’s-algorithm-function-in-2022" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How will YouTube’s algorithm function in 2022?"></a>Part 2. How will YouTube’s algorithm function in 2022?</h2><p>The YouTube algorithm chooses videos for users with the intention of finding the most relevant content for them and keeping them interested. When we refer to “the algorithm,” we mean one of three selection or discovery techniques that are related but slightly different: three different algorithms: one that chooses videos for YouTube’s main page, one that ranks the results of any given search, and one that chooses what videos users should watch next are used.</p>
<p>According to YouTube, in 2022 the majority of channels’ top traffic sources would often be their homepage and suggested videos. With the exception of explainer or instructional films, which frequently receive the most traffic via search (e.g., “how to tune up a bicycle”)</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-is-the-algorithm-set-up-on-YouTube"><a href="#Part-3-How-is-the-algorithm-set-up-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How is the algorithm set up on YouTube?"></a>Part 3. How is the algorithm set up on YouTube?</h2><p>What ranking factors does YouTube consider when deciding which videos to display to users? Every traffic source varies a little. But in the end, a combination of factors including customization (the history and preferences of the viewer) performance (the success of the video) external variables (the overall audience or market)</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-How-YouTube-determines-its-homepage-algorithm"><a href="#Part-4-How-YouTube-determines-its-homepage-algorithm" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. How YouTube determines its homepage algorithm"></a>Part 4. How YouTube determines its homepage algorithm</h2><p>The YouTube algorithm presents a wide selection of videos that it thinks a user might like to view every time they open the YouTube app or type in youtube.com. Because the computer hasn’t yet determined what the viewer wants—acoustic versions of popular songs, for example—this selection is frequently broad. talks that are motivating against procrastination? to watch their preferred possum vlogger? Two categories of ranking signals are used to determine which videos appear on the homepage:</p>
<p><strong>Performance:</strong></p>
<p>YouTube gauges performance using indicators including the click-through rate, typical viewing time, typical percentage of views, likes, and disapproval ratings from viewers. After you upload a video, the algorithm initially displays it to a small number of users on their homepage. If it appeals to, engages, and satisfies those viewers (i.e., they click on it, watch it through, like it, share it, etc.), then it is then presented to an increasing number of users on their homepages.</p>
<p><strong>Personalization:</strong></p>
<p>However, the trending tab does not include YouTube. According to their past activity, also known as their watch history, or personalization, YouTube suggests videos to users based on what it believes are relevant to their interests. More of the same will be presented to a user if they frequently watch a particular channel or show they have an interest in. This element is also responsive to behavioral alterations throughout time as a person’s affinities and interests change.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-4"><a href="#Conclusion-4" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>It’s a fallacy that the algorithm would penalize you for publishing too regularly or insufficiently frequently, even if YouTube undoubtedly promotes the idea of uploading constantly in order to develop and maintain a relationship with your audience. The growth of the audience is unrelated to the interval between uploads. The zeitgeist can change quickly, but by keeping an eye on Google Trends and giving yourself opportunity to explore, you won’t fall behind.</p>
