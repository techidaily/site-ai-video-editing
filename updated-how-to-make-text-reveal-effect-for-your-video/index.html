<p>First, make sure the video clips you are using are clear, with the subject moving across the frame. It will help the text to stand out and be more easily seen. Now, follow the step-by-step guides below:</p>
<h5 id="Step-1-Add-video-tracks"><a href="#Step-1-Add-video-tracks" class="headerlink" title="Step 1 Add video tracks"></a>Step 1 Add video tracks</h5><p>You will need three video tracks in order to create this effect, so click the (+) icon above the timeline &gt; Add Video Track and add two more video tracks.</p>

<p>Since the subject in this tutorial is moving from side to side, we are going to match the mask’s y-axis setting, which is also the revealed text portion, with the subject’s movement. Starting from the first clip, adjust the y-axis number to a smaller&#x2F;bigger number.</p>
