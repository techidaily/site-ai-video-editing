Similarly, you may need to reduce the duration of the entire video. Speeding up the video is your only option when you do not want to cut any part. You must have also observed that certain videos look funny when you speed them up. To speed up videos, you will need a video editor that does not degrade the video quality.</p>
<p>Final Cut Pro is a popular choice to speed up video without distorting the pitch. Many think that the video quality can degrade when they change the speed of the video clip. This concern can be taken care of when you alter the video speed with Final Cut Pro. Instead of changing the speed of the entire video, you can change the speed of specific parts. We will illustrate how to speed up the video using Final Cut Pro and suggest a better choice than FCP.</p>

Speed Up Video using Final Cut Pro</h2><p>Final Cut Pro by Apple is one of Mac users’ most popular video editors. Many video creators purchase MacBooks for editing their videos in Final Cut Pro. The video editor is suitable for beginners as well as professionals. FCP, as a video editor, is super fast in rendering and processing video while exporting. Here are the steps for the Final Cut Pro speed-up clip.</p>
<p>Step1 Open FCP. Navigate to File&gt;New&gt; and tap Project to start a new project.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step2 Go to File&gt;Import&gt; Media and fetch your video clip. After that, drag&#x2F;drop the video clip into the timeline.</p>

                      alt="clip into the timeline"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 Choose the video clip from the timeline. Click on the Speedometer(Retime) icon at the top of the timeline.</p>

                      alt="video clip"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 Tap the Speedometer icon, to get the drop-drop menu. For the Final Cut Pro speed-up video, go to Fast and select the speed. You get to choose from 2X to 20X.</p>

                ></p>

Tips for Speeding Up Video in Final Cut Pro"></a>Part II. Tips for Speeding Up Video in Final Cut Pro</h2><p>You have to keep a few points in mind when you speed up videos in Final Cut Pro. This ensures that the video does not get distorted while speeding up a section. Here are some tips to follow to speed up the video in FCP.</p>
<p><strong>Adjust The Pitch of Sped-Up Clips -</strong></p>
<p>By default, Final Cut Pro preserves the pitch of the audio even when you change the speed of the video. However, you may want to change the pitch per the video’s speed. This is because you might want to make the audio sound funny. You need to turn off the Preserve Pitch option from Retime menu. Once you do that, the pitch of the sped-up clip adjusts itself as per the change in speed.</p>
<p><strong>Speeding Up Video by Adjusting Frame Rate -</strong></p>
<p>You can shoot at a low frame rate for the scene you want to speed up. The frame rate should be lower than the overall video project’s frame rate.</p>
<p>You can add the scene to your video project on the timeline. Then you need to choose Automatic Speed from Retime menu. This will increase the frame rate from the scene to the video project frame rate. Once the frame rate increases, the video will speed up automatically.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Smoothen Out the Sped-Up Video -</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes, the overall video may look old when you speed up a particular portion. That is why there are two options available on Final Cut Pro. The first option is frame blending which is more suitable for the slow-motion clip.</p>
<p>The second option is the optical flow that smoothens out the sped-up clip. It adds in-between frames by analyzing the directional movement of pixels. You can find the option from Video Quality present in the Retime menu.</p>

<p>Step3 Drag and drop the video file onto the timeline. Select the video clip from the timeline and click on the Speed (timer icon) option at the top of the timeline. If you want to speed up a portion of the video, you need to split the video clip.</p>
