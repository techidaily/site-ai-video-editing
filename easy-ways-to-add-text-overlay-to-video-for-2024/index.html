<p>~ Some FAQs about FLV Videos:</p>
<p><strong>why is .flv format used?</strong></p>
<p>FLV is basically used to publish or distribute videos on the Internet. Many social platforms and web pages (such as youtube, Hulu, e.t.c.) use .flv files as it provide high-quality synchronized audio and video in compact file size.

<p>To play .flv files a flash player is required. Which is pre-installed in almost most of the computers and browsers, if that’s not the case. Then you need a good video player which supports .flv format. Therefore VLC media prayer is a good choice. It is quite easy to use and has some useful features like Speed, Adding subtitles, Audio sync, e.t.c.</p>
<p><strong>Is .flv file easy to edit?</strong></p>
<p>FLV is just a format, It can be edited like any other format. Steps may differ from software to software. But don’t worry as I have mentioned the steps of some popular FLV video editors above.</p>
<p><strong>Can the .flv file be converted?</strong></p>
<p>If you don’t want to stick with the .flv format for long enough and want to switch over to a more convenient format then you can try these converters.</p>
<p><strong>VLC Media Player:</strong> Yes, apart from being a video player it can convert video formats. It’s quite easy to use.</p>

<p><strong>Flv vs Mp4 which is better?</strong></p>
<p>FLV format was quite popular back in 2010 as it provides high-quality compressed video for the internet. It takes less space which makes it easy to download and transfer quickly. Nowadays MP4 format is used more as it is versatile and is compatible with almost all devices like Mobile, PC, TV, e.t.c. FLV uses H.263 codec while MP4 uses  codec which provides better quality after compression. Still .flv file is a better choice for streaming platforms as one of the most common software used for streaming is OBS studio and it produces .flv files.</p>

<p>~ Some FAQs about FLV Videos:</p>
<p><strong>why is .flv format used?</strong></p>
<p>FLV is basically used to publish or distribute videos on the Internet. Many social platforms and web pages (such as youtube, Hulu, e.t.c.) use .flv files as it provide high-quality synchronized audio and video in compact file size. It was mostly used for embedded videos on these platforms. It is compatible with most browsers and devices even with older phones and computers.</p>
<p><strong>How to play .FLV files?</strong></p>
<p>To play .flv files a flash player is required. Which is pre-installed in almost most of the computers and browsers, if that’s not the case. Then you need a good video player which supports .flv format. Therefore VLC media prayer is a good choice. It is quite easy to use and has some useful features like Speed, Adding subtitles, Audio sync, e.t.c.</p>
<p><strong>Is .flv file easy to edit?</strong></p>
<p>FLV is just a format, It can be edited like any other format. Steps may differ from software to software. But don’t worry as I have mentioned the steps of some popular FLV video editors above.</p>
<p><strong>Can the .flv file be converted?</strong></p>
<p>If you don’t want to stick with the .flv format for long enough and want to switch over to a more convenient format then you can try these converters.</p>
<p><strong>VLC Media Player:</strong> Yes, apart from being a video player it can convert video formats. It’s quite easy to use.</p>
<p>Simply Open VLC Media Player &gt;&gt; Click Media tab &gt;&gt; Click “Convert&#x2F;Save” &gt;&gt; On pop up menu Select “Add” to add file (can add multiple files also) &gt;&gt; Click “Convert&#x2F;Save” &gt;&gt; Add Destination folder and File Format (to convert in) then click “Start”.</p>
<p><strong>Hand Brake:</strong> It is another popular video converter that can convert a .flv file into almost any file format.</p>
<p>Open HandBrake-“Drop a file” screen will appear &gt;&gt; Select the specific file you one to convert &gt;&gt; Select Destination filder &gt;&gt; Click “Start encoding”.</p>
<p><strong>Flv vs Mp4 which is better?</strong></p>
<p>FLV format was quite popular back in 2010 as it provides high-quality compressed video for the internet. It takes less space which makes it easy to download and transfer quickly. Nowadays MP4 format is used more as it is versatile and is compatible with almost all devices like Mobile, PC, TV, e.t.c. FLV uses H.263 codec while MP4 uses  codec which provides better quality after compression. Still .flv file is a better choice for streaming platforms as one of the most common software used for streaming is OBS studio and it produces .flv files.</p>
<p> <strong>It is available for both Windows and Mac.</strong></p>

<p>Now, without any more delay, let’s start learning how to combine videos in Filmora through the following steps.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Install Filmora on Your Computer</strong></p>
<p>Just visit <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora’s website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to download the latest version of the software for your Windows or MAC.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-2.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>
<p>After downloading the software on your computer, install it. Once the software is ready, double-click the “Wondershare Filmora” icon (it should be on your desktop screen) to open the program.</p>
<p>As you can see, the interface is simple with user-friendly options.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-3.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Import Multiple Videos in Filmora</strong></p>
<p>Click on the blue icon with a “+” sign to import videos.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-4.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>
<p>Or, click on the “File” button on the top menu to import files and drag and drop both clips to the same timeline.</p>
<p>As you can see, there are two clips on the timeline. The first clip is called “Cherry Blossom,” and the second clip’s name is “Plating Food.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-5.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Keep Video Clips on the Same Timeline</strong></p>
<p>There shouldn’t be any gap or spaces between the two clips.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>
<p>It is because gaps will create a dark blank space between the clips when you export the clips, like this:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-7.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>
<p>Therefore, slide the second video right next to the first video without leaving any gaps with your mouse.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-8.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>
<p>And guess what? You have already merged the two clips.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Save Video on Your PC</strong></p>
<p>Now, hit the “Export” button and save the merged video on your computer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-9.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>

<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-5.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Keep Video Clips on the Same Timeline</strong></p>
<p>There shouldn’t be any gap or spaces between the two clips.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-6.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>
<p>It is because gaps will create a dark blank space between the clips when you export the clips, like this:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-7.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>
<p>Therefore, slide the second video right next to the first video without leaving any gaps with your mouse.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-8.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>
<p>And guess what? You have already merged the two clips.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Save Video on Your PC</strong></p>
<p>Now, hit the “Export” button and save the merged video on your computer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-9.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>
<p>HandBrake is an outstanding tool for video conversion, but there’s no benefit of learning <strong>how to merge videos in HandBrake</strong>, as the software does not include such features. Nevertheless, when it is about combining multiple videos in high quality, you can rely on Filmora to merge clips in no time.</p>
