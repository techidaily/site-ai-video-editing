Sometimes, even though the video has informative content, the content might not be attractive to the viewers for various reasons, like the content might be routine and does not have more reach, likes, or shares. Along with good content, we also need new and creative ideas to get more viewers. Thus, we have some tools to provide unique and innovative ideas based on the niche you choose.</p>
<p>Videos Idea Generator is a tool that gives ideas for YouTube videos, and it works based on AI technology (Neural Networks). This tool will be more beneficial for the content creators to get more <strong>AI video ideas</strong>. Naturally, you might be out of ideas for your channel, or sometimes it takes more time to get an idea, or it could be a routine idea that does not sound interesting to the viewers. In such cases, <strong>an AI video idea generator</strong> is more helpful in suggesting new and innovative ideas for the content creators based on their interesting topics.</p>
<p>Some of the advantages of a video idea generator are:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Time-saving – as one can utilize the time in other work, such as editing the video&#x2F; adding subtitles, etc., instead of thinking of an idea.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Engaging with the audience – can utilize the time in engaging with the audience by answering their questions.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Promote videos – can utilize time to promote their videos on other social media platforms or collaborate with other content creators for promotions.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Add animations – animations and other visual effects can be added to the videos using AI. Also, we can add video and audio summaries after each video so that the viewers can get brief detailing of the whole video.</p>
<p><strong>How to use Videos Idea Generator:</strong></p>
<p>There are different <strong>AI video idea generator</strong> tools, and most of them work similarly. The most common steps are:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Provide Topic</strong></p>
<p>Here you need to provide the topic’s name on which we are planning to create the video.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Provide Keywords</strong></p>
<p>After providing a topic, give the keywords required for publishing. The video needs to have all the keywords so that the main content of the video can project adequately.</p>
<p>Based on the topic name and keywords, the tool will generate suggestions for the video ideas using the Neural Network concept of Artificial Learning.</p>

Once you get clarity on the area of interest, it’s easy to pick a topic from that and create an innovative video. Try to be more specific in the topic you choose. Also, have clarity on the section of audience you want to target.</p>
<p>For example, if your topic is more related to children, add more animations of animals&#x2F; cartoons that interest children. If you choose a related topic, do not add more animations that might confuse the audience. Add more reference links so that they can refer to those and be more particular on the specific topic you are trying to explain through the video. Similarly, if you choose a gaming-related topic, do not be more general about gaming.</p>
<p>Be specific towards a particular section of games like mobile gaming&#x2F; desktop&#x2F; virtual to reach more audience, and it does not seem boring to the audience.</p>

<h2 id="Part-3-Start-Filming"><a href="#Part-3-Start-Filming" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Start Filming"></a>Part 3: Start Filming</h2><p>Step1 Firstly, you must show the coin and the bottom of the glass.</p>

                      alt="show the coin and the bottom of the glass"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 After that, you need to hold the coin with the fingers part of one hand and tap down on the coin. Make sure it looks like the coin is going through straight to the glass.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="hold the coin with the fingers"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 You need someone else to drop the other coin from the top. Meanwhile, you are pretending to tap a coin on the glass. You don’t need to worry about someone else hand in the frame. Since you can remove it easily with the masking feature in Filmora.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step2 Drag and drop the clip onto the first track of the timeline.Afterward, move the playhead to the right and find the spot where you tapped the coin last time before your friend drops the other coin. Additionally, make sure it is in the middle of the tapping action and cut.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="drag and drop the clip onto the first track"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 Then move the playhead to the right and find the spot where your friend drops the coin while you tap without the coin in your hand. Make sure it is in the middle of the tapping action, and the position of your hand roughly matches that in the last cut and make a cut.</p>

                      alt="move the playhead to the right"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 Now you need to delete the middle part and play it back. Indeed, cutting on action is the key to creating the illusion that the action is continued without editing.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="delete the middle part"
                ></p>

                      alt="remove your friend&#39;s hand in the frame"
                ></p>

                ></p>
<p>Step7 Here you can see the mask is applied.First, adjust the angle and position of the mask to only show the top part of the frame. Then you have to change the Blur Strength to add more blur to the edge of the mask.</p>
