This Quick and Easy Tutorial Teaches How to Create a Risograph Effect in Photoshop"></a>Want to Give a Bold and Colorful Look to Your Ad or Abstract Art Project? This Quick and Easy Tutorial Teaches How to Create a Risograph Effect in Photoshop</h2><p>Risograph printing is a digital printing process that combines the best features of offset and screen printing used by many small print shops and design studios to provide trendy vibes and a classic look to the images.</p>
<p>If you’re a novice graphic designer or illustrator, you’ve probably seen Risograph prints and wondered how they are made. Well, this article will help you <strong>create a risograph effect in Photoshop</strong> quickly!</p>
<p>Without further delay, let’s get started with our step-by-step tutorial!</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-Risograph-Effect"><a href="#What-Is-Risograph-Effect" class="headerlink" title="What Is Risograph Effect?"></a>What Is Risograph Effect?</h2><p>Before we look into how to create a risograph effect in Photoshop <a href="#_How_To_Use">in the later part of this article</a>, let’s have a basic understanding of Risograph.</p>
<p>Risograph was created in <strong>1986</strong> by a Japanese company called <strong>Riso Kagaku Corporation.</strong> It’s a form of stencil printing, a technique that uses a stencil to create an image on a piece of paper.</p>
<p>The Risograph machine prints images by building them up one layer at a time, with each subsequent layer being a different color. Because of this, each print produced is imperfect, though some artists believe this only adds to the Risograph’s unique charm and distinct look.</p>
<p>The Risograph printing effect gives images a vibrant and bold look, making them perfect for ads, magazines, and abstract artworks. The printing method is also used for many products, including books, fabric, magazines, newspapers, plastic, metal, and even some forms of packaging.</p>

<p>Firstly, we will focus on how to use Photoshop in the following way to create the primary risograph effect.</p>
<h3 id="How-To-Create-the-Basic-Risograph-Effect-in-Photoshop"><a href="#How-To-Create-the-Basic-Risograph-Effect-in-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="How To Create the Basic Risograph Effect in Photoshop"></a>How To Create the Basic Risograph Effect in Photoshop</h3><p>Step1 Launch <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.adobe.com/"><strong>Adobe Photoshop</strong></a> on your laptop&#x2F;desktop (For this tutorial, we are using Photoshop CC 2021). Click <strong>“Create New,”</strong> select the document size, and click <strong>“Create.”</strong> Now set a paper-like textured layer on the canvas. Click <strong>“Ctrl + Shift + N,”</strong> and in the new layer window, set the mode to <strong>“Multiply.”</strong> Click <strong>“OK.”</strong> to confirm your action.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="select edit option"
                ></p>
<p>Click <strong>“Layer”</strong> from the toolbar and choose <strong>“New Fill Layer”&gt; “Pattern.”</strong> Next, select your new pattern layer and click <strong>“OK”</strong> to get a grid layer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="choose new fill layer"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 Let’s place an object&#x2F;subject onto our canvas. Set the issue to “<strong>Multiply</strong>,” right-click on it and choose “<strong>Convert to Smart Object</strong>.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="choose convert to smart object"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 To add a Gradient Map Layer, click <strong>“Layer,”</strong> scroll down and click <strong>“New Adjustment Layer.”</strong> Select <strong>“Gradient Map…”</strong> from the drop-down menu and click <strong>“OK”</strong> to confirm.</p>

                      alt="click layer"
                ></p>
<p>Use the <strong>“Properties”</strong> panel and select the <strong>“gradient”</strong> colors. Here we’ve chosen shades of <strong>“White”</strong> and <strong>“Red.”</strong> Click <strong>“OK”</strong> to apply.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="select the gradient color"
                ></p>
<p>Step5 For the image to have less contrast, click <strong>“Image”</strong> in the top toolbar and click <strong>“Adjustments.”</strong> Select <strong>“Levels…”</strong> from the menu. Now, set the black output to <strong>73.</strong></p>

                      alt="click image"
                ></p>
<p>Finally, click <strong>“Filter”</strong> and open the <strong>“Filter Gallery.”</strong> Select <strong>“Sketch” &gt; “Torn Edge,”</strong> set Image balance to <strong>30,</strong> smoothness, and contrast to <strong>15, 15</strong> respectively. Click <strong>“OK”</strong> to apply the changes.</p>

<h3 id="How-To-Create-A-Dual-Tone-Risograph-Effect"><a href="#How-To-Create-A-Dual-Tone-Risograph-Effect" class="headerlink" title="How To Create A Dual-Tone Risograph Effect"></a>How To Create A Dual-Tone Risograph Effect</h3><p>After creating an image with the risograph effect, how to make it more visually vertical? At this time, the dual-tone impact will help us have a more delicate picture.</p>
<p>The dual-tone effect is a technique in the risograph effect that combines two or more overlapping images to give a more vibrant look to the final project or emphasize the critical concept, information, or idea.</p>
<p>To create a dual-tone risograph effect in Photoshop, do the following steps.</p>
<p>Step1 To create a dual-tone risograph effect, add another subject to the canvas and set the blending mode to <strong>Multiply.</strong> Also, change its opacity to blend the two issues well. Make sure to turn the subject to <strong>Smart Object</strong> by right-clicking on the object’s layer and selecting <strong>“Convert to Smart Object.”</strong> Adjust the position of the subject on the previous one.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/converting-subject-to-smart-object-in-photoshop-to-create-risograph-effect.png"
                      alt="add another subject to the canvas"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Select the layer of the new subject and click <strong>“Layer”</strong> Click <strong>“New Adjustment Layer”</strong> and select <strong>“Gradient Map…”</strong> from the drop-down menu.</p>
<p>Open the Gradient Editor and set the gradient colors of the new subject. Click <strong>“OK”</strong> to confirm. Click <strong>“Image”</strong> and choose <strong>“Adjustments”</strong> from the drop-down menu. Select <strong>“Levels”</strong> and set the <strong>Black Output</strong> to <strong>73.</strong></p>
<p>Step3 Click <strong>“Filter”</strong> and open <strong>“Filter Gallery.”</strong> Navigate to <strong>“Swatches” &gt; “Torn Edge”</strong> and set the <strong>Image Balance, Smoothness, and Contrast</strong> to <strong>30, 15, and 15,</strong> respectively, if you want to smooth down the subject.</p>
<p>Finally, your dual-tone effect is created in Photoshop!</p>
<h3 id="How-To-Blend-Images-Using-Layer-Modes"><a href="#How-To-Blend-Images-Using-Layer-Modes" class="headerlink" title="How To Blend Images Using Layer Modes"></a>How To Blend Images Using Layer Modes</h3><p>In this part, let’s see how to use the layer modes to add another subject to the canvas and blend it with the previous ones.</p>
<p>Step1 Place the new subject on the canvas and set the layer mode to <strong>Multiply</strong> by pressing the <strong>“Ctrl + Shift + N”</strong> and selecting <strong>“Multiply”</strong> from the drop-down menu in the new pop-up window. Click <strong>“Ok”</strong> to apply your changes.</p>
<p>To adjust the size of the object, click <strong>“Edit”</strong> from the top toolbar, and select <strong>“Transform.”</strong> From the drop-down menu, select <strong>“Scale.”</strong> Use the handles to make the object smaller or larger.</p>
<p>Step2 Click the <strong>“Move”</strong> icon from the left menu and drag the object to set its position. Now, copy and clip the <strong>Gradient mode</strong> from the main subject to the new one.</p>
<p>Step3 Apply the <strong>Level</strong> and <strong>Filter Galler</strong> to the new object (Same settings as the main subject). That’s it. You’ve successfully blended images using the layer mode.</p>

<p>Listening has always been more enjoyable, easier, and faster than reading. We understand better when we are listening. So it is good news for us that our life has been made even easier with the development of <strong>TTS</strong> technology or <strong>Text-to-Speech technology</strong>.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, <strong>TTS</strong> or <strong>Text-to-Speech</strong> is a technology that can convert texts to speech or voices. In other words, it is a technology that reads aloud any type of digital text so one can just listen to it without having to manually read those texts himself&#x2F;herself. Text-to-Speech is also known as <strong>speech synthesis</strong>, which means artificial human speech production.</p>
<p>Though Text-to-Speech might sound like a new technology to most people, it has been here for a long time now. It’s just that only the big companies and some authorities had access to it in the past. But now, we can easily find this technology around us. Some of the popular examples would be audiobooks, read-aloud functions on websites, voice assistants like Alexa, Siri, etc.</p>
<p>While text-to-speech service is widely used for convenience and ease of life, its importance is not just limited to that. This technology has been extremely helpful for those with visible imparities and those who cannot read or write. Not only that, but it also has a great contribution to the field of education, business, and technology itself.</p>
<p>So now that we’re a little familiar with this Text to Speech system, it’s about time we have a look at some of the best Text to Speech software or say, Text to Speech converters. In this article, we’ll be covering the <strong>Top 20 Best Text to Speech Software</strong> with their price, features, and cons along with the platforms they are available for like Windows, Mac, Android, iPhone, and Online:</p>

<p>Listening has always been more enjoyable, easier, and faster than reading. We understand better when we are listening. So it is good news for us that our life has been made even easier with the development of <strong>TTS</strong> technology or <strong>Text-to-Speech technology</strong>.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, <strong>TTS</strong> or <strong>Text-to-Speech</strong> is a technology that can convert texts to speech or voices. In other words, it is a technology that reads aloud any type of digital text so one can just listen to it without having to manually read those texts himself&#x2F;herself. Text-to-Speech is also known as <strong>speech synthesis</strong>, which means artificial human speech production.</p>
<p>Though Text-to-Speech might sound like a new technology to most people, it has been here for a long time now. It’s just that only the big companies and some authorities had access to it in the past. But now, we can easily find this technology around us. Some of the popular examples would be audiobooks, read-aloud functions on websites, voice assistants like Alexa, Siri, etc.</p>
<p>While text-to-speech service is widely used for convenience and ease of life, its importance is not just limited to that. This technology has been extremely helpful for those with visible imparities and those who cannot read or write. Not only that, but it also has a great contribution to the field of education, business, and technology itself.</p>
<p>So now that we’re a little familiar with this Text to Speech system, it’s about time we have a look at some of the best Text to Speech software or say, Text to Speech converters. In this article, we’ll be covering the <strong>Top 20 Best Text to Speech Software</strong> with their price, features, and cons along with the platforms they are available for like Windows, Mac, Android, iPhone, and Online:</p>

<p>Listening has always been more enjoyable, easier, and faster than reading. We understand better when we are listening. So it is good news for us that our life has been made even easier with the development of <strong>TTS</strong> technology or <strong>Text-to-Speech technology</strong>.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, <strong>TTS</strong> or <strong>Text-to-Speech</strong> is a technology that can convert texts to speech or voices. In other words, it is a technology that reads aloud any type of digital text so one can just listen to it without having to manually read those texts himself&#x2F;herself. Text-to-Speech is also known as <strong>speech synthesis</strong>, which means artificial human speech production.</p>
<p>Though Text-to-Speech might sound like a new technology to most people, it has been here for a long time now. It’s just that only the big companies and some authorities had access to it in the past. But now, we can easily find this technology around us. Some of the popular examples would be audiobooks, read-aloud functions on websites, voice assistants like Alexa, Siri, etc.</p>
<p>While text-to-speech service is widely used for convenience and ease of life, its importance is not just limited to that. This technology has been extremely helpful for those with visible imparities and those who cannot read or write. Not only that, but it also has a great contribution to the field of education, business, and technology itself.</p>
<p>So now that we’re a little familiar with this Text to Speech system, it’s about time we have a look at some of the best Text to Speech software or say, Text to Speech converters. In this article, we’ll be covering the <strong>Top 20 Best Text to Speech Software</strong> with their price, features, and cons along with the platforms they are available for like Windows, Mac, Android, iPhone, and Online:</p>

<p>Listening has always been more enjoyable, easier, and faster than reading. We understand better when we are listening. So it is good news for us that our life has been made even easier with the development of <strong>TTS</strong> technology or <strong>Text-to-Speech technology</strong>.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, <strong>TTS</strong> or <strong>Text-to-Speech</strong> is a technology that can convert texts to speech or voices. In other words, it is a technology that reads aloud any type of digital text so one can just listen to it without having to manually read those texts himself&#x2F;herself. Text-to-Speech is also known as <strong>speech synthesis</strong>, which means artificial human speech production.</p>
<p>Though Text-to-Speech might sound like a new technology to most people, it has been here for a long time now. It’s just that only the big companies and some authorities had access to it in the past. But now, we can easily find this technology around us. Some of the popular examples would be audiobooks, read-aloud functions on websites, voice assistants like Alexa, Siri, etc.</p>
<p>While text-to-speech service is widely used for convenience and ease of life, its importance is not just limited to that. This technology has been extremely helpful for those with visible imparities and those who cannot read or write. Not only that, but it also has a great contribution to the field of education, business, and technology itself.</p>
<p>So now that we’re a little familiar with this Text to Speech system, it’s about time we have a look at some of the best Text to Speech software or say, Text to Speech converters. In this article, we’ll be covering the <strong>Top 20 Best Text to Speech Software</strong> with their price, features, and cons along with the platforms they are available for like Windows, Mac, Android, iPhone, and Online:</p>
