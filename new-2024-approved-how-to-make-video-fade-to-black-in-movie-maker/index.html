<p>Sounds easy, right? However, if you have multiple videos to open or have other video players installed in your Mac, you should consider following this second approach.

Although there are several QuickTime format files that you may come across and play across the platform, it only converts any video file into MOV format, which is the dedicated file format potentially designed by Apple. To understand the method to convert any QuickTime video format to MOV format, follow the steps shown below:</p>
<p>Step 1: You need to open the appropriate video across QuickTime to convert it accordingly. Once opened, tap on the “File” tab, and select “Export as” across the available options.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="access export as option"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: You need to select an appropriate resolution from the available options according to the video quality that you want the video to be saved in on the preceding menu. QuickTime player will show low-quality resolutions for the high-quality video but not vice versa.</p>

                      alt="choose video quality"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: A new window opens that requires you to set up the name and location for the video. Add the file extension “.mov” at the end of the name of the video to convert it into MOV format.</p>

Although there are several QuickTime format files that you may come across and play across the platform, it only converts any video file into MOV format, which is the dedicated file format potentially designed by Apple. To understand the method to convert any QuickTime video format to MOV format, follow the steps shown below:</p>
<p>Step 1: You need to open the appropriate video across QuickTime to convert it accordingly. Once opened, tap on the “File” tab, and select “Export as” across the available options.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="access export as option"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: You need to select an appropriate resolution from the available options according to the video quality that you want the video to be saved in on the preceding menu. QuickTime player will show low-quality resolutions for the high-quality video but not vice versa.</p>

                      alt="choose video quality"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: A new window opens that requires you to set up the name and location for the video. Add the file extension “.mov” at the end of the name of the video to convert it into MOV format.</p>
