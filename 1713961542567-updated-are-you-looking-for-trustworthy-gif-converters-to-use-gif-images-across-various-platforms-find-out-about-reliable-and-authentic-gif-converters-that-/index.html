They tweak the colors and tones in your footage to create a new visual experience. Following are the basic details of using and applying LUTs in basic video editing operations.</p>
<p><strong>Types of LUTs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Technical LUTs:</strong> These are for technical stuff like adjusting color spaces or correcting gamma. They ensure your colors and tones stay consistent across different devices and platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Creative LUTs:</strong> This type is a fun type of LUT. Creative LUTs help you achieve specific looks or styles. They can make your videos look like they were shot on film or create different moods and visual effects.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Apply LUTs with the Correct LUT Format</strong></p>
<p>You can apply LUTs using different video editing software. For instance, there is Adobe Premiere Pro, DaVinci Resolve, Final Cut Pro, and others to apply LUT. Just load the LUT and apply it to your video clips or the whole project. Moreover, you can make adjustments to the LUT according to your preference.</p>
<p>In addition, LUTs come in different file formats, such as .cube, .3dl, .look, or .icc. The most common one is .cube. Furthermore, different video editing tools support different formats. Moreover, choose the right format for your editing software and the colors you want.</p>
<p><strong>Customizing LUTs and Non-Destructive Editing</strong></p>
<p>You don’t have to stick with pre-made LUTs. Additionally, you can create your own or modify existing ones to match your needs and style. Advanced color grading software lets you tweak individual colors, contrast, saturation, and more. Save these adjustments as custom LUTs for future use.</p>
<p>The great thing about LUTs is that they don’t mess with your original video file. They’re like a layer that sits on top, making real-time changes during playback or rendering. Moreover, you can always return to the original footage or make further adjustments without losing data.</p>
