Add a call to action</h3><p>if you have successfully maintained the interest of your viewer until the very end of your video, use this opportunity to invite them to engage with your content more.

<p>Step1 Start by introducing yourself.</p>
<p>Step2 Get into details.</p>
<p>Step3 Add a call to action.</p>
<p>Step4 Add personalization to your video.</p>
<p>Step5 Video Length.</p>
<h3 id="1-Start-by-introducing-yourself-1"><a href="#1-Start-by-introducing-yourself-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Start by introducing yourself"></a>1. Start by introducing yourself</h3><p>You can always start your intro by introducing yourself but don’t just state your name and what</p>
<p>you do, tell them why you do it, what your core values are and what motivates and dives you to</p>
<p>do this kind of career. Because you all know doing vlog on YouTube is a job, work, and a career.</p>
<p>Share emotions with your audience, and help them relate to you. Doing so is going to help you stand out immediately from the crowd and get audiences interested enough to watch the remainder of your video’s content.</p>
<h3 id="2-Get-into-details-1"><a href="#2-Get-into-details-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Get into details"></a>2. Get into details</h3><p>Tip is always direct to the point, add a few facts about yourself, like your interest or previous experiences or who you are as a person. If you are a business owner and would want to talk about your business you can always share how it started.</p>
<p>If we are talking about the YouTube intro video. Every good YouTube intro video usually includes beneficial information for subscribers and viewers. Add any short important text that you feel is necessary from the video titles, your YouTube channel name, and social media handles. Keep your informative text in a consistent format and branding style.</p>
<h3 id="3-Add-a-call-to-action-1"><a href="#3-Add-a-call-to-action-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Add a call to action"></a>3. Add a call to action</h3><p>if you have successfully maintained the interest of your viewer until the very end of your video, use this opportunity to invite them to engage with your content more. It’s worth including a call to action in each video. Take a full advantage of YouTube to provide your audience with your social media channels and maybe a link or two to your other videos that might interest them,</p>
<h3 id="4-Add-personalization-to-your-video-1"><a href="#4-Add-personalization-to-your-video-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Add personalization to your video"></a>4. Add personalization to your video</h3><p>Even though an intro can be more than logo animation, the latter should still be a part of it. Otherwise, there’s a sense that something is messing. Include eye catchy visuals effects to your videos to stands out, so that people can easily remember your YouTube channel.</p>

Video length</h3><p>A long intro, even if it’s spectacular, can get boring once your audience has seen it a few times. An ideal length for intros is up to 8-10 seconds only. Just enough time to deliver your message and branding, and hook audiences in for the rest of the video. Any longer than that, and you might lose viewers who are waiting to see the video that they clicked on.</p>
<p>In the era of social media, tempting distractions and short attention spans, it’s critical to keep your content as short and sharp as you can.</p>

It has many of the features of Adobe Premiere, but it is free.</p>
<p>It supports the following formats: AVI, MP4, WMV, MKV, MOV, FLV and 3GP.</p>
<p>Wondershare Filmora is different than most video editors in that it does not use timelines. Instead, the user edits clips in a storyboard and adds effects and titles to them. It also has an Audio Visualization feature that plays back music in your collection and shows what you’re listening to in real time. There is no voice-over tool and it is not possible to add an audio track.</p>
<p>Wondershare Filmora has a very large number of effects, all editable via keyframes. These include simple motion graphics such as fades and dissolves, but it also includes advanced options like motion blur and chroma-key. There are free downloadable effects, which are created by users.</p>
<p>Wondershare Filmora supports text editing and there is a large library of free fonts available for download on its website. It does not support green-screening&#x2F;chroma-keying. This can be done in post production via Adobe Premiere or other software.</p>
<p>It also has the ability to add a number of different titles, which can be stacked and moved around in 3D space.</p>
<p>Wondershare Filmora allows you to import photos for use in slideshows and effects. Every clip or image can have its own effect applied to it if desired.</p>

<p>This software has a very simple interface that is easy to navigate, even for beginners. The design of the program makes it intuitive enough that you can start editing videos right away without having to go through tutorials. It is easy to create the desired effects and titles that you need for your video with just a few clicks. Its editing tools are powerful enough for professional use while still being easy to learn.</p>
