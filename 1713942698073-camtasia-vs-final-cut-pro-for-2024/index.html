</ul>
<p>Editing video with Final Cut Pro is not a complicated process. Here are the steps to help a beginner get started.</p>
<p><strong>Step1: Create a new project &amp; import media</strong></p>
<p>When you Launch the Final Cut Pro interface, Libraries and Events are automatically created. You only need to create a new project.</p>
<p>At the top menu bar, click <em>File &gt; New &gt; Project</em> to create a new project. Here you will have to type in a new name of the project and then select ‘<em>Use Automatic Settings’</em>.</p>
<p>At the top menu bar again, click <em>File &gt; Import &gt; Media</em> to enable the program to bring up the Media Import window where you can select the video and audio files you want to import into your new project.</p>
<p>After selecting all the media you want to include in your project press <em>‘Import Selected’</em> and then close the media window.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add your trimmed clips to the timeline.</strong></p>
<p>The thumbnails of all the media you have imported will be appearing in the browser. For you to create a new video you need to arrange and trim that media in the timeline.</p>
<p>In your browser, you can set the <em>‘In</em> and <em>Out’</em> points for each video clip by holding ‘_Option_’. To do this you will have to click the thumbnail and drag it. The yellow timeline that appears on the clip represents the range that will be added to your video timeline.</p>
<p>After arranging them in the order that you want them to play, trim your clips by moving the mouse cursor to the edge of its thumbnail. This is done by using the <em>‘Trim tool’.</em> Drag forward or backward to adjust the clip’s endings.</p>
<p>If you are arranging the clips in your sequence, you need to drag and drop any of the clips from the timeline into a different position. Final Cut Pro has a tool known as Magnetic timeline that will automatically insert and arrange the clips for you. You just need to ensure that your clips do not overlap or lay on top of each other.</p>
<p>To preview your video in the viewer, press the space bar on your keyboard or the Play icon in your software interface.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add Title, Texts, Transitions, and Effects</strong></p>
<p><strong>Title and Texts</strong>: Final Cut Pro has many Titles located in the browser where you imported your media. You can add them by dragging them into your video’s timeline. To access those titles you can press the <em>‘Title and Generators’</em> icon in the sidebar to open it.</p>
<p><strong>Transitions</strong>: When adding Transitions, there is nothing wrong with a “<em>hard cut_” between 2 clips. Use the transitions only where they make sense so as not to ruin your video. To add these transitions, you need to open the ‘_Transition browser’</em> by clicking on its indicated icon.</p>
<p>The transition’s length can be adjusted by dragging inwards or outwards. To customize your transition you can open the inspector by pressing ‘<em>Command + 4’</em> and make the adjustments.</p>
<p><strong>Effects</strong>: With Final Cut Pro inbuilt Effects, you can add some more value to your video after you are done with basic arrangements in the timeline. To add the effects click on the ‘<em>Effects browser’</em> icon to open it.</p>
<p>Next to the effects browser icon, choose your preferred effect and add it between any 2 clips. By doing this you will have added animation effect between them.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Add Audio, Music, and Color.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Audio &amp; Music:</strong> At this point, you can import and add your music. Photos and Audio sidebar icon is located above the browser and you can click to open, and then select Sound Effects.</p>
<p>To see all the songs available in Final Cut Pro, you can type the word <em>‘Jingle</em>‘ and you can preview them by pressing the small play button.</p>
<p><strong>Color correction</strong>: By highlighting all the video clips in your video timeline, you can see a yellow outline around them.</p>
<p>Then open the drop-down menu by clicking the ‘_Enhancement_’ icon situated below the Viewer.</p>
<p>To improve the color and contrast, select Balance Color or <em>‘Option + Cmd + B’</em>.</p>
<p>Now that you are done editing your video, you can save and share as you prefer.</p>

<p>Editing video with Final Cut Pro is not a complicated process. Here are the steps to help a beginner get started.</p>
<p><strong>Step1: Create a new project &amp; import media</strong></p>
<p>When you Launch the Final Cut Pro interface, Libraries and Events are automatically created. You only need to create a new project.</p>
<p>At the top menu bar, click <em>File &gt; New &gt; Project</em> to create a new project. Here you will have to type in a new name of the project and then select ‘<em>Use Automatic Settings’</em>.</p>
<p>At the top menu bar again, click <em>File &gt; Import &gt; Media</em> to enable the program to bring up the Media Import window where you can select the video and audio files you want to import into your new project.</p>
<p>After selecting all the media you want to include in your project press <em>‘Import Selected’</em> and then close the media window.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add your trimmed clips to the timeline.</strong></p>
<p>The thumbnails of all the media you have imported will be appearing in the browser. For you to create a new video you need to arrange and trim that media in the timeline.</p>
<p>In your browser, you can set the <em>‘In</em> and <em>Out’</em> points for each video clip by holding ‘_Option_’. To do this you will have to click the thumbnail and drag it. The yellow timeline that appears on the clip represents the range that will be added to your video timeline.</p>
<p>After arranging them in the order that you want them to play, trim your clips by moving the mouse cursor to the edge of its thumbnail. This is done by using the <em>‘Trim tool’.</em> Drag forward or backward to adjust the clip’s endings.</p>
<p>If you are arranging the clips in your sequence, you need to drag and drop any of the clips from the timeline into a different position. Final Cut Pro has a tool known as Magnetic timeline that will automatically insert and arrange the clips for you. You just need to ensure that your clips do not overlap or lay on top of each other.</p>
<p>To preview your video in the viewer, press the space bar on your keyboard or the Play icon in your software interface.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add Title, Texts, Transitions, and Effects</strong></p>
<p><strong>Title and Texts</strong>: Final Cut Pro has many Titles located in the browser where you imported your media. You can add them by dragging them into your video’s timeline. To access those titles you can press the <em>‘Title and Generators’</em> icon in the sidebar to open it.</p>
<p><strong>Transitions</strong>: When adding Transitions, there is nothing wrong with a “<em>hard cut_” between 2 clips. Use the transitions only where they make sense so as not to ruin your video. To add these transitions, you need to open the ‘_Transition browser’</em> by clicking on its indicated icon.</p>
<p>The transition’s length can be adjusted by dragging inwards or outwards. To customize your transition you can open the inspector by pressing ‘<em>Command + 4’</em> and make the adjustments.</p>
<p><strong>Effects</strong>: With Final Cut Pro inbuilt Effects, you can add some more value to your video after you are done with basic arrangements in the timeline. To add the effects click on the ‘<em>Effects browser’</em> icon to open it.</p>
<p>Next to the effects browser icon, choose your preferred effect and add it between any 2 clips. By doing this you will have added animation effect between them.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Add Audio, Music, and Color.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Audio &amp; Music:</strong> At this point, you can import and add your music. Photos and Audio sidebar icon is located above the browser and you can click to open, and then select Sound Effects.</p>
<p>To see all the songs available in Final Cut Pro, you can type the word <em>‘Jingle</em>‘ and you can preview them by pressing the small play button.</p>
<p><strong>Color correction</strong>: By highlighting all the video clips in your video timeline, you can see a yellow outline around them.</p>
<p>Then open the drop-down menu by clicking the ‘_Enhancement_’ icon situated below the Viewer.</p>
<p>To improve the color and contrast, select Balance Color or <em>‘Option + Cmd + B’</em>.</p>
<p>Now that you are done editing your video, you can save and share as you prefer.</p>

<p>Editing video with Final Cut Pro is not a complicated process. Here are the steps to help a beginner get started.</p>
<p><strong>Step1: Create a new project &amp; import media</strong></p>
<p>When you Launch the Final Cut Pro interface, Libraries and Events are automatically created. You only need to create a new project.</p>
<p>At the top menu bar, click <em>File &gt; New &gt; Project</em> to create a new project. Here you will have to type in a new name of the project and then select ‘<em>Use Automatic Settings’</em>.</p>
<p>At the top menu bar again, click <em>File &gt; Import &gt; Media</em> to enable the program to bring up the Media Import window where you can select the video and audio files you want to import into your new project.</p>
<p>After selecting all the media you want to include in your project press <em>‘Import Selected’</em> and then close the media window.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add your trimmed clips to the timeline.</strong></p>
<p>The thumbnails of all the media you have imported will be appearing in the browser. For you to create a new video you need to arrange and trim that media in the timeline.</p>
<p>In your browser, you can set the <em>‘In</em> and <em>Out’</em> points for each video clip by holding ‘_Option_’. To do this you will have to click the thumbnail and drag it. The yellow timeline that appears on the clip represents the range that will be added to your video timeline.</p>
<p>After arranging them in the order that you want them to play, trim your clips by moving the mouse cursor to the edge of its thumbnail. This is done by using the <em>‘Trim tool’.</em> Drag forward or backward to adjust the clip’s endings.</p>
<p>If you are arranging the clips in your sequence, you need to drag and drop any of the clips from the timeline into a different position. Final Cut Pro has a tool known as Magnetic timeline that will automatically insert and arrange the clips for you. You just need to ensure that your clips do not overlap or lay on top of each other.</p>
<p>To preview your video in the viewer, press the space bar on your keyboard or the Play icon in your software interface.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add Title, Texts, Transitions, and Effects</strong></p>
<p><strong>Title and Texts</strong>: Final Cut Pro has many Titles located in the browser where you imported your media. You can add them by dragging them into your video’s timeline. To access those titles you can press the <em>‘Title and Generators’</em> icon in the sidebar to open it.</p>
<p><strong>Transitions</strong>: When adding Transitions, there is nothing wrong with a “<em>hard cut_” between 2 clips. Use the transitions only where they make sense so as not to ruin your video. To add these transitions, you need to open the ‘_Transition browser’</em> by clicking on its indicated icon.</p>
<p>The transition’s length can be adjusted by dragging inwards or outwards. To customize your transition you can open the inspector by pressing ‘<em>Command + 4’</em> and make the adjustments.</p>
<p><strong>Effects</strong>: With Final Cut Pro inbuilt Effects, you can add some more value to your video after you are done with basic arrangements in the timeline. To add the effects click on the ‘<em>Effects browser’</em> icon to open it.</p>
<p>Next to the effects browser icon, choose your preferred effect and add it between any 2 clips. By doing this you will have added animation effect between them.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Add Audio, Music, and Color.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Audio &amp; Music:</strong> At this point, you can import and add your music. Photos and Audio sidebar icon is located above the browser and you can click to open, and then select Sound Effects.</p>
<p>To see all the songs available in Final Cut Pro, you can type the word <em>‘Jingle</em>‘ and you can preview them by pressing the small play button.</p>
<p><strong>Color correction</strong>: By highlighting all the video clips in your video timeline, you can see a yellow outline around them.</p>
<p>Then open the drop-down menu by clicking the ‘_Enhancement_’ icon situated below the Viewer.</p>
<p>To improve the color and contrast, select Balance Color or <em>‘Option + Cmd + B’</em>.</p>
<p>Now that you are done editing your video, you can save and share as you prefer.</p>

</ul>
<p>Here are key steps to follow when editing a video with Camtasia.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Break up steps of a process with lower thirds.</p>
<p>Break any long multi-step video to help lower the viewer’s cognitive load.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Reinforce texts with video.</p>
<p>Remove any mistakes and extra content such as unnecessary footage from the ends of your recording. If you trim too much drag the clip back to restore. This process is known as trimming.</p>
<p>You can zoom in on the most important section to focus your viewer’s attention there.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Add narrative to video</p>

<p>By pressing the alt&#x2F;option again on the stopwatch, you can edit your expression anytime-or by clicking the arrow beside “position” and then double-clicking the text in the timeline.</p>

Its amplitude is the second number, which indicates how far it moves. The numbers are adjustable as you wish. Layers will shake dramatically but slowly when they use Wiggle (2,40). The “Wiggle (10,3)” command makes a layer move quickly without too much movement in one direction.</p>

Adjust the frame rate of your Composition</h3><p>In order to make the overall effect more “choppy,” you can reduce the frame rate of the video by going to Composition&gt; Composition settings. After Effects uses a frame rate of 24.5, you can go as low as “8” if you want a choppy feel.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Your entire Composition will become choppier if you reduce the frame rate, so it might not be worth it if you have other moving elements in your Composition. Only adjust the frame rate of the layer containing the wiggling object if you want it to affect that layer.</p>

You know, those cool shake effects that you may have seen on an amateur or professional video on the web? Well, if you have, then you probably thought it was impossible. The camera shake effect is a technique applied to the clips where shaky camera movements cause the image to appear more cinematic and real. Applying a camera shake effect is to hide your flaws when shooting a video.</p>
<p>Camera shake is often mistaken for poor cinematography. It can enhance your video. For instance, if you’re filming something like a car chase or any other scene where there’s lots of movement and action, the inclusion of a camera shake can help make it more realistic.</p>
<p>A camera shake effect can be an excellent way of adding a sense of realism to your videos. Whether you’re making a video that’s meant to be taken as a real scene, such as one depicting a robbery, or one that’s supposed to be shot in a documentary style, such as making a movie, you can use this as an effective tool. You can consider adding camera shakes to your videos due to the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>This camera shake effect makes your video more creative. If you want to make, your video different from those other businesses produce, adding this effect will be a good idea.</li>
<li>Your audience will be able to relate better to your video if they’ve seen similar videos before.</li>
<li>Adding a camera shake to your video will make it more interesting and engaging for your viewers.</li>
<li>It’s a great way to mask any mistakes you might have made during the video production. After all, we aren’t perfect humans, so we can’t make perfect videos every time!”</li>
<li>You can use camera shakes to simulate the feeling of being in an environment that is free from control (such as being on a boat).</li>
<li>You can use them to create a sense of urgency for the viewer&#x2F;audience by adding motion blur to the sequence.</li>

Using it correctly can add subtle motion to a static frame, emphasize an important object, and even make a character quiver in fear! In this tutorial, you will learn how to effectively use the wiggle expression to affect a layer throughout the Composition.</p>
<h3 id="Step-1-Select-the-layer-you-want-to-shake-from-your-After-Effects-file-1"><a href="#Step-1-Select-the-layer-you-want-to-shake-from-your-After-Effects-file-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1.

Just follow the steps described below.</p>

Press the alt&#x2F;option key, then click the stopwatch next to “position.”</h3><p>You are adding an “expression” to the timeline when the position text turns red, and you begin typing. Using a coding language adapted from javascript, you can apply complex motion to layers.</p>
<p>By pressing the alt&#x2F;option again on the stopwatch, you can edit your expression anytime-or by clicking the arrow beside “position” and then double-clicking the text in the timeline.</p>

Its amplitude is the second number, which indicates how far it moves. The numbers are adjustable as you wish. Layers will shake dramatically but slowly when they use Wiggle (2,40). The “Wiggle (10,3)” command makes a layer move quickly without too much movement in one direction.</p>
<h3 id="Step-4-Adjust-the-frame-rate-of-your-Composition-1"><a href="#Step-4-Adjust-the-frame-rate-of-your-Composition-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 4. Adjust the frame rate of your Composition"></a>Step 4. Adjust the frame rate of your Composition</h3><p>In order to make the overall effect more “choppy,” you can reduce the frame rate of the video by going to Composition&gt; Composition settings. After Effects uses a frame rate of 24.5, you can go as low as “8” if you want a choppy feel.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>Your entire Composition will become choppier if you reduce the frame rate, so it might not be worth it if you have other moving elements in your Composition. Only adjust the frame rate of the layer containing the wiggling object if you want it to affect that layer.</p>

Using it correctly can add subtle motion to a static frame, emphasize an important object, and even make a character quiver in fear! In this tutorial, you will learn how to effectively use the wiggle expression to affect a layer throughout the Composition.</p>
<h3 id="Step-1-Select-the-layer-you-want-to-shake-from-your-After-Effects-file-3"><a href="#Step-1-Select-the-layer-you-want-to-shake-from-your-After-Effects-file-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 1. Select the layer you want to shake from your After Effects file"></a>Step 1. Select the layer you want to shake from your After Effects file</h3><p>Suppose you have an image or video of an object and want to apply it to shake effect, then it is quite easy. Just follow the steps described below.</p>

Press the alt&#x2F;option key, then click the stopwatch next to “position.”"></a>Step 2. Press the alt&#x2F;option key, then click the stopwatch next to “position.”</h3><p>You are adding an “expression” to the timeline when the position text turns red, and you begin typing. Using a coding language adapted from javascript, you can apply complex motion to layers.</p>
<p>By pressing the alt&#x2F;option again on the stopwatch, you can edit your expression anytime-or by clicking the arrow beside “position” and then double-clicking the text in the timeline.</p>

Enter “Wiggle (3,8)” and adjust the settings accordingly"></a>Step 3. Enter “Wiggle (3,8)” and adjust the settings accordingly</h3><p>In this expression, the first number indicates the frequency of Wiggle – basically, how quickly it appears to tremble. Its amplitude is the second number, which indicates how far it moves. The numbers are adjustable as you wish. Layers will shake dramatically but slowly when they use Wiggle (2,40). The “Wiggle (10,3)” command makes a layer move quickly without too much movement in one direction.</p>

Adjust the frame rate of your Composition"></a>Step 4. Adjust the frame rate of your Composition</h3><p>In order to make the overall effect more “choppy,” you can reduce the frame rate of the video by going to Composition&gt; Composition settings. After Effects uses a frame rate of 24.5, you can go as low as “8” if you want a choppy feel.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>Your entire Composition will become choppier if you reduce the frame rate, so it might not be worth it if you have other moving elements in your Composition. Only adjust the frame rate of the layer containing the wiggling object if you want it to affect that layer.</p>

This is where the <strong>Google stabilizer video</strong> editing feature comes into play. You can stabilize a video with the Google Photos app that has a built-in video stabilizer and other editing tools to give a finishing touch to your media files before they are shared online or with family, friends, and&#x2F;or colleagues.</p>
<p>In this article, we will show you how to use Google Photos as a <strong>stabilizer video Google</strong> offers to its consumer. In addition, you will also learn about one of the most trusted and efficient third-party tools to stabilize the clips if <strong>Google video stabilizer</strong> fails to produce quality output.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Google-Photos-and-How-Does-It-Work"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Google-Photos-and-How-Does-It-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Google Photos and How Does It Work?"></a>Part 1: What is Google Photos and How Does It Work?</h2><p>Google Photos is an app that can be obtained from Play Store or App Store to be installed on an Android-based smartphone or iPhone or iPad respectively.</p>
<p>The program can store photos and videos from your phone, and ensures that those media files are well-backed up so they can be recovered easily if&#x2F;when lost due to some mishaps. Furthermore, the tool even lets you edit, customize, and share your photos and videos with ease.</p>
<p><strong>1. History and Current Policies</strong></p>
<p>Earlier, Google Photos used to offer unlimited storage to the users where they can save as many photos as they want, as long as the images were saved in ‘high-quality’ resolution. However, from June 01, 2021, Google changed its policies of using the app, and now the tool offers limited storage. If more space is needed, the users must subscribe to a paid plan.</p>
<p><strong>2. Accessibility</strong></p>
<p>Google Photos can be accessed from a web browser, Google Drive desktop program, and smartphone app. While you can make only minor changes to the videos such as editing date, time, and location when accessing Google Photos via a web browser, the smartphone app allows you to edit the clips comparatively more sophisticatedly.</p>
<p><strong>3. Deletion</strong></p>
<p>The files that are stored in Google Photos remain there for an indefinite duration, of course until the entire space is completely consumed. When you delete something, it is moved to the Trash and stays there for another 60 days, after which it is automatically deleted from the Cloud forever.</p>

Using the built-in <strong>Google stabilizer video</strong> editor of the Photos app on both platforms is almost identical and extremely easy.</p>
<p>You can learn how to work with <strong>Google video stabilizer</strong> to stabilize a video by following the steps that are given below:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Locate and Open the Source Video in Google Photos</strong></p>
<p>Download and install Google Photos on your smartphone (Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ is used here for illustrations). Launch the app, tap <strong>Library</strong> from the bottom-right corner of the interface, and tap to open the source video that you want to stabilize with <strong>Google video stabilizer</strong>.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Stabilize the Video</strong></p>
<p>After the video opens in the app and the playback begins, tap <strong>Edit</strong> from the bottom. On the next screen, ensure that the <strong>Video</strong> section is selected. Tap the <strong>Stabilize</strong> icon from the lower-left area of the window, and wait while <strong>Google Photos stabilize video</strong>.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>5. Filters</strong></p>
<p>You can even add a filter using the presets available in the ‘Filters’ section.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="filters google photos"
                ></p>
<p><strong>6. Annotations</strong></p>
<p>The ‘Markup’ section enables you to annotate the video. You can either use the ‘Pen’ tool or ‘Highlighter’ to write text on the video or give the screen a different shade respectively.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p>Google Photos can be accessed from a web browser, Google Drive desktop program, and smartphone app. While you can make only minor changes to the videos such as editing date, time, and location when accessing Google Photos via a web browser, the smartphone app allows you to edit the clips comparatively more sophisticatedly.</p>
<p><strong>3. Deletion</strong></p>
<p>The files that are stored in Google Photos remain there for an indefinite duration, of course until the entire space is completely consumed. When you delete something, it is moved to the Trash and stays there for another 60 days, after which it is automatically deleted from the Cloud forever.</p>

Using the built-in <strong>Google stabilizer video</strong> editor of the Photos app on both platforms is almost identical and extremely easy.</p>
<p>You can learn how to work with <strong>Google video stabilizer</strong> to stabilize a video by following the steps that are given below:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Locate and Open the Source Video in Google Photos</strong></p>
<p>Download and install Google Photos on your smartphone (Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ is used here for illustrations). Launch the app, tap <strong>Library</strong> from the bottom-right corner of the interface, and tap to open the source video that you want to stabilize with <strong>Google video stabilizer</strong>.</p>

<p>The ‘Markup’ section enables you to annotate the video. You can either use the ‘Pen’ tool or ‘Highlighter’ to write text on the video or give the screen a different shade respectively.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Google-Photos-and-How-Does-It-Work-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Google-Photos-and-How-Does-It-Work-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Google Photos and How Does It Work?"></a>Part 1: What is Google Photos and How Does It Work?</h2><p>Google Photos is an app that can be obtained from Play Store or App Store to be installed on an Android-based smartphone or iPhone or iPad respectively.</p>
<p>The program can store photos and videos from your phone, and ensures that those media files are well-backed up so they can be recovered easily if&#x2F;when lost due to some mishaps. Furthermore, the tool even lets you edit, customize, and share your photos and videos with ease.</p>
<p><strong>1. History and Current Policies</strong></p>
<p>Earlier, Google Photos used to offer unlimited storage to the users where they can save as many photos as they want, as long as the images were saved in ‘high-quality’ resolution. However, from June 01, 2021, Google changed its policies of using the app, and now the tool offers limited storage. If more space is needed, the users must subscribe to a paid plan.</p>
<p><strong>2. Accessibility</strong></p>
<p>Google Photos can be accessed from a web browser, Google Drive desktop program, and smartphone app. While you can make only minor changes to the videos such as editing date, time, and location when accessing Google Photos via a web browser, the smartphone app allows you to edit the clips comparatively more sophisticatedly.</p>
<p><strong>3. Deletion</strong></p>
<p>The files that are stored in Google Photos remain there for an indefinite duration, of course until the entire space is completely consumed. When you delete something, it is moved to the Trash and stays there for another 60 days, after which it is automatically deleted from the Cloud forever.</p>

Using the built-in <strong>Google stabilizer video</strong> editor of the Photos app on both platforms is almost identical and extremely easy.</p>
<p>You can learn how to work with <strong>Google video stabilizer</strong> to stabilize a video by following the steps that are given below:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Locate and Open the Source Video in Google Photos</strong></p>
<p>Download and install Google Photos on your smartphone (Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ is used here for illustrations). Launch the app, tap <strong>Library</strong> from the bottom-right corner of the interface, and tap to open the source video that you want to stabilize with <strong>Google video stabilizer</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="open video to stabilize"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Stabilize the Video</strong></p>
<p>After the video opens in the app and the playback begins, tap <strong>Edit</strong> from the bottom. On the next screen, ensure that the <strong>Video</strong> section is selected. Tap the <strong>Stabilize</strong> icon from the lower-left area of the window, and wait while <strong>Google Photos stabilize video</strong>.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="stabilize video with google photos"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Save the Video</strong></p>
<p>Once the stabilization process is complete, click <strong>Save copy</strong> from the bottom-right corner to save the modified video as a separate copy, thus leaving the original instance intact.</p>

<p>Wondershare Filmora video editor is available for Windows and Mac platforms, and gives a tough competition to other industry-standard video editing applications like Final Cut Pro X and Adobe Premiere Pro, etc. You can learn how to stabilize a clip with Filmora instead of using <strong>Google stabilizer video</strong> editor by following the step-by-step instructions that are explained below:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Add the Source Video to the Timeline</strong></p>
<p>After downloading and installing Wondershare Filmora on your Mac or Windows computer (a Windows 11 PC is used here for illustrations), launch the program, and click the <strong>New Project</strong> tile from the first screen that appears.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Now, drag and drop the video to the timeline, or hover the mouse over the clip’s thumbnail in the <strong>Media</strong> window, click the <strong>+</strong> icon from the bottom-right area. Click the button under the <strong>Match to Media</strong> or <strong>Keep Project Settings</strong> label when the confirmation box comes up to add the film to the Timeline using the preferences that you selected.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Export the Stabilized Video</strong></p>
<p>Back on the main interface, click <strong>Export</strong> from the center-top. On the <strong>Export</strong> box that opens up next, go to your preferred tab, pick an output format, define output preferences, and click <strong>Export</strong> from the bottom-right corner to export the stabilized clip without even using <strong>Google stabilizer video</strong>.</p>

Some post-production tasks that you can perform while using Google Photos include:</p>
<p><strong>1. Trimming</strong></p>
<p>The trimming handles can be seen when you are on the ‘Video’ section after tapping ‘Edit’ in Google Photos after opening the video. You can drag these handles inwards to get rid of the unwanted starting and ending parts of a clip.</p>
