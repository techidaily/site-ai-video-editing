In this article, we will take a look at the software Lightworks and learn how to cut videos using it.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we will cover the cutting of videos in Lightworks. We will talk about what Lightworks is and how to download it. We’ll also cover the general interface so you know which buttons do what. Finally, we’ll talk about exporting a finished video and getting started with your next project in Lightworks!</p>
<h2 id="What-is-Lightworks"><a href="#What-is-Lightworks" class="headerlink" title="What is Lightworks?"></a>What is Lightworks?</h2><p>Lightworks is an editing software created by a company called Lightworks. It’s a free video editor that is incredibly powerful and has been used to edit some of the most popular films of recent years.</p>
<p>The software was originally designed for professional filmmakers, but it’s now available for anyone to use for any type of project. You can download Lightworks from the website here - <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.lightworks.com/" >https://www.lightworks.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<h2 id="Downloading-the-Software"><a href="#Downloading-the-Software" class="headerlink" title="Downloading the Software"></a>Downloading the Software</h2><p>First, download the Lightworks software from the website. You can do this by clicking on the big green button that says “Download the Latest Version”. When you click on it, you’ll be prompted to select your operating system and download the appropriate package.</p>
<p>Click “Next” and you’ll see a license agreement and a prompt for installation details. Fill in your information and click “Next” again to start your installation.</p>
<p>When installation is complete, launch Lightworks by double-clicking on the Lightworks icon in your files section.</p>
<p>The first time you open Lightworks, you’ll need to go through a few steps of initializing before using it for editing videos. This includes setting up your project settings and choosing whether or not to keep a backup of your previous work.</p>
<p>We will cover these initial steps separately in future blog posts, so don’t worry if it’s all unclear right now!</p>
<h2 id="The-Interface"><a href="#The-Interface" class="headerlink" title="The Interface"></a>The Interface</h2><p>New users to the software will notice that there are four different windows. The first window is the Project window. This window shows you all of the footage you have loaded into your project, as well as any clips you’ve added to your project (see below) and edits you’ve made. You may also notice a timeline in this window; this is where you’ll be placing your clips to create your video.</p>

                      alt="cut-video-in-lightworks"
                ></p>
<p>The Toolbar is located at the top of all four windows and gives quick access to commonly used features like adding clips, cropping, cutting clips, and more.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="cut-video-in-lightworks"
                ></p>
<p>The Edit List Window displays all of the clips that are available for use in your Project Window or Timeline. They’re not ordered chronologically; they’re ordered by how they were imported into Lightworks.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="cut-video-in-lightworks"
                ></p>
<p>The Timeline Window displays a list of edited scenes from your edited project for viewing purposes only - it does not contain anything about editing or timeline manipulation tasks.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="cut-video-in-lightworks"
                ></p>
<p>The Monitor Window displays information about what’s being displayed on screen at any given time. It can be used to preview videos before exporting them, previous scenes from the timeline, or rendered video frames after applying render effects.</p>

<h2 id="Step-by-Step-in-Cutting-Videos-in-Lightworks"><a href="#Step-by-Step-in-Cutting-Videos-in-Lightworks" class="headerlink" title="Step by Step in Cutting Videos in Lightworks"></a>Step by Step in Cutting Videos in Lightworks</h2><p>It’s not difficult to cut or divide a clip in Lightworks, and it doesn’t require a lot of time or effort. The following are the simple actions you’ll need to do to get started:</p>
<p>Step 1: First and foremost, you must import your movie into Lightworks. The simplest way to do this is to drag the clip you wish to work with onto the timeline:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-lightworks-6.png"
                      alt="cut-video-in-lightworks"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: After you’ve uploaded your clips to the timeline, you’ll be able to begin trimming them. To do so, simply slide the play head to the point where you wish to cut the clip and press the “C” key on your keyboard:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-lightworks-7.png"
                      alt="cut-video-in-lightworks"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: After you’ve cut the part you need, you’ll need to erase the rest. To do so, use your mouse to select the part you don’t want to erase, then use your mouse to pick the “Delete” option, or just click the “delete” button on your keyboard:</p>

The following are the simple actions you’ll need to do to get started:</p>
<p>Step 1: First and foremost, you must import your movie into Lightworks. The simplest way to do this is to drag the clip you wish to work with onto the timeline:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>Step 3: After you’ve cut the part you need, you’ll need to erase the rest. To do so, use your mouse to select the part you don’t want to erase, then use your mouse to pick the “Delete” option, or just click the “delete” button on your keyboard:</p>

The following are the simple actions you’ll need to do to get started:</p>
<p>Step 1: First and foremost, you must import your movie into Lightworks. The simplest way to do this is to drag the clip you wish to work with onto the timeline:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>Step 2: After you’ve uploaded your clips to the timeline, you’ll be able to begin trimming them. To do so, simply slide the play head to the point where you wish to cut the clip and press the “C” key on your keyboard:</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 3: After you’ve cut the part you need, you’ll need to erase the rest. To do so, use your mouse to select the part you don’t want to erase, then use your mouse to pick the “Delete” option, or just click the “delete” button on your keyboard:</p>

It may go from basic editing to VFX and so on. Speed ramping is also an important feature of editing. Creators who make cinematics or B-rolls often may have used this feature.</p>
<p>Changing the speed of the whole video doesn’t look good in most situations therefore speed ramping feature was created. Speed Ramping means gradually changing the speed of a clip over time. It isn’t a complex thing but doing it correctly in the right amount at the right time can change the feel of the whole video. It catches the attention of viewers through different scenes of a clip.</p>
<p>So, here we have mentioned some iPhone video editing softwares that can at least do basic speed changes. but most of them can also do advanced speed ramping. These are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Filmora Go:</strong></p>
<p><strong>It is available on IOS and Android both.</strong></p>
<p>Want to do speed ramping? use Filmora Go. But are you a content creator and want to do more than just video editing? I would still recommend “Filmora Go”. Because it is such a versatile and easy-to-use software made by Wondershare. Like its PC software, it is also packed with many cool features such as chroma key, mask, keyframing, blending, e.t.c.

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid iPhone Video speeding Softwares?</em></strong></p>
<p>It usually depends on your needs. If you just want a speed editor to make slow-mo or timelapse videos for your social media then you should go for free video editors, as they are easy to use and provide better speed ramping features than some paid video editors mentioned here.</p>
<p>But as a content creator if you want more features alongside speed ramping then you should go for paid softwares mentioned above. As mobile video editors are quite affordable and some of them have features like that of some PC softwares.</p>
<p><strong>FAQs about Speed ramping feature and softwares:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) What is Speed Ramping and where it is used?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Speed Ramping is different from just changing the speed of the whole clip. It means changing the speed of the video gradually, so the clip doesn’t feel jumpy.</p>
<p>It is done to give viewers a smooth experience between different parts of the clip. like the fast-forward clip is used to show the passage of time. and the slow-mo is used to emphasize something or produce tension, while a mix of both is used in ads and action scenes, e.t.c.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) How to do Speed Ramping?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Speed Ramping methods vary from software to software. Either you can do it by adding keyframes and changing speed with time or you can add or adjust curves for speed change. If your software doesn’t support the speed ramping feature, you can split a clip into parts and apply speed change to them differently. For some of the best iPhone softwares, we have mentioned the speed ramping steps above.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) What FPS is best for Slo-mo videos?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Shooting at 60 Fps is ideal as it gives a smooth and crisp video and you can make slow motion easily if required, you can slow it down up to 40% of its speed while maintaining the quality. It is supported in almost most devices nowadays. And if you want to create super slo-mo for your cinematics or product video then 120 or 240 fps is preferable. But higher fps often have disadvantages as it is harder to apply visual effects or masks. So choose the frame rate according to your requirements.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) Does changing the speed of video affect its audio?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, changing the speed of video affects the audio, It affects its pitch (tempo). Increasing its speed increases the pitch of the audio making it sound shrill while decreasing the speed of the video or making slow-mo decreases the pitch making it sound deep.</p>
<p>Although, some softwares provide the feature to maintain the pitch while changing the speed of the clip.</p>
<p><strong>~Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Its UI doesn’t support editing in landscape orientation.</li>
<li>It doesn’t support 4k video resolution.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid iPhone Video speeding Softwares?</em></strong></p>
<p>It usually depends on your needs. If you just want a speed editor to make slow-mo or timelapse videos for your social media then you should go for free video editors, as they are easy to use and provide better speed ramping features than some paid video editors mentioned here.</p>
<p>But as a content creator if you want more features alongside speed ramping then you should go for paid softwares mentioned above. As mobile video editors are quite affordable and some of them have features like that of some PC softwares.</p>
<p><strong>FAQs about Speed ramping feature and softwares:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) What is Speed Ramping and where it is used?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Speed Ramping is different from just changing the speed of the whole clip. It means changing the speed of the video gradually, so the clip doesn’t feel jumpy.</p>
<p>It is done to give viewers a smooth experience between different parts of the clip. like the fast-forward clip is used to show the passage of time. and the slow-mo is used to emphasize something or produce tension, while a mix of both is used in ads and action scenes, e.t.c.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) How to do Speed Ramping?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Speed Ramping methods vary from software to software. Either you can do it by adding keyframes and changing speed with time or you can add or adjust curves for speed change. If your software doesn’t support the speed ramping feature, you can split a clip into parts and apply speed change to them differently. For some of the best iPhone softwares, we have mentioned the speed ramping steps above.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) What FPS is best for Slo-mo videos?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Shooting at 60 Fps is ideal as it gives a smooth and crisp video and you can make slow motion easily if required, you can slow it down up to 40% of its speed while maintaining the quality. It is supported in almost most devices nowadays. And if you want to create super slo-mo for your cinematics or product video then 120 or 240 fps is preferable. But higher fps often have disadvantages as it is harder to apply visual effects or masks. So choose the frame rate according to your requirements.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) Does changing the speed of video affect its audio?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, changing the speed of video affects the audio, It affects its pitch (tempo). Increasing its speed increases the pitch of the audio making it sound shrill while decreasing the speed of the video or making slow-mo decreases the pitch making it sound deep.</p>
<p>Although, some softwares provide the feature to maintain the pitch while changing the speed of the clip.</p>
<p><strong>~Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Its UI doesn’t support editing in landscape orientation.</li>
<li>It doesn’t support 4k video resolution.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid iPhone Video speeding Softwares?</em></strong></p>
<p>It usually depends on your needs. If you just want a speed editor to make slow-mo or timelapse videos for your social media then you should go for free video editors, as they are easy to use and provide better speed ramping features than some paid video editors mentioned here.</p>

<p><strong>FAQs about Speed ramping feature and softwares:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) What is Speed Ramping and where it is used?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Speed Ramping is different from just changing the speed of the whole clip. It means changing the speed of the video gradually, so the clip doesn’t feel jumpy.</p>
<p>It is done to give viewers a smooth experience between different parts of the clip. like the fast-forward clip is used to show the passage of time. and the slow-mo is used to emphasize something or produce tension, while a mix of both is used in ads and action scenes, e.t.c.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) How to do Speed Ramping?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Speed Ramping methods vary from software to software. Either you can do it by adding keyframes and changing speed with time or you can add or adjust curves for speed change. If your software doesn’t support the speed ramping feature, you can split a clip into parts and apply speed change to them differently. For some of the best iPhone softwares, we have mentioned the speed ramping steps above.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) What FPS is best for Slo-mo videos?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Shooting at 60 Fps is ideal as it gives a smooth and crisp video and you can make slow motion easily if required, you can slow it down up to 40% of its speed while maintaining the quality. It is supported in almost most devices nowadays. And if you want to create super slo-mo for your cinematics or product video then 120 or 240 fps is preferable. But higher fps often have disadvantages as it is harder to apply visual effects or masks. So choose the frame rate according to your requirements.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) Does changing the speed of video affect its audio?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, changing the speed of video affects the audio, It affects its pitch (tempo). Increasing its speed increases the pitch of the audio making it sound shrill while decreasing the speed of the video or making slow-mo decreases the pitch making it sound deep.</p>
<p>Although, some softwares provide the feature to maintain the pitch while changing the speed of the clip.</p>
<p><strong>~Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Its UI doesn’t support editing in landscape orientation.</li>
<li>It doesn’t support 4k video resolution.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid iPhone Video speeding Softwares?</em></strong></p>
<p>It usually depends on your needs. If you just want a speed editor to make slow-mo or timelapse videos for your social media then you should go for free video editors, as they are easy to use and provide better speed ramping features than some paid video editors mentioned here.</p>
<p>But as a content creator if you want more features alongside speed ramping then you should go for paid softwares mentioned above. As mobile video editors are quite affordable and some of them have features like that of some PC softwares.</p>
<p><strong>FAQs about Speed ramping feature and softwares:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) What is Speed Ramping and where it is used?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Speed Ramping is different from just changing the speed of the whole clip. It means changing the speed of the video gradually, so the clip doesn’t feel jumpy.</p>
<p>It is done to give viewers a smooth experience between different parts of the clip. like the fast-forward clip is used to show the passage of time. and the slow-mo is used to emphasize something or produce tension, while a mix of both is used in ads and action scenes, e.t.c.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) How to do Speed Ramping?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Speed Ramping methods vary from software to software. Either you can do it by adding keyframes and changing speed with time or you can add or adjust curves for speed change. If your software doesn’t support the speed ramping feature, you can split a clip into parts and apply speed change to them differently. For some of the best iPhone softwares, we have mentioned the speed ramping steps above.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) What FPS is best for Slo-mo videos?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Shooting at 60 Fps is ideal as it gives a smooth and crisp video and you can make slow motion easily if required, you can slow it down up to 40% of its speed while maintaining the quality. It is supported in almost most devices nowadays. And if you want to create super slo-mo for your cinematics or product video then 120 or 240 fps is preferable. But higher fps often have disadvantages as it is harder to apply visual effects or masks. So choose the frame rate according to your requirements.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) Does changing the speed of video affect its audio?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, changing the speed of video affects the audio, It affects its pitch (tempo). Increasing its speed increases the pitch of the audio making it sound shrill while decreasing the speed of the video or making slow-mo decreases the pitch making it sound deep.</p>
<p>Although, some softwares provide the feature to maintain the pitch while changing the speed of the clip.</p>

<h5 id="Step1-Download-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Step1-Download-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Download Wondershare Filmora"></a>Step1 Download Wondershare Filmora</h5><p>Wondershare Filmora will provide the working platform. Follow the below steps to download it:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, install the Wondershare Filmora.</li>
<li>Then, launch this application on your PC or Mac</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="Step2-Import-your-Photos-and-Videos"><a href="#Step2-Import-your-Photos-and-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Import your Photos and Videos"></a>Step2 Import your Photos and Videos</h5><p>Importing your videos and pictures to Filmora’s media panel is best to have them all in one folder. Therefore, when you open Wondershare Filmora, you will notice the main import window in the top left corner.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click in the center of the <strong>import</strong> window upon the import icon.</li>
<li><strong>Browse</strong> from the PC library to where your target Videos and Photos are stored.</li>
<li>Please select the required videos and photos and <strong>Open</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-2.png"
                      alt="import your videos and photos"
                ></p>
<p>Your next step will be to add the imported videos and images to the timeline.</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Add-your-Photos-and-Videos-to-the-Timeline"><a href="#Step3-Add-your-Photos-and-Videos-to-the-Timeline" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Add your Photos and Videos to the Timeline"></a>Step3 Add your Photos and Videos to the Timeline</h5><p>When you have multiple videos and photos, you can add all of them simultaneously. Or you can also add them one by one wherever you need. Follow the steps mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Right-click</strong> on the photo or video you want.</li>
<li>Keep holding the Right-click and drag it down to the timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-3.png"
                      alt="add your photos and videos to your timeline"
                ></p>
<p>Now that we have imported your photos and videos into the timeline, it is time to align and add text.</p>
<h5 id="Step4-Add-the-Title"><a href="#Step4-Add-the-Title" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Add the Title"></a>Step4 Add the Title</h5><p>To create an attractive slideshow, you will need to add a title before the start of the video. Doing so will allow you to gain more viewers and audiences.</p>
<p><strong>Add a Black Screen</strong></p>
<p>The black screen will eventually act like a canvas to give your title a good look. To add a black screen, follow the steps mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>media</strong> icon from the bar above the import window.</li>
<li>You will notice many tabs on the left-hand side under a drop-down bar.</li>
<li>Scroll below to find the <strong>sample media</strong></li>
<li>Download the black color if it is not downloaded already.</li>
<li>Click and drag it down below to the start of your video.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-4.png"
                      alt="adding a black screen"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Add a Title Tile</strong></p>
<p>Now that we have our canvas, we will now add the title. Above the import media library, there will be a <strong>Title</strong> icon.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>title</strong> icon, and select the title that you want for your video by browsing and scrolling down.</li>
<li>For this purpose, we will use a simple title tile called “<strong>Title 29</strong>.”</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can find the same title by scrolling, browsing, or searching in the search bar above the import library.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click and drag the title onto the black screen that we added.</li>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> the title to open its settings.</li>
<li>Here you can type in the text that you want.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-5.png"
                      alt="add a title"
                ></p>
<p>You can also change its font. When you click on the font bar, a drop-down option will pop up, and you choose whichever you like.</p>
<ul>
<li>Change the <strong>animation</strong> of the text title from the top left corner <strong>animation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Change The Timing of The Title</strong></p>
<p>You can also adjust the timing of the title by below steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>advanced option</strong> in the bottom right corner, and settings will pop up.</li>
<li>Find the title bar and drag it to the right side to increase the timing of the title.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-6.png"
                      alt="change the timing of the title"
                ></p>
<p>After adding the title, it’s time to go with fading effect as shown below!</p>
<h5 id="Step5-Add-a-Fade-effect"><a href="#Step5-Add-a-Fade-effect" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Add a Fade effect"></a>Step5 Add a Fade effect</h5><p>You can also add a fade transition to the start of your video. It will blend the title with the first clip. Follow the steps mentioned to add the transition effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Search the <strong>Fade</strong> option from the Transitions tab above the import window</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> A fade transition will allow your title to fade into the first clip creating a visually pleasing effect.</p>
<ul>
<li>Download the <strong>Fade</strong> transition and <strong>drag</strong> it between the Black screen and the first clip.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-7.png"
                      alt="adding a fade effect"
                ></p>
<p>Now that we have added a transition, it is time to move on to our music!</p>
<h5 id="Step6-Add-The-Music"><a href="#Step6-Add-The-Music" class="headerlink" title="Step6 Add The Music"></a>Step6 Add The Music</h5><p>You can add your music to the slideshow from your PC library, but make sure you have the music rights. It is better to use stock audio by following the steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>Audio</strong> icon on the bar above the import window, and the list will pop up.</li>
<li>Please browse the library to find music that best suits your video and download it.</li>
<li>Then add it to the timeline’s audio track.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Add Beat Detection</strong></p>
<p>To match your video clips properly with the music, so it remains in sync, you can adjust it with the beat of the music. To add beat detection, follow the steps mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right-Click on the audio that you selected in the audio library.</li>
<li>You will see a pop-up list, and in the options, you will see Beat detection.</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Beat detection</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-8.png"
                      alt="adding beat detection"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Then click on the audio and drag it below on the timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Match The Video With The Audio Markers</strong></p>
<p>To have the full advantage of beat detection, you must adjust your videos and photos to the markers. Follow the steps mentioned below to do so:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-9.png"
                      alt="matching the video with the audio"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Check that the video clips are in sync with the marker on the audio.</li>
<li>For this, drag one video end to a marker or as many videos as you want.</li>
<li>Ultimately, you will create a timeline in which your videos sync with the audio beat.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-10.png"
                      alt="synced video with audio"
                ></p>
<p>After syncing your videos and photos to the audio, it is time to move on to the scaling and background blur.</p>
<h5 id="Step7-Scale-and-Blur-The-Background"><a href="#Step7-Scale-and-Blur-The-Background" class="headerlink" title="Step7 Scale and Blur The Background"></a>Step7 Scale and Blur The Background</h5><p>Now, some of the pictures you have added must-have black borders. It usually means that your image is shorter than the aspect ratio.</p>
<p>If you leave the picture&#x2F;photo as it is, the black borders will make it look shorter and out of proportion. As a result, it gives a generally poor look, as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-11.png"
                      alt="unscaled photo in the main play window"
                ></p>
<p>To counter this problem, follow some easy steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> on the picture with black borders, and it will open the settings list.</li>
<li>Go into the <strong>Transform</strong> Here you can see multiple settings.</li>
<li>Increase the size of your photo to match the aspect ratio.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-12.png"
                      alt="scaling of the photo"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Add a Background Blur Effect</strong></p>
<p>In some cases where you have taken a portrait photo where the picture is vertical, it ultimately stays out of proportion to the aspect ratio.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Simply scaling the image to match the aspect ratio size is not sensible in this case. Doing so will hide the many pretty features of a portrait.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-13.png"
                      alt="photo with black borders"
                ></p>
<p>To counter this problem, you can add a blur effect. This effect will turn your background blur, matching the aspect ratio. Follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>Effects</strong> tab above the import window and search for <strong>Blur</strong>.</li>
<li>Download the blur effect that suits you best and then <strong>drag</strong> the blur effect above your photo in the timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will notice the background turn to a blur in the main play screen.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-14.png"
                      alt="photo with blurred background"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step8-Add-a-Transition"><a href="#Step8-Add-a-Transition" class="headerlink" title="Step8 Add a Transition"></a>Step8 Add a Transition</h5><p>You can also add a transition effect to spice up things. It can get bland when your video or photo changes from one to another. To create a good slideshow video, you can add a transition effect by following the steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>Transition</strong> icon above the import window.</li>
<li><strong>Browse</strong> the library until you find a transition you like, then download one.</li>
<li>Click on the transition and drag it between the clips.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-15.gif"
                      alt="transition effect"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Adjust The Duration and Placement of The Transition</strong></p>
<p>Now it’s time to adjust the duration and placement of the transition. For this, you can follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> on the transition effect, and it will open the settings list.</li>
<li>You can adjust the duration by setting the timer as per your requirement.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If other transitions are added to the timeline, you can adjust them by clicking Apply to all.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adjusting the duration of the transition"
                ></p>
<p>When you have adjusted the slideshow transitions, it is time to move on to the effects and filters.</p>
<h5 id="Step9-Add-the-Effects-and-Filters"><a href="#Step9-Add-the-Effects-and-Filters" class="headerlink" title="Step9 Add the Effects and Filters"></a>Step9 Add the Effects and Filters</h5><p>If you create a slideshow video of your trip to a historical place. You can add a Vintage filter to your video to give it that vintage tint. Follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Head over to the Effects tab, where the <strong>effects library</strong> will open up</li>
<li>Select any effect and <strong>download</strong></li>
<li>Click on the effect and <strong>drag</strong> it to <strong>drop</strong> in the timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adding the vintage effect"
                ></p>
<p>Combining a vintage effect with a dreamy glow will make your video pop up even more. To add a nostalgic glow to your video, follow the steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>effects</strong> and search for <strong>Glow</strong> in the search bar.</li>
<li>Click and drag the glow effect above the timeline and ensure the effect is in the separate video timeline.</li>

<p>We are almost done. Let us now move toward our outro!</p>
<h5 id="Step10-Create-an-Outro"><a href="#Step10-Create-an-Outro" class="headerlink" title="Step10 Create an Outro"></a>Step10 Create an Outro</h5><p>The steps we will do will be similar to the ones we did initially. As we are creating, we will again need a canvas. Follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Head to the <strong>media</strong> icon on the bar and scroll until you see the sample <strong>media tab</strong>.</li>
<li>In the sample color option, <strong>drag</strong> and <strong>drop</strong> the black color at the end of your video.</li>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Fade out The Audio</strong></p>
<p>If the audio suddenly ends at the end of your slideshow, it will create a bitter effect. Therefore, you should always fade out audio at the end of the video. To do this, follow the steps mentioned:</p>

<h5 id="Step2-Import-your-Photos-and-Videos-1"><a href="#Step2-Import-your-Photos-and-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Import your Photos and Videos"></a>Step2 Import your Photos and Videos</h5><p>Importing your videos and pictures to Filmora’s media panel is best to have them all in one folder. Therefore, when you open Wondershare Filmora, you will notice the main import window in the top left corner.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click in the center of the <strong>import</strong> window upon the import icon.</li>
<li><strong>Browse</strong> from the PC library to where your target Videos and Photos are stored.</li>
<li>Please select the required videos and photos and <strong>Open</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-2.png"
                      alt="import your videos and photos"
                ></p>
<p>Your next step will be to add the imported videos and images to the timeline.</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Add-your-Photos-and-Videos-to-the-Timeline-1"><a href="#Step3-Add-your-Photos-and-Videos-to-the-Timeline-1" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Add your Photos and Videos to the Timeline"></a>Step3 Add your Photos and Videos to the Timeline</h5><p>When you have multiple videos and photos, you can add all of them simultaneously. Or you can also add them one by one wherever you need. Follow the steps mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Right-click</strong> on the photo or video you want.</li>
<li>Keep holding the Right-click and drag it down to the timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-3.png"
                      alt="add your photos and videos to your timeline"
                ></p>
<p>Now that we have imported your photos and videos into the timeline, it is time to align and add text.</p>
<h5 id="Step4-Add-the-Title-1"><a href="#Step4-Add-the-Title-1" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Add the Title"></a>Step4 Add the Title</h5><p>To create an attractive slideshow, you will need to add a title before the start of the video. Doing so will allow you to gain more viewers and audiences.</p>
<p><strong>Add a Black Screen</strong></p>
<p>The black screen will eventually act like a canvas to give your title a good look. To add a black screen, follow the steps mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>media</strong> icon from the bar above the import window.</li>
<li>You will notice many tabs on the left-hand side under a drop-down bar.</li>
<li>Scroll below to find the <strong>sample media</strong></li>
<li>Download the black color if it is not downloaded already.</li>
<li>Click and drag it down below to the start of your video.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-4.png"
                      alt="adding a black screen"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Add a Title Tile</strong></p>
<p>Now that we have our canvas, we will now add the title. Above the import media library, there will be a <strong>Title</strong> icon.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>title</strong> icon, and select the title that you want for your video by browsing and scrolling down.</li>
<li>For this purpose, we will use a simple title tile called “<strong>Title 29</strong>.”</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can find the same title by scrolling, browsing, or searching in the search bar above the import library.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click and drag the title onto the black screen that we added.</li>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> the title to open its settings.</li>
<li>Here you can type in the text that you want.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-5.png"
                      alt="add a title"
                ></p>
<p>You can also change its font. When you click on the font bar, a drop-down option will pop up, and you choose whichever you like.</p>
<ul>
<li>Change the <strong>animation</strong> of the text title from the top left corner <strong>animation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Change The Timing of The Title</strong></p>
<p>You can also adjust the timing of the title by below steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>advanced option</strong> in the bottom right corner, and settings will pop up.</li>
<li>Find the title bar and drag it to the right side to increase the timing of the title.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-6.png"
                      alt="change the timing of the title"
                ></p>
<p>After adding the title, it’s time to go with fading effect as shown below!</p>
<h5 id="Step5-Add-a-Fade-effect-1"><a href="#Step5-Add-a-Fade-effect-1" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Add a Fade effect"></a>Step5 Add a Fade effect</h5><p>You can also add a fade transition to the start of your video. It will blend the title with the first clip. Follow the steps mentioned to add the transition effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Search the <strong>Fade</strong> option from the Transitions tab above the import window</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> A fade transition will allow your title to fade into the first clip creating a visually pleasing effect.</p>
<ul>
<li>Download the <strong>Fade</strong> transition and <strong>drag</strong> it between the Black screen and the first clip.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-7.png"
                      alt="adding a fade effect"
                ></p>
<p>Now that we have added a transition, it is time to move on to our music!</p>
<h5 id="Step6-Add-The-Music-1"><a href="#Step6-Add-The-Music-1" class="headerlink" title="Step6 Add The Music"></a>Step6 Add The Music</h5><p>You can add your music to the slideshow from your PC library, but make sure you have the music rights. It is better to use stock audio by following the steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>Audio</strong> icon on the bar above the import window, and the list will pop up.</li>
<li>Please browse the library to find music that best suits your video and download it.</li>
<li>Then add it to the timeline’s audio track.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Add Beat Detection</strong></p>
<p>To match your video clips properly with the music, so it remains in sync, you can adjust it with the beat of the music. To add beat detection, follow the steps mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right-Click on the audio that you selected in the audio library.</li>
<li>You will see a pop-up list, and in the options, you will see Beat detection.</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Beat detection</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-8.png"
                      alt="adding beat detection"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Then click on the audio and drag it below on the timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Match The Video With The Audio Markers</strong></p>
<p>To have the full advantage of beat detection, you must adjust your videos and photos to the markers. Follow the steps mentioned below to do so:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-9.png"
                      alt="matching the video with the audio"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Check that the video clips are in sync with the marker on the audio.</li>
<li>For this, drag one video end to a marker or as many videos as you want.</li>
<li>Ultimately, you will create a timeline in which your videos sync with the audio beat.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-10.png"
                      alt="synced video with audio"
                ></p>
<p>After syncing your videos and photos to the audio, it is time to move on to the scaling and background blur.</p>
<h5 id="Step7-Scale-and-Blur-The-Background-1"><a href="#Step7-Scale-and-Blur-The-Background-1" class="headerlink" title="Step7 Scale and Blur The Background"></a>Step7 Scale and Blur The Background</h5><p>Now, some of the pictures you have added must-have black borders. It usually means that your image is shorter than the aspect ratio.</p>
<p>If you leave the picture&#x2F;photo as it is, the black borders will make it look shorter and out of proportion. As a result, it gives a generally poor look, as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-11.png"
                      alt="unscaled photo in the main play window"
                ></p>
<p>To counter this problem, follow some easy steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> on the picture with black borders, and it will open the settings list.</li>
<li>Go into the <strong>Transform</strong> Here you can see multiple settings.</li>
<li>Increase the size of your photo to match the aspect ratio.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-12.png"
                      alt="scaling of the photo"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Add a Background Blur Effect</strong></p>
<p>In some cases where you have taken a portrait photo where the picture is vertical, it ultimately stays out of proportion to the aspect ratio.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Simply scaling the image to match the aspect ratio size is not sensible in this case. Doing so will hide the many pretty features of a portrait.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-13.png"
                      alt="photo with black borders"
                ></p>
<p>To counter this problem, you can add a blur effect. This effect will turn your background blur, matching the aspect ratio. Follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>Effects</strong> tab above the import window and search for <strong>Blur</strong>.</li>
<li>Download the blur effect that suits you best and then <strong>drag</strong> the blur effect above your photo in the timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will notice the background turn to a blur in the main play screen.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-14.png"
                      alt="photo with blurred background"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step8-Add-a-Transition-1"><a href="#Step8-Add-a-Transition-1" class="headerlink" title="Step8 Add a Transition"></a>Step8 Add a Transition</h5><p>You can also add a transition effect to spice up things. It can get bland when your video or photo changes from one to another. To create a good slideshow video, you can add a transition effect by following the steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>Transition</strong> icon above the import window.</li>
<li><strong>Browse</strong> the library until you find a transition you like, then download one.</li>
<li>Click on the transition and drag it between the clips.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-15.gif"
                      alt="transition effect"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Adjust The Duration and Placement of The Transition</strong></p>
<p>Now it’s time to adjust the duration and placement of the transition. For this, you can follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> on the transition effect, and it will open the settings list.</li>
<li>You can adjust the duration by setting the timer as per your requirement.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If other transitions are added to the timeline, you can adjust them by clicking Apply to all.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adjusting the duration of the transition"
                ></p>
<p>When you have adjusted the slideshow transitions, it is time to move on to the effects and filters.</p>
<h5 id="Step9-Add-the-Effects-and-Filters-1"><a href="#Step9-Add-the-Effects-and-Filters-1" class="headerlink" title="Step9 Add the Effects and Filters"></a>Step9 Add the Effects and Filters</h5><p>If you create a slideshow video of your trip to a historical place. You can add a Vintage filter to your video to give it that vintage tint. Follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>

<li>Select any effect and <strong>download</strong></li>
<li>Click on the effect and <strong>drag</strong> it to <strong>drop</strong> in the timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adding the vintage effect"
                ></p>
<p>Combining a vintage effect with a dreamy glow will make your video pop up even more. To add a nostalgic glow to your video, follow the steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>effects</strong> and search for <strong>Glow</strong> in the search bar.</li>
<li>Click and drag the glow effect above the timeline and ensure the effect is in the separate video timeline.</li>

<p>We are almost done. Let us now move toward our outro!</p>
<h5 id="Step10-Create-an-Outro-1"><a href="#Step10-Create-an-Outro-1" class="headerlink" title="Step10 Create an Outro"></a>Step10 Create an Outro</h5><p>The steps we will do will be similar to the ones we did initially. As we are creating, we will again need a canvas. Follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Head to the <strong>media</strong> icon on the bar and scroll until you see the sample <strong>media tab</strong>.</li>
<li>In the sample color option, <strong>drag</strong> and <strong>drop</strong> the black color at the end of your video.</li>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Fade out The Audio</strong></p>
<p>If the audio suddenly ends at the end of your slideshow, it will create a bitter effect. Therefore, you should always fade out audio at the end of the video. To do this, follow the steps mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> on the audio in the timeline, and the settings list will pop up.</li>
<li>On the top section of the import window, you will notice fade options.</li>
<li>In the fade-out bar, drag it to the side to set your fade-out timer.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can show your friends and family the slideshow or upload it to Youtube. Play the Slideshow Video from the beginning to see the changes.</p>

<h2 id="Enhancing-Your-Video-In-Premiere-Pro-3"><a href="#Enhancing-Your-Video-In-Premiere-Pro-3" class="headerlink" title="Enhancing Your Video In Premiere Pro"></a>Enhancing Your Video In Premiere Pro</h2><p>Once you have done all the steps above, you can also use the video enhancing feature of adobe premiere pro to improve the quality of your videos. When you brighten a video, there is a chance that you might lose quality a little bit. So, to overcome that deficiency, this method might be helpful. Enhancing your videos with Premiere Pro is easy once you know the proper steps to do so. Just follow the steps described below:</p>
<h3 id="Step-1-11"><a href="#Step-1-11" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h3><p>In the effects panel, search for “unsharp Mask” and drag it to the video clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/premiere-pro-brighten-video-8.png"
                      alt="enhance video in premiere pro"
                ></p>
<h3 id="Step-2-11"><a href="#Step-2-11" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h3><p>In the effect control panel under the Unsharp mask, set the amounts, radius, and threshold to enhance the video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/premiere-pro-brighten-video-9.png"
                      alt="enhance video in premiere pro"
                ></p>
<p>Keep in mind that you can increase the values of these parameters too high, but you will end up with a distorted video. Try increasing the values by small increments and see what happens. Avoid increasing the “amount” and radius value beyond 100% and ten, respectively.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-9"><a href="#Conclusion-9" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>● Brightening in Premiere Pro is a simple process that can benefit some video projects. Whether you want to brighten the video by increasing exposure, increasing luminance, or adding a vignette effect altogether, there are several ways to do so in Premiere Pro.</p>
<p>● However, you should know that neither option is necessarily better than the other. Video editing in general does take a bit of practice to master, but in this article, we have provided you with the basics and helped you on your way. All methods can be helpful in different situations, and even with similar circumstances, you might find advantages to all practices. Try out these methods for yourself and see which one best suits your needs.</p>
