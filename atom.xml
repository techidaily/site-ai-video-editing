The new<a class="link"   href="https://www.minisforum.com/page/x7ti/index.html?lang=en" >AtomMan X7 Ti <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> becomes the first in the firm’s AtomMan line, described as a high-end cutting-edge marque by Minisforum. It is also claimed to be the “first Intel Ultra 9 AI Mini PC with a 4-inch Touchscreen.” With the rising popularity of<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cooling/hands-on-lian-lis-lcd-screen-fans-turn-heads-and-are-surprisingly-affordable-but-not-as-configurable-as-id-like" >extra screens in PCs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , integrating one into a compact desktop might be a popular idea.</p><p> Starting from the outside, we see that the AtomMan X7 Ti would be a conventional-looking<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/asus-gets-license-to-make-intel-nucs" >NUC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> -alike apart from two things. Firstly, it features a 4-inch 480p touch display which covers a fair portion of the top panel. Secondly, it comes with a neat stand that angles the display panel into an easy glanceable view. Furthermore, Minisforum has followed some logic by situating a 1080p<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/windows-hello-fido2-certification-may-update-microsoft,39261.html" >Windows Hello <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> compatible webcam and dual mics above the touchscreen, appealing to video conferencing fans.</p><p> While we are considering external features, let’s look at the ports. Despite its compact size (145 x 145 x 49mm), the AtomMan X7 Ti features a decent quantity and selection of ports, as follows: RJ45 5G Ethernet Port ×2, DP 2.0, HDMI 2.1,<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/worlds-first-oculink-usb-4-egpu-with-radeor-rx-7600m-xt" >OCulink <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Port (up to 64Gbps), USB4 ×2, USB3.2 Gen2 Type-A ×2, USB3.2 Gen1 Type-A, USB2.0, a 3.5mm Combo Jack, SD Card slot, and a Power Button with an embedded fingerprint reader. <a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/wi-fi-7-faq" >Wi-Fi 7 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and Bluetooth 5.4 complement the dual Ethernet ports. It must also be noted that the mix of dedicated monitor and USB4 ports means you can connect up to four external displays to this machine.</p><p> Image 1 of 3</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="Minisforum AtomMan X7 Ti PC"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Minisforum)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="Minisforum AtomMan X7 Ti PC"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Minisforum)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="Minisforum AtomMan X7 Ti PC"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Minisforum)</p><p> Moving inside, the star of the show is the new Intel Core Ultra 9 processor<a class="link"   href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/236849/intel-core-ultra-9-processor-185h-24m-cache-up-to-5-10-ghz/specifications.html" >185H <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with a 16C&#x2F;22T CPU running at up to 5.1 GHz, and onboard Arc GPU with eight Xe cores running at up to 2.35 GHz.

It uses standard DDR5-5600 SO-DIMMs, up to a max of 64GB. There are also two M.2 2280 PCIe 4.0 SSD slots, and the aforementioned wireless functionality comes courtesy of a socketed Intel BE200 card, so it can be changed for repair or upgrade.</p><p> We don’t have pricing for the AtomMan X7 Ti. Minisforum says it will go on pre-sale from May 20, so we expect to hear more about pricing and shipping RAM&#x2F;storage configurations at that time. Those particularly interested in this product can sign up for an email about it and get a $30 coupon from Minisforum.</p><p> We caught a first glimpse of the AtomMan X7 Ti<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/desktops/mini-pcs/minisforum-first-intel-core-ultra-mini-pc-amd-rx-7600M-xt-mini-pc" >at CES 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> when it was showcased with other interesting new computers like the Minisforum HX200G, Mini Workstation MS-01, and the<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tablets/minisforum-v3-tablet-arrives-the-worlds-first-amd-ryzen-7-8840u-powered-surface-clone" >V3 tablet <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter"><a href="#Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter" class="headerlink" title="Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter"></a>Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter</h2><p> Get Tom’s Hardware’s best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p><p> Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands  Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors</p><p> By submitting your information you agree to the<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/terms-conditions/" >Terms &amp; Conditions <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/privacy-policy/" >Privacy Policy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and are aged 16 or over.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-step-by-step-save-instagram-videos-on-desktop-devices/"><u>[New] In 2024, Step-by-Step Save Instagram Videos on Desktop Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/new-snapseed-simplified-the-photographers-first-toolkit/"><u>[New] Snapseed Simplified The Photographer's First Toolkit</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-flexicam-soft-cam-covering-pad/"><u>2024 Approved FlexiCam Soft Cam Covering Pad</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/8-ultimate-fixes-for-google-play-your-honor-x50-gt-isnt-compatible-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>8 Ultimate Fixes for Google Play Your Honor X50 GT Isnt Compatible | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11-tips.techidaily.com/capture-windows-like-a-pro-snip-tool-vs-prtsc-advantages/"><u>Capture Windows Like a Pro: Snip Tool Vs.

The procedure of slomo creation, like <strong>The Slow Mo Guys</strong> in Filmora, is given below:</p><h5 id="Step-1Import-Media-to-Start-Slomo-Creation"><a href="#Step-1Import-Media-to-Start-Slomo-Creation" class="headerlink" title="Step 1Import Media to Start Slomo Creation"></a>Step 1Import Media to Start Slomo Creation</h5><p>After downloading Filmora on your device, click the “New Project” button to start.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="ChatGPT-Vs-Claude-AI-Showdown-Determining-the-Superior-Language-Model-for-Engaging-Chats"><a href="#ChatGPT-Vs-Claude-AI-Showdown-Determining-the-Superior-Language-Model-for-Engaging-Chats" class="headerlink" title="ChatGPT Vs. Claude AI Showdown: Determining the Superior Language Model for Engaging Chats"></a>ChatGPT Vs. Claude AI Showdown: Determining the Superior Language Model for Engaging Chats</h2><p> Since its release in November 2022, ChatGPT has remained the dominant force in the AI chatbot space. Despite far-reaching efforts by several AI companies, no one has really been able to build a chatbot that truly challenges ChatGPT in overall response quality. Google’s Bard? Microsoft’s Bing AI? No, not really.</p><p> However, Claude AI, a chatbot built by AI startup Anthropic, shows qualities of a chatbot that can dethrone ChatGPT. A considerable number of users are already saying Claude is the better option. But is this the case? Let’s take both chatbots for a spin.</p><h2 id="ChatGPT-vs-Claude-AI-Common-Sense-and-Logical-Reasoning"><a href="#ChatGPT-vs-Claude-AI-Common-Sense-and-Logical-Reasoning" class="headerlink" title="ChatGPT vs. Claude AI: Common-Sense and Logical Reasoning"></a>ChatGPT vs. Claude AI: Common-Sense and Logical Reasoning</h2><p> There’s an intriguing contrast when working with AI chatbots. On one hand, they can whiz through complex tasks that humans may labor over for days to solve. On the other hand, they sometimes grapple with elementary problems that require just a bit of common-sense or logical reasoning. So, we tested both ChatGPT and Claude AI to see which AI chatbot was better at common sense and logical reasoning tasks.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/logical-and-commonsense-problem.jpg"                      alt="logical and commonsense problem"                ></p><p> ChatGPT broke up the problem into bits and solved it on the first attempt. Claude AI also had a go at it and solved the problem as well, but with a different approach.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/claude-ai-solving-a-commonsense-and-logical-reasoning-problem.jpg"                      alt="Claude AI solving a commonsense and logical reasoning problem"                ></p><p> For the first task, both chatbots were able to crack the problem. So, we moved on to a different kind of problem. We tasked both chatbots with answering a trick question.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/chatgpt-answers-trick-question-1.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT Answers Trick Question-1"                ></p><p> ChatGPT was able to immediately spot the trick–you can’t bury survivors because they aren’t dead. Claude AI, on the other hand, seemed to understand that it was a trick question but failed to spot the most common-sense issue that you don’t bury survivors.</p><p> Instead, it over-analyzed the question and came to the conclusion that there would be “no survivors to bury” because crashing from Mars to Earth would be fatal. It is not the answer we expected, but if you look at things from a different angle, there is some truth to it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/claude-ai-answers-trick-question.jpg"                      alt="Claude AI answers trick question"                ></p><p> On this task, we give it to ChatGPT, but we can’t totally rule out Claude AI’s approach. For our final task on this metric, we asked both chatbots how many apples would be left on an apple tree after five and 10 days respectively if we started with 10 apples and five of them got sliced while still on the tree. ChatGPT said there’d still be 10 apples left.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/chatgpt-birds-commonsense-logic.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT birds commonsense logic"                ></p><p> Claude AI, on the other hand, gave a more common-sense response by recognizing that the five sliced apples are likely to rot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/claude-ai-common-sense-reasoning-with-apple-rotting.jpg"                      alt="Claude AI Common sense reasoning with Apple rotting"                ></p><p> Claude AI clearly got this one. We tried a few more tricky problems, and both chatbots had a fair share of successes and failures in dealing with them. Considering the outcome we observed, it might be fair to say that while ChatGPT has an edge, both chatbots are not too far apart in common sense and logical reasoning abilities.</p><h2 id="ChatGPT-vs-Claude-AI-Math-Skills"><a href="#ChatGPT-vs-Claude-AI-Math-Skills" class="headerlink" title="ChatGPT vs. Claude AI: Math Skills"></a>ChatGPT vs. Claude AI: Math Skills</h2><p> Even if you never plan to use ChatGPT or Claude AI to solve your Algebra homework, their mathematical abilities have far-reaching implications. For AI chatbots, math is the key to understanding real-world logic, identifying flawed thinking, and admitting mistakes.</p><p> Essentially, math proficiency is a core metric of artificial intelligence. So, between ChatGPT and Claude AI, which chatbot is more proficient in math? We tasked both chatbots with solving a twisty math productivity problem. We started with Claude AI, and the chatbot cracked the problem.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/claude-ai-solves-maths-problem-on-productivity.jpg"                      alt="Claude AI solves maths problem on productivity"                ></p><p>ChatGPT also cracked the problem as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/chatgpt-solves-maths-problem-on-productivity.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT solves maths problem on productivity"                ></p><p> Moving on, we asked both chatbots to solve<strong>8&#x2F;a-1 &#x3D; 20&#x2F;3a-1</strong> , a fairly straightforward math problem with a surprisingly high failure rate among AI chatbots. ChatGPT was able to solve it, providing a correct answer of<strong>-3</strong> at the first attempt.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/chatgpt-solves-a-math-problem.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT solves a math problem"                ></p><p> Claude AI failed at the first attempt, but when we prompted it to solve the problem step by step (which forces it to think through every step of its logic) it was able to crack it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/claude-ai-solves-a-math-problem-step-by-step.jpg"                      alt="Claude AI solves a math problem step-by-step"                ></p><p> We tried a few more math problems. While both chatbots got it right on the first try in some cases, in several instances, Claude AI needed a second or third attempt to provide the right response. In terms of math skills, we’ll give the crown to ChatGPT.</p><h2 id="ChatGPT-vs-Claude-AI-Creativity"><a href="#ChatGPT-vs-Claude-AI-Creativity" class="headerlink" title="ChatGPT vs. Claude AI: Creativity"></a>ChatGPT vs. Claude AI: Creativity</h2><p> One of Claude AI’s biggest hype is its creative abilities. But can it match ChatGPT’s creativity? Or, could it possibly surpass ChatGPT? To put both chatbots to the test, we tasked them with writing lyrics for a rap song that rhymes.</p><p> We chose a rhyming rap test because it is something a lot of language models struggle with. Most models will typically not get the rhyming right or get the rhyming right while the lyrics itself doesn’t make sense. To make things more interesting, the rap song will be about growing cucumbers.</p><p> So, we asked both ChatGPT and Claude AI to “write a rhyming rap about growing cucumbers as a farmer and becoming a millionaire from it.” ChatGPT went first, and as expected, it produced some exciting lyrics.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/chatgpt-composes-a-rap-lyrics.jpg"                      alt="ChatGPT composes a rap lyrics"                ></p><p> We then fed the same prompt to Claude AI, and it gave it a fair shot as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/claude-ai-composes-a-rap-lyrics.jpg"                      alt="Claude AI composes a rap lyrics"                ></p><p> Both lyrics are good, but ChatGPT seemed to have an edge here. It had better rhyming, and we had the result we needed on the first trial. We had to try three times before Claude AI could produce lyrics that rhymed. We’ll give this one to ChatGPT.</p><p> After trying out a few more creative tasks, Claude AI seemed to excel in writing-related tasks and was able to write more natural-sounding content like a human writer would do. Although<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/creative-ways-to-use-chatgpt-openai/" >ChatGPT was better at overcoming more complex creative tasks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , it sometimes couldn’t shake off that AI chatbot feeling in the text it generated. Our verdict? Both ChatGPT and Claude AI are creative in their own right.</p><h2 id="ChatGPT-vs-Claude-AI-Coding-Skills"><a href="#ChatGPT-vs-Claude-AI-Coding-Skills" class="headerlink" title="ChatGPT vs. Claude AI: Coding Skills"></a>ChatGPT vs. Claude AI: Coding Skills</h2><p> Just like math skills, coding skills are another very important metric for judging the abilities of an AI chatbot. While the majority of users will probably never<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/chatgpt-programming-practical-uses/" >use a chatbot for coding <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , there are significant underlying implications for a chatbot’s abilities to write and understand code proficiently.</p><p> While chatbots are currently sophisticated, they are far from what they could actually become if and when they’re able to write code proficiently. For AI chatbots to truly evolve into powerful AI assistants that can do more than generate text, they need to be able to write code that solves problems on demand. We’ve previously discussed how important coding skills are to AI chatbots in our<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-chatgpt-code-interpreter/" >ChatGPT Code Interpreter explainer. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> ​​​​​​That said, we put both chatbots on two coding tasks. We asked ChatGPT and Claude AI to write functional code for a to-do list app. Starting with ChatGPT, the AI chatbot was able to deliver a functional to-do list app on the first attempt. We copy-pasted and ran it on a browser, and it worked perfectly without errors. Here’s the output on a browser.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/to-do-list-app-by-chatgpt.jpg"                      alt="to-do list app by ChatGPT"                ></p><p> Moving on to Claude AI, the chatbot wrote clearly intelligible code. The structure and logic all seemed fine. Unfortunately, despite repeated attempts, Claude AI kept missing some critical logic to make the code actually run on a browser. It’s a fail on this one.</p><p> After Claude AI failed the last test, we tried a different kind of coding task, one that was more about analyzing code and less about writing new code. We uploaded five PHP files that represent the complete backend for a website and asked both Claude AI and ChatGPT where we would need to edit in all the uploaded files to ensure we get a mail once a new user registers on the site.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/claude-ai-analyzing-multiple-php-files.jpg"                      alt="Claude AI analyzing multiple PHP files"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087409/7443" target="_top" id="2087409">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087409" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087409/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Surprisingly, ChatGPT, despite seemingly having superior coding skills, failed at this despite repeated attempts. Claude AI, on the other hand, was able to analyze the code proficiently while identifying the right places that needed to be edited to achieve the desired results.</p><p> Of course, this was not an isolated case, we repeated it with several other code files, but ChatGPT stumbled and stalled on the majority of cases while Claude AI kept delivering impressive results. In terms of coding skills, the winner is not entirely straightforward.</p><p> ChatGPT is clearly significantly better at writing new code and can manage complex code with impressive proficiency. However, Claude AI is significantly better at analyzing large code bases. So, if you’re looking to write code for some new idea you have, ChatGPT is the tool to turn to. If you want to analyze or make sense of a code base with thousands of lines across several files, then we would definitely recommend Claude AI.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130869/7443" target="_top" id="2130869">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130869" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130869/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Claude-AI-Is-a-Potent-Competitor-on-the-Block"><a href="#Claude-AI-Is-a-Potent-Competitor-on-the-Block" class="headerlink" title="Claude AI Is a Potent Competitor on the Block"></a>Claude AI Is a Potent Competitor on the Block</h2><p> Claude AI represents a potent competition for ChatGPT–one that can compete with and potentially surpass ChatGPT someday.

channel</li><li>No USB ports</li></ul><p> TP-Link has built a reputation for itself recently with some surprisingly affordable Wi-Fi 6 routers, and the Deco X20 is no exception. This small but mighty mesh system represents a way to get into<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/wi-fi-6-802-11-ax-4797345" >Wi-Fi 6 technology <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> without emptying your wallet.</p><p> The X20 is a good choice for users who need broad coverage, with three units handling homes of up to 5,800 square feet. The<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/dual-band-wireless-networking-explained-818279" >dual-band <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> AX1800 Wi-Fi 6 support offers a comfortable 1.8Mbps bandwidth, although this is only partially on par with some of the pricier alternatives in this list.</p><p> But more importantly, the Deco X20 lacks the dedicated backhaul channel on more advanced mesh Wi-Fi systems. This means it may not perform as well on busy and heavily congested home networks — those with a dozen or more devices gaming, video calling, and streaming in 4K—but it should be more than enough for the online needs of smaller families.</p><p> The Deco X20 is a breeze to set up, thanks to TP-Link’s aptly named Deco app, which can help even the most inexperienced home networking users get up and running within a few minutes. It also includes TP-Link’s new HomeCare security suite, powered by Trend Micro. It offers anti-malware features and parental controls to keep your home network safe against intruders and kids away from the internet’s darker corners. Each unit includes two Gigabit Ethernet ports to connect non-wireless devices, but sadly, there aren’t any USB ports for sharing external storage devices.</p><p><strong>Wireless Spec:</strong> 802.11ax |<strong>Security:</strong> HomeCare, WPA3 |<strong>Standard&#x2F;Speed:</strong> AX1800 |<strong>Bands:</strong> Dual-band |<strong>MU-MIMO:</strong> Yes |<strong>Beamforming:</strong> Yes |<strong>Wired Ports:</strong> 2</p><h2 id="Best-Parental-Controls"><a href="#Best-Parental-Controls" class="headerlink" title="Best Parental Controls"></a>Best Parental Controls</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/54445769" >Netgear Orbi Home Wi-Fi System <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/e0pqAK3I9BIPd_HjQl8z5DRaZ-I=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/netgear-orbi-whole-home-wi-fi-system-41457ad2356b431eb21ef92d6fc06f7e.jpg" >Netgear Orbi Whole Home Wi-Fi System <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/54445769" >https://www.walmart.com/ip/54445769 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/54445769" >$225 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Fast and reliable coverage</li><li>Easy to set up</li><li>Highly configurable</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>USB ports don’t support shared storage</li></ul><p> Netgear’s Orbi strikes an almost perfect balance of performance, price, and features among mesh Wi-Fi systems. With only two units, Orbi can provide fast and stable Wi-Fi over an area of up to 5,000 square feet, and this range can be easily extended by adding additional units.</p><p> Netgear promises that Orbi can deliver at least 150Mbps anywhere in your home, which was more than evident in our testing. You’ll enjoy smooth online performance throughout your living space without worrying about buffering<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-stream-netflix-in-4k-1847830" >Netflix 4K UHD <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> streams or stuttering<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-zoom-and-how-does-it-work-4800476" >Zoom calls <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> Orbi accomplishes this by dedicating the fastest of its three Wi-Fi bands as a backhaul channel. Remember that in a mesh network, data to or from your device may pass from one access point to the following multiple times before it reaches your router and moves on to your<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/internet-service-provider-isp-2625924" >Internet Service Provider <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> network. The backhaul channel provides dedicated bandwidth for this pass-through traffic, ensuring you’ll get the same excellent wireless performance whether your devices are closer to the central unit or one of the satellite units.</p><p> This also makes the collection of four Gigabit Ethernet ports found on each unit even more helpful, as you can plug in things like a TV and not see a drop in speed. Each also has a USB 2.0 port for sharing printers around your home. The partnership between Netgear and Circle with Disney offers advanced security and parental controls.</p><p><strong>Wireless Spec:</strong> 802.11ac |<strong>Security:</strong> NETGEAR Armor, WPA2, Guest Wi-Fi Secure Access, Circle with Disney |<strong>Standard&#x2F;Speed:</strong> AC3000 |<strong>Bands:</strong> Tri-band |<strong>MU-MIMO:</strong> Yes |<strong>Beamforming:</strong> Yes |<strong>Wired Ports:</strong> 4</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/8avh1Ze3JbmbKGNMK8KABSk5mCY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/NetgearOrbi-899149c3f879469788d6c8f71f0c885b.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Orbi"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Bill Thomas</p><h2 id="Best-Range"><a href="#Best-Range" class="headerlink" title="Best Range"></a>Best Range</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LN1Z7JK?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB08LN1Z7JK" >Linksys Velop MX12600 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/-dYI3_OihGLEiIYzSq9ZD_Qv5qo=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/linksys-velop-ax4200-tri-band-mesh-wi-fi-6-system-mx12600-eac5daec45984003b0a35fe55eddd1b9.jpg" >Linksys Velop AX4200 Tri-Band Mesh Wi-Fi 6 System (MX12600) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LN1Z7JK?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB08LN1Z7JK" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LN1Z7JK?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB08LN1Z7JK <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LN1Z7JK?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB08LN1Z7JK" >$200 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/101526375" >$364 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HPN52LL/A/linksys-velop-ax4200-wifi-6-mesh-system-3-pack" >$500 at Apple <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Tri-band Wi-Fi 6</li><li>Expansive coverage</li><li>Affordable</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Requires mobile app for initial set up</li><li>Not good for multi-gigabit broadband</li><li>Lacks advanced features</li></ul><p> When getting maximum coverage out of your mesh Wi-Fi system, Linksys’ Velop system will give you the best bang for your buck. The MX 12600 bundle includes three identical Wi-Fi 6 capable AX4200 mesh units (three times 4,200 is 12,600, see?) for less than most other systems charge for only two. This means solid and reliable performance for homes of up to 8,100 square feet at an affordable price.</p><p> You’ll designate one of these units as the primary router that hosts your broadband connection, then place the other two wherever you need the best and strongest coverage in your home. The Velop system also features a “dynamic” backhaul channel: The system intelligently decides which of the three Wi-Fi bands is best suited to move traffic between the mesh stations and which should be available for your Wi-Fi clients.</p><p> Each unit also includes four Gigabit Ethernet ports, letting you hardwire in non-Wi-Fi devices. And thanks to a high-speed USB 3.2 port on the back of each unit, you can connect multiple hard drives or other storage devices for sharing files or even streaming media.</p><p> Linksys’ mobile app also makes the system a cinch to set up, walking you through getting the first unit online and then joining the other two into a single mesh network. Although you’ll need to use the mobile app for the initial configuration, you can manage the system from the more familiar web interface once the mesh has been configured.</p><p> The MX12600 system offers all the basic networking features you’d expect from a modern router, including elementary Quality of Service (QoS) support (which prioritizes devices based on the type of service they’re using. There are rudimentary parental controls, but they should be enough for most typical users.

Since a two-unit system will give you 5,000 square feet of Wi-Fi coverage (which can be expanded by adding up to five more satellite units), you’ll be sure to see consistently fast speeds anywhere in your home.</p><p> Netgear has also packed in four Gigabit Ethernet ports on each station, so you’ll have plenty of room for wiring in devices like game consoles for maximum performance. The main router on this higher-end model also offers a high-speed 2.5Gbps<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/wide-area-network-816383" >Wide Area Network (WAN) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> port to ensure you’re ready for the fastest home broadband connections.</p><p> One disappointing aspect of Netgear’s newer Wi-Fi 6 solution is the omission of the USB ports found in earlier Orbi versions. The lack of advanced configuration settings may also let power users down compared to other Wi-Fi 6 routers. But if you want to maintain the best performance possible, even if it means sacrificing some network management features, this is the mesh system for you.</p><p><strong>Wireless Spec:</strong> 802.11ax |<strong>Security:</strong> WPA3 |<strong>Standard&#x2F;Speed:</strong> AX6000 |<strong>Bands:</strong> Tri-band |<strong>MU-MIMO:</strong> Yes |<strong>Beamforming:</strong> Yes |<strong>Wired Ports:</strong> 4</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/cjLjOjMRWQJm5An87vAXSv1ZALw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/NetgearOrbiAX6000-01f5a284913b44099978b706c3a3fa79.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Orbi AX6000"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Jeremy Laukkonen</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/orbi-whole-home-tri-band-mesh-wi-fi-6-system-review-5069596" >Orbi Whole Home Tri-Band Mesh Wi-Fi 6 System Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983539">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983539.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983539">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983539.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983539%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983539/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-for-Gaming"><a href="#Best-for-Gaming" class="headerlink" title="Best for Gaming"></a>Best for Gaming</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081GH8XRS?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB081GH8XRS" >Asus ZenWiFi XT8 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/u36wLJKd2jTPAgvkVuGxo2A8P4g=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/asus-zenwifi-xt8-ax6600-tri-band-mesh-wi-fi-6-system-3865cd2d845349a78c533b0b397df43b.jpg" >Asus ZenWiFi XT8 AX6600 Tri-Band Mesh Wi-Fi 6 System <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081GH8XRS?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB081GH8XRS" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081GH8XRS?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB081GH8XRS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081GH8XRS?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB081GH8XRS" >$282 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/447452455" >$282 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1541979-REG/asus%5Fxt8%5Fb%5F2%5Fpk%5Fzenwifi%5Fac%5Fwhole%5Fhome%5Ftri%5Fband.html" >$350 at B&amp;H Photo Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Lots of advanced features</li><li>Parental and security controls</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Expensive</li></ul><p> Although Asus’ AiMesh technology will let you join almost any combination of Asus routers to form a mesh network, the company’s ZenWiFi XT8 takes that further.

So, it’s an especially great choice for anyone already invested in the Google ecosystem. You can issue voice commands to control smart appliances, check the weather, send messages, and set up calendar appointments.</p><p> Three units—the central base station and two points—provide up to 5,400 square feet of coverage. Google’s Home and Wi-Fi apps make this an absolute cinch to set up and manage. It even lets you set up a guest network for your friends and other visitors and let them get online simply by<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/scan-qr-codes-on-smartphone-4154658" >scanning a QR code <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> The main downside to Nest Wi-Fi is that the base station includes only one Ethernet LAN port, and you won’t find any at all on the satellite points, so you’ll need to add your<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/ethernet-and-network-hubs-816358" >network hub <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you want to hardwire in some of your devices at the router. And if you need to wire in devices at the points, you’ll want to look elsewhere.</p><p> Additionally, the Nest doesn’t support the newer Wi-Fi 6 standard like some of the other systems here, so if you need maximum performance or are a stickler for future-proofing your network, the Nest may not be the best option.</p><p><strong>Wireless Spec:</strong> 802.11ac |<strong>Security:</strong> WPA3 |<strong>Standard&#x2F;Speed:</strong> AC2200 |<strong>Bands:</strong> Tri-band |<strong>MU-MIMO:</strong> Yes |<strong>Beamforming:</strong> Yes |<strong>Wired Ports:</strong> 2</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/O_4HqL-cj7KOoa_JTrVN--P752o=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/GoogleNestWi-Fi-9704c0e2a822442d89253e49f44d9948.jpg"                      alt="Google Nest Wi-Fi"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andrew Hayward</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/google-nest-wi-fi-review-4846243" >Google Nest Wi-Fi Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://united.elfm.net/c/5597632/2139558/4704" target="_top" id="2139558">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4704-2139558" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://united.elfm.net/i/5597632/2139558/4704"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Best-Design"><a href="#Best-Design" class="headerlink" title="Best Design"></a>Best Design</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N2NLNEH/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB01N2NLNEH" >Linksys Velop AC6600 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/j4p01isOS24wSYnZhkkDN75cgIU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/linksys-velop-ac6600-tri-band-mesh-wi-fi-system-c5531ec228e247eb88bb7d05247c3842.jpg" >Linksys Velop AC6600 Tri-Band Mesh Wi-Fi System <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ](<a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N2NLNEH/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB01N2NLNEH" >https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N2NLNEH/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&amp;ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB01N2NLNEH <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p>PHOTO: Amazon</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N2NLNEH/?tag=lifewire-onsite-prod-20&ascsubtag=4139748%7Cn26c898adea614da9809527309478f9e615%7CB01N2NLNEH" >$170 at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/55384671" >$170 at Walmart <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://www.pcrichard.com/linksys-velop-whole-home-mesh-wi-fi-system-3-pack/WHW0303.html?slpfid=3" >View on Pcrichard.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Strong, consistent connection</li><li>Sleek Design</li><li>Great range</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>Lacks some basic settings</li><li>Some features cost extra</li></ul><p> Linksys’ first whole home Wi-Fi system, the Velop Tri-Band AC6600, is one of the more attractive designs we’ve seen. Each sleek white node is roughly the size of a tower of Jenga blocks, and they look nice enough to sit on display rather than being hidden away. Linksys sells Velop nodes individually or in packs of two or three; each will give you about 2,000 square feet of coverage. So, a complete system can blanket a 6,000-square-foot home.</p><p> The Velop AC6600 system includes tri-band Wi-Fi and dedicates the second 5GHz band as a backhaul channel. This means it can keep traffic moving smoothly between all units for maximum performance throughout your home, even if one is under heavy usage. The downside is that your devices won’t be able to take advantage of the extra 5GHz band, so even though each of these AC2200 routers can theoretically provide 2,134Mbps of throughput, only 1,267Mbps of that total is available to your devices.</p><p> The Velop offers a simplified setup process thanks to the Linksys smartphone app. However, if you like to tinker with your network settings, you’ll probably want to look elsewhere since it has limited configuration options. There’s also no malware protection, and parental controls are confined to blocking websites and manually restricting internet access from specific devices.</p><p><strong>Wireless Spec:</strong> 802.11ac |<strong>Security:</strong> WPA2 |<strong>Standard&#x2F;Speed:</strong> AC6600 |<strong>Bands:</strong> Tri-band |<strong>MU-MIMO:</strong> Yes |<strong>Beamforming:</strong> Yes |<strong>Wired Ports:</strong> 4</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/SkmNvOHzz4u2QHpClMEbMhzcBbQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/LinksysVelopAC6600-2fd0f211926949cd9e38646f533fb981-6b8bc5f3009346dfaee7ef6b86357f34.jpg"                      alt="Linksys Velop AC6600"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/linksys-velop-review-powerful-mesh-router-5072402" >Linksys Velop Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="What-to-Look-For-in-a-Mesh-Wi-Fi-Network"><a href="#What-to-Look-For-in-a-Mesh-Wi-Fi-Network" class="headerlink" title="What to Look For in a Mesh Wi-Fi Network"></a>What to Look For in a Mesh Wi-Fi Network</h2><p> Every wireless router, no matter how many antennas it has or how powerful it is, suffers from the same issue: radio signals weaken when they pass through walls, floors, and other obstructions. Mesh Wi-Fi network systems are designed to solve this problem by placing a number of nodes throughout your home or business, creating a uniformly strong signal with no dead spots.</p><p> Unlike traditional routers with wireless extenders and access points, mesh systems are designed from the ground up to work as a node-based system. Setting up a mesh Wi-Fi network system is typically a lot easier than connecting range extenders to an existing system, and they automatically pass your connection from one node to the next as you move around your home.</p><p> The main drawback of mesh Wi-Fi network systems is the price, as they tend to be more expensive than traditional routers. You can typically buy a nice router and some extenders for less than a mesh Wi-Fi starter kit, but if your situation really calls for a mesh system, it’s well worth the additional investment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/dFk9VbnycX8txbFO35hsBW2ZGvg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/4038590-2_1-5c8fbca346e0fb000172f07e.jpg"                      alt="Netgear Orbi"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135373/19272" target="_top" id="2135373">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135373" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="392" height="72"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135373/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Lifewire</p><h3 id="Smart-Home-Integration-Which-System-Do-You-Use"><a href="#Smart-Home-Integration-Which-System-Do-You-Use" class="headerlink" title="Smart Home Integration: Which System Do You Use?"></a>Smart Home Integration: Which System Do You Use?</h3><p> Most mesh Wi-Fi network systems support a single<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/introduction-to-connected-home-817684" >smart home <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> integration system, and a few support more than one.<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-alexa-voice-assistant-4152107" >Alexa <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the most commonly supported, with integration from manufacturers like Eero, Linksys, Netgear, and more. Philips Hue,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-ifttt-4172417" >IFTTT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and others see less integration.</p><p> If you already have some smart devices in your home, and you’re already tied into either the Alexa or<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-google-home-and-how-does-it-work-4801919" >Google Home <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ecosystem, then that should inform your decision regarding which mesh Wi-Fi network system to choose, but keep in mind that you don’t technically need your router to support your smart home assistant unless you need to be able to control its features with voice commands, such as enabling your guest network or blocking access to your kids’ devices.</p><p> If you’re an Apple HomeKit user, then the iPhone maker has taken a different approach. You won’t find any routers that can be controlled via Siri, however, a few mesh systems are adding HomeKit-specific security features to keep your smart home devices protected from network intrusions, which is something that neither Google Home nor Amazon Alexa yet offers.</p><h3 id="Security-and-Parental-Controls-Check-For-Hidden-Costs"><a href="#Security-and-Parental-Controls-Check-For-Hidden-Costs" class="headerlink" title="Security and Parental Controls: Check For Hidden Costs"></a>Security and Parental Controls: Check For Hidden Costs</h3><p> Since mesh systems are high-end equipment, they typically include robust security options and parental controls. There are a handful of systems that don’t include either, so look for those if you don’t have kids and prefer to manage security on individual devices.</p><p> The most important thing to check in this area is whether or not the security and parental controls of the mesh system you’re interested in require a subscription. Basic security options are often free, but the best-advanced protections and parental controls often come at the cost of an ongoing monthly subscription, so make sure to take that into account.  </p><p> FAQ</p><ul><li>What’s the difference between a mesh Wi-Fi system and a Wi-Fi extender?<br> Mesh Wi-Fi systems and Wi-Fi extenders extend the reach of your wireless signal beyond your main router’s range. Mesh Wi-Fi systems are more tightly integrated, with the main and satellite devices expressly designed to work in concert.</li><li>Are mesh Wi-Fi systems faster?<br> Technically speaking, a mesh Wi-Fi system won’t offer better performance than an equivalent standalone router when you’re sitting right beside it. Since speed always falls off due to a weaker signal as you move farther away from your router, mesh systems can make a difference in larger homes.</li><li>Do you need to replace your existing router?<br> In most cases, the answer is yes. Although some mesh Wi-Fi systems can work with existing routers, you’ll generally get better performance and a much better user experience if you use a full mesh Wi-Fi system. If you’re a cable internet subscriber, you’ll still need to hang onto your cable modem.</li><li>How fast is a mesh Wi-Fi system?<br> Since mesh Wi-Fi network systems are uniformly high-end, they are also pretty fast. If your home internet connection isn’t very fast, then there isn’t any benefit to choosing a speedier mesh system over a slower one. You can check your internet connection speed with<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/internet-speed-test-sites-2626177" >free speed tests <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you aren’t sure what it is.</li></ul><p>Was this page helpful?</p><p>Thanks for letting us know!</p><p> Get the Latest Tech News Delivered Every Day</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/#" >Subscribe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Tell us why!</p><p> Other  Not enough details  Hard to understand</p><p> Submit</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-secrets-to-high-quality-sims-4-gameplay-recordings/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Secrets to High-Quality Sims 4 Gameplay Recordings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-win11-elite-screen-recording-software/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Win11 Elite Screen Recording Software</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discover-alternatives.techidaily.com/comment-utiliser-handbrake-sans-cuda-pour-accelerer-vos-projets-de-traitement-video/"><u>Comment Utiliser Handbrake Sans CUDA Pour Accélérer Vos Projets De Traitement Vidéo ?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-renaissance.techidaily.com/common-causes-and-fixes-for-apple-watch-touchscreen-problems/"><u>Common Causes and Fixes for Apple Watch Touchscreen Problems</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-revival.techidaily.com/1722201609786-cut-the-red-tape-speak-to-chatgpt/"><u>Cut the Red Tape – Speak to ChatGPT</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/how-to-break-dvd-copy-restrictions-explore-eight-effective-strategies-and-zero-cost-solutions/"><u>How to Break DVD Copy Restrictions: Explore Eight Effective Strategies and Zero Cost Solutions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-enable-usb-debugging-on-a-locked-vivo-y27-4g-phone-by-drfone-android/"><u>How To Enable USB Debugging on a Locked Vivo Y27 4G Phone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-apple-iphone-13-mini-passcode-without-computer-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Unlock Apple iPhone 13 mini Passcode without Computer? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-marvelous.techidaily.com/ipad-pro-vs-surface-pro-showdown-key-features-and-benefits-unveiled/"><u>IPad Pro Vs.

There are multiple cool templates available on the internet that could be used. You can also make your own stunning yet customized glitch effect Photoshop. If this has impressed you, then stay here because we will talk a lot about glitch photo editors.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">Part 1. How Do You Do Photo Glitch Effect in Photoshop?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">Part 2. 5 Awesome Glitch Effect Photoshop Actions.</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-Do-You-Do-Photo-Glitch-Effect-in-Photoshop"><a href="#Part-1-How-Do-You-Do-Photo-Glitch-Effect-in-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How Do You Do Photo Glitch Effect in Photoshop?"></a>Part 1. How Do You Do Photo Glitch Effect in Photoshop?</h2><p>The jagged lines, the colorful pixels, frozen visuals, and also the distorted colors, everything perfectly blends to make a glitch effect. Usually, this is how all the glitch templates are, but if you get an opportunity to customize your image glitch effect and make your special effect, what will you do?</p><p>The best option to adopt in any such circumstances is Photoshop. With Photoshop, you can create a stunning and mind-blowing Photoshop VHS effect. If you want to learn about its steps, then continue reading.</p><p>Step 1: The process starts by importing the image to Photoshop on which you plan to add the photo glitch effect. Then you should always convert the image from colorful to black and white. This could be done quickly by going into the ‘Image’ menu from the menu bar. Next, go for the ‘Adjustments’ option and select ‘Desaturate.’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/stunning-glitch-effect-photoshop-1.jpg"                      alt="tap on desaturate option"                ></p><p>Step 2: Now duplicate the image by dragging it onto the New Layer icon in the Layers Panel. Then double click on the duplicated image. This will open a ‘Layer Style’ settings menu. Here, click on the icon for ‘R Channel’ and deselect it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/stunning-glitch-effect-photoshop-2.jpg"                      alt="disable channel r"                ></p><p>Step 3: Now, it’s time to add the first glitch element. For that, hold the ‘Shift’ key and move the image by using the left&#x2F;right cursor keys on the keyboard. This will offset the image layer from the original.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/stunning-glitch-effect-photoshop-3.jpg"                      alt="add first glitch element"                ></p><p>Step 4: You can now select the ‘Mark’ tool from the left side. Make a rectangle anywhere on the image with the Mark tool and then switch back to the ‘Move’ tool. Then again, nudge the rectangular portion left or right to offset it. You can repeat this process multiple times on different areas of the image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/stunning-glitch-effect-photoshop-4.jpg"                      alt="use mark and move tool"                ></p><p>Step 5: At this point, make a New Layer and fill it with White. Now right-click on this white layer and select the option of ‘Convert to Smart Object.’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/stunning-glitch-effect-photoshop-5.jpg"                      alt="tap on the option of convert to smart object"                ></p><p>Step 6: Move to the menu bar at the top and go to the ‘Filter’ section. From there, select the option of ‘Filter Gallery.’ A new window will show up. Head to the ‘Sketch’ category, and there change the ‘Pattern Type’ to ‘Line.’ You can also play with the ‘Contrast’ and the ‘Size’ of the lines.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/stunning-glitch-effect-photoshop-6.jpg"                      alt="change the pattern"                ></p><p>Step 7: Now, in the ‘Layers Panel,’ select the option of ‘Overlay’ from the dropdown menu so that the different layers can show through. You can adjust the visibility of the lines by adjusting the number on the scale.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/stunning-glitch-effect-photoshop-7.jpg"                      alt="tap on overlay"                ></p><p>Step 8: After setting everything for the glitch effect in your image, you can now add colors using the ‘Gradient Map.’ Or you can also import some graphic textures to Photoshop and add them to the image. Don’t forget to change the ‘Binding Mode’ to ‘Overlay.’ You can then play with the color and graphic settings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/stunning-glitch-effect-photoshop-8.jpg"                      alt="change the binding mode"                ></p><p>Step 9: Once all the color adjustments have satisfied you, it’s time to add some text to your glitch image. For that, head to the ‘Text’ tool from the left menu and type in your text. Edit it as you did to your image so that you can make a cool glitch text effect Photoshop and with this, you are all done with making the most stunning glitch effect Photoshop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/stunning-glitch-effect-photoshop-9.jpg"                      alt="customize your glitch effect"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-5-Awesome-Glitch-Effect-Photoshop-Actions"><a href="#Part-2-5-Awesome-Glitch-Effect-Photoshop-Actions" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 5 Awesome Glitch Effect Photoshop Actions"></a>Part 2. 5 Awesome Glitch Effect Photoshop Actions</h2><p>With Photoshop, you can create your photo glitch effect as you prefer instead of using the available standard templates.

The AtomMan G7 Pt, however, is somewhere in-between as a Mini PC featuring mobile processors. For the rest of the specs check out the table below.</p><p> Swipe to scroll horizontally</p><table><thead><tr><th>Processor</th><th>AMD Ryzen 9 7945HX Processor, 16C&#x2F;32T (64M Cache, up to 5.4 GHz)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>GPU</td><td>AMD Radeon RX 7600M XT (GDDR6 8G)</td></tr><tr><td>Memory</td><td>DDR5-5200 Dual channel (SODIMM Slots×2, Max 96GB)</td></tr><tr><td>Storage</td><td>M.2 2280 PCIe5.0 SSD ×1</td></tr><tr><td>Storage Expansion</td><td>M.2 2280 PCIe4.0 SSD ×1</td></tr><tr><td>Wireless Connectivity</td><td>M.2 2230 Wi-Fi support (Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4)</td></tr><tr><td>Video Output</td><td>HDMI 2.1 ×1；DisplayPort 2.0 ×1；USB-C ×1</td></tr><tr><td>Audio Output</td><td>HDMI 2.1 ×1；DisplayPort 2.0 ×1；3.5mm Combo Jack ×1；Line out ×1</td></tr><tr><td>Peripherals Interface</td><td>RJ45 2.5G Ethernet Port×1 USB 3.2 Gen2 Type-A Port ×1(In Front) USB 3.2 Gen2 Type-A Port ×3(In Back) USB 3.2 Gen2 Type-C Port ×1(In Front, Data Only) USB 3.2 Gen2 Type-C Port ×1(In Back, Alt Data and DP) HDMI ×1 DisplayPort ×1 3.5mm Combo Jack ×1 Line out ×1 Mic in ×1 Clear CMOS ×1</td></tr><tr><td>Power</td><td>DC 19V (adapter included)</td></tr><tr><td>System</td><td>Windows 11</td></tr></tbody></table><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BCXcTW8u5XFwpHJ2k5ueD6-320-80.jpg"                      alt="Minisforum AtomMan G7 Pt"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Minisforum)</p><p> The AMD Dragon Range CPU and RX7600M XT may not be the newest or most powerful AMD combo a PC maker could assemble in mid-2024. Nevertheless, they should do a pretty good job delivering a capable mini gaming system experience, as long as user ambitions for higher resolutions (like 4K) and raytracing are kept in check.</p><p> Another thing that needs to be carefully kept in check in a mini system is cooling. Minisforum touts the capabilities of its Cold Wave Ultra cooling system, which uses “a vertical single heat pipe with dual air inlets in series and dual-sided quad fans.” Complementing the processor cooling, it has also fitted “an enhanced DDR&#x2F;SSD active cooler and dual liquid metal 8-heat pipe separated link.” The firm claims the cooling fitted into the AtomMan G7 Pt can cope with up to 205W, without fan noise breaching 45dB.</p><p> LATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware Tom’s Hardware</p><p> Other aspects of the interior specs worth commenting on are the device’s easy upgrades with twin DDR5-5200 SODOMM slots for up to 96GB RAM. Also, it has two M.2 storage slots (PCIe5.0 and PCIe4.0), and a socketed wireless card.</p><p> Connectivity seems pretty good for such a small box. As well as Wi-Fi 7 there is a 2.5G Ethernet port, and you can connect up to three 4K monitors at once (HDMI, DP, and USB-C). Six USB ports are available in total, with all being USB 3.2 Gen2 rated.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5vH5yUKbtEt5tHuJMtPYk5-320-80.jpg"                      alt="Minisforum AtomMan G7 Pt"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Minisforum)</p><p> One of the bigger changes we have seen added to the AtomMan G7 Pt since its name was switched from the HX200G is the provision of dual RGB backlighting panels. The example logo scrawl provides a prime example of beauty being in the eye of the beholder.</p><h2 id="Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter"><a href="#Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter" class="headerlink" title="Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter"></a>Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter</h2><p> Get Tom’s Hardware’s best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p><p> Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands  Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors</p><p> By submitting your information you agree to the<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/terms-conditions/" >Terms &amp; Conditions <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/privacy-policy/" >Privacy Policy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and are aged 16 or over.</p><p> Pricing for the AtomMan G7 Pt hasn’t been divulged, though we have written back to Minisforum for some pricing details.

This tiny PC weighs just 2.6 kg and comes in a 2.5-liter chassis that measures 270 x 180 x 50mm. Even though it has a diminutive form factor, you won’t miss out on performance as it comes with either an Intel Core Ultra 7 155H or a Core Ultra 9 185H. Both models also have a discrete GPU — an RTX 4060 for the Ultra 7 and RTX 4070 for the Ultra 9.</p><p> Intel left the mini-PC business in July 2023, licensing its<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/nuc-is-now-officially-part-of-the-asus-product-lineup" >NUC brand <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to Asus and allowing it to continue the line of tiny computers.

Asus even says that you have the option to create your own logo, although there’s no indication yet of how to do that.</p><p> LATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware Tom’s Hardware</p><p> Although the ROG NUC is a tiny computer, it can accommodate up to four 4K displays via the HDMI, DisplayPort, and USB4 ports.

If you use PowerPoint for Windows and are a subscription to Microsoft 365, you have access to that function! There is a lot going on in some Microsoft PowerPoint presentations. It may include a lot of little details or significant information like PowerPoint slide zoom, and altering it would be impractical. If this occurs, you may make a zoom shape and utilize the expand animation to focus on the information you’re describing in more depth. By doing this, you can maintain the overall picture while concentrating on the key points of the talk.</p><p>You are giving a presentation at a meeting and have a number of possibilities. Zoom in PowerPoint Presentation enables you to create an introduction slide that includes thumbnails for the slides you wish to skip to in any order to discuss those choices throughout your meeting. It builds a navigable interactive dashboard for your presentation. When you leave the opening slide and go through all the slides in a part, you are immediately returned to the beginning. So where does PowerPoint’s magic reside? PowerPoint The most recent addition to the lengthy and ever-expanding list of new functions is Zoom. Zoom is incredible since it effectively turns a slide or many slides from your project into a changeable hotspot. A hotspot is a clickable item that connects to a certain area, in case you forgot.
