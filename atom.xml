Photographers are becoming more daring with their creations thanks to the advancement in editing software. For example, after effects green screen keying allows you to alter your image’s background during post-production.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/green-screen-key-1.jpg"                      alt="green screen key"                ></p><p>The following is all you need to know about the green screen key effect and how to apply it using different video editing software. In addition, you will discover why the effect is popular with video editors. Keep reading to find out more.</p><h2 id="Part1-What-is-keying-in-green-screen"><a href="#Part1-What-is-keying-in-green-screen" class="headerlink" title="Part1: What is keying in green screen?"></a>Part1: What is keying in green screen?</h2><p>Keying refers to a post-production process of separating and isolating an image’s aspects using color or brightness. Typically, filmmakers use it to remove green screens and make color corrections to add warmth to the subjects’ skin tones.</p><p>It involves identifying a color or brightness value that you will make transparent in the photo. In addition, you can use two types of keys during the keying process.</p><h3 id="Chroma-Keys"><a href="#Chroma-Keys" class="headerlink" title="Chroma Keys"></a>Chroma Keys</h3><p>These allow you to select a specific color in your image and make everything that features the color transparent. Typically, chrome keys are best for images and videos featuring lots of green or blue backgrounds.</p><h3 id="Luma-Keys"><a href="#Luma-Keys" class="headerlink" title="Luma Keys"></a>Luma Keys</h3><p>Alternatively, you can use luma keys to determine which backgrounds will be transparent according to the brightness level. In addition, you can use them to designate the backgrounds you want opaque in your final image.</p><p>So, why do filmmakers prefer using a green screen? First, green is not a natural color in human skin tones. As such, it allows you more creative freedom with your shots. In addition, most digital cameras feature more green photosites allowing you to capture more details in your shots and making it the default choice for filmmakers.</p><p>However, you can also use a blue screen for your shots if green is your subject’s main color scheme. This is because blue is also rare among human subjects and allows you greater flexibility than any other background alternative.</p><p>Using a green screen key is an important skill to learn as a filmmaker. This is because it allows you more creative freedom resulting in more iconic images and photos. Although most video editing software allows you to apply the effect easily, it still requires finesse.</p><p>For example, using after effects green screen keying incorrectly can result in spill issues. This is when the green light from your screen bounces back to your subject. As such, you lose some subject detail, and the image appears messy.</p><p>Furthermore, not all video editing software includes the green screen key tool. Therefore, always check your software details before purchasing a copy. The next section contains step-by-step guides on performing green screen keying on some of the industry’s most popular software.</p><h2 id="Part2-How-to-do-Green-Screen-Keying-in-After-Effects"><a href="#Part2-How-to-do-Green-Screen-Keying-in-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Part2: How to do Green Screen Keying in After Effects?"></a>Part2: How to do Green Screen Keying in After Effects?</h2><p>Adobe After Effects green screen keying tool is arguably one of the top favorites for filmmakers. It features a user-friendly interface, and several keying presets you can use to achieve incredible photo finishes. For example, the Keylight effect is an Academy Award-winning preset you can use to apply professional-quality color keying.</p><p>Follow these steps to do green screen keying using Adobe After Effects.</p><h3 id="1-Upload-your-footage-to-Adobe-After-Effects"><a href="#1-Upload-your-footage-to-Adobe-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="1. Upload your footage to Adobe After Effects"></a>1. Upload your footage to Adobe After Effects</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/green-screen-key-2.jpg"                      alt="upload footage to adobe"                ></p><p>Launch the program from your macOS or Windows device, and click on the <strong>New Composition From Footage</strong> option. A pop-up window with your file locations will appear and click on the footage you want to import. Ensure the footage you use is shot using a green screen background to achieve the best results.</p><h3 id="2-Using-the-green-screen-key-presets"><a href="#2-Using-the-green-screen-key-presets" class="headerlink" title="2.

Once the panel opens, tap <strong>Animation Presets</strong> and highlight the <strong>Keylight + Key Cleaner + Advanced Spill Suppressor</strong> preset from the <strong>Image-Utilities</strong> menu.</p><h3 id="3-Drag-and-drop-the-preset-to-your-footage"><a href="#3-Drag-and-drop-the-preset-to-your-footage" class="headerlink" title="3. Drag and drop the preset to your footage"></a>3. Drag and drop the preset to your footage</h3><p>Then drag and drop the effect to your uploaded footage to begin the keying process. The green screen key preset applies three effects to your image:</p><ul><li><strong>Keylight effect.</strong></li></ul><p>The effect allows you to select the background color you want to make transparent. First, select the green screen background by clicking on <strong>Screen Color</strong> and selecting <strong>Color Picker</strong>. Then apply the effect by clicking on the green background closest to your subject.</p><ul><li><strong>Key cleaner effect.</strong></li></ul><p>The key cleaner effect sharpens your subject’s edges for a more detailed finish. In addition, you will rarely adjust its values because it automatically corresponds to the changes you make using the Keylight effect. However, you can adjust the <strong>Additional Edge Radius</strong> and <strong>Reduce Chatter</strong> options to decrease the visible noise of your image. Furthermore, you can use the <strong>Alpha Contrast</strong> adjustment to increase the sharpness of your subject’s edges.</p><ul><li><strong>Advanced spill suppressor.</strong></li></ul><p>Sometimes your green screen background can spill to your subject’s edges resulting in a messy outline. For example, you may find a green outline on your subject’s hair or clothing. The <strong>Advanced Spill Suppressor</strong> eliminates these outlines automatically. You can enable the effect by clicking the check box next to the effect from the <strong>Animation Presets</strong> panel.</p><h3 id="4-Apply-a-new-background"><a href="#4-Apply-a-new-background" class="headerlink" title="4.

To master color grading, you must practice constantly, one of the reasons for the existence of specialists in this field. While everybody can color grade, not everyone can do it well. People in this business have devised remedies to make the editing workflow considerably more accessible and less time-consuming.</p><p>Achieving a specific ambiance in a scene demands ongoing effort and naturally takes longer. LUTs, or Lookup Tables, were created as a result. LUTs are ideal for storing a set of colors to use later or in another program. A LUT is the most effective technique to color or alters your image’s colors.</p><h2 id="Benefits-of-using-LUTs"><a href="#Benefits-of-using-LUTs" class="headerlink" title="Benefits of using LUTs"></a>Benefits of using LUTs</h2><p>There are numerous advantages to using lookup tables to edit your footage. We’ve already discussed that it helps to give your films a more polished and professional appearance, which is one of the primary explanations why individuals use LUTs, but there are many more.</p><h3 id="1-A-beginning-towards-professionalism"><a href="#1-A-beginning-towards-professionalism" class="headerlink" title="1. A beginning towards professionalism"></a>1. A beginning towards professionalism</h3><p>This is a fantastic approach for beginners to have a good idea of how to build their own trademark looks in their videos. The time it takes to develop your color grading craft is unavoidable. So, as a novice, LUTs will come in useful for you to establish your approach and save your ass, big time.</p><p>You’ll eventually come up with a blend of your own LUTs to use, resulting in your own LUT. Not only will LUTs aid in color grading learning, but they will also save funds and resources. You will not only devote time to learning color grading, but you will also spend a significant amount of money on color grading tools and equipment, such as software and color panels. You’ll see why color grading equipment is necessary when you get to this point.</p><p>However, for the time being, employing LUTs is the most cost-effective way to obtain a cinematic look.</p><h3 id="2-It-saves-your-time"><a href="#2-It-saves-your-time" class="headerlink" title="2. It saves your time"></a>2. It saves your time</h3><p>Because LUTs are predefined colors used to establish a specific look on a picture, they save you time. Having a trustworthy LUT to use for video will save the life of freelance editors who are constantly meeting commitments and modifications. Isn’t the purpose of color grading to generate a visual emotion for your movie? So, with LUTs, you can create one without going through the time-consuming process of manual color correction. Only one-color preset will be applied to all scenes in a single LUT.</p><p>However, there’s a good probability that it won’t look the same in all of the images. This is where you’ll adjust the colors to make them more evenly match the film. It’s nothing significant most of the time, just some little saturation adjustments, etc.</p><h3 id="3-Work-on-a-budget"><a href="#3-Work-on-a-budget" class="headerlink" title="3. Work on a budget"></a>3. Work on a budget</h3><p>Time spent in a color-grade suite may be highly costly, and it can lead your films to go over budget in order to achieve a specific aesthetic. LUTs, on the other hand, are available for free online or for a fee for more complex versions. Even if you buy your LUTs, you could save thousands of dollars based on the size of your film. LUTs can also assist you in meeting tight deadlines, and setting targets too optimistically is something I’m sure we’ve all done at some point.</p><p>Whether it’s a client or a personal project, things can often get pushed to the last minute, so having something in your arsenal that can save you time is always a good bonus. There are, however, projects where you need to appear competent without investing a lot of time on them due to budget limits; this is where a lookup table comes in handy because you can modify the complete style of your movie in a matter of seconds by pressing a few buttons. Even complicated editing can be completed quickly, giving you more time to work on other tasks that will earn you more money.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135406/19272" target="_top" id="2135406">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135406" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135406/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-It-provides-an-artistic-approach"><a href="#4-It-provides-an-artistic-approach" class="headerlink" title="4.

Even people passionate about their cameras and visual art enthusiasts know it. If you are a newbie, Let us make it easy for you. This article will talk about the vertical phone aspect ratio ratio, its definition, types, iPhone vertical video dimensions, etc. We’ll also provide you solid tips on mobile vertical video size and how to create phone vertical videos easily. Let’s jump into the topic and see what you can learn.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [What is Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical?](#Part 1)</p><p>02 [Types of Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical](#Part 2)</p><p>03 [Tips to Create Phone Vertical Videos](#Part 3)</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Phone-Aspect-Ratio-Vertical"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Phone-Aspect-Ratio-Vertical" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical?"></a>Part 1 What is Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical?</h2><p>The vertical phone aspect ratio is the “proportional” relationship between the screen’s width and height. For example, if your image or video has an aspect ratio of 4:5, it simply means the width of the screen (photo or video) is four times the height of the image.</p><p>The vertical phone aspect ratio is the “proportional” relationship between the screen’s width and height. For example, if your image or video has an aspect ratio of 4:5, it simply means the width of the screen (photo or video) is four times the height of the image.</p><p>Back in the television days, you might have seen certain old pictures with black padding on either side of the screen. It was just that they were shot in different aspect ratios and your television screen had different aspect ratios.</p><h3 id="Aspect-Ratio-Vs-Resolution"><a href="#Aspect-Ratio-Vs-Resolution" class="headerlink" title="Aspect Ratio Vs Resolution"></a>Aspect Ratio Vs Resolution</h3><p>Remember that aspect ratio does not refer to the physical size of an image or its dimensions in pixels (resolution). So aspect ratio 3:1 does not refer to the actual width and height of the image or video; it just describes their relationship.</p><p>You are wrong if you think aspect ratio is just another fancy name for resolution. Think again. Check out how it is calculated.</p><p>“</p><p>| |  Aspect Ratio | Resolution                                                     |                                                                                    |<br>| ————— | ————————————————————– | ———————————————————————————- |<br>| Definition      | The Ratio of the width of an image to the height of the image. | Total number of pixels displayed on your screen (computer, cell phone, television) |<br>| Commonly Used   | ● 1:1 ● 3:1 ● 3:2 ● 4:3 ● 5:4 ● 9:1 ● 16:9                     | ● 640x480 ● 800x600 ● 1024x768                                                     |</p><h3 id="Aspect-Ratio-Calculator"><a href="#Aspect-Ratio-Calculator" class="headerlink" title="Aspect Ratio Calculator"></a>Aspect Ratio Calculator</h3><p>To get the resolution, you need to multiply width times the height. To get aspect ratio, the formula is: Divide the width by the height or simply divide the long side by the short side.</p><p>There are multiple online aspect ratio calculators available. Check out the value for both the images and the videos generated through the photo ratio calculator for your ease.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Common Aspect Ratio</th><th>AR Width</th><th>AR Height</th><th>Image Width</th><th>Image Height</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1:1(square)</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1920</td><td>1920</td></tr><tr><td>5:4 (large and medium format cameras)</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>1920</td><td>1536</td></tr><tr><td>4:3 Standard</td><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>1920</td><td>1440</td></tr><tr><td>3:2 (35mm camera)</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1920</td><td>1280</td></tr><tr><td>16:9</td><td>16</td><td>9</td><td>1920</td><td>1080</td></tr><tr><td>3:1 Panoramic</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>1920</td><td>640</td></tr><tr><td>9:16</td><td>9</td><td>16</td><td>1080</td><td>1920</td></tr></tbody></table><p>For example, the aspect ratio of 3:1 may be an image of 3m wide and 1m high. At the same time it can be 3 feet wide and 1 foot high. For further simplification, consider dimensions in pixels: a 6000×4000 image has 3:2 aspect ratios.</p><p>Always remember this small but crucial point. The aspect ratio refers to the image or video you captured or recorded and the display (or screen) in which your video or image would be displayed.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144298/7443" target="_top" id="2144298">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144298" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144298/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Why-is-the-aspect-ratio-important"><a href="#Why-is-the-aspect-ratio-important" class="headerlink" title="Why is the aspect ratio important?"></a>Why is the aspect ratio important?</h3><p>In the age of web content, asking why aspect ratio is important? Some may consider it naïve. Images need to be uploaded at different aspect ratios for different uses (desktop vs. mobile or blog vs. social media). Incorrect aspect ratio affects your final image and end-user experience.</p><p>Choice of the wrong aspect ratio can eliminate the potential for editing (cropping and resizing). In addition, using the correct aspect ratios saves you from facing the trouble of distortion or clipping.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Types-of-Phone-Aspect-Ratio-Vertical"><a href="#Part-2-Types-of-Phone-Aspect-Ratio-Vertical" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Types of Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical"></a>Part 2 Types of Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134248/18498" target="_top" id="2134248">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134248" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134248/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Image-Aspect-Ratios"><a href="#Image-Aspect-Ratios" class="headerlink" title="Image Aspect Ratios"></a>Image Aspect Ratios</h3><p>The aspect ratio decides and changes the entire composition and how the audience perceives the image.

But the digital revolution has changed that. Now from unforgivable sin, the vewayal mode has practically become a mainstream media sensation. Vertical style has now become the dominant format.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-7.png"                      alt="phone aspect ratio"                ></p><p>Phone aspect ratio vertical simply means taller screen than wider. The most common type is 9:16 (1080x1920 pixels), a typical vertical videos aspect ratio. Although this phone aspect ratio vertical comes in a few more shapes and sizes such as 4:5, 2:3.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Tips-to-Create-Phone-Vertical-Videos"><a href="#Part-3-Tips-to-Create-Phone-Vertical-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Tips to Create Phone Vertical Videos"></a>Part 3 Tips to Create Phone Vertical Videos</h2><p>Creating vertical videos is crucial for getting engagements and growing your brand. It is easy with a phone because most smartphones, by default, record in 9:16, which is the standard vertical aspect ratio. But with a camera, you have to manually edit to the correct aspect ratio before you shoot it.</p><p>You can also shoot horizontally and then change it to vertical, but it needs professional videographer expertise.</p><p>Who wants to rotate their phones watching videos? Well, as far as the trend, Let us see some tiny but handy tips for creating vertical phone videos.</p><h3 id="1-Choose-the-correct-aspect-ratio"><a href="#1-Choose-the-correct-aspect-ratio" class="headerlink" title="1. Choose the correct aspect ratio"></a>1. Choose the correct aspect ratio</h3><p>Video taller than the 1:1 aspect ratio is commonly considered Vertical video. Types of these vertical aspects ratio include 4:5 (social), 2:3 and 9:16. They are all taller than they are wide, thus vertical.</p><p>Choosing the correct aspect ratio for your vertical video, always think about why and where you intend to use the video. The second important thing you should consider is your plans for editing that video.</p><p>Cropping horizontal can be irritating and sometimes disappointing at the same time. Producing a 9:16 vertical frame at HD resolution from a horizontal HD frame may result in very pixelated and low-quality footage.</p><p>If, for some reason, you still want first to shoot it horizontal and then change it back to mobile vertical video size. You may need to shoot in 4K horizontally to get extra pixels to work with. It can later be cropped in the sides to 9:16 (Vertical phone aspect ratio). Plus, you won’t need to scale it anymore.</p><h3 id="2-Direct-your-viewer’s-eyes"><a href="#2-Direct-your-viewer’s-eyes" class="headerlink" title="2. Direct your viewer’s eyes"></a>2. Direct your viewer’s eyes</h3><p>For hooking social media viewers, you need to put your most interesting visual upfront. These include GIFs, colourful stop-motion or looping animation.

How Do You Do Photo Glitch Effect in Photoshop?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">Part 2. 5 Awesome Glitch Effect Photoshop Actions.</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-Do-You-Do-Photo-Glitch-Effect-in-Photoshop"><a href="#Part-1-How-Do-You-Do-Photo-Glitch-Effect-in-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How Do You Do Photo Glitch Effect in Photoshop?"></a>Part 1. How Do You Do Photo Glitch Effect in Photoshop?</h2><p>The jagged lines, the colorful pixels, frozen visuals, and also the distorted colors, everything perfectly blends to make a glitch effect. Usually, this is how all the glitch templates are, but if you get an opportunity to customize your image glitch effect and make your special effect, what will you do?</p><p>The best option to adopt in any such circumstances is Photoshop. With Photoshop, you can create a stunning and mind-blowing Photoshop VHS effect. If you want to learn about its steps, then continue reading.</p><p>Step 1: The process starts by importing the image to Photoshop on which you plan to add the photo glitch effect. Then you should always convert the image from colorful to black and white. This could be done quickly by going into the ‘Image’ menu from the menu bar. Next, go for the ‘Adjustments’ option and select ‘Desaturate.’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/stunning-glitch-effect-photoshop-1.jpg"                      alt="tap on desaturate option"                ></p><p>Step 2: Now duplicate the image by dragging it onto the New Layer icon in the Layers Panel. Then double click on the duplicated image. This will open a ‘Layer Style’ settings menu. Here, click on the icon for ‘R Channel’ and deselect it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/stunning-glitch-effect-photoshop-2.jpg"                      alt="disable channel r"                ></p><p>Step 3: Now, it’s time to add the first glitch element. For that, hold the ‘Shift’ key and move the image by using the left&#x2F;right cursor keys on the keyboard. This will offset the image layer from the original.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/stunning-glitch-effect-photoshop-3.jpg"                      alt="add first glitch element"                ></p><p>Step 4: You can now select the ‘Mark’ tool from the left side. Make a rectangle anywhere on the image with the Mark tool and then switch back to the ‘Move’ tool. Then again, nudge the rectangular portion left or right to offset it. You can repeat this process multiple times on different areas of the image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/stunning-glitch-effect-photoshop-4.jpg"                      alt="use mark and move tool"                ></p><p>Step 5: At this point, make a New Layer and fill it with White. Now right-click on this white layer and select the option of ‘Convert to Smart Object.’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/stunning-glitch-effect-photoshop-5.jpg"                      alt="tap on the option of convert to smart object"                ></p><p>Step 6: Move to the menu bar at the top and go to the ‘Filter’ section. From there, select the option of ‘Filter Gallery.’ A new window will show up. Head to the ‘Sketch’ category, and there change the ‘Pattern Type’ to ‘Line.’ You can also play with the ‘Contrast’ and the ‘Size’ of the lines.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/stunning-glitch-effect-photoshop-6.jpg"                      alt="change the pattern"                ></p><p>Step 7: Now, in the ‘Layers Panel,’ select the option of ‘Overlay’ from the dropdown menu so that the different layers can show through. You can adjust the visibility of the lines by adjusting the number on the scale.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/stunning-glitch-effect-photoshop-7.jpg"                      alt="tap on overlay"                ></p><p>Step 8: After setting everything for the glitch effect in your image, you can now add colors using the ‘Gradient Map.’ Or you can also import some graphic textures to Photoshop and add them to the image. Don’t forget to change the ‘Binding Mode’ to ‘Overlay.’ You can then play with the color and graphic settings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/stunning-glitch-effect-photoshop-8.jpg"                      alt="change the binding mode"                ></p><p>Step 9: Once all the color adjustments have satisfied you, it’s time to add some text to your glitch image. For that, head to the ‘Text’ tool from the left menu and type in your text. Edit it as you did to your image so that you can make a cool glitch text effect Photoshop and with this, you are all done with making the most stunning glitch effect Photoshop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/stunning-glitch-effect-photoshop-9.jpg"                      alt="customize your glitch effect"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148633/16836" target="_top" id="2148633">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148633" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148633/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-5-Awesome-Glitch-Effect-Photoshop-Actions"><a href="#Part-2-5-Awesome-Glitch-Effect-Photoshop-Actions" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 5 Awesome Glitch Effect Photoshop Actions"></a>Part 2. 5 Awesome Glitch Effect Photoshop Actions</h2><p>With Photoshop, you can create your photo glitch effect as you prefer instead of using the available standard templates.

Slow-mo has been trendy for years, and its use is not ending soon.</p><p>This article will guide you about the <strong>iMovie slow motion</strong> effect and explain the app in detail. Users considering creating a video across their Mac should be aware of slow-mo in iMovie.

Well, that is what I’m going to show and explain to you today.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135417/19272" target="_top" id="2135417">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135417" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="392" height="72"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135417/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-is-the-rule-of-thirds"><a href="#What-is-the-rule-of-thirds" class="headerlink" title="What is the rule of thirds"></a>What is the rule of thirds</h2><p>At its core the rule of thirds is a guide to follow whenever you create something visual.</p><p>You break an image into thirds both horizontally and vertically, in doing this you are left with nine boxes and four gridlines, the rule states that by placing key elements in line with gridlines you will have an overall better composition.</p><p>To gain a better understanding of this here is a visual example of the gridlines and nine boxes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/rule-of-thirds-gridline.jpg"                      alt="rule of thirds gridline"                ></p><p>This may seem simple but is often overlooked due to time restraints and eagerness to get that video out there. By following these guidelines your overall composition will gain interesting and pleasing results that can help with viewer engagement. This is only one piece of the puzzle but as any photography professional or artist will tell you, It’s the small things that add up.</p><h2 id="How-to-use-the-rule-of-thirds"><a href="#How-to-use-the-rule-of-thirds" class="headerlink" title="How to use the rule of thirds"></a>How to use the rule of thirds</h2><p>To show how to use the rule of thirds I will be showing an image with and without the use of the guidelines. In doing this you will be able to see how impactful this system is and how it can help with your own creations within <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>This will be our scene example, you can see buildings, boats, water and skyline. This may be typical of a backdrop or an insert for a holiday picture amongst many other things.</p><p>I will now show this picture with no compositional thought and without the use of the thirds system.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/shoot-a-scene-with-three-thirds.jpg"                      alt="shoot a scene with three thirds"                ></p><p>Notice how all the elements are in the scene but it just looks interesting and something just seems off when you look at it. You may find yourself searching for understanding of the image rather than taking the image in and concentrating on what the creator intended. This is seen commonly due to the need to fit every element in the scene but sometimes it is best to sacrifice something you may see as important for the sake of the whole picture.</p><p>We will now look at the example image with the rule of thirds in place and see if overall this makes a more interesting scene.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/place-thirds-points-in-photo.jpg"                      alt="place thirds points in photo"                ></p><p>We have aligned the skyline with the first horizontal grid line and aligned the boats with the vertical grid lines. We have sacrificed the crane in the scene but overall I’m sure you can agree that this is more pleasing and makes more sense when you’re viewing this. The whole middle section of the scene now has information within it and the contrast between the middle and the rest of the scene directs your eyes to what was intended to be viewed, This is called effect use of empty space. In doing this you save yourself time from adding more information to direct the viewer.</p><p>Placing key elements directly in the center of your scene can seem static and boring but by placing elements to one side or using the first and second horizontal grid lines you create something called Dynamism , where the viewer sees an element along the grid and takes a journey through the rest of the image.</p><p>Studies have shown that this is the humans natural way of viewing imagery, we first find something interesting to look at and then journey around that. So by using this rule you are creating a more natural process for your viewer.</p><h2 id="Tips-when-starting-using-the-rule-of-thirds"><a href="#Tips-when-starting-using-the-rule-of-thirds" class="headerlink" title="Tips when starting using the rule of thirds"></a>Tips when starting using the rule of thirds</h2><p>The first tip I would say is to view other videos, YouTube is a good starting point. Watch interviews and notice where the chairs are aligned. Watch reviewers and notice where they position themselves in the scene. Lastly watch movies and pause on an interesting scene and try to deconstruct where everything is placed and why they chose that composition.</p><p>The idea with the rule is to have it become something you do naturally, by always considering the form you save yourself time in the editing process. The key things you have in your mind whenever you make a scene should be.</p><p>1. What is the key element in my scene or what am I trying to make the viewer focus on.</p><p>2. where do I intend to place these in my scene?</p><p>3. Have I created a balanced scene with enough negative space to direct the eye.</p><p>If you consider this with every video you make then in time this will become as natural as drinking water on a hot day. As a practice you could open some old projects and apply this rule to your video to see the results and you may find yourself impressed with the change.</p><p><strong>When is it best to not use the rule of thirds?</strong></p><p>The rule is very useful when you’re aiming to grab the attention towards a certain element but that being said, when you have a symmetrical scene you can get away with not using the rule as your eyes can make sense of symmetry very well.</p><p>Even when working with a symmetrical scene you can incorporate the rule within for elements such as people or key figures but in this situation it is down to the creator to figure what they feel is best in any given shot.</p><h2 id="How-to-Use-Rule-of-Thirds-in-Filmora"><a href="#How-to-Use-Rule-of-Thirds-in-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Rule of Thirds in Filmora"></a>How to Use Rule of Thirds in Filmora</h2><p>The tools provided within Filmora are generous and one great feature is the crop and size tool.</p><p>When inserting an image or movie file you can right click on the timeline and select crop and size bringing up a handy screen with the gridlines already there for you. It’s just a matter of aligning your shot for the best composition.</p><p>For reference I will show you what this looks like.</p><p>First right click the timeline on the image you want to reposition. Alternatively you can select the desired insert and press Alt+C this will also bring up the same editing box.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/crop-rule-of-thirds-video.jpg"                      alt="crop rule of thirds video"                ></p><p>Now click on the crop and zoom option and this editor will appear.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/crop-rule-of-thirds-filmora.jpg"                      alt="crop rule of thirds filmora"                ></p><p>As you can see you are able to align the shot and change the aspect ratio to align with your project. For a better look at the built in grid lines see image below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/rule-of-thirds-final-video.jpg"                      alt="rule of thirds final video"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion-4"><a href="#Conclusion-4" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>To conclude, the rule of thirds is very important within visual media and is tough within the fundamentals of art and photography from beginner level right up to the highest point of education, Practice thinking about your placement of key elements within your videos and how this affects your overall composition. The goal is to have this as an automatic thought when shooting your videos or still images. This is a small change you can make but has a big impact on how a viewer engages your content and in return leaves a positive opinion towards your creativity and eye for detail.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-deciding-on-the-best-gopro-max-or-hero-11/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Deciding on the Best GoPro Max or Hero 11?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/updated-best-of-background-tracks-selection-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Best of Background Tracks Selection for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-compilation-of-the-best-9-multi-platform-video-communication-devices-iosandroid/"><u>[Updated] Compilation of The Best 9 Multi-Platform Video Communication Devices (iOS/Android)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11-tips.techidaily.com/1719319213526-essential-tips-for-a-working-winshift/"><u>Essential Tips for a Working WinShift.</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-issues.techidaily.com/expert-advice-on-fixing-the-unresponsive-steelseries-arctis-mic-product-code-problems/"><u>Expert Advice on Fixing the Unresponsive SteelSeries Arctis Mic ([Product Code]) Problems</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/how-can-i-catch-the-regional-pokemon-without-traveling-on-vivo-y28-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How Can I Catch the Regional Pokémon without Traveling On Vivo Y28 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/how-to-change-huawei-nova-y71-location-on-skout-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Change Huawei Nova Y71 Location on Skout | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-editing.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-are-you-looking-for-a-video-format-converter-free-we-will-introduce-the-5-best-online-converters-and-also-the-5-best-video-format-converte/"><u>New 2024 Approved Are You Looking for a Video Format Converter Free?

Create a new composition for your intro"></a>1. Create a new composition for your intro</h2><p>You must build up your video’s composition based on the output. You can upload the previously recorded video after choosing the composition and the runtime. Right-click again and select “Pre-compose” from the menu that appears. To make it simpler to find later, you can also rename your movie here.</p><p>The composition can then include a solid layer. Follow *Layer &gt; New &gt; Solid* to get to this option. Additionally,</p><p>you can choose a hue based on the type of video you want to make. Additionally, you may use the Text option to build text layers, which will allow you to split the words at different points in the document. You can edit each word separately when you break it into layers. Finally, you can move the text around and change the color of the reader to make it more appropriate for your films.</p><p>After Effects makes it incredibly simple to edit the text composition and import it into the timeline of the film.</p><p>A panel appears on the right after importing a text composition. Here, you can alter the text’s color, position,</p><p>and size.</p><h2 id="2-Add-the-first-transition-layer"><a href="#2-Add-the-first-transition-layer" class="headerlink" title="2.

You can experiment with a variety of transition layers in After Effects before selecting the ideal one (CC Light Wipe is a popular choice).</p><p>You can modify the transition after applying it to the layer. For instance, you may decide to apply the second</p><p>key transition at a later period in the timeline and configure the first key transition to occur immediately at the start of the timeline. Setting the completion value is crucial since it will influence how long the word will remain displayed in the video.</p><h2 id="3-Add-the-second-transition-layer"><a href="#3-Add-the-second-transition-layer" class="headerlink" title="3. Add the second transition layer"></a>3. Add the second transition layer</h2><p>The transition effect you introduced in the first stage can either be maintained here, or you can select an</p><p>entirely different one. According to how long you want the text to be displayed, add the layer and adjust</p><p>completion. The reader is invisible when the completion value is set to 100%, or the word is said when it is set</p><p>to 0%.</p><p><strong>A memory sketch</strong></p><p>If you want to make a black-and-white video that is more interesting, the memory sketch is a great template to use. You can make a visually beautiful video with its outstanding text captions, fluid transitions, and excellent animations.</p><p><strong>Toolkit for Instagram</strong></p><p>These days, Instagram is a very popular social media site. Instagram is a platform where reels and videos</p><p>flourish, therefore you must make every effort to differentiate your video from the millions of others available.</p><p>The Instagram Toolkit template meets the standards of the social media network by being brief, clear, and</p><p>appealing.</p><p><strong>Lighting sweep</strong></p><p>A final transition effect, which can be found in the *Effects &gt; Generate *section, must be added to the video in order to complete the effect. The final flourish can be added in the same way as the other keyframes. In this step, you can use the edge intensity, sweep intensity, and direction. This allows you to seamlessly combine the transition of words with lighting effects.</p><p>These are some quick and easy techniques to adding some intros to your videos that look professional. Let’s</p><p>also take a look at some well-known templates you may utilize to make perfect video intros.

Read on to Learn More About AV1 and How It Could Impact Your Life</h2><p>Have you heard about the <strong>AV1 format video</strong>? This format is a new compression standard that promises to improve video quality while reducing file size. If you frequently stream video, the <strong>AV1 files</strong> could make an impact on your life, and we are just beginning to see its potential. Let’s take a further look at what AV1 is and what you need to know about this new video codec.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-format-video-1.jpg"                      alt="av1 logo"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Where-does-it-come-from"><a href="#Part-1-Where-does-it-come-from" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Where does it come from?"></a>Part 1: Where does it come from?</h2><p>AV1 (AOMedia Video 1) is a new video compression format that is being developed by the Alliance for Open Media (AOMedia). AOMedia is a consortium of major tech companies including Google, Microsoft, Netflix, and Amazon. The AV1 codec is an improvement on VP9 in several ways, most notably in its ability to compress video more efficiently.</p><p>Although the AV1 codec is still in the early stages of development, it is already being adopted by some major tech companies. Netflix has announced that it will start using AV1 for its streaming service, and Google has said that AV1 will be the default codec for YouTube.</p><h3 id="How-can-streaming-platforms-and-users-benefit-from-a-new-codec"><a href="#How-can-streaming-platforms-and-users-benefit-from-a-new-codec" class="headerlink" title="How can streaming platforms and users benefit from a new codec?"></a>How can streaming platforms and users benefit from a new codec?</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-format-video-2.jpg"                      alt="watching netflix on tv"                ></p><p><strong>The importance of codecs</strong></p><p>A codec is a device that encodes and decodes digital audio signals. Without a codec, your audio would sound garbled and distorted. There are two metrics to take into account to judge the performance of video codecs: quality and bitrate.</p><h3 id="The-benefits-of-the-new-codec"><a href="#The-benefits-of-the-new-codec" class="headerlink" title="The benefits of the new codec"></a>The benefits of the new codec</h3><p>Two of the most popular video formats, provide high-quality video at a relatively low bit rate.</p><p>The new AV1 codec offers several benefits for streaming platforms and their users. Take a look at a few of them:</p><ol><li><strong>Lower bitrate</strong></li><li><strong>Reduced costs for encoding</strong></li></ol><p>For streaming platforms, AV1 could lead to reducing costs for encoding as well as increasing quality and compatibility. For users, AV1 could improve streaming quality, especially on mobile devices.</p><ol><li><strong>Smaller size with better quality</strong></li></ol><p><strong>AV1 files</strong> will take up less space on your hard drive or be smaller in file size when streamed online. Since AV1 can compress video files to a much smaller size without sacrificing quality, users will be able to save data when streaming video on their devices!</p><ol><li><strong>More efficient</strong></li></ol><p>AV1 will use less processing power to decode a video compared to other video codecs.

We can expect H.266 to continue to evolve and be improved upon as time goes on. Some of their transcendence that you can look forward to:</p><ul><li><strong>Improve compression efficiency</strong></li></ul><p>H.266&#x2F;VVC is designed to improve compression efficiency by 20-50% over previous versions. You can have a video of the same file size and bit rate but make it look significantly better.</p><ul><li><strong>Inter-Layer Prediction (ILP) usage</strong></li></ul><p>The H.266 codec uses a new type of inter-frame prediction called Inter-Layer Prediction (ILP). ILP allows the codec to exploit the correlations between different layers of a video signal. Therefore, it gives better results on image quality and file size when you encode a video with the H.266 codec.</p><ul><li><strong>Higher-quality video</strong></li></ul><p>We can expect higher-quality video content to become more widespread. This new codec will also enable new types of content, such as virtual reality and 360-degree video, to be streamed and enjoyed by a wider audience.</p><h3 id="AV2-codec"><a href="#AV2-codec" class="headerlink" title="AV2 codec"></a>AV2 codec</h3><p>The AV2 codec is an improvement on the current AV1. The AV2 codec is said to be more efficient and have better quality than the AV1 codec.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Explore-the-Latest-in-Computer-Components-at-Your-Site-Name-Innovation-Like-Never-Before"><a href="#Explore-the-Latest-in-Computer-Components-at-Your-Site-Name-Innovation-Like-Never-Before" class="headerlink" title="Explore the Latest in Computer Components at [Your Site Name] - Innovation Like Never Before"></a>Explore the Latest in Computer Components at [Your Site Name] - Innovation Like Never Before</h2><p>This year’s<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/computex" >Computex 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> trade show was filled interesting AI focused PCs, but often, their most interesting features had little to do with AI. Such is the case with<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/msi-microstar" >MSI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ‘s MEG Vision X AI Desktop, which we stumbled upon in the company’s sprawling booth.</p><p> Due out in Q4 for an undisclosed price, the MEG Vision X will have, according to MSI reps “the latest” Intel CPU and Nvidia GPU at the time, which implies that it will have an Arrow Lake processor and a 5080 or 5090 card (presuming Nvidia announces one this fall). With all that horsepower, you could use this system to play high-end games, train models or just process a little local AI generated art.</p><p> But what makes the MEG Vision X stand out is not its ability to run AI or gaming tasks – any PC with a decent video card or an NPU could do that. It’s the 1080 x 1920 touch screen that takes up the entire front surface of the chassis that led us to name this desktop one of the<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/best-of-computex-2024" >best products of Computex 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><p> The chassis with built-in screen is so impressive to look at that Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger signed his name and the word “awesome” on the top of the Meg Vision X when he visited MSI’s booth.</p><p> LATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware Tom’s Hardware</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BYkvUDqMNVz6ycnx4BZFYV-320-80.jpg"                      alt="MSI Meg Vision X with Gelsinger Signature"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Tom’s Hardware)</p><p> By default, the touch display shows key PC stats such as your CPU temperature and clock speed. It also allows you to launch your favorite apps on your primary screen by tapping a shortcut icon. You can change performance modes here as well, opting for more speed or quieter fans.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2SRaW8dq9GVUxC4BK2xbzh-320-80.jpg"                      alt="MSI Meg Vision X"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Tom’s Hardware)</p><p> The display is seen by Windows as a full-fledged second display in portrait mode. So you can play YouTube videos on it or run apps on it if you wish. MSI reps said a game streamer should keep their chat or OBS window on the front-panel screen while gaming on their primary monitor. They also said that the touch screen uses Intel integrated graphics while the main monitor or any secondary monitors you attach would use the Nvidia graphics card.</p><p> We got to spend a few minutes with the MSI MEG Vision X and its touch screen and we were impressed with how responsive it was. We put a YouTube vertical video onto the touch screen and then swiped down to switch to a different one. The screen supports ten-point touch so you can pinch-to-zoom or even finger paint on it.</p><h2 id="Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter"><a href="#Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter" class="headerlink" title="Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter"></a>Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter</h2><p> Get Tom’s Hardware’s best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p><p> Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands  Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors</p><p> By submitting your information you agree to the<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/terms-conditions/" >Terms &amp; Conditions <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/privacy-policy/" >Privacy Policy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and are aged 16 or over.</p><p> Of course, MSI, like every other PC OEM, feels compelled to tout the computer’s AI features and how they integrate with the screen. The screen itself is called an AI HMI and some of the shortcuts on it launch built-in MSI AI apps such as AI Artist x MSI Chat, which is a chat bot &#x2F; image generator that runs locally. A built-in microphone and speaker will let you issue voice commands either to MSI’s app or to Copilot.</p><p> There’s also MSI AI Engine, which adjusts performance based on AI. Then there’s AI Frozr, which does the same thing for cooling.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/naxGXKocxiSqBdGWe9LHqR-320-80.jpg"                      alt="MSI Meg Vision X"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Tom’s Hardware)</p><p> But even if having a local image generator &#x2F; chatbot is really valuable to you, you don’t need a special PC or an on-case screen on the case to get those features. MSI may have its own branded apps, but it’s likely using the same chat and image generation that’s available elsewhere. Anyone who has a decent graphics card can download and install Stable Diffusion image generator or LLama for chat. If you have an RTX card, try<a class="link"   href="https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI" >ComfyUI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , which is a very powerful frontend for Stable Diffusion.</p><p> What you can’t get elsewhere is a full HD screen that takes up the entire front surface of your chassis. We have seen some cases with screens on the front – the<a class="link"   href="https://www.jonsbo.com/en/products/D41MESHSCREENBlack.html" >Jonsbo D41 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> comes to mind. But MSI’s display takes up the entire space and is meant to be an integral part of the user experience, not just a cute special effect.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/n-2024-unparalleled-video-grabber-suite-your-download-delight/"><u>[New] In 2024, Unparalleled Video Grabber Suite - Your Download Delight</u></a></li><li><a href="https://mondly-stories.techidaily.com/10-cross-cultural-films-that-sharpen-your-vocabulentic-skills/"><u>10 Cross-Cultural Films That Sharpen Your Vocabulentic Skills</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-fake.techidaily.com/5-easy-ways-to-change-location-on-youtube-tv-on-xiaomi-redmi-note-12-4g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>5 Easy Ways to Change Location on YouTube TV On Xiaomi Redmi Note 12 4G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-editing.techidaily.com/2024hevch265/"><u>無料で2024年に対応したHEVC/H.265を変換・エンコードする人気のアプリ</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-language-of-interaction-engaging-viewers-on-youtube/"><u>In 2024, The Language of Interaction Engaging Viewers on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-editing.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-using-slow-motion-in-adobe-after-effects-a-step-by-step-procession/"><u>New 2024 Approved Using Slow Motion in Adobe After Effects A Step-by-Step Procession</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-editing.techidaily.com/new-bored-of-extraneous-software-downloads-and-program-installations-to-edit-your-videos-the-best-video-editing-online-utilities-are-here-at-your-rescue-for/"><u>New Bored of Extraneous Software Downloads and Program Installations to Edit Your Videos?

Simple as that, however if the laptop doesn’t figure it out on its own you may need to explain what is going on with the second display. Although more reliable, connecting via cable means your source device is linked to the TV and you can’t go for a stroll. It also means you don’t have to worry about the wireless connection fading.</p><h3 id="Steps-to-Get-Zoom-on-TV-with-HDMI"><a href="#Steps-to-Get-Zoom-on-TV-with-HDMI" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Get Zoom on TV with HDMI"></a>Steps to Get Zoom on TV with HDMI</h3><h5 id="Step1Connect-the-HDMI-End-to-the-TV-and-the-Other-End-to-Your-Device"><a href="#Step1Connect-the-HDMI-End-to-the-TV-and-the-Other-End-to-Your-Device" class="headerlink" title="Step1Connect the HDMI End to the TV and the Other End to Your Device"></a>Step1Connect the HDMI End to the TV and the Other End to Your Device</h5><p>You may use this in its place if you don’t have an HDMI but do have a USB-C port.

On MacOS and iOS, Airplay is used to communicate between the Zoom client and the Zoom room. There may be a great potential for your own business requirements if you can figure out how to utilize Airplay to Zoom mirror your screen to your Apple TV.

Keep Reading to Learn More</h2><p>When it comes to social media marketing, video is one of the most powerful tools at your disposal. Videos can be used to create engaging content that draws in new followers, and they can also be used to promote your products or services. In fact, videos are so effective that nearly 90% of businesses now use them as part of their social media marketing strategy. So, if you’re not using video yet, now is the time to start. In this post, we’ll discuss the benefits of using video for social media marketing and provide tips for getting started.

More Engaging Than Text or Images</h2><p>When you’re scrolling through your feed, what’s more, likely to stop you in your tracks: a picture or a video? For most people, the answer is video. In general, video is more engaging than image because it captures our attention more effectively and holds it for longer. Studies have shown that the human brain processes video 60,000 times faster than text, and that viewers retain 95% of a message when they watch it in a video, as opposed to 10% when they read it in text. Furthermore, video is more likely to evoke an emotional response than an image. We can’t help but be drawn in by the movement, sound, and facial expressions of the people in the video, which makes us more likely to feel connected to them. So next time you’re trying to capture someone’s attention, think about using video instead of a still image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/the-benefits-of-using-video-for-social-media-marketing-01.jpg"                      alt="Video Format"                ></p><p>Video Format</p><h2 id="2-Build-a-Relationship-with-Audience"><a href="#2-Build-a-Relationship-with-Audience" class="headerlink" title="2. Build a Relationship with Audience"></a>2. Build a Relationship with Audience</h2><p>Video can help you build a relationship with your audience on social media. That’s because people like to watch videos. They’re fun and interesting. You can show people what you’re doing and what’s going on in your life. And people can leave comments and talk to you on the video. The more you interact with your audience, the more they’ll like you.</p><p>Plus, video is a great way to show off your products or services. You can give people a tour of your store or office. Or show them how to use your product. If you have a new product, you can create a video to show it off. People are more likely to buy a product if they can see it in action.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/the-benefits-of-using-video-for-social-media-marketing-02.jpg"                      alt="Videos Help You Build a Relationship"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043596/7443" target="_top" id="2043596">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043596" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043596/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Videos Help You Build a Relationship</p><h2 id="3-Promote-Your-Brand-or-Product"><a href="#3-Promote-Your-Brand-or-Product" class="headerlink" title="3. Promote Your Brand or Product"></a>3. Promote Your Brand or Product</h2><p>Video allows you to show, rather than just tell, potential customers what your brand is all about. You can give them a behind-the-scenes look at your company, or showcase your products in action. And because people are more likely to watch a video than read an article or blog post, you’re more likely to reach a wider audience with your message.</p><p>Creating a video doesn’t have to be expensive or time-consuming. You can use your smartphone or a simple video camera to get started. And there are plenty of free or low-cost video editing software programs available if you want to get fancier with your finished product.</p><p>If you’re not sure where to start, try creating a short video that introduces your brand and tells viewers what they can expect from your products or services. Then post it on your website and social media channels and see how it goes! You might be surprised at how well it performs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/the-benefits-of-using-video-for-social-media-marketing-03.jpg"                      alt="Videos Help Promote Your Brand"                ></p><p>Videos Help Promote Your Brand</p><h2 id="4-Drive-Traffic-to-Your-Website"><a href="#4-Drive-Traffic-to-Your-Website" class="headerlink" title="4. Drive Traffic to Your Website"></a>4. Drive Traffic to Your Website</h2><p>Website traffic refers to the number of visitors who visit a website. This can be measured in a number of ways, including the number of unique visitors, the number of page views, and the amount of time spent on the site.</p><p>If you’re looking for a way to give your website a boost, you may want to consider using videos. By posting engaging videos on social media sites, you can drive traffic to your site and increase your visibility. And, with more people visiting your site, you’ll have a better chance of converting visitors into customers. Of course, creating videos can be time-consuming and requires some level of creative talent. But it’s worth the effort if you’re looking for a way to improve your web traffic.</p><p>So, if you’re ready to take your social media marketing to the next level, why not give video a try?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/the-benefits-of-using-video-for-social-media-marketing-04.jpg"                      alt="Videos Help Drive Traffic"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2036472/19272" target="_top" id="2036472">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2036472" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2036472/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Videos Help Drive Traffic</p><h2 id="5-Increase-Your-Social-Media-Reach"><a href="#5-Increase-Your-Social-Media-Reach" class="headerlink" title="5. Increase Your Social Media Reach"></a>5. Increase Your Social Media Reach</h2><p>Social media reach is the number of people who see your content. It’s the potential audience for your message. The more people who see it, the more likely it is that someone will engage with it. The size of your reach depends on the platform you’re using and how many followers you have. Some platforms, like Facebook, make it easy to reach a large audience.</p><p>The best way to increase your reach is to create compelling video content that people want to share. Videos are highly shareable, and if they are well-made and engaging, they can quickly attract a large audience. In addition, videos are a great way to build brand awareness and show potential customers what your business is all about. By including videos in your social media marketing strategy, you can reach a wider audience and create more opportunities for customer engagement.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/the-benefits-of-using-video-for-social-media-marketing-05.jpg"                      alt="Videos Help Increase Social Media Reach"                ></p><p>Videos Help Drive Traffic</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130875/7443" target="_top" id="2130875">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130875" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130875/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="6-Boost-your-SEO"><a href="#6-Boost-your-SEO" class="headerlink" title="6. Boost your SEO"></a>6. Boost your SEO</h2><p>SEO is an acronym that stands for “search engine optimization.” It is a process of improving the visibility and ranking of a website or web page in search engine results pages (SERPs). The higher a website or web page appears in the SERPs, the more likely it is to be clicked by users.</p><p>If you’re like most people, you probably spend a good chunk of your day scrolling through social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. And when you’re not scrolling through your feed, you’re probably watching videos. Whether it’s a funny cat video or a cooking tutorial, chances are you’ve watched a video online in the past 24 hours. What you may not realize is that videos can also be used to boost your SEO.</p><p>That’s right - by creating and posting engaging videos, you can attract more visitors to your website and improve your search engine ranking. Here’s how it works: when people watch your videos and share them with their friends, they are effectively giving your website a “vote” of approval. This helps to improve your visibility on search engines and attracts more visitors to your site. In addition, videos help to keep people on your website for longer periods of time, which is also a positive signal to search engines. So if you’re looking for a new way to improve your SEO, consider adding videos to your website. You might just be surprised at the results.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/the-benefits-of-using-video-for-social-media-marketing-06.jpg"                      alt="Videos Help Boost Your SEO"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i110150.net/c/5597632/798161/11305" target="_top" id="798161">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11305-798161" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i110150.net/i/5597632/798161/11305"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Videos Help Boost Your SEO</p><p>Wrap Up</p><ul><li>Now that you know the importance of using video for your social media marketing, it’s time to start planning your next campaign.</li><li>Keep in mind the different ways you can use video to engage with your audience and think about what kind of content will resonate best with them.</li><li>Don’t be afraid to try something new – after all, that’s how we learn and grow.
