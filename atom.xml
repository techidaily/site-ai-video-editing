Find Out How to Use These Scopes and Improve Your Video Editing Skills</h2><p>How do you set up <strong>DaVinci scopes</strong>? The internal color scopes in Resolve are flexible and customizable but can be confusing. The built-in DaVinci Resolve scope used to be limited only a few possibilities. However, the new 9-scope view offers a wider range of choice, making them a powerful tool for video editing. In this article, we will explore how to set up DaVinci scopes to achieve better color results.</p><p><strong>Color Correction Editor</strong> An easy-to-use video editor helps you make color correction and color grading experience for videos<img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"                      alt="Free Download"                > <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Use Vectorscope in Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try Color Correction <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box.png"                      alt="Wondershare Filmora"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-Unlocking-Color-Precision-Exploring-the-Improved-Scopes-in-DaVinci-Resolve"><a href="#Part-1-Unlocking-Color-Precision-Exploring-the-Improved-Scopes-in-DaVinci-Resolve" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. **Unlocking Color Precision: Exploring the Improved Scopes in DaVinci Resolve"></a><strong>Part 1.</strong> **Unlocking Color Precision: Exploring the Improved Scopes in DaVinci Resolve</h2><p>The Blackmagic Design continues to improve the Resolve to make it better with every iteration. The new features improve colorist workflow in less powerful ways. The major improvements include a major facelift to the scope, allowing professions to do more with DaVinci resolve. Let’s have a look at some of these changes:</p><h3 id="1-CIE-1931-Color-Space"><a href="#1-CIE-1931-Color-Space" class="headerlink" title="1. CIE 1931 Color Space"></a><strong>1. CIE 1931 Color Space</strong></h3><p>The inclusion of the CIE chromaticity diagram is perhaps the biggest change to DaVinci scopes. It displays the gamut of the project as set in the Color Management preferences. This makes it a useful alternate way of looking at the trace of an image to judge when the values are out of legal range. It also functions as an educational tool for learning about the range of color spaces.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/mastering-davinci-resolve-scopes-a-comprehensive-guide-1.JPG"                      alt="cie 1931 color space"                ></p><h3 id="2-Low-Pass-Filter"><a href="#2-Low-Pass-Filter" class="headerlink" title="2. Low Pass Filter"></a><strong>2. Low Pass Filter</strong></h3><p>The wavefront and parade scopes now have a low pass filter, which reduces noise in the trace. This visually sharpens the display of the scopes, allowing easier detection of elements in the frame.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/mastering-davinci-resolve-scopes-a-comprehensive-guide-2.JPG"                      alt="low pass filter"                ></p><p>The image above shows the major improvements. The second set of waveforms has more defined lines. These have the low-pass filter activated, which makes the scopes easier to read.</p><h3 id="3-High-Mid-and-Low-Views-in-Vectorscope"><a href="#3-High-Mid-and-Low-Views-in-Vectorscope" class="headerlink" title="3. High, Mid, and Low Views in Vectorscope"></a><strong>3. High, Mid, and Low Views in Vectorscope</strong></h3><p>The vectorscope has been added to the ability to toggle the mid-tones, shadows, and highlights of the image independently.

Mastering Scopes in DaVinci Resolve: A Brief Guide"></a><strong>Part 2. Mastering Scopes in DaVinci Resolve: A Brief Guide</strong></h2><p>DaVinci scopes help you to analyze images as a basis for color correction. When used properly, scopes help in fixing white balance issues and checking saturation. They also allow you to get the correct exposure and check details like skin tone. To use scopes in DaVinci Resolve, go to the color page in the bottom right corner. You can also click on the small graph icon to view the scope. Here is how to use them:</p><ul><li><a href="#davinci1">Waveform</a></li><li><a href="#davinci2">Parade (RGB)</a></li><li><a href="#davinci3">Vectorscope</a></li><li><a href="#davinci4">Histogram</a></li></ul><h3 id="1-Waveform"><a href="#1-Waveform" class="headerlink" title="1. Waveform"></a><strong>1. Waveform</strong></h3><p>The Waveform represents the brightness or luminance of your image. In this video scope, the brightest parts are at the top while the darkest are at the bottom. The pixels are represented from left to right.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/mastering-davinci-resolve-scopes-a-comprehensive-guide-8.JPG"                      alt="waveform"                ></p><p>The Waveform scope on DaVinci Resolve is helpful when you are checking for clipping. This simply means finding out whether the image is too bright or too dark. The waveform also ensures that the image is properly exposed. The colorize feature of the waveform shows the colors of the image while the extent shows the darkest or lightest parts of the image.</p><h3 id="2-Parade-RGB"><a href="#2-Parade-RGB" class="headerlink" title="2. Parade (RGB)"></a><strong>2. Parade (RGB)</strong></h3><p>The RGB Parade comprises 3 waveforms that represent the luminance of red, green, and blue channels. The approach for reading the parade video scope is similar to that of the waveform. However, you now look at the balance between the colors correct the white balance, and check for a color cast.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/mastering-davinci-resolve-scopes-a-comprehensive-guide-9.JPG"                      alt="parade"                ></p><p>The Parade works almost in a similar manner as the waveform. It displays the red, green, and blue channels of the image as separate waveforms. This way, you can easily identify and correct color casts while ensuring the colors in the image are balanced. The video scope provides useful information to decide which parts of the image need to be corrected or tweaked further.</p><h3 id="3-Vectorscope"><a href="#3-Vectorscope" class="headerlink" title="3. Vectorscope"></a><strong>3. Vectorscope</strong></h3><p>Vectorscope in DaVinci Resolve shows hue and saturation on a circular graph. Hues (the colors) are indicated outside of the color wheel for easier color correction. Saturation is indicated by how far the graph extends from the center.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/mastering-davinci-resolve-scopes-a-comprehensive-guide-10.JPG"                      alt="vectorscope"                ></p><p>By displaying the hue and saturation of the image as a vector, this video scope helps check skin tones. The scope specifically checks whether skin tones are shifted toward colors such as yellow, magenta, or green. It allows you to make sure that the colors in your subject skin tones are not too saturated or desaturated.</p><h3 id="4-Histogram"><a href="#4-Histogram" class="headerlink" title="4. Histogram"></a><strong>4. Histogram</strong></h3><p>Histogram is a video scope in DaVinci Resolve that displays the brightness or luminance of an image from left to right for the RGB channel. The video scope is based on the number of pixels that the colors red, blue, and green have in an image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/mastering-davinci-resolve-scopes-a-comprehensive-guide-11.JPG"                      alt="histogram"                ></p><p>Using the histogram video scope on DaVinci Resolve allows you to check for overexposure or underexposure in your image. You can also ensure that the image has a good overall brightness range. The scope provides a graphical representation of tonal distribution in each channel. This way, you can evaluate the tone in detail for more accurate brightness and contrast adjustments.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Edit-Like-a-Pro-Mastering-Video-Scopes-in-Filmora"><a href="#Part-3-Edit-Like-a-Pro-Mastering-Video-Scopes-in-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: **Edit Like a Pro: Mastering Video Scopes in Filmora"></a><strong>Part 3:</strong> **Edit Like a Pro: Mastering Video Scopes in Filmora</h2><p>When working on video projects, Wondershare Filmora is a great editing software.

If you want to learn about its steps, then continue reading.</p><p>Step 1: The process starts by importing the image to Photoshop on which you plan to add the photo glitch effect. Then you should always convert the image from colorful to black and white. This could be done quickly by going into the ‘Image’ menu from the menu bar. Next, go for the ‘Adjustments’ option and select ‘Desaturate.’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/stunning-glitch-effect-photoshop-1.jpg"                      alt="tap on desaturate option"                ></p><p>Step 2: Now duplicate the image by dragging it onto the New Layer icon in the Layers Panel. Then double click on the duplicated image. This will open a ‘Layer Style’ settings menu. Here, click on the icon for ‘R Channel’ and deselect it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/stunning-glitch-effect-photoshop-2.jpg"                      alt="disable channel r"                ></p><p>Step 3: Now, it’s time to add the first glitch element. For that, hold the ‘Shift’ key and move the image by using the left&#x2F;right cursor keys on the keyboard. This will offset the image layer from the original.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/stunning-glitch-effect-photoshop-3.jpg"                      alt="add first glitch element"                ></p><p>Step 4: You can now select the ‘Mark’ tool from the left side. Make a rectangle anywhere on the image with the Mark tool and then switch back to the ‘Move’ tool. Then again, nudge the rectangular portion left or right to offset it. You can repeat this process multiple times on different areas of the image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/stunning-glitch-effect-photoshop-4.jpg"                      alt="use mark and move tool"                ></p><p>Step 5: At this point, make a New Layer and fill it with White.

This feature helps create slow-motion videos by slowing down the recorded action when played at normal speed. These <strong>slow-motion</strong> <strong>cameras</strong> are popular in filmmaking, sports analysis, science, and content creation. That’s because they capture detailed moments and highlight fast-moving things.</p><ul><li><strong>Higher Frame Rate:</strong> Regular videos usually record 24, 30, or 60 frames per second (fps). But <strong>slow-motion cameras</strong> can capture hundreds or thousands of frames per second. More frames mean more details and smoother slow-motion videos when played back.</li><li><strong>Smooth Playback:</strong> Slow-motion videos look smooth and purposeful when played at regular speeds. More frames are recorded initially to achieve this effect. Ultimately, it will preserve all details when the video is played in slow motion.</li><li><strong>High-Resolution Sensors:</strong> Lots of <strong>slow-motion cameras</strong> have high-quality sensors. These sensors ensure that even with more frames captured, the picture stays sharp and detailed in slow-motion videos. This helps capture fine details without losing clarity.</li><li><strong>Creative Control:</strong> <strong>Slow-motion cameras</strong> let filmmakers and videographers control how fast or slow some parts of a scene look. This helps tell stories better, focus on details, and make videos more interesting and attractive to watch.</li><li><strong>Reduced Motion Blur:</strong> More frames per second make pictures clearer and sharper.
