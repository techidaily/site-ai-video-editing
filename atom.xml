You can make commercials, animated movies etc. Here are some questions from which you will get to know everything you need to know:</p><h3 id="01What-is-an-Online-Storyboard"><a href="#01What-is-an-Online-Storyboard" class="headerlink" title="01What is an Online Storyboard?"></a>01What is an Online Storyboard?</h3><p>Online Storyboard allows you to create animation videos or films on a web based platform, which is credible in the sense that you do not need to be device specific to use the tool.

Here are some main components:</p><p><strong>●</strong> Learning purpose</p><p><strong>●</strong> A detailed description of communication</p><p><strong>●</strong> Informatory Strategies to teach the learners</p><p><strong>●</strong> Format should be perfect according to the topic</p><p><strong>●</strong> Proper information of audio with file names</p><p><strong>●</strong> Feedback for the assessment</p><h3 id="03Why-do-you-need-a-Storyboard"><a href="#03Why-do-you-need-a-Storyboard" class="headerlink" title="03Why do you need a Storyboard?"></a>03Why do you need a Storyboard?</h3><p>A Storyboard is a process of pre- production. It lets you know how your story is going to flow. You will get to know the mistakes in the early stages if you make a storyboard and this will help you to save your money and time. Here are some essentials because of which you need to have a storyboard.</p><p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Is this concept is going to work? -</strong> A storyboard lets you know whether the concept is going to work out or not. A storyboard helps the client to confirm whether the concept will work or not.</p><p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Arranging Shots -</strong> A Storyboard lets you to tell you story in a limited time frame in the best way. In commercials we don’t have much time. It is like you have 60 seconds, 30 seconds, or sometimes it is just 15 seconds. So, it is the best way to make every shot count.</p><p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Saving Money -</strong> Before making the final product, it is better to have an accepted storyboard from your client. In complex animations, it takes a lot of time and money so it is better to have an approved storyboard. This will let you know how the final product would look like. This will let the client know what is on your mind.</p><p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Recognizing the mistakes -</strong> On a storyboarding phase, you can recognize the mistakes related to the media, narration or any other details. This will save your energy, time and money and then you will be ready for the production phase.</p><p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Agreement with punch lines and dialogues -</strong> When you are creating a storyboard you can check whether the dialogues and punch lines work together as you have planned before. It is very important to check that the dialogues and punches are delivered in the exact way that you have imagined.</p><h3 id="04How-to-Label-Storyboards"><a href="#04How-to-Label-Storyboards" class="headerlink" title="04How to Label Storyboards?"></a>04How to Label Storyboards?</h3><p>If you are using numerous storyboards for the same shot, keeping the shots labeled is important so that everything is arranged in an order and your team can stay focused and organized. If you will use any software it will name the panel numbers automatically. In case you are not using any software and your client wants to delete, add or move a panel then you can’t name that panel.</p><p>For example: Panel_7_New_New_New. It will be very difficult to figure out and also time consuming. The correct way to do is this: Project name_ Script#_Scene_Frame_01.JPG</p><h3 id="05Do-Storyboards-have-Dialogues"><a href="#05Do-Storyboards-have-Dialogues" class="headerlink" title="05Do Storyboards have Dialogues?"></a>05Do Storyboards have Dialogues?</h3><p>Storyboards have dialogues and you can include dialogues which will flow underneath the panels for each and every scene.

You Have Come to the Right Place. This Guide Will Teach You All You Need to Know to Create Montages of Video Games and Share Them with Other Players</h2><p>The popularity of gaming montage is growing every day in today’s pop culture. There are currently more than 2.5 billion gamers, and most of them love watching gaming video content on YouTube. Whether people use a montage to parody gaming montages themselves or show off their skills, the effort and time put into them create impressive results.</p><p>We will explain how to create gaming montages and give you some tips that you might want to keep in mind to make epic videos.</p><h2 id="How-to-Make-a-Gaming-Montage"><a href="#How-to-Make-a-Gaming-Montage" class="headerlink" title="How to Make a Gaming Montage"></a>How to Make a Gaming Montage</h2><p>You have several options when it comes to creating gaming montages. You can include a random cut of great scenes, a mixture of the highlighted moments you found thrilling and would like to share with other gamers. In other cases, you’ll have to think of an engaging story in advance, then base your gameplay on this story.</p><p>Essentially, the workflow will be slightly different for these two scenarios. It’s much easier with the random cut type, especially when using a reliable video editor. Editing montages is as exciting as playing the game.</p><p>With that in mind, here is how to make a gaming montage.</p><h3 id="1-Decide-Your-Montage-Story-Type"><a href="#1-Decide-Your-Montage-Story-Type" class="headerlink" title="1) Decide Your Montage Story&#x2F;Type"></a>1) Decide Your Montage Story&#x2F;Type</h3><p>Deciding your montage type beforehand helps clear your mind and create an epic gaming montage that will keep viewers watching. It allows you to choose the relevant video clips for your gaming montage.</p><p>Choose the topic of the video and decide the length of each clip and the sequence of the clips. Be sure to put the most epic or funny clips in the last section of your video. And this will make your viewers watch the video until the end.</p><h3 id="2-Record-Your-Gameplay-Footage"><a href="#2-Record-Your-Gameplay-Footage" class="headerlink" title="2) Record Your Gameplay Footage"></a>2) Record Your Gameplay Footage</h3><p>The methods to capture the gameplay varies depending on the platform where the game is. The most important thing you have to keep in mind is to ensure your recorder supports Replay Buffer; this will allow you to record scenes that occurred minutes or seconds ago.</p><p>That means you do not need to record the gameplay the whole time and burn your hardware. Instead, you’ll capture the moment after interesting things occur.</p><p>Game consoles like PS4 allow you to record the video natively for a maximum of one hour with the gamepad. A capture card lets you record it longer than 60 minutes.</p><p>Once you’ve all the clips you want on your PC, head over to <a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.net/filmora-video-editor.html" >https://filmora.wondershare.net/filmora-video-editor.html <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and download Filmora and install the software on your computer. This program allows you to edit your video clips and add cool effects that will make viewers keep watching.</p><h3 id="3-Import-You-Videos-to-Media-Library"><a href="#3-Import-You-Videos-to-Media-Library" class="headerlink" title="3) Import You Videos to Media Library"></a>3) Import You Videos to Media Library</h3><p>You only have to import the videos to Filmora’s media library and then drag and drop them into the timeline, where you can start making the edits.</p><p>By right-clicking on the clip in your timeline, you’ll see the options to zoom, speed, change, split, or trim your videos. You can also add sound effects by going to the Audio Tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gaming-montage-1.png"                      alt="How to make a game montage - import videos"                ></p><p>Import Videos</p><h3 id="4-Choose-Background-Music-for-Your-Montage"><a href="#4-Choose-Background-Music-for-Your-Montage" class="headerlink" title="4) Choose Background Music for Your Montage"></a>4) Choose Background Music for Your Montage</h3><p>Music will help make your gaming montage engaging. Make sure you use a license-free track if you plan to post it on social media.</p><p>Using copyrighted music tracks and uploading the video on social media platforms can lead to video strikes. Luckily, Filmora has loads of non-copyrighted music tracks.</p><p>Navigate to Stock Media, where you’ll find non-copyrighted music on Pixabay, and choose the one you prefer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gaming-montage-2.png"                      alt="How to make a game montage with Filmora - Choose Background Music"                ></p><p>Choose Background Music</p><h3 id="5-Edit-the-Gaming-Montage"><a href="#5-Edit-the-Gaming-Montage" class="headerlink" title="5) Edit the Gaming Montage"></a>5) Edit the Gaming Montage</h3><p>With Filmora’s auto gaming montage maker, you can watch the video clip with the music you have selected. This tool will analyze beat points to change the video and effects.</p><p>Additionally, the tool can identify any bad parts in your video and delete them so that the video matches the music.</p><p>The Effects tab allows you to add multiple overlays and filters to your gaming montage video. Filmora has different categories of overlays that let you add emotions or personality to your montage. You can also use it to set the tone in your video.</p><p>Filters allow you to spice up your gaming videos. There are also different types of filters on Filmora.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gaming-montage-3.png"                      alt="How to make a game montage with Filmora - Edit Gaming Montage"                ></p><p>Edit Gaming Montage</p><h3 id="6-Export-Your-Gaming-Montage-Video"><a href="#6-Export-Your-Gaming-Montage-Video" class="headerlink" title="6) Export Your Gaming Montage Video"></a>6) Export Your Gaming Montage Video</h3><p>Once you have finished editing your video and added music, hit the Export button.

Sync Gunshot with Music Beat"></a>3. Sync Gunshot with Music Beat</h3><p>Try to match gunshot sounds with beats and rhythms in shooter video games.

Color Grade the Video for the Mood"></a>5. Color Grade the Video for the Mood</h3><p>Use color grading to your advantage, as it can set the mood of your viewers.

Add Video Vignettes for Special Occasions"></a>6. Add Video Vignettes for Special Occasions</h3><p>You can add dark edges around the corners of your video to highlight action or create a certain mood. For gameplay based on a story, use vignetting to add a sense of nostalgia or as a flashback that shows viewers the past.</p><p>You can use Filmora to apply the vignetting effect by heading to Advanced Color Tuning, then clicking the Vignette option. You can then add the vignette effect to the video. Additionally, you can adjust the vignette’s exposure, feather, roundness, size, and highlights.</p><h2 id="Best-Gaming-Montage-for-Studying"><a href="#Best-Gaming-Montage-for-Studying" class="headerlink" title="Best Gaming Montage for Studying"></a>Best Gaming Montage for Studying</h2><p>Here are three gaming montages that are good for studying.</p><h3 id="1-Call-of-Duty-Modern-Warfare"><a href="#1-Call-of-Duty-Modern-Warfare" class="headerlink" title="1. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare"></a>1. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</h3><p>Uploaded by DemixB, the Call of Duty Game Montage uses Jacques Offenbach’s Can Can Music track. It’s a happy song that has a tempo of 81 BPM. The track has average danceable energy, and it’s somewhat danceable.</p><p>DemixB set the gunshot in the montage video to the music tune. The track builds up to the climax when the gunshot echoes with the attention-grabbing orchestral explosions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gaming-montage-4.png"                      alt="Best Gaming Montage Example - Call of Duty: Modern Warfare"                ></p><p>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</p><h3 id="2-ShutteR’s-Gaming-Montage"><a href="#2-ShutteR’s-Gaming-Montage" class="headerlink" title="2. ShutteR’s Gaming Montage"></a>2. ShutteR’s Gaming Montage</h3><p>In the gaming montage uploaded by ShutteR on his YouTube channel, he used velocity effects to enhance the video. You’ll see that the transition in each scene is paired with adrenaline-pumping, speed-ramping effects.</p><p>ShutteR used a slow-motion to highlight action in each scene, then speeds up again when he wants to fast out into the next scene.; this makes the video more engaging to keep viewers glued to their screens.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gaming-montage-5.png"                      alt="Best Gaming Montage Example - ShutteR&#39;s Gaming Montage"                ></p><p>ShutteR’s Gaming Montage</p><h3 id="3-NEVERMORE-CS-GO"><a href="#3-NEVERMORE-CS-GO" class="headerlink" title="3. NEVERMORE [CS: GO]"></a>3. NEVERMORE [CS: GO]</h3><p>NEVERMORE [CS: GO] was uploaded by Fuze on his YouTube channel, and it has creative gameplay. The gaming montage is based on a story. He did the project with Apel, an artist who designed the Fever Dream series skins in the video.</p><p>The basic idea of this gaming montage was that the main game character is a corrupted policeman with purple glowing eyes because he’s not human.</p><p>When the edits begin, the shape of the main character will shift from CS: GO CT models and turn into his real corrupt CT shape. So that’s why his name keeps changing. You can get his real identity by pausing some of the frames and looking at the “Killfeed.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gaming-montage-6.png"                      alt="Best Gaming Montage Example - NEVERMORE"                ></p><p>NEVERMORE [CS: GO]</p><p>Closing Thoughts:</p><p>Gaming montage involves picking and editing a range of video clips, which are brought together to create engaging video content. It consists of the best scenes from gameplay and non-copyrighted background music.</p><p>Use Filmora to edit and add effects to your video, including transitions and overlays.

This social media app can instantly slow down your video without any effort. Such videos can retain the viewers’ attention and urge them to explore the details. Plus, slow-motion videos encourage the audience to stay tuned to the upcoming content. Look at the below point to explore the uses of <strong>slow motion in Snapchat</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Creating Comedy:</strong> Sometimes, people use slow-motion to turn their captured moments into comedy. For instance, you can add slow motion to your friend’s video of eating noodles.

It acts as a stencil, determining which parts of the underlying layer are visible and which are transparent. Track mattes are used for creating various effects such as text animations, transitions, and seamlessly composing multiple layers. After Effects offers four Track Matte options:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-1.jpg"                      alt="alpha track matte"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Alpha Matte:</strong> <strong>Alpha matte in After Effects</strong> allows white areas in the matte layer to become visible while black areas become transparent. Effectively, this helps the underlying layer to show through.</li><li><strong>Alpha Inverted Matte:</strong> In an alpha inverted matte, black areas in the matte layer are visible, and white areas are transparent. It reverses the transparency values to create unique effects.</li><li><strong>Luma Matte:</strong> A luma matte uses the brightness values of the matte layer to determine visibility. Bright areas in the matte layer are visible, while dark areas are transparent.</li><li><strong>Luma Inverted Matte:</strong> The luma inverted matte works opposite to the luma matte. The top layer’s dark areas are visible, while bright areas are transparent.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-2.jpg"                      alt="luma track matte"                ></p><p>You can use any of the <strong>track mattes in After Effects</strong> according to your requirements. Following is a step-by-step guide on how to use track mattes:</p><h5 id="Step-1"><a href="#Step-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h5><p>To apply a track matte to your video, you must work with two layers. The top layer acts as the alpha or the luminance layer. The bottom layer acts as the fill. Once you have identified the layers, you can proceed to the next step.</p><h5 id="Step-2"><a href="#Step-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h5><p>Go to the “Modes” column and open the dropdown menu next to “Layer List.” Here, select the layer you wish to use as the track matte.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-3.jpg"                      alt="select track matte layer"                ></p><h5 id="Step-3"><a href="#Step-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3"></a>Step 3</h5><p>You will see two toggle switches once you select your layer. You can use these switches and the available options to set the transparency for the Track Matte. You can add <strong>alpha matte in After Effects</strong> or other types from here.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-4.jpg"                      alt="use switches to add track matte"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Performing-Mask-Tracking-With-Adobe-After-Effects-Reviewing-the-Steps"><a href="#Part-2-Performing-Mask-Tracking-With-Adobe-After-Effects-Reviewing-the-Steps" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Performing Mask Tracking With Adobe After Effects: Reviewing the Steps"></a>Part 2: Performing Mask Tracking With Adobe After Effects: Reviewing the Steps</h2><p>Another remarkable feature that After Effects offers is mask tracking. Using <strong>After Effects mask tracking</strong>, you can automatically animate a mask’s position, shape, or path. This is done to match the movement of an object in a video clip. You can now easily deal with complex or fast-moving footage with this feature. To use <strong>Track Mask in After Effects</strong>, you can follow these steps:</p><h5 id="Step-1-1"><a href="#Step-1-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h5><p>Import the footage you wish to edit in After Effects. Select the clip you wish to track from the timeline. Then, select the “Pen” tool from the top toolbar or press G on your keyboard. Select the area around the object you wish to mask in the footage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-5.jpg"                      alt="use pen tool to mark boundary"                ></p><h5 id="Step-2-1"><a href="#Step-2-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h5><p>Now, open the layer and right-click on the mask name to select “Track Mask.” This will open the mask tracker in the tracker panel at the right. Open the dropdown menu next to the “Method” option. Here, you can find a range of options for tracking methods. Choose the one according to your requirements. If the object isn’t moving much, you can choose a simple option such as “Position.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-6.jpg"                      alt="set method for tracking"                ></p><h5 id="Step-3-1"><a href="#Step-3-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 3"></a>Step 3</h5><p>Tap the “Analyze Forward” icon and let the tracker analyze the frames in the clip.

It allows you to access the files faster and cause a good playback. If these media caches use hefty hard disk space, then to enhance playback performance.</p><p>To do so, open the Premiere Pro and go to the “Preferences” menu. From the list, select “Media Cache.” Now browse to select the media and tap on the “Delete Unused” next to the “Delete Unused Media Cache Files. After choosing the option to delete cache files, click on “OK and the files will be removed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/resolve-premiere-pro-slow-playback-issue-2.jpg"                      alt="delete media cache files slow playback"                ></p><h3 id="Solution-3-Optimize-Rendering-for-Performance"><a href="#Solution-3-Optimize-Rendering-for-Performance" class="headerlink" title="Solution 3: Optimize Rendering for Performance"></a>Solution 3: Optimize Rendering for Performance</h3><p>If <strong>Premiere Pro slow playback</strong> still exists, then use this method to fix it. Set the optimized rendering to fix the performance of playback. Press the “Edit” option from the top toolbar and choose the “Preferences.” Then, navigate toward “Memory” and find a pop-up window. From that screen, click on “Memory” dropdown and pick “Performance.” Finally, tap on “OK” and get a better playback.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/resolve-premiere-pro-slow-playback-issue-3.jpg"                      alt="optimize rendering for performance slow playback"                ></p><h3 id="Solution-4-Close-Unnecessary-Applications"><a href="#Solution-4-Close-Unnecessary-Applications" class="headerlink" title="Solution 4: Close Unnecessary Applications"></a>Solution 4: Close Unnecessary Applications</h3><p>Sometimes, lagging in playback occurs when you work on multiple applications. The system gets burdened and might slow down every process at that time. For a quick and effective solution, you should close the other tabs immediately. Only Adobe Premiere Pro and your file manager can remain open for continuous playback.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/resolve-premiere-pro-slow-playback-issue-4.jpg"                      alt="close unnecessary applications, slow playback"                ></p><h3 id="Solution-5-Turn-on-GPU-Acceleration"><a href="#Solution-5-Turn-on-GPU-Acceleration" class="headerlink" title="Solution 5: Turn on GPU Acceleration"></a>Solution 5: Turn on GPU Acceleration</h3><p>There is another fix you can try to overcome <strong>Premiere Pro playback slow</strong>. Without any delay, ensure that the Render is set to GPU Acceleration. Simply go to the “File” option at the top toolbar and click on the “Project Settings.” Then, pick “General” and set it to “Mercury Playback Engine GPU Acceleration.” This option is under the Playback Section and Video Render.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/resolve-premiere-pro-slow-playback-issue-5.jpg"                      alt="turn on gpu acceleration slow playback"                ></p><h3 id="Solution-6-Change-Playback-Resolution"><a href="#Solution-6-Change-Playback-Resolution" class="headerlink" title="Solution 6: Change Playback Resolution"></a>Solution 6: Change Playback Resolution</h3><p>Due to the higher resolution of videos, playback lagging occurs. It has a quick solution: changing the playback resolution to a lower rate. For this purpose, go to “Settings” at the top right and choose the “Dynamic Quality” option. Select a lower resolution, like 1:2 or lower. You should look for options that can reduce resolution from the original resolution of the clip.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/resolve-premiere-pro-slow-playback-issue-6.jpg"                      alt="change playback resolution slow playback"                ></p><h3 id="Solution-7-Use-Proxy-Videos-in-Adobe"><a href="#Solution-7-Use-Proxy-Videos-in-Adobe" class="headerlink" title="Solution 7: Use Proxy Videos in Adobe"></a>Solution 7: Use Proxy Videos in Adobe</h3><p>Proxy videos are proxy files that are compressed versions of original projects. They help users edit heavy and lengthy videos with any <strong>Premiere Playback slow</strong>. In your project panel, select your video and right-click on it. From the list, choose “Proxy” and explore “Create Proxies.”</p><p>Now, pick the “Codec” option from another window and tap “QuickTime.” Specify a location for proxies and try to keep them in a new folder with the original media. Lastly, click “OK,” and Adobe Media Encoder will instantly produce video proxies.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/resolve-premiere-pro-slow-playback-issue-7.jpg"                      alt="use proxy videos slow playback"                ></p><h3 id="Solution-8-Mute-FX-Effects"><a href="#Solution-8-Mute-FX-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Solution 8: Mute FX Effects"></a>Solution 8: Mute FX Effects</h3><p>The working size of video files gets increased with visual and audio effects. If your videos are still lagging in playbacks, then head to mute those effects to fix this issue. From the playback toolbar, choose the “fx” button. Alternatively, click on the “+” icon at the top right side of Program Monitor. Drag it to the button panel and press the “fx” button to toggle it “Off.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/resolve-premiere-pro-slow-playback-issue-8.jpg"                      alt="mute fx effects slow playback"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Make-the-Slow-Motion-Video-Making-Easy-with-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Part-3-Make-the-Slow-Motion-Video-Making-Easy-with-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Make the Slow-Motion Video Making Easy with Wondershare Filmora"></a>Part 3: Make the Slow-Motion Video Making Easy with Wondershare Filmora</h2><p>Apart from <strong>Premiere Pro’s slow playback</strong>, it’s a difficult tool to work with.

It acts as a stencil, determining which parts of the underlying layer are visible and which are transparent. Track mattes are used for creating various effects such as text animations, transitions, and seamlessly composing multiple layers. After Effects offers four Track Matte options:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-1.jpg"                      alt="alpha track matte"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Alpha Matte:</strong> <strong>Alpha matte in After Effects</strong> allows white areas in the matte layer to become visible while black areas become transparent. Effectively, this helps the underlying layer to show through.</li><li><strong>Alpha Inverted Matte:</strong> In an alpha inverted matte, black areas in the matte layer are visible, and white areas are transparent. It reverses the transparency values to create unique effects.</li><li><strong>Luma Matte:</strong> A luma matte uses the brightness values of the matte layer to determine visibility. Bright areas in the matte layer are visible, while dark areas are transparent.</li><li><strong>Luma Inverted Matte:</strong> The luma inverted matte works opposite to the luma matte. The top layer’s dark areas are visible, while bright areas are transparent.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-2.jpg"                      alt="luma track matte"                ></p><p>You can use any of the <strong>track mattes in After Effects</strong> according to your requirements. Following is a step-by-step guide on how to use track mattes:</p><h5 id="Step-1"><a href="#Step-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h5><p>To apply a track matte to your video, you must work with two layers. The top layer acts as the alpha or the luminance layer. The bottom layer acts as the fill. Once you have identified the layers, you can proceed to the next step.</p><h5 id="Step-2"><a href="#Step-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h5><p>Go to the “Modes” column and open the dropdown menu next to “Layer List.” Here, select the layer you wish to use as the track matte.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-3.jpg"                      alt="select track matte layer"                ></p><h5 id="Step-3"><a href="#Step-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3"></a>Step 3</h5><p>You will see two toggle switches once you select your layer. You can use these switches and the available options to set the transparency for the Track Matte. You can add <strong>alpha matte in After Effects</strong> or other types from here.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-4.jpg"                      alt="use switches to add track matte"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Performing-Mask-Tracking-With-Adobe-After-Effects-Reviewing-the-Steps"><a href="#Part-2-Performing-Mask-Tracking-With-Adobe-After-Effects-Reviewing-the-Steps" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Performing Mask Tracking With Adobe After Effects: Reviewing the Steps"></a>Part 2: Performing Mask Tracking With Adobe After Effects: Reviewing the Steps</h2><p>Another remarkable feature that After Effects offers is mask tracking. Using <strong>After Effects mask tracking</strong>, you can automatically animate a mask’s position, shape, or path. This is done to match the movement of an object in a video clip. You can now easily deal with complex or fast-moving footage with this feature. To use <strong>Track Mask in After Effects</strong>, you can follow these steps:</p><h5 id="Step-1-1"><a href="#Step-1-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h5><p>Import the footage you wish to edit in After Effects. Select the clip you wish to track from the timeline. Then, select the “Pen” tool from the top toolbar or press G on your keyboard. Select the area around the object you wish to mask in the footage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-5.jpg"                      alt="use pen tool to mark boundary"                ></p><h5 id="Step-2-1"><a href="#Step-2-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h5><p>Now, open the layer and right-click on the mask name to select “Track Mask.” This will open the mask tracker in the tracker panel at the right. Open the dropdown menu next to the “Method” option. Here, you can find a range of options for tracking methods. Choose the one according to your requirements. If the object isn’t moving much, you can choose a simple option such as “Position.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-6.jpg"                      alt="set method for tracking"                ></p><h5 id="Step-3-1"><a href="#Step-3-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 3"></a>Step 3</h5><p>Tap the “Analyze Forward” icon and let the tracker analyze the frames in the clip. Once the process has finished, you can restart your clip and set “Mask Mode” from the timeline to “Subtract.” This will remove the selected object from the clip.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-7.jpg"                      alt="analyze and change mode"                ></p><h5 id="Step-4"><a href="#Step-4" class="headerlink" title="Step 4"></a>Step 4</h5><p>To fill in the details, go to the “Window” menu from the top and select “Content Aware Fill.” Once you see the panel on the screen, set the “Alpha Extension” slider to a number of your choice and click on “Generate Fill Layer.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-8.jpg"                      alt="use content fill properties"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Make-Masking-Easy-Try-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Make-Masking-Easy-Try-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Make Masking Easy?

Its popularity has been well received by those under thirty. A Beijing-based company, ByteDance, owns it. It has been downloaded over 315 million times by users worldwide. It generates over $50 million in revenue from users.</p><p>This leads us towards a discussion of how the platform works and, more specifically, how to create a video with the correct TikTok aspect ratios to gain popularity. This article covers essential tips about video size ratio and other little tricks to make your videos better.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [TikTok: Brief Definition ](#Part 1)</p><p>02 [TikTok Video Tips You Should Know](#Part 2)</p><h2 id="Part-1-TikTok-Brief-Definition"><a href="#Part-1-TikTok-Brief-Definition" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 TikTok: Brief Definition"></a>Part 1 TikTok: Brief Definition</h2><p>Social media is one of the fastest ways to gain popularity. Using TikTok challenges and trends, content creators and businesses can drive their profits, popularity, and high visibility. The app allows users to create, edit and share short videos, which are made more entertaining with filters and music, dancing, and lipsyncing.</p><p>Tiktok has a certain prescribed video width and height to make videos. This TikTok ratio allows users to be perceived favorably in the program algorithm. The main reason why users are drawn to TikTok is for entertainment and to foster a sense of community.</p><p>The brief 15-60 second videos can offer entertainment for any duration, no matter how short. It remains a popular site frequented by teenagers and young adults. Thanks to the popularity of challenge videos and honest product reviews, it becomes a go-to haven for them. This makes Tiktok an ideal platform for marketing aimed at that demographic.</p><h2 id="Part-2-TikTok-Video-Tips-You-Should-Know"><a href="#Part-2-TikTok-Video-Tips-You-Should-Know" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 TikTok Video Tips You Should Know"></a>Part 2 TikTok Video Tips You Should Know</h2><p>In TikTok, the video creation editing process goes hand in hand. You can edit a video as you create it. As you start and stop your video, your videos are going to be automatically ‘stitched’ together. This does not mean you can’t trim the videos and edit them after they are made.</p><p>Similarly, if you’re not happy with how the video turned out, you can select the backspace button to delete the video on the app. Now let’s dive into the TikTok Video ratios that will make your videos shine.</p><p>Another thing that helps you form video ratios for TikTok is to know the audience. The TikTok gender ratio among US viewers is skewed to be 61% female and 39% male.</p><h3 id="2-1-TikTok-Video-Format"><a href="#2-1-TikTok-Video-Format" class="headerlink" title="2.1 TikTok Video Format"></a>2.1 TikTok Video Format</h3><p>There is a difference in the specification of videos for android and ios. For example, TikTok allows 72 MB on Android or 287.6 MB in size for iOS. The videos are designed to be viewed on mobile so aiming for vertical videos helps promote your videos on the algorithm.</p><p>The frame size for a TikTok video should be 1080 x1920 pixels. This gives the highest quality video output. As a content creator, it is advised to record videos in the .mp4 file format. Ad-creators should look into the .avi and .gif formats for better placements.</p><p>You can use premium video editing software like Wondershare Filmora to edit your videos. It offers cutting-edge features like motion tracking, color matching videos, and offering a split screen in the same video. This can help push your creativity to its full potential.</p><h4 id="Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Wondershare Filmora"></a>Wondershare Filmora</h4><p>Get started easily with Filmora’s powerful performance, intuitive interface, and countless effects!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Learn More about Filmora&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box-right-side.png"                      alt="download"                ></p><h3 id="2-2-Titktok-Video-Aspect-Ratios-How-To-Resize-It"><a href="#2-2-Titktok-Video-Aspect-Ratios-How-To-Resize-It" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Titktok Video Aspect Ratios &amp; How To Resize It"></a>2.2 Titktok Video Aspect Ratios &amp; How To Resize It</h3><p>The width of an image or video frame in relation to its height is known as the aspect ratio. It defines the proportion of your content asset. This can be important as it influences how nice the video turns out when viewed. It determines the final shape of your video.</p><p>Finding the correct video dimensions for TikTok can be a challenge. This section deals with the aspect ratios of video and what you can do to have the perfect video ratio for TikTok.</p><p>Finding the proper aspect ratio is important because it influences how your videos look on different platforms, which drives your TikTok like to follower ratio.

This can boost your video’s rating in the algorithm and, in turn, skyrocket your popularity on the platform.</p><p>Let’s say a creator is in possession of a video they made. They realize that the video is not in the correct TikTok video ratio. The algorithm approves a specific TikTok video width and height.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p>They can do one of two things, upload the video as is, and hope for the best.

Adobe AfterEffects for tikTok is an alternative you can use to change the video aspect ratio as well.</p><h3 id="2-3-Change-Tiktok-Video-From-Landscape-To-Portrait"><a href="#2-3-Change-Tiktok-Video-From-Landscape-To-Portrait" class="headerlink" title="2.3 Change Tiktok Video From Landscape To Portrait"></a>2.3 Change Tiktok Video From Landscape To Portrait</h3><p>Tiktok can support videos made in portrait or landscape mode. However, creators should focus on creating videos in portrait mode. This is because TikTok’s algorithm favors vertical videos over horizontal ones.</p><p>Considering TikTok users use their mobiles to view the video, this makes portrait mode the better option for ensuring video success.</p><p>Tiktok allows users to create a video in portrait mode and editing after. You can also create a video in landscape mode for TikTok. Tiktok also enables users to upload a video in landscape mode.</p><p>Alternatively, you can use a video editing app like Wondershare Filmora. This video editing app makes it easy to convert the file from your previous aspect ratio to those favored by TikTok, YouTube, or Instagram.</p><p>It helps retain the high definition with smaller file size and better effects. If you want to post across platforms, using Filmora video editing can help you save valuable editing time. Thanks to its auto-editing options, even beginners can create professional-level videos.</p><p>Another way to change the TikTok size is to use Adobe Premiere Pro. Premiere Pro is capable of performing all of the everyday video editing operations required to create high-definition footage. It allows inputs that can then be exported to the appropriate medium and format different platforms.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/tiktok-aspect-ratio-pic-1.jpg"                      alt="Tiktok logo"                ></p><h3 id="2-4-Make-Fullscreen-Tiktok-Video"><a href="#2-4-Make-Fullscreen-Tiktok-Video" class="headerlink" title="2.4 Make Fullscreen Tiktok Video"></a>2.4 Make Fullscreen Tiktok Video</h3><p>It can be a frustrating experience to watch a Tiktok video when you have the For you tab at the top, blocking your video. The like button and share buttons all do a number on your valuable screen space at the sides. The comment section with the scrolling ribbons of comments is the worst offender at making the TikTok video seem unappealing.</p><p>One way you can make your TikTok experience better is through full-screen viewing of your TikTok video. You can do this by simply saving the video to your phone. Save the video by pressing the share button. In the second half of the share section, you have the “save video” option, and you can select this for a blissful video viewing experience.</p><p>One other way users can view TikTok on full screen is to go to their android’s ‘settings’ page. Go into the ‘Display and Brightness’ settings. Look for the tab titled ‘Full-Screen Display”. In this section, scroll down to TikTok and select. Once there, enable ‘Notch Area Display.’</p><p>There you go, your TikTok account can now be graced with full-screen videos. This will make the user experience a lot better.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>One of the keys to creating high-quality content for your brand on social media is recognizing how much aspect ratio brings to the table and how to apply it to your videos and images. There is no doubt that using videos for promotion is the most effective technique to increase brand engagement nowadays.</p><p>To make it easy to cut, edit, and even design your images and movies for the most outstanding performance, use an excellent online video editor like Wondershare Filmora. It’s one of the best video editors for both beginners and experienced professionals.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>TikTok is one of the most popular social media apps for short-form video sharing.

You can make commercials, animated movies etc. Here are some questions from which you will get to know everything you need to know:</p><h3 id="01What-is-an-Online-Storyboard"><a href="#01What-is-an-Online-Storyboard" class="headerlink" title="01What is an Online Storyboard?"></a>01What is an Online Storyboard?</h3><p>Online Storyboard allows you to create animation videos or films on a web based platform, which is credible in the sense that you do not need to be device specific to use the tool. A web based storyboard works in all your preferred devices and smart phones.

Here are some main components:</p><p><strong>●</strong> Learning purpose</p><p><strong>●</strong> A detailed description of communication</p><p><strong>●</strong> Informatory Strategies to teach the learners</p><p><strong>●</strong> Format should be perfect according to the topic</p><p><strong>●</strong> Proper information of audio with file names</p><p><strong>●</strong> Feedback for the assessment</p><h3 id="03Why-do-you-need-a-Storyboard"><a href="#03Why-do-you-need-a-Storyboard" class="headerlink" title="03Why do you need a Storyboard?"></a>03Why do you need a Storyboard?</h3><p>A Storyboard is a process of pre- production. It lets you know how your story is going to flow. You will get to know the mistakes in the early stages if you make a storyboard and this will help you to save your money and time. Here are some essentials because of which you need to have a storyboard.</p><p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Is this concept is going to work? -</strong> A storyboard lets you know whether the concept is going to work out or not. A storyboard helps the client to confirm whether the concept will work or not.</p><p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Arranging Shots -</strong> A Storyboard lets you to tell you story in a limited time frame in the best way. In commercials we don’t have much time. It is like you have 60 seconds, 30 seconds, or sometimes it is just 15 seconds. So, it is the best way to make every shot count.</p><p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Saving Money -</strong> Before making the final product, it is better to have an accepted storyboard from your client. In complex animations, it takes a lot of time and money so it is better to have an approved storyboard. This will let you know how the final product would look like. This will let the client know what is on your mind.</p><p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Recognizing the mistakes -</strong> On a storyboarding phase, you can recognize the mistakes related to the media, narration or any other details. This will save your energy, time and money and then you will be ready for the production phase.</p><p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Agreement with punch lines and dialogues -</strong> When you are creating a storyboard you can check whether the dialogues and punch lines work together as you have planned before. It is very important to check that the dialogues and punches are delivered in the exact way that you have imagined.</p><h3 id="04How-to-Label-Storyboards"><a href="#04How-to-Label-Storyboards" class="headerlink" title="04How to Label Storyboards?"></a>04How to Label Storyboards?</h3><p>If you are using numerous storyboards for the same shot, keeping the shots labeled is important so that everything is arranged in an order and your team can stay focused and organized. If you will use any software it will name the panel numbers automatically. In case you are not using any software and your client wants to delete, add or move a panel then you can’t name that panel.</p><p>For example: Panel_7_New_New_New. It will be very difficult to figure out and also time consuming. The correct way to do is this: Project name_ Script#_Scene_Frame_01.JPG</p><h3 id="05Do-Storyboards-have-Dialogues"><a href="#05Do-Storyboards-have-Dialogues" class="headerlink" title="05Do Storyboards have Dialogues?"></a>05Do Storyboards have Dialogues?</h3><p>Storyboards have dialogues and you can include dialogues which will flow underneath the panels for each and every scene. If you want, you can save it on your drawing. You can name the angles and just specify them “OTS 1” and “OTS 2” with the corresponding dialogues.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Best-10-Storyboards-Creators-To-Make-Your-Animation-Stand-Out"><a href="#Part-2-Best-10-Storyboards-Creators-To-Make-Your-Animation-Stand-Out" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Best 10 Storyboards Creators To Make Your Animation Stand Out"></a>Part 2 Best 10 Storyboards Creators To Make Your Animation Stand Out</h2><h3 id="01Milanote"><a href="#01Milanote" class="headerlink" title="01Milanote"></a>01Milanote</h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free for limited number of file uploads and paid version for $9.99 per month for unlimited file uploads.</p><p><strong>Platform:</strong> Web, Android, iPhone and IPad.</p><p><strong>Description</strong></p><p>If you want to create your storyboard from scratch, Milanote is the best choice.
