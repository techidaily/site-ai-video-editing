Here, we will be helping you find the best way to create animated videos for your particular project.</p>
<p>It is important to point out that there are very many animation programs in the market and choosing the best one will depend on your needs, your style, the feature and tools you need, the cost of the program, and even the export options that each tool gives you.</p>
<p>Before we look at the best ways to create animated videos, let’s start by examining why you would need to use an animated video maker in the first place.</p>
<h2 id="When-to-Use-an-Animated-Video-Maker"><a href="#When-to-Use-an-Animated-Video-Maker" class="headerlink" title="When to Use an Animated Video Maker"></a>When to Use an Animated Video Maker</h2><p>There are several reasons why you would want to create an animated video, rather than use traditional video solutions. The following are the most important from a digital marketing standpoint;</p>
<p><strong>Improve Conversion and Sales</strong></p>
<p>Animated videos are engaging enough to improve your conversion and sales. Studies have shown that an animated video can increase both conversion and sales by up to 80%. It may therefore be a good idea to use an animated explainer video to show your potential customers how to purchase a product or service on your website.</p>
<p><strong>Increase Brand Awareness</strong></p>
<p>Because they can be very entertaining and engaging, animated videos can also be a great way to increase brand awareness. And since they can be created very easily and cheaply, they can be a good way to reach potential customers.</p>
<p><strong>Generate Online Leads</strong></p>
<p>Because of the engaging nature of animated videos, you can use them to introduce yourself to potential customers and generate online leads. They have a very high conversion rate, as we have seen before, making them one of the best ways to reach people who would otherwise have never heard of you and your brand.</p>
<p><strong>Explain Complex Processes</strong></p>

But a well-crafted animated video gives you the chance to explain complex ideas in a fun and engaging way, making it easier for your customers to understand and engage with your brand.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Principles-for-Great-GIF-Design"><a href="#Part-1-Principles-for-Great-GIF-Design" class="headerlink" title="Part 1  Principles for Great GIF Design"></a>Part 1  Principles for Great GIF Design</h2><p>Creating GIFs for infotainment or casual information sharing is the current talk of the trend. You might have visibly landed across a heap of tantalizing GIFs in blogs, social media posts, product promotion websites and almost every other domain you can possibly think of. Using GIFs for any type of content promotion is bound to captivate the target audience in impressive multiplicities. Ever wondered what’s the cue behind the mass appeal that GIFs create? Well, an obvious answer is the stunning <strong>GIF design</strong>.</p>
<p>When going for GIF creation and selection, design plays the key role in creating considerable buzz about the information being transmitted. To add impact to your creation, you need to pay considerable attention to its design implications, thus ensuring that the right things get presented in the right way. Outlined below are some amazing principles you can use to enhance your GIF design to the next level:</p>
<h3 id="01Ensure-Accuracy-and-Preciseness"><a href="#01Ensure-Accuracy-and-Preciseness" class="headerlink" title="01Ensure Accuracy and Preciseness"></a>01Ensure Accuracy and Preciseness</h3><p>The primary concern you need to be attentive about while designing a GIF is its preciseness. Ensure ban exactness of information and confine your creation to the theme and requirement of your creation, like, the message you want to deliver or the impact you want to create through the GIF. Balance your creativity within specific content parameters and avoid getting carried away or overdoing on the beautifying aspect.</p>
<p>As an example, it is visibly not appealing to add a wholesome mix of 15 shades and 20 different elements in a nature-based GIF. You will end up getting too harsh on the viewers’ eyes, confusing them with a hoard of speeding elements and banging colors. You can instead stick to 2 or 3 frames with an intelligent mix of 2 complementary shades.</p>
<h3 id="02Maintain-Visual-Identity"><a href="#02Maintain-Visual-Identity" class="headerlink" title="02Maintain Visual Identity"></a>02Maintain Visual Identity</h3><p>An important aspect to keep in mind while attempting to <strong>design GIF</strong> is, it should visually relate to the underlying content. For instance, if you are intending a brand promotion through your GIF, lay stress on adding elements like, brand definition, product specifications, know-how of your work patterns, etc. ensure that your content flows naturally and has exactness.</p>
<p>Other alternatives are, using your product logo as the GIF background, character representation of your brand or using some explicit product oriented themes. While, you are free to pick anything that suits your preferences and needs, just make sure that using it in your GIF adds value to your brand instead of giving an out of the box feel.</p>

<h3 id="03Cut-Down-on-Unnecessary-Frames"><a href="#03Cut-Down-on-Unnecessary-Frames" class="headerlink" title="03Cut Down on Unnecessary Frames"></a>03Cut Down on Unnecessary Frames</h3><p>Have you ever encountered a halt in the natural loop of your GIF out of nowhere? While pondering over the underlying cause, it is a common assumption to take this as an animation fallacy, but that’s evidently not the case. The actual culprits behind this glitch are those extra frames that contribute towards nothing but adding weight to an already heavy file.</p>
<p>To set this straight, you should switch to removing any extra frames, while saving a particular one which you may stretch to a desired duration according to the break point of your contents in the GIF. However, take caution to maintain the visual quality of your GIF while you remove those extra frames.</p>
<h3 id="04Make-Your-GIF-Accessible"><a href="#04Make-Your-GIF-Accessible" class="headerlink" title="04Make Your GIF Accessible"></a>04Make Your GIF Accessible</h3><p>You should always adhere to the concern of accessibility while creating a GIF. The reason being, your content is visibly going to get mass attention across the web and you cannot filter out visitors, make sure your GIF is easily accessible to all kind of users, particularly those with vision limitations, like, epileptic patients or the ones using screen readers.</p>
<p>Focus on describing your GIF content with alt text and using a limited blinking and flashing rate. In case your GIF content is primarily text based, take care to limit the effective color and image movement and adjust the frames rates to avoid constant and quick movement of image frames when adding many clips on a single page.</p>
<p>Pay additional heed to the auto play feature of your GIFs. It can be visibly annoying to be welcomed on a site homepage with GIFs enjoying an auto play session of their own. You can alternatively, incorporate a ‘Click to Play’ option or grant your site visitors the liberty to decide on what is to be played when.</p>

<h3 id="05Use-Storyboards"><a href="#05Use-Storyboards" class="headerlink" title="05Use Storyboards"></a>05Use Storyboards</h3><p>When aiming to create visibly appealing GIFs, you need to lay considerable stress on choosing an apt background story. Don’t get misled by the wrong assumption of using any random background, owing to the short play duration of GIFs. An impressive solution to this concern is taking the help of a storyboard to keep track of your GIF’s content flow.</p>
<p>Using a storyboard is quite effective means of being in line with the direction of content movement, rescuing you from the hustle of going off the track. This comes explicitly handy when you are working with a team of creators. The storyboard is there to keep everything at the exact place, thus improving member communications and boosting up the design process.</p>

<h3 id="06Focus-on-Creating-Loops"><a href="#06Focus-on-Creating-Loops" class="headerlink" title="06Focus on Creating Loops"></a>06Focus on Creating Loops</h3><p>Consider creating an animated motion loop for your GIF allowing a repeated and comprehensive view of your content. Looping projects a deeper observation of the clip and its contents in a seamless transition. However, creating an infinite motion loop in GIFs is quite tricky, as you need to pay utmost concern to ensure a smooth content flow and chances of even the slightest errors are not entertained.</p>
<p>Any loopholes in placement of your GIF elements will get noticed within a blink and lead to an unsatisfactory user experience. Hence, you need to check each of your content frames separately to eliminate chances of possible errors. If you are a beginner, try working with geometrical animations to get the initial pickup. This will be advantageous in deciding the exact element positions at the start and end of the GIF.</p>

<h3 id="07Make-Use-of-Motion-Blur"><a href="#07Make-Use-of-Motion-Blur" class="headerlink" title="07Make Use of Motion Blur"></a>07Make Use of Motion Blur</h3><p>Using the concept of motion blur is pivotal in providing a natural flow and feel to your GIF, which, in an otherwise case would ordinarily appear as a mere collection of static images clubbed together. This would give a wobbling feel with unsteady frame movements to your viewers. The motion blur effect potentially ensures a smooth content flow, and your GIF looks like a short video captured from a camera.</p>

<h3 id="08Stick-to-a-Reduced-File-Size"><a href="#08Stick-to-a-Reduced-File-Size" class="headerlink" title="08Stick to a Reduced File Size"></a>08Stick to a Reduced File Size</h3><p>Creating GIF of within a standard size range is quite difficult, owing to the fact that these are shared across a variety of media platforms, each having a different file size constraint. It is, however, recommended to stick to a file size as low as possible to escape the notch of modifying the same, ener5y time you need to work with the GIF on a different platform.</p>
<p>Listed below are a few ways to limit your GIF to a lower file size:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Restrict your GIF to a frame count under 150, exceeding which, it will get difficult to export the GIF to most of the commonly visited social media and content sharing platforms.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> When your GIF is ready to export, adjust its lossy parameter between 5 and 10 to boost the file compression rate. Look for a setting that decreases the effective file size without compromising with the overall <strong>GIF design.</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Restrict to a minimum possible color usage. This will not only intensify the <strong>GIF design</strong>, but also contribute in maintaining a decreased file size. You can instead, focus on playing with animations or adjusting your image frames to longer play durations.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Don’t experiment with multiple background gradients in your GIF. You can select from either a completely opaque, or a totally transparent background. Adding unnecessary gradients will end up giving your GIF a hazy look, along with a visibly large file that will be difficult to export non any platform.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Principles-for-Great-GIF-Design-1"><a href="#Part-1-Principles-for-Great-GIF-Design-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1  Principles for Great GIF Design"></a>Part 1  Principles for Great GIF Design</h2><p>Creating GIFs for infotainment or casual information sharing is the current talk of the trend. You might have visibly landed across a heap of tantalizing GIFs in blogs, social media posts, product promotion websites and almost every other domain you can possibly think of. Using GIFs for any type of content promotion is bound to captivate the target audience in impressive multiplicities. Ever wondered what’s the cue behind the mass appeal that GIFs create? Well, an obvious answer is the stunning <strong>GIF design</strong>.</p>
<p>When going for GIF creation and selection, design plays the key role in creating considerable buzz about the information being transmitted. To add impact to your creation, you need to pay considerable attention to its design implications, thus ensuring that the right things get presented in the right way. Outlined below are some amazing principles you can use to enhance your GIF design to the next level:</p>
<h3 id="01Ensure-Accuracy-and-Preciseness-1"><a href="#01Ensure-Accuracy-and-Preciseness-1" class="headerlink" title="01Ensure Accuracy and Preciseness"></a>01Ensure Accuracy and Preciseness</h3><p>The primary concern you need to be attentive about while designing a GIF is its preciseness. Ensure ban exactness of information and confine your creation to the theme and requirement of your creation, like, the message you want to deliver or the impact you want to create through the GIF. Balance your creativity within specific content parameters and avoid getting carried away or overdoing on the beautifying aspect.</p>
<p>As an example, it is visibly not appealing to add a wholesome mix of 15 shades and 20 different elements in a nature-based GIF. You will end up getting too harsh on the viewers’ eyes, confusing them with a hoard of speeding elements and banging colors. You can instead stick to 2 or 3 frames with an intelligent mix of 2 complementary shades.</p>
<h3 id="02Maintain-Visual-Identity-1"><a href="#02Maintain-Visual-Identity-1" class="headerlink" title="02Maintain Visual Identity"></a>02Maintain Visual Identity</h3><p>An important aspect to keep in mind while attempting to <strong>design GIF</strong> is, it should visually relate to the underlying content. For instance, if you are intending a brand promotion through your GIF, lay stress on adding elements like, brand definition, product specifications, know-how of your work patterns, etc. ensure that your content flows naturally and has exactness.</p>
<p>Other alternatives are, using your product logo as the GIF background, character representation of your brand or using some explicit product oriented themes. While, you are free to pick anything that suits your preferences and needs, just make sure that using it in your GIF adds value to your brand instead of giving an out of the box feel.</p>

<h3 id="03Cut-Down-on-Unnecessary-Frames-1"><a href="#03Cut-Down-on-Unnecessary-Frames-1" class="headerlink" title="03Cut Down on Unnecessary Frames"></a>03Cut Down on Unnecessary Frames</h3><p>Have you ever encountered a halt in the natural loop of your GIF out of nowhere? While pondering over the underlying cause, it is a common assumption to take this as an animation fallacy, but that’s evidently not the case. The actual culprits behind this glitch are those extra frames that contribute towards nothing but adding weight to an already heavy file.</p>
<p>To set this straight, you should switch to removing any extra frames, while saving a particular one which you may stretch to a desired duration according to the break point of your contents in the GIF. However, take caution to maintain the visual quality of your GIF while you remove those extra frames.</p>
<h3 id="04Make-Your-GIF-Accessible-1"><a href="#04Make-Your-GIF-Accessible-1" class="headerlink" title="04Make Your GIF Accessible"></a>04Make Your GIF Accessible</h3><p>You should always adhere to the concern of accessibility while creating a GIF. The reason being, your content is visibly going to get mass attention across the web and you cannot filter out visitors, make sure your GIF is easily accessible to all kind of users, particularly those with vision limitations, like, epileptic patients or the ones using screen readers.</p>
<p>Focus on describing your GIF content with alt text and using a limited blinking and flashing rate. In case your GIF content is primarily text based, take care to limit the effective color and image movement and adjust the frames rates to avoid constant and quick movement of image frames when adding many clips on a single page.</p>
<p>Pay additional heed to the auto play feature of your GIFs. It can be visibly annoying to be welcomed on a site homepage with GIFs enjoying an auto play session of their own. You can alternatively, incorporate a ‘Click to Play’ option or grant your site visitors the liberty to decide on what is to be played when.</p>

<h3 id="05Use-Storyboards-1"><a href="#05Use-Storyboards-1" class="headerlink" title="05Use Storyboards"></a>05Use Storyboards</h3><p>When aiming to create visibly appealing GIFs, you need to lay considerable stress on choosing an apt background story. Don’t get misled by the wrong assumption of using any random background, owing to the short play duration of GIFs. An impressive solution to this concern is taking the help of a storyboard to keep track of your GIF’s content flow.</p>
<p>Using a storyboard is quite effective means of being in line with the direction of content movement, rescuing you from the hustle of going off the track. This comes explicitly handy when you are working with a team of creators. The storyboard is there to keep everything at the exact place, thus improving member communications and boosting up the design process.</p>

<h3 id="06Focus-on-Creating-Loops-1"><a href="#06Focus-on-Creating-Loops-1" class="headerlink" title="06Focus on Creating Loops"></a>06Focus on Creating Loops</h3><p>Consider creating an animated motion loop for your GIF allowing a repeated and comprehensive view of your content. Looping projects a deeper observation of the clip and its contents in a seamless transition. However, creating an infinite motion loop in GIFs is quite tricky, as you need to pay utmost concern to ensure a smooth content flow and chances of even the slightest errors are not entertained.</p>
<p>Any loopholes in placement of your GIF elements will get noticed within a blink and lead to an unsatisfactory user experience. Hence, you need to check each of your content frames separately to eliminate chances of possible errors. If you are a beginner, try working with geometrical animations to get the initial pickup. This will be advantageous in deciding the exact element positions at the start and end of the GIF.</p>

This would give a wobbling feel with unsteady frame movements to your viewers. The motion blur effect potentially ensures a smooth content flow, and your GIF looks like a short video captured from a camera.</p>

It is, however, recommended to stick to a file size as low as possible to escape the notch of modifying the same, ener5y time you need to work with the GIF on a different platform.</p>
<p>Listed below are a few ways to limit your GIF to a lower file size:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Restrict your GIF to a frame count under 150, exceeding which, it will get difficult to export the GIF to most of the commonly visited social media and content sharing platforms.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> When your GIF is ready to export, adjust its lossy parameter between 5 and 10 to boost the file compression rate. Look for a setting that decreases the effective file size without compromising with the overall <strong>GIF design.</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Restrict to a minimum possible color usage. This will not only intensify the <strong>GIF design</strong>, but also contribute in maintaining a decreased file size. You can instead, focus on playing with animations or adjusting your image frames to longer play durations.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Don’t experiment with multiple background gradients in your GIF. You can select from either a completely opaque, or a totally transparent background. Adding unnecessary gradients will end up giving your GIF a hazy look, along with a visibly large file that will be difficult to export non any platform.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Principles-for-Great-GIF-Design-2"><a href="#Part-1-Principles-for-Great-GIF-Design-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1  Principles for Great GIF Design"></a>Part 1  Principles for Great GIF Design</h2><p>Creating GIFs for infotainment or casual information sharing is the current talk of the trend. You might have visibly landed across a heap of tantalizing GIFs in blogs, social media posts, product promotion websites and almost every other domain you can possibly think of. Using GIFs for any type of content promotion is bound to captivate the target audience in impressive multiplicities. Ever wondered what’s the cue behind the mass appeal that GIFs create? Well, an obvious answer is the stunning <strong>GIF design</strong>.</p>
<p>When going for GIF creation and selection, design plays the key role in creating considerable buzz about the information being transmitted. To add impact to your creation, you need to pay considerable attention to its design implications, thus ensuring that the right things get presented in the right way. Outlined below are some amazing principles you can use to enhance your GIF design to the next level:</p>
<h3 id="01Ensure-Accuracy-and-Preciseness-2"><a href="#01Ensure-Accuracy-and-Preciseness-2" class="headerlink" title="01Ensure Accuracy and Preciseness"></a>01Ensure Accuracy and Preciseness</h3><p>The primary concern you need to be attentive about while designing a GIF is its preciseness. Ensure ban exactness of information and confine your creation to the theme and requirement of your creation, like, the message you want to deliver or the impact you want to create through the GIF. Balance your creativity within specific content parameters and avoid getting carried away or overdoing on the beautifying aspect.</p>
<p>As an example, it is visibly not appealing to add a wholesome mix of 15 shades and 20 different elements in a nature-based GIF. You will end up getting too harsh on the viewers’ eyes, confusing them with a hoard of speeding elements and banging colors. You can instead stick to 2 or 3 frames with an intelligent mix of 2 complementary shades.</p>
<h3 id="02Maintain-Visual-Identity-2"><a href="#02Maintain-Visual-Identity-2" class="headerlink" title="02Maintain Visual Identity"></a>02Maintain Visual Identity</h3><p>An important aspect to keep in mind while attempting to <strong>design GIF</strong> is, it should visually relate to the underlying content. For instance, if you are intending a brand promotion through your GIF, lay stress on adding elements like, brand definition, product specifications, know-how of your work patterns, etc. ensure that your content flows naturally and has exactness.</p>
<p>Other alternatives are, using your product logo as the GIF background, character representation of your brand or using some explicit product oriented themes. While, you are free to pick anything that suits your preferences and needs, just make sure that using it in your GIF adds value to your brand instead of giving an out of the box feel.</p>

<h3 id="03Cut-Down-on-Unnecessary-Frames-2"><a href="#03Cut-Down-on-Unnecessary-Frames-2" class="headerlink" title="03Cut Down on Unnecessary Frames"></a>03Cut Down on Unnecessary Frames</h3><p>Have you ever encountered a halt in the natural loop of your GIF out of nowhere? While pondering over the underlying cause, it is a common assumption to take this as an animation fallacy, but that’s evidently not the case. The actual culprits behind this glitch are those extra frames that contribute towards nothing but adding weight to an already heavy file.</p>
<p>To set this straight, you should switch to removing any extra frames, while saving a particular one which you may stretch to a desired duration according to the break point of your contents in the GIF. However, take caution to maintain the visual quality of your GIF while you remove those extra frames.</p>
<h3 id="04Make-Your-GIF-Accessible-2"><a href="#04Make-Your-GIF-Accessible-2" class="headerlink" title="04Make Your GIF Accessible"></a>04Make Your GIF Accessible</h3><p>You should always adhere to the concern of accessibility while creating a GIF. The reason being, your content is visibly going to get mass attention across the web and you cannot filter out visitors, make sure your GIF is easily accessible to all kind of users, particularly those with vision limitations, like, epileptic patients or the ones using screen readers.</p>
<p>Focus on describing your GIF content with alt text and using a limited blinking and flashing rate. In case your GIF content is primarily text based, take care to limit the effective color and image movement and adjust the frames rates to avoid constant and quick movement of image frames when adding many clips on a single page.</p>
<p>Pay additional heed to the auto play feature of your GIFs. It can be visibly annoying to be welcomed on a site homepage with GIFs enjoying an auto play session of their own. You can alternatively, incorporate a ‘Click to Play’ option or grant your site visitors the liberty to decide on what is to be played when.</p>

<h3 id="05Use-Storyboards-2"><a href="#05Use-Storyboards-2" class="headerlink" title="05Use Storyboards"></a>05Use Storyboards</h3><p>When aiming to create visibly appealing GIFs, you need to lay considerable stress on choosing an apt background story. Don’t get misled by the wrong assumption of using any random background, owing to the short play duration of GIFs. An impressive solution to this concern is taking the help of a storyboard to keep track of your GIF’s content flow.</p>
<p>Using a storyboard is quite effective means of being in line with the direction of content movement, rescuing you from the hustle of going off the track. This comes explicitly handy when you are working with a team of creators. The storyboard is there to keep everything at the exact place, thus improving member communications and boosting up the design process.</p>

<h3 id="06Focus-on-Creating-Loops-2"><a href="#06Focus-on-Creating-Loops-2" class="headerlink" title="06Focus on Creating Loops"></a>06Focus on Creating Loops</h3><p>Consider creating an animated motion loop for your GIF allowing a repeated and comprehensive view of your content. Looping projects a deeper observation of the clip and its contents in a seamless transition. However, creating an infinite motion loop in GIFs is quite tricky, as you need to pay utmost concern to ensure a smooth content flow and chances of even the slightest errors are not entertained.</p>
<p>Any loopholes in placement of your GIF elements will get noticed within a blink and lead to an unsatisfactory user experience. Hence, you need to check each of your content frames separately to eliminate chances of possible errors. If you are a beginner, try working with geometrical animations to get the initial pickup. This will be advantageous in deciding the exact element positions at the start and end of the GIF.</p>

This would give a wobbling feel with unsteady frame movements to your viewers. The motion blur effect potentially ensures a smooth content flow, and your GIF looks like a short video captured from a camera.</p>

It is, however, recommended to stick to a file size as low as possible to escape the notch of modifying the same, ener5y time you need to work with the GIF on a different platform.</p>
<p>Listed below are a few ways to limit your GIF to a lower file size:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Restrict your GIF to a frame count under 150, exceeding which, it will get difficult to export the GIF to most of the commonly visited social media and content sharing platforms.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> When your GIF is ready to export, adjust its lossy parameter between 5 and 10 to boost the file compression rate. Look for a setting that decreases the effective file size without compromising with the overall <strong>GIF design.</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Restrict to a minimum possible color usage. This will not only intensify the <strong>GIF design</strong>, but also contribute in maintaining a decreased file size. You can instead, focus on playing with animations or adjusting your image frames to longer play durations.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Don’t experiment with multiple background gradients in your GIF. You can select from either a completely opaque, or a totally transparent background. Adding unnecessary gradients will end up giving your GIF a hazy look, along with a visibly large file that will be difficult to export non any platform.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Principles-for-Great-GIF-Design-3"><a href="#Part-1-Principles-for-Great-GIF-Design-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1  Principles for Great GIF Design"></a>Part 1  Principles for Great GIF Design</h2><p>Creating GIFs for infotainment or casual information sharing is the current talk of the trend. You might have visibly landed across a heap of tantalizing GIFs in blogs, social media posts, product promotion websites and almost every other domain you can possibly think of. Using GIFs for any type of content promotion is bound to captivate the target audience in impressive multiplicities. Ever wondered what’s the cue behind the mass appeal that GIFs create? Well, an obvious answer is the stunning <strong>GIF design</strong>.</p>
<p>When going for GIF creation and selection, design plays the key role in creating considerable buzz about the information being transmitted. To add impact to your creation, you need to pay considerable attention to its design implications, thus ensuring that the right things get presented in the right way. Outlined below are some amazing principles you can use to enhance your GIF design to the next level:</p>
<h3 id="01Ensure-Accuracy-and-Preciseness-3"><a href="#01Ensure-Accuracy-and-Preciseness-3" class="headerlink" title="01Ensure Accuracy and Preciseness"></a>01Ensure Accuracy and Preciseness</h3><p>The primary concern you need to be attentive about while designing a GIF is its preciseness. Ensure ban exactness of information and confine your creation to the theme and requirement of your creation, like, the message you want to deliver or the impact you want to create through the GIF. Balance your creativity within specific content parameters and avoid getting carried away or overdoing on the beautifying aspect.</p>
<p>As an example, it is visibly not appealing to add a wholesome mix of 15 shades and 20 different elements in a nature-based GIF. You will end up getting too harsh on the viewers’ eyes, confusing them with a hoard of speeding elements and banging colors. You can instead stick to 2 or 3 frames with an intelligent mix of 2 complementary shades.</p>
<h3 id="02Maintain-Visual-Identity-3"><a href="#02Maintain-Visual-Identity-3" class="headerlink" title="02Maintain Visual Identity"></a>02Maintain Visual Identity</h3><p>An important aspect to keep in mind while attempting to <strong>design GIF</strong> is, it should visually relate to the underlying content. For instance, if you are intending a brand promotion through your GIF, lay stress on adding elements like, brand definition, product specifications, know-how of your work patterns, etc. ensure that your content flows naturally and has exactness.</p>
<p>Other alternatives are, using your product logo as the GIF background, character representation of your brand or using some explicit product oriented themes. While, you are free to pick anything that suits your preferences and needs, just make sure that using it in your GIF adds value to your brand instead of giving an out of the box feel.</p>

<h3 id="03Cut-Down-on-Unnecessary-Frames-3"><a href="#03Cut-Down-on-Unnecessary-Frames-3" class="headerlink" title="03Cut Down on Unnecessary Frames"></a>03Cut Down on Unnecessary Frames</h3><p>Have you ever encountered a halt in the natural loop of your GIF out of nowhere? While pondering over the underlying cause, it is a common assumption to take this as an animation fallacy, but that’s evidently not the case. The actual culprits behind this glitch are those extra frames that contribute towards nothing but adding weight to an already heavy file.</p>
<p>To set this straight, you should switch to removing any extra frames, while saving a particular one which you may stretch to a desired duration according to the break point of your contents in the GIF. However, take caution to maintain the visual quality of your GIF while you remove those extra frames.</p>
<h3 id="04Make-Your-GIF-Accessible-3"><a href="#04Make-Your-GIF-Accessible-3" class="headerlink" title="04Make Your GIF Accessible"></a>04Make Your GIF Accessible</h3><p>You should always adhere to the concern of accessibility while creating a GIF. The reason being, your content is visibly going to get mass attention across the web and you cannot filter out visitors, make sure your GIF is easily accessible to all kind of users, particularly those with vision limitations, like, epileptic patients or the ones using screen readers.</p>
<p>Focus on describing your GIF content with alt text and using a limited blinking and flashing rate. In case your GIF content is primarily text based, take care to limit the effective color and image movement and adjust the frames rates to avoid constant and quick movement of image frames when adding many clips on a single page.</p>
<p>Pay additional heed to the auto play feature of your GIFs. It can be visibly annoying to be welcomed on a site homepage with GIFs enjoying an auto play session of their own. You can alternatively, incorporate a ‘Click to Play’ option or grant your site visitors the liberty to decide on what is to be played when.</p>

<h3 id="05Use-Storyboards-3"><a href="#05Use-Storyboards-3" class="headerlink" title="05Use Storyboards"></a>05Use Storyboards</h3><p>When aiming to create visibly appealing GIFs, you need to lay considerable stress on choosing an apt background story. Don’t get misled by the wrong assumption of using any random background, owing to the short play duration of GIFs. An impressive solution to this concern is taking the help of a storyboard to keep track of your GIF’s content flow.</p>
<p>Using a storyboard is quite effective means of being in line with the direction of content movement, rescuing you from the hustle of going off the track. This comes explicitly handy when you are working with a team of creators. The storyboard is there to keep everything at the exact place, thus improving member communications and boosting up the design process.</p>

<h3 id="06Focus-on-Creating-Loops-3"><a href="#06Focus-on-Creating-Loops-3" class="headerlink" title="06Focus on Creating Loops"></a>06Focus on Creating Loops</h3><p>Consider creating an animated motion loop for your GIF allowing a repeated and comprehensive view of your content. Looping projects a deeper observation of the clip and its contents in a seamless transition. However, creating an infinite motion loop in GIFs is quite tricky, as you need to pay utmost concern to ensure a smooth content flow and chances of even the slightest errors are not entertained.</p>
<p>Any loopholes in placement of your GIF elements will get noticed within a blink and lead to an unsatisfactory user experience. Hence, you need to check each of your content frames separately to eliminate chances of possible errors. If you are a beginner, try working with geometrical animations to get the initial pickup. This will be advantageous in deciding the exact element positions at the start and end of the GIF.</p>

This would give a wobbling feel with unsteady frame movements to your viewers. The motion blur effect potentially ensures a smooth content flow, and your GIF looks like a short video captured from a camera.</p>

It is, however, recommended to stick to a file size as low as possible to escape the notch of modifying the same, ener5y time you need to work with the GIF on a different platform.</p>
<p>Listed below are a few ways to limit your GIF to a lower file size:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Restrict your GIF to a frame count under 150, exceeding which, it will get difficult to export the GIF to most of the commonly visited social media and content sharing platforms.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> When your GIF is ready to export, adjust its lossy parameter between 5 and 10 to boost the file compression rate. Look for a setting that decreases the effective file size without compromising with the overall <strong>GIF design.</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Restrict to a minimum possible color usage. This will not only intensify the <strong>GIF design</strong>, but also contribute in maintaining a decreased file size. You can instead, focus on playing with animations or adjusting your image frames to longer play durations.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Don’t experiment with multiple background gradients in your GIF. You can select from either a completely opaque, or a totally transparent background. Adding unnecessary gradients will end up giving your GIF a hazy look, along with a visibly large file that will be difficult to export non any platform.</p>
