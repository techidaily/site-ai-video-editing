<p>Of course, we have to thank content writer Ubaid Ullah for the article on how to get Discord GIF profile without nitro. After all, it is one of our reference points.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Create a GIF or download one that meets your taste from different websites. Currently, we have many sites offering free GIFs; hence you don’t have to worry about copyright issues. Some top websites to consider are Giphy, Gifer, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Look for a site that can translate a GIF document to the APNG file. Don’t worry about this step since you can always google the top options. We currently have the ezgif site but technology changes every day; hence you can expect rising websites.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Let’s use the ezgif website. Upon accessing it, ensure that you settle for the APNG maker icon. It is on the top left of the website.</p>

                      alt="how to get discord gif profile pic"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Check on the Crossfade Frames option. Note that you need to choose images with at most thirty frames. Finally, click on the Make APNG option</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to get discord gif profile pic without nitro"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> You can add multiple after-effects after creating the GIF to customize the final look</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Download the final file and save it on your PC with the name you wish</p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Upload on Discord</p>
<p><strong>Important things to note when uploading GIFs on Discord</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Discord only allows a file that is at least 8MBs. So, if yours isn’t, you can compress it via different websites.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A gif with nitro is neater, but a GIF without nitro works better than having an image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Even without discord Nitro, you still have access to the <strong>cool animated discord profile pics if you have a discord server.</strong> Suppose you have an <strong>animated discord profile</strong>, and then we can only see one frame without discord nitro.</p>

If you play a video recorded in the 80s, you’ll notice graininess, blurriness, and light exposure, giving the footage a dreamy vintage touch. So, in this short tutorial, we’ll learn how to create a vintage 1980-style video with a retro effect that will leave your audience yearning for more.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, we’ll add a keyframe to the third video with a lady removing her sunglasses. To do that, add the footage to the third track, then double-click the video track. After that, place the playhead at the start of the video and apply an animation keyframe before changing the opacity to 0%. Move the playhead a few keyframes forward and add another animation keyframe.</p>

<p>Go to the <strong>Effect</strong> tab and choose <strong>Overlay</strong>. Once that is done, select the <strong>TV Static</strong> option before choosing the <strong>VHS Distortion</strong> effect. This effect will give your video the retro feeling of the 1980s. Don’t be afraid to try out the TV Static effects to find what works best in your video.</p>
