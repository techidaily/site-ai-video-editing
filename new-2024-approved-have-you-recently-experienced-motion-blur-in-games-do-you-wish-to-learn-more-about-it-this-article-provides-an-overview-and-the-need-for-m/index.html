This Article Provides an Overview and the Need for Motion Blur Gaming</h2><p>Video games, as a whole, have developed exceptionally in the market over the past two decades. With new technology taking charge, different effects and enhancements have risen and introduced contemporary gaming designs. Amidst this transition, the development of games with the motion blur effect is also present. But does a gamer need a motion blur effect in their games?</p>
<p>Although motion blur is present in many game settings, it has not been acknowledged in the gaming community. However, there are still doubts about this effect. In this article, we will discuss <strong>motion blur gaming</strong> in detail. We will also decide whether gamers require a motion blur effect in their games. Read this article to know if motion blur is beneficial or problematic for gamers.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Motion-Blur"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Motion-Blur" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Motion Blur?"></a>Part 1: What is Motion Blur?</h2><p>The motion blur effect has been a part of many movies and videos. It has been used as a source to display objects moving at high speed. This effect is bridged in situations where the objects moving in speed are directed in a single direction. However, this effect is not adjusting the object in a frame but creates an apparent blur.</p>
<p>If you tend to pause that video or movie during the motion blur effect, you will find the picture blurred in a specific direction. This is because the camera records the blur as the motion information, providing a realistic effect. Many filmmakers and videographers utilize this feature and tend to develop a sense of fast-moving objects. This advancement has turned out to be quite successful.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="what is motion blur"
                ></p>
<p>With the help of the information recorded through motion blur, the high-speed objects moving within the frame are coherent within the 24 frames, which is the standard frame rate per second. However, motion blur has also been tested at 29.97 and 30fps, which does show diversity in its functionality.</p>
<h3 id="An-Overview-of-Stop-Motion-Animation-Effect"><a href="#An-Overview-of-Stop-Motion-Animation-Effect" class="headerlink" title="An Overview of Stop-Motion Animation Effect"></a>An Overview of Stop-Motion Animation Effect</h3><p>If you tend to display the cohesive effect of the object within the image, you will have to cut short the particular clip. It should be done in 24 frames to achieve a frame-by-frame display of the object with changing direction. This removes the dynamic blur within the video. However, it displays another effect generally referred to as stop-motion animation.</p>
<p>Talking about this principle, stop-motion animation is quite common in old animated films. The movement was displayed by taking snapshots of every frame with the object displaced within each frame. Combining these snapshots, a complete stop-motion effect was created, making footage. The animation is captured one frame at a time, with a sequenced display. However, no blurring is present within the animation, making both discussed effects different.</p>

Why Do Games Have It?"></a>Part 2: What is Motion Blur in Games? Why Do Games Have It?</h2><p>Once you understand the concept of motion blur, it is time to figure out <strong>what motion blur is in games.</strong> This particular effect has not only been used in films but is now taking place within games for a realistic effect. Unfortunately, the use of stop-motion animation within the games is not effective. Although it has a standard frame rate of 24fps, the screen always lags.</p>
<p>Since the recorded action is manually adjusted within the frames, the motion is inaccurate, indicating the need for a motion blur effect in games. Talking about motion blur in games, this particular effect was not observed for a long time. The use of motion blur increases the quality of the game, but it also enhances the size of the game, which requires better equipment.</p>
<p>The games did not include the effect for quite a long time. Every frame was clear since the stop-motion animation runs under this principle. The clarity in frames, if operated at 24fps, the standard rate for stop-motion animation, will show screen lags. This is why the games were operated at least 30fps to be almost smooth.</p>
<p>When these screens were to display high-speed movement, the game had 30fps displayed lag on screen. Rapid changes in cameras led to the need for games to include <strong>motion blur gaming.</strong> This was based on smoothening the fast-moving effect covered in 30fps or less. Motion blur has improved the overall video output effects of the game. Due to motion blur, you can observe better transitions with a smooth flow at a lower fps rate.</p>

<h2 id="Part-3-Should-Motion-Blur-in-Game-Be-On-or-Off"><a href="#Part-3-Should-Motion-Blur-in-Game-Be-On-or-Off" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Should Motion Blur in Game Be On or Off?"></a>Part 3: Should Motion Blur in Game Be On or Off?</h2><p>The question that arises, in this case, is whether you should keep <strong>the motion blur on or off.</strong> To answer this question, you will have to observe why gamers dislike motion blur in games. As this effect is most prominent in conditions where the screen’s frame rate is 30fps or lesser, it becomes redundant if the screen’s frame rate is less than it.</p>
<p>Although you have heard that motion blur makes a screen smooth, this goes the other way in such situations. The display gets sticky for screens with lower frame rates, making the user dizzy. A good gaming engine provides the function of automatically adjusting the motion blur effect against the screen’s frame rate. However, if the user is not playing such quality games, they will face this issue.</p>
<p>It is better to turn off the motion blur effect for games without this adjustment or conditions where the output video remains sticky. For smoother results, the motion blur effect is preferred. It clarifies that the problem generally ranges from player to player. This clearly explains that motion blur is not the culprit in this situation.</p>

Does it Increase FPS?"></a>Part 4: Is Motion Blur Good for FPS? Does it Increase FPS?</h2><p>Motion blur, as explained above, is pleasing if it makes your results smoother. Generally, this is the reason why <strong>motion blur gaming</strong> was considered. Thus, motion blur is good for FPS; however, it does not increase the frame rates of your computer’s screen. The explanation above shows that motion blur has nothing to do with increasing the frame rates. It blurs the object’s trail by sustaining the video within the same frame rates.</p>
<p>The brain corrects the pictures the eye observes since it is being observed in natural circumstances. The use of motion blur improves the experience. Along with that, the results are always considered realistic under dynamic blur. In conclusion, motion blur is considered much more effective in video games.</p>

It all started when I filmed a certain place during a trip and somebody told me to upload it on YouTube. At first, I was hesitant doing that because I have no clue of what is YouTube. So, I did research and got curious, so I decided to upload the video. Time went by and I started to learn how to vlog.</p>

<li>A teaser – wherein your aim is to caught the attention of your viewers.</li>
<li>An intro – what is your channel all about.</li>
<li>The body of the vlog – the part wherein you’re explaining everything in depth, elaborating things about the topic you chose to share. In this part, you can insert the so called <strong>“<strong>call of action</strong>“</strong> - wherein you can tell your viewers to subscribe, to like and comment something about your vlog you’re tackling.

<p>What Have I Encountered on the Way</p>
<p>It’s not easy to become a Youtuber, because you, yourself is the only one that you’ve got. You are the director – managing everything all at once. The artist (youtuber) - the one who’s going to talk in front of the camera. The scriptwriter – the one who’s in charge of the whole story of the video and even the editor- the one who’ll edit the video afterwards.</p>
<p>On YouTube platform, you have to be consistent. It doesn’t mean that you need to upload a video thrice in a week, but even a video will do. After all, it’s quality over quantity. You’ll have to think what kind of video you’ll upload because you need to give your viewers or audiences something significant out of your vlog. YouTube is the second largest search engine next to Google, so most of the people are searching for answers to their questions. Or even searching solutions to their problems. So, if you have something to offer, why not share it for free.</p>
<p>If you’re a new YouTuber, you don’t need to have high-end equipment’s for vlogging. Anyone can start up by using his&#x2F;her mobile phone. I used to vlog using my Samsung S-6. Mobile phone nowadays, can record a high-definition resolution. You can add a tripod so that your phone can be sturdy during your filming session. Just film during day time so that you can minimize yourself from buying a ring light. A lavalier microphone can be a useful add-on so that your viewers or audiences can hear your voice clearly.</p>
<h2 id="4-What-to-Do-As-a-YouTuber"><a href="#4-What-to-Do-As-a-YouTuber" class="headerlink" title="4. What to Do As a YouTuber"></a>4. What to Do As a YouTuber</h2><p>As a Youtuber, you should find your own niche. Something that you’re passionate about. Something denoting products, services, or interests that appeal to a small, specialized section of the population. Something that you’re a hundred percent that you can deliver to them loud and clear.</p>

<p>What to Do As a YouTuber</p>
<p>As a YouTuber, you should be yourself in front of the camera. At first it will be awkward, but in time you’ll get used to it. Speak with your heart and not with your mind because when you start to think of the things that you need to say, you’ll get distracted. But when you speak whatever is in your heart at that very moment, you can create miracles and wonders.</p>
<p>It’s okay that you stutter once in a while. Even a reporter experiencing that kind of phenomena and besides, no one is perfect. Everything that you said unnecessarily can be omitted during the editing process. During editing, the first thing that you need to do is to put all the raw videos in your video editor’s timeline. Cut all the unnecessary part specially the so called, <strong>“<strong>dead air</strong>“</strong> or the part that you’re starting to think and not to talk at all. And your viewers can only see are all dead silence. After that you can add your personal touch. You can add your watermark (your trademark in other words), lower third green screens, subtitle if necessary (the hardest part to be honest) if you’re doing it manually. Some cool stickers, effects and transitions.</p>
<h2 id="5-How-I-Started-Video-Editing"><a href="#5-How-I-Started-Video-Editing" class="headerlink" title="5. How I Started Video Editing"></a>5. How I Started Video Editing</h2><p>As I’ve told you at the start of this article, I’m a phone editor not until I found <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>. And I must say that, this video editor is the best video editor for beginners. It has a user-friendly interface that even a person with zero experience on editing can fully understand it’s incredible features easily.</p>
<p>Wondershare Filmora 11 | More Than Just You</p>
<p>It also has new features that I personally not encountered with my previous video editor like Instant Mode and from the word itself, this mode can make your video in a blink of an eye. There’s Creator Academy wherein you can watch very interesting tutorials that can be a big help in your editing skills in the future.</p>
<p>If we’re going to dig in, there are lots of features that’s a game changer when it comes to editing indeed! Like bunch of Title styles that you can choose from. You can insert green screen videos (that I personally love to use in my vlogs) and there’s a Motion Tracker if you want to focus in an object or person in action. If you’re not in the mood in editing manually, you can make a montage and the software will make it for you in the Auto Montage Maker – the software will choose the highlights of your video and deliver the results after.</p>
<p>Key framing is also one of the incredible features of this editor in case that you want to emphasize things in your video. To zoom in&#x2F;out a certain part to be exact.</p>
<p>How awesome Wondershare Filmora because you don’t need another software. Everything that you need is just right in front of your eyes. When needing of a PC screen recorder, I need another software to use. But as I’ve said this editor have it all. There’s a built in PC screen recorder when you want to do a tutorial video.</p>

<p>It also has new features that I personally not encountered with my previous video editor like Instant Mode and from the word itself, this mode can make your video in a blink of an eye. There’s Creator Academy wherein you can watch very interesting tutorials that can be a big help in your editing skills in the future.</p>
<p>If we’re going to dig in, there are lots of features that’s a game changer when it comes to editing indeed! Like bunch of Title styles that you can choose from. You can insert green screen videos (that I personally love to use in my vlogs) and there’s a Motion Tracker if you want to focus in an object or person in action. If you’re not in the mood in editing manually, you can make a montage and the software will make it for you in the Auto Montage Maker – the software will choose the highlights of your video and deliver the results after.</p>
<p>Key framing is also one of the incredible features of this editor in case that you want to emphasize things in your video. To zoom in&#x2F;out a certain part to be exact.</p>
<p>How awesome Wondershare Filmora because you don’t need another software. Everything that you need is just right in front of your eyes. When needing of a PC screen recorder, I need another software to use. But as I’ve said this editor have it all. There’s a built in PC screen recorder when you want to do a tutorial video.</p>

In such cases, <strong>an AI video idea generator</strong> is more helpful in suggesting new and innovative ideas for the content creators based on their interesting topics.</p>
<p>Some of the advantages of a video idea generator are:</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> Promote videos – can utilize time to promote their videos on other social media platforms or collaborate with other content creators for promotions.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Provide Topic</strong></p>
<p>Here you need to provide the topic’s name on which we are planning to create the video.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Provide Keywords</strong></p>
<p>After providing a topic, give the keywords required for publishing. The video needs to have all the keywords so that the main content of the video can project adequately.</p>
<p>Based on the topic name and keywords, the tool will generate suggestions for the video ideas using the Neural Network concept of Artificial Learning.</p>

Now you can select whether you want the entire video or small bits of it; you can also limit the import to any frame to manage the size and time of the video. You can choose different color gradients and many other things according to your preference. And then go to “file” and select “save for web.”</p>

They provide you with the essential tools to make the best GIFs out of any video you want.</p>
<p>So here is a step-by-step method to help you make your GIFs in Photoshop and impress your friends.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: One of the most important steps is to choose the video you want to use in your GIF. GIFs are supposed to be short and express what you want to in that concise sequence, and that’s why choosing a correct sequence of the right length is very important.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now you will have to download the video file to your computer and continue to trim it down to as few frames as possible, and choose the frames that convey the message as accurately as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Import the video to Photoshop by going to “File” &gt; “Import” &gt; “Video frames to layers.” Choose the video file you need, and it will appear in the form of separate frames. Now you can select whether you want the entire video or small bits of it; you can also limit the import to any frame to manage the size and time of the video. You can choose different color gradients and many other things according to your preference. And then go to “file” and select “save for web.”</p>

They provide you with the essential tools to make the best GIFs out of any video you want.</p>
<p>So here is a step-by-step method to help you make your GIFs in Photoshop and impress your friends.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: One of the most important steps is to choose the video you want to use in your GIF. GIFs are supposed to be short and express what you want to in that concise sequence, and that’s why choosing a correct sequence of the right length is very important.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now you will have to download the video file to your computer and continue to trim it down to as few frames as possible, and choose the frames that convey the message as accurately as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Import the video to Photoshop by going to “File” &gt; “Import” &gt; “Video frames to layers.” Choose the video file you need, and it will appear in the form of separate frames. Now you can select whether you want the entire video or small bits of it; you can also limit the import to any frame to manage the size and time of the video. You can choose different color gradients and many other things according to your preference. And then go to “file” and select “save for web.”</p>

But on iPhones and iPad, some already installed programs can help you make GIFs easily.</p>
<p>You can use a live photos program and add effects to the shots you want to turn into gifs. You will have to go to the Photos app, select the image and click on the gray corner and add different effects as you desire. You can get a gif maker from the app store and turn your life photos into a gif quickly with all the effects you have added previously.</p>

For example, in Samsung Galaxy phones, one can use gif-making features already available in the pre-installed gallery app. In addition, Google photos have a ‘motion photos’ feature that can be converted and used to make GIFs easily using third-party apps you can easily find on Play Store.</p>
