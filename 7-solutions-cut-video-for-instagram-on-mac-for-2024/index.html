<p>Instagram is a social media site owned by Facebook. However, its main focus is on sharing videos and photos. It also allows users to put up stories that only last 24 hours. Stories allow you to highlight some crucial aspects of your life. These stories could be made up of photos, texts, and videos. However, each story slide can only take up to 15 seconds of video.</p>
<p>Most times, your video would be longer than that. If you upload a video longer than the accepted 15 seconds, Instagram automatically trims it to 15 seconds. However, the resulting video might not be the parts you want to show to your audience. Maybe there’s a particular section you would like your followers to see. That’s why video cutters enter the picture.</p>
<p>A good video splitter to cut video for Instagram on Mac is necessary when you’re creating video content for your Instagram page. In addition, the video editing tool you choose must maintain the quality and the safety of the file. Therefore, we’ve selected the best tools to cut videos for Instagram on Mac. Next, we’ll explore these tools, highlighting their best features, cons, and how you can use them. On that note, let’s dive in.</p>

<p><strong>Which Should I Choose, Free or Paid Instagram Video Cutter?</strong></p>
<p>Now that you know the best free and paid video cutters to cut Instagram videos, you’re probably wondering what the ideal option is. With so many options, you must make the right decision for your project. You need to consider several factors before you decide if a paid or free Instagram video cutter is the best option for you.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Budget</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When deciding between a paid or free Instagram cutter, one crucial factor is how much you’re willing to pay. If your budget is really low and doesn’t fit into any paid options, you can simply go for a free option. However, if the price isn’t an issue for you, going for a paid option is best because it offers you more editing features to enhance your video.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ease of Use</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You should also consider how easy it is to use the video cutter. Some paid options are for professionals and can be challenging to understand. However, most free options offer poor performance times. The last thing Instagram users want is to devote hours to figure out where each tool is on the software. However, there are paid options with an intuitive interface that makes it easy to cut your Instagram video.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Customer Support</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You also need to consider whether customer support will be available when you need it. Some free options have no customer support to turn to. Instead, consider a video cutter that will offer helpful and responsive customer support when picking.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Video Format Support</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Before choosing a paid or free option, you need to consider if it would support the video format you prefer. You might be using different video formats, and you want to ensure you’re not limited to select options. You also want a video cutter that offers various output formats.</p>
<p><strong>FAQs about Cut Video For Instagram</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How do you post long videos on Instagram without splitting?</strong> Instagram allows users to post long videos on the app, as long as 60 seconds. Alternatively, you can use the IGTV to upload long clips on Instagram without splitting.</li>
<li><strong>What is multi-capture on Instagram:</strong> This tool allows you to create and share multiple photos on your stories.</li>
<li><strong>How do I split the video into two parts for Instagram on Mac?</strong> The paid and free video cutters shared above will help you split a video into two parts for Instagram on Mac. Simply pick the option that fits your preference.</li>
<li><strong>Why can’t I split a video on iMovie?</strong> Maybe your iMovie software is experiencing a glitch; you can simply restart the software. Alternately, move the clip to the center row if you find the option greyed out. Moving the clip should help fix the issue.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Various tools are available to help you cut a video for Instagram on Mac. Therefore, just refer to the paid and free tools listed above whenever you need a video cutter. These video cutters are highly recommended and ensure the quality isn’t affected while cutting the video. When deciding which is the best option for you, free or paid, the factors listed will help you decide. Suppose you’re looking specifically for a video cutter that offers you all the features you need to enhance your video while providing an intuitive user interface. In that case, Wondershare Filmora is the ideal choice.</p>
<p>Instagram is a social media site owned by Facebook. However, its main focus is on sharing videos and photos. It also allows users to put up stories that only last 24 hours. Stories allow you to highlight some crucial aspects of your life. These stories could be made up of photos, texts, and videos. However, each story slide can only take up to 15 seconds of video.</p>
<p>Most times, your video would be longer than that. If you upload a video longer than the accepted 15 seconds, Instagram automatically trims it to 15 seconds. However, the resulting video might not be the parts you want to show to your audience. Maybe there’s a particular section you would like your followers to see. That’s why video cutters enter the picture.</p>
<p>A good video splitter to cut video for Instagram on Mac is necessary when you’re creating video content for your Instagram page. In addition, the video editing tool you choose must maintain the quality and the safety of the file. Therefore, we’ve selected the best tools to cut videos for Instagram on Mac. Next, we’ll explore these tools, highlighting their best features, cons, and how you can use them. On that note, let’s dive in.</p>

<li><strong>Customer Support</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You also need to consider whether customer support will be available when you need it. Some free options have no customer support to turn to. Instead, consider a video cutter that will offer helpful and responsive customer support when picking.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Video Format Support</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Before choosing a paid or free option, you need to consider if it would support the video format you prefer. You might be using different video formats, and you want to ensure you’re not limited to select options. You also want a video cutter that offers various output formats.</p>

In that case, Wondershare Filmora is the ideal choice.</p>
<p>Instagram is a social media site owned by Facebook. However, its main focus is on sharing videos and photos. It also allows users to put up stories that only last 24 hours. Stories allow you to highlight some crucial aspects of your life. These stories could be made up of photos, texts, and videos. However, each story slide can only take up to 15 seconds of video.</p>
<p>Most times, your video would be longer than that. If you upload a video longer than the accepted 15 seconds, Instagram automatically trims it to 15 seconds. However, the resulting video might not be the parts you want to show to your audience. Maybe there’s a particular section you would like your followers to see. That’s why video cutters enter the picture.</p>
<p>A good video splitter to cut video for Instagram on Mac is necessary when you’re creating video content for your Instagram page. In addition, the video editing tool you choose must maintain the quality and the safety of the file. Therefore, we’ve selected the best tools to cut videos for Instagram on Mac. Next, we’ll explore these tools, highlighting their best features, cons, and how you can use them. On that note, let’s dive in.</p>

<p><strong>Which Should I Choose, Free or Paid Instagram Video Cutter?</strong></p>
<p>Now that you know the best free and paid video cutters to cut Instagram videos, you’re probably wondering what the ideal option is. With so many options, you must make the right decision for your project. You need to consider several factors before you decide if a paid or free Instagram video cutter is the best option for you.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Budget</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When deciding between a paid or free Instagram cutter, one crucial factor is how much you’re willing to pay. If your budget is really low and doesn’t fit into any paid options, you can simply go for a free option. However, if the price isn’t an issue for you, going for a paid option is best because it offers you more editing features to enhance your video.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ease of Use</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You should also consider how easy it is to use the video cutter. Some paid options are for professionals and can be challenging to understand. However, most free options offer poor performance times. The last thing Instagram users want is to devote hours to figure out where each tool is on the software. However, there are paid options with an intuitive interface that makes it easy to cut your Instagram video.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Customer Support</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You also need to consider whether customer support will be available when you need it. Some free options have no customer support to turn to. Instead, consider a video cutter that will offer helpful and responsive customer support when picking.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Video Format Support</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Before choosing a paid or free option, you need to consider if it would support the video format you prefer. You might be using different video formats, and you want to ensure you’re not limited to select options. You also want a video cutter that offers various output formats.</p>
<p><strong>FAQs about Cut Video For Instagram</strong></p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Various tools are available to help you cut a video for Instagram on Mac. Therefore, just refer to the paid and free tools listed above whenever you need a video cutter. These video cutters are highly recommended and ensure the quality isn’t affected while cutting the video. When deciding which is the best option for you, free or paid, the factors listed will help you decide. Suppose you’re looking specifically for a video cutter that offers you all the features you need to enhance your video while providing an intuitive user interface. In that case, Wondershare Filmora is the ideal choice.</p>
<p>Instagram is a social media site owned by Facebook. However, its main focus is on sharing videos and photos. It also allows users to put up stories that only last 24 hours. Stories allow you to highlight some crucial aspects of your life. These stories could be made up of photos, texts, and videos. However, each story slide can only take up to 15 seconds of video.</p>
<p>Most times, your video would be longer than that. If you upload a video longer than the accepted 15 seconds, Instagram automatically trims it to 15 seconds. However, the resulting video might not be the parts you want to show to your audience. Maybe there’s a particular section you would like your followers to see. That’s why video cutters enter the picture.</p>
<p>A good video splitter to cut video for Instagram on Mac is necessary when you’re creating video content for your Instagram page. In addition, the video editing tool you choose must maintain the quality and the safety of the file. Therefore, we’ve selected the best tools to cut videos for Instagram on Mac. Next, we’ll explore these tools, highlighting their best features, cons, and how you can use them. On that note, let’s dive in.</p>

<p><strong>Which Should I Choose, Free or Paid Instagram Video Cutter?</strong></p>
<p>Now that you know the best free and paid video cutters to cut Instagram videos, you’re probably wondering what the ideal option is. With so many options, you must make the right decision for your project. You need to consider several factors before you decide if a paid or free Instagram video cutter is the best option for you.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Budget</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When deciding between a paid or free Instagram cutter, one crucial factor is how much you’re willing to pay. If your budget is really low and doesn’t fit into any paid options, you can simply go for a free option. However, if the price isn’t an issue for you, going for a paid option is best because it offers you more editing features to enhance your video.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ease of Use</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You should also consider how easy it is to use the video cutter. Some paid options are for professionals and can be challenging to understand. However, most free options offer poor performance times. The last thing Instagram users want is to devote hours to figure out where each tool is on the software. However, there are paid options with an intuitive interface that makes it easy to cut your Instagram video.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Customer Support</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid GoPro Video Editor?</em></strong></p>
<p>You can choose free or paid softwares depending on your requirements and budget. If a free software meets your requirements then stay on it otherwise move towards a paid alternative. If you have a GoPro and you make videos just for fun then use a free and simple video editor. Even if you are an experienced video editor, I would recommend you to go for free video editors which I have mentioned above as they are quite powerful and professional software but if you are harvesting a good amount of money from this field then you can upgrade to pro versions of these free softwares or get a paid software from start. As almost all of these softwares are professional and can get your job done, so it’s better to choose one, which is comfortable for you to work on.</p>

As almost all of these softwares are professional and can get your job done, so it’s better to choose one, which is comfortable for you to work on.</p>

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid GoPro Video Editor?</em></strong></p>
<p>You can choose free or paid softwares depending on your requirements and budget. If a free software meets your requirements then stay on it otherwise move towards a paid alternative. If you have a GoPro and you make videos just for fun then use a free and simple video editor. Even if you are an experienced video editor, I would recommend you to go for free video editors which I have mentioned above as they are quite powerful and professional software but if you are harvesting a good amount of money from this field then you can upgrade to pro versions of these free softwares or get a paid software from start. As almost all of these softwares are professional and can get your job done, so it’s better to choose one, which is comfortable for you to work on.</p>

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid GoPro Video Editor?</em></strong></p>
<p>You can choose free or paid softwares depending on your requirements and budget. If a free software meets your requirements then stay on it otherwise move towards a paid alternative. If you have a GoPro and you make videos just for fun then use a free and simple video editor. Even if you are an experienced video editor, I would recommend you to go for free video editors which I have mentioned above as they are quite powerful and professional software but if you are harvesting a good amount of money from this field then you can upgrade to pro versions of these free softwares or get a paid software from start. As almost all of these softwares are professional and can get your job done, so it’s better to choose one, which is comfortable for you to work on.</p>
<p>FAQs about GoPro Video Editing:</p>

</ol>
<p>Yes, GoPro has its own video editor “Quik”. It is available on mobile phones and desktops both. It is simple and easy to use. It provides basic features to edit your video.

<ol>
<li><strong>Q) Can I make videos for social media with a GoPro?</strong></li>

<ol>

<li>Download the <strong>Fade</strong> transition and <strong>drag</strong> it between the Black screen and the first clip.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now that we have added a transition, it is time to move on to our music!</p>
<h5 id="Step6-Add-The-Music"><a href="#Step6-Add-The-Music" class="headerlink" title="Step6 Add The Music"></a>Step6 Add The Music</h5><p>You can add your music to the slideshow from your PC library, but make sure you have the music rights. It is better to use stock audio by following the steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>Audio</strong> icon on the bar above the import window, and the list will pop up.</li>
<li>Please browse the library to find music that best suits your video and download it.</li>
<li>Then add it to the timeline’s audio track.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Add Beat Detection</strong></p>
<p>To match your video clips properly with the music, so it remains in sync, you can adjust it with the beat of the music. To add beat detection, follow the steps mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right-Click on the audio that you selected in the audio library.</li>
<li>You will see a pop-up list, and in the options, you will see Beat detection.</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Beat detection</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-8.png"
                      alt="adding beat detection"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Then click on the audio and drag it below on the timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Match The Video With The Audio Markers</strong></p>
<p>To have the full advantage of beat detection, you must adjust your videos and photos to the markers. Follow the steps mentioned below to do so:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-9.png"
                      alt="matching the video with the audio"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Check that the video clips are in sync with the marker on the audio.</li>
<li>For this, drag one video end to a marker or as many videos as you want.</li>
<li>Ultimately, you will create a timeline in which your videos sync with the audio beat.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-10.png"
                      alt="synced video with audio"
                ></p>
<p>After syncing your videos and photos to the audio, it is time to move on to the scaling and background blur.</p>
<h5 id="Step7-Scale-and-Blur-The-Background"><a href="#Step7-Scale-and-Blur-The-Background" class="headerlink" title="Step7 Scale and Blur The Background"></a>Step7 Scale and Blur The Background</h5><p>Now, some of the pictures you have added must-have black borders. It usually means that your image is shorter than the aspect ratio.</p>
<p>If you leave the picture&#x2F;photo as it is, the black borders will make it look shorter and out of proportion. As a result, it gives a generally poor look, as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-11.png"
                      alt="unscaled photo in the main play window"
                ></p>
<p>To counter this problem, follow some easy steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> on the picture with black borders, and it will open the settings list.</li>
<li>Go into the <strong>Transform</strong> Here you can see multiple settings.</li>
<li>Increase the size of your photo to match the aspect ratio.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-12.png"
                      alt="scaling of the photo"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Add a Background Blur Effect</strong></p>
<p>In some cases where you have taken a portrait photo where the picture is vertical, it ultimately stays out of proportion to the aspect ratio.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Simply scaling the image to match the aspect ratio size is not sensible in this case. Doing so will hide the many pretty features of a portrait.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-13.png"
                      alt="photo with black borders"
                ></p>
<p>To counter this problem, you can add a blur effect. This effect will turn your background blur, matching the aspect ratio. Follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>Effects</strong> tab above the import window and search for <strong>Blur</strong>.</li>
<li>Download the blur effect that suits you best and then <strong>drag</strong> the blur effect above your photo in the timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will notice the background turn to a blur in the main play screen.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h5 id="Step8-Add-a-Transition"><a href="#Step8-Add-a-Transition" class="headerlink" title="Step8 Add a Transition"></a>Step8 Add a Transition</h5><p>You can also add a transition effect to spice up things. It can get bland when your video or photo changes from one to another. To create a good slideshow video, you can add a transition effect by following the steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>Transition</strong> icon above the import window.</li>
<li><strong>Browse</strong> the library until you find a transition you like, then download one.</li>
<li>Click on the transition and drag it between the clips.</li>
</ul>

                      alt="transition effect"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Adjust The Duration and Placement of The Transition</strong></p>
<p>Now it’s time to adjust the duration and placement of the transition. For this, you can follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> on the transition effect, and it will open the settings list.</li>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If other transitions are added to the timeline, you can adjust them by clicking Apply to all.</p>

                      alt="adjusting the duration of the transition"
                ></p>
<p>When you have adjusted the slideshow transitions, it is time to move on to the effects and filters.</p>
<h5 id="Step9-Add-the-Effects-and-Filters"><a href="#Step9-Add-the-Effects-and-Filters" class="headerlink" title="Step9 Add the Effects and Filters"></a>Step9 Add the Effects and Filters</h5><p>If you create a slideshow video of your trip to a historical place.

<p>Now that we have imported your photos and videos into the timeline, it is time to align and add text.</p>
<h5 id="Step4-Add-the-Title-1"><a href="#Step4-Add-the-Title-1" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Add the Title"></a>Step4 Add the Title</h5><p>To create an attractive slideshow, you will need to add a title before the start of the video. Doing so will allow you to gain more viewers and audiences.</p>
<p><strong>Add a Black Screen</strong></p>
<p>The black screen will eventually act like a canvas to give your title a good look. To add a black screen, follow the steps mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>media</strong> icon from the bar above the import window.</li>
<li>You will notice many tabs on the left-hand side under a drop-down bar.</li>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Add a Title Tile</strong></p>
<p>Now that we have our canvas, we will now add the title. Above the import media library, there will be a <strong>Title</strong> icon.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>title</strong> icon, and select the title that you want for your video by browsing and scrolling down.</li>
<li>For this purpose, we will use a simple title tile called “<strong>Title 29</strong>.”</li>

<p>Now that we have added a transition, it is time to move on to our music!</p>
<h5 id="Step6-Add-The-Music-1"><a href="#Step6-Add-The-Music-1" class="headerlink" title="Step6 Add The Music"></a>Step6 Add The Music</h5><p>You can add your music to the slideshow from your PC library, but make sure you have the music rights. It is better to use stock audio by following the steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>Audio</strong> icon on the bar above the import window, and the list will pop up.</li>
<li>Please browse the library to find music that best suits your video and download it.</li>
<li>Then add it to the timeline’s audio track.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Add Beat Detection</strong></p>
<p>To match your video clips properly with the music, so it remains in sync, you can adjust it with the beat of the music. To add beat detection, follow the steps mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right-Click on the audio that you selected in the audio library.</li>
<li>You will see a pop-up list, and in the options, you will see Beat detection.</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Beat detection</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adding beat detection"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Then click on the audio and drag it below on the timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Match The Video With The Audio Markers</strong></p>
<p>To have the full advantage of beat detection, you must adjust your videos and photos to the markers. Follow the steps mentioned below to do so:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-9.png"
                      alt="matching the video with the audio"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Check that the video clips are in sync with the marker on the audio.</li>
<li>For this, drag one video end to a marker or as many videos as you want.</li>
<li>Ultimately, you will create a timeline in which your videos sync with the audio beat.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-10.png"
                      alt="synced video with audio"
                ></p>
<p>After syncing your videos and photos to the audio, it is time to move on to the scaling and background blur.</p>
<h5 id="Step7-Scale-and-Blur-The-Background-1"><a href="#Step7-Scale-and-Blur-The-Background-1" class="headerlink" title="Step7 Scale and Blur The Background"></a>Step7 Scale and Blur The Background</h5><p>Now, some of the pictures you have added must-have black borders. It usually means that your image is shorter than the aspect ratio.</p>
<p>If you leave the picture&#x2F;photo as it is, the black borders will make it look shorter and out of proportion. As a result, it gives a generally poor look, as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-11.png"
                      alt="unscaled photo in the main play window"
                ></p>
<p>To counter this problem, follow some easy steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> on the picture with black borders, and it will open the settings list.</li>
<li>Go into the <strong>Transform</strong> Here you can see multiple settings.</li>
<li>Increase the size of your photo to match the aspect ratio.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-12.png"
                      alt="scaling of the photo"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Add a Background Blur Effect</strong></p>
<p>In some cases where you have taken a portrait photo where the picture is vertical, it ultimately stays out of proportion to the aspect ratio.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Simply scaling the image to match the aspect ratio size is not sensible in this case. Doing so will hide the many pretty features of a portrait.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="photo with black borders"
                ></p>
<p>To counter this problem, you can add a blur effect. This effect will turn your background blur, matching the aspect ratio. Follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>Effects</strong> tab above the import window and search for <strong>Blur</strong>.</li>
<li>Download the blur effect that suits you best and then <strong>drag</strong> the blur effect above your photo in the timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will notice the background turn to a blur in the main play screen.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h5 id="Step8-Add-a-Transition-1"><a href="#Step8-Add-a-Transition-1" class="headerlink" title="Step8 Add a Transition"></a>Step8 Add a Transition</h5><p>You can also add a transition effect to spice up things.

                ></p>
<p><strong>Adjust The Duration and Placement of The Transition</strong></p>
<p>Now it’s time to adjust the duration and placement of the transition. For this, you can follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> on the transition effect, and it will open the settings list.</li>
<li>You can adjust the duration by setting the timer as per your requirement.</li>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If other transitions are added to the timeline, you can adjust them by clicking Apply to all.</p>

                ></p>
<p>When you have adjusted the slideshow transitions, it is time to move on to the effects and filters.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Fade out The Audio</strong></p>
<p>If the audio suddenly ends at the end of your slideshow, it will create a bitter effect. Therefore, you should always fade out audio at the end of the video. To do this, follow the steps mentioned:</p>

It’s simple; in the 1950s, video-making technologies were slightly advanced, although films were more about rock and roll and poodle skirts. So, without further dilly-dallying, let’s learn how to create a retro 1950-style video with this simple Filmora tutorial.</p>
<h2 id="Preparation"><a href="#Preparation" class="headerlink" title="Preparation"></a>Preparation</h2><p><img

                ></p>
<p>Shooting a video to teleport yourself to the 1950s doesn’t need to be complicated. You simply need to look the part in the video. For example, you can wear velvet-collar jackets, stovepipe trousers, carefully combed back hair, and other trendy styles in the 50s. It’s even better if you can find those vintage chairs in your grandparent’s collection.</p>
<p>How to create a 1950s vintage film:</p>

                      alt="add your video on filmora"
                ></p>
<p>First, fire up Filmora and load the video you want to send back to the 1950s. Then, drag your footage onto the editing timeline.</p>

                      alt="apply a cropping effect to the video"
                ></p>
<p>Once the video is successfully added to Filmora, click the <strong>Effect</strong> tab on the top menu bar and choose the <strong>Crop</strong> effect under the <strong>Utility</strong> folder. Make sure you add the Crop effect two or three tracks above the original video track.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="click the effect tab"
                ></p>
<p>Double-click the Crop effect, then change the Left and Right values to make the video look like it was shot in the 50s. You can set the values as 10.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Up to here, you’ll realize that your video doesn’t still look like a 1950s film per se. Double-click your video clip and choose the <strong>3D LUT</strong> option under the <strong>Color</strong> category. Then, open the drop-down menu and choose <strong>Warm Film</strong>. This will make your video look like it was shot using an old camera.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Please don’t stop there; we want to make the footage slightly grainy. In other words, you need to make the footage have a lot of grain and low light. To do that, tap the <strong>Overlay</strong> menu under the Effects tab, then click <strong>Old Film</strong>. After that, choose the <strong>Random Dust, Dirty Film,</strong> and <strong>Subtle Grain</strong> effects and add them to the tracks above your video clip. Remember to use as much grain as possible to give your footage that vintage look of the 1950s.</p>

<p>Up to here, you’ll realize that your video doesn’t still look like a 1950s film per se.

<p>Please don’t stop there; we want to make the footage slightly grainy. In other words, you need to make the footage have a lot of grain and low light. To do that, tap the <strong>Overlay</strong> menu under the Effects tab, then click <strong>Old Film</strong>. After that, choose the <strong>Random Dust, Dirty Film,</strong> and <strong>Subtle Grain</strong> effects and add them to the tracks above your video clip. Remember to use as much grain as possible to give your footage that vintage look of the 1950s.</p>
