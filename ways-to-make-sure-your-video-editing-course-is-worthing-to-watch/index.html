These are very easy to understand, so go through the following steps for splitting the video clips. Two ways are trimming and splitting the clips in Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<p><strong>First method: splitting on the timeline</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Selection of the clip in the timeline that you want to split. Your play head should be precisely at this particular place from where you need the splitting.</p>

<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Make-a-Material-Transparent-in-Blender"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Make-a-Material-Transparent-in-Blender" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to Make a Material Transparent in Blender"></a>Part 2 How to Make a Material Transparent in Blender</h2><p>Blender is a top class graphic modulation tool; you can use to play with your editing creativity to your heart’s content, catering to a variety of design requirements, while adhering to a distinguished professional outlook. If you are pondering over the perfect task choice to start your editing journey with Blender, you can begin with making a material transparent in the software.</p>
<p>When beginning to create transparent artworks in Blender, you need to be familiar with the Transparent BSDF node. Here’s a quick explanation:</p>
<p><strong>Transparent BSDF Node</strong></p>
<p>When working with Blender, you get to access a variety of graphic nodes that cater to specific design purposes. Likewise, the transparent BSDF, as the name suggests, is an exclusive transparency creation graphic node that is essential to make materials transparent in Blender. Talking of the specific node function, it is there to facilitate the control of different transparency modes, in cohesion with specific user requirements.</p>
<p>Browse through the following section for a guided tutorial to make a material transparent using Blender:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p>Prepare a suitable BSDF material by selecting any image from your device and applying it to the object in the Blender’s viewport.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p>To start working with the Transparent BSDF node, you first need to insert the same into the node tree amongst the Principle BSDF and the Mix Shader nodes. To do this, you need to select ‘Add’ or press ‘Ctrl + A’, followed by locating the same in the ‘Shader’ submenu. Do not forget to add the ‘Mix Shader’ node, which is again, present in the ‘Shader’ submenu, to the node tree.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p>
<p>Plug in the Transparent BSDF output into the top Shader input of the Mix Shader, while dragging the latter into the connecting link between the Material Output and Principle BSDF nodes. This enables the Mix Shader node to pass through the two output generating nodes. The resultant ‘Transparency Effect’ can be seen on the viewpoint object within a few seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong></p>
<p>Make an additional connection of two fresh nodes into the node tree as follows:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Transparent BSDF output to the Mix Shader input</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Principal BSDF output to the Mix Shader input</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Mix Shader output to the Surface input</p>
<p>This will finally fetch a transparent material output for the selected image object.</p>

If you are pondering over the perfect task choice to start your editing journey with Blender, you can begin with making a material transparent in the software.</p>
<p>When beginning to create transparent artworks in Blender, you need to be familiar with the Transparent BSDF node. Here’s a quick explanation:</p>
<p><strong>Transparent BSDF Node</strong></p>
<p>When working with Blender, you get to access a variety of graphic nodes that cater to specific design purposes. Likewise, the transparent BSDF, as the name suggests, is an exclusive transparency creation graphic node that is essential to make materials transparent in Blender. Talking of the specific node function, it is there to facilitate the control of different transparency modes, in cohesion with specific user requirements.</p>
<p>Browse through the following section for a guided tutorial to make a material transparent using Blender:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p>Prepare a suitable BSDF material by selecting any image from your device and applying it to the object in the Blender’s viewport.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p>To start working with the Transparent BSDF node, you first need to insert the same into the node tree amongst the Principle BSDF and the Mix Shader nodes. To do this, you need to select ‘Add’ or press ‘Ctrl + A’, followed by locating the same in the ‘Shader’ submenu. Do not forget to add the ‘Mix Shader’ node, which is again, present in the ‘Shader’ submenu, to the node tree.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p>
<p>Plug in the Transparent BSDF output into the top Shader input of the Mix Shader, while dragging the latter into the connecting link between the Material Output and Principle BSDF nodes. This enables the Mix Shader node to pass through the two output generating nodes. The resultant ‘Transparency Effect’ can be seen on the viewpoint object within a few seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong></p>
<p>Make an additional connection of two fresh nodes into the node tree as follows:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Transparent BSDF output to the Mix Shader input</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Principal BSDF output to the Mix Shader input</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Mix Shader output to the Surface input</p>
<p>This will finally fetch a transparent material output for the selected image object.</p>

If you are pondering over the perfect task choice to start your editing journey with Blender, you can begin with making a material transparent in the software.</p>
<p>When beginning to create transparent artworks in Blender, you need to be familiar with the Transparent BSDF node. Here’s a quick explanation:</p>
<p><strong>Transparent BSDF Node</strong></p>
<p>When working with Blender, you get to access a variety of graphic nodes that cater to specific design purposes. Likewise, the transparent BSDF, as the name suggests, is an exclusive transparency creation graphic node that is essential to make materials transparent in Blender. Talking of the specific node function, it is there to facilitate the control of different transparency modes, in cohesion with specific user requirements.</p>
<p>Browse through the following section for a guided tutorial to make a material transparent using Blender:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p>Prepare a suitable BSDF material by selecting any image from your device and applying it to the object in the Blender’s viewport.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p>To start working with the Transparent BSDF node, you first need to insert the same into the node tree amongst the Principle BSDF and the Mix Shader nodes. To do this, you need to select ‘Add’ or press ‘Ctrl + A’, followed by locating the same in the ‘Shader’ submenu. Do not forget to add the ‘Mix Shader’ node, which is again, present in the ‘Shader’ submenu, to the node tree.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p>
<p>Plug in the Transparent BSDF output into the top Shader input of the Mix Shader, while dragging the latter into the connecting link between the Material Output and Principle BSDF nodes. This enables the Mix Shader node to pass through the two output generating nodes. The resultant ‘Transparency Effect’ can be seen on the viewpoint object within a few seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong></p>
<p>Make an additional connection of two fresh nodes into the node tree as follows:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Transparent BSDF output to the Mix Shader input</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Principal BSDF output to the Mix Shader input</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Mix Shader output to the Surface input</p>
<p>This will finally fetch a transparent material output for the selected image object.</p>

Talking of the specific node function, it is there to facilitate the control of different transparency modes, in cohesion with specific user requirements.</p>
<p>Browse through the following section for a guided tutorial to make a material transparent using Blender:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p>Prepare a suitable BSDF material by selecting any image from your device and applying it to the object in the Blender’s viewport.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p>To start working with the Transparent BSDF node, you first need to insert the same into the node tree amongst the Principle BSDF and the Mix Shader nodes. To do this, you need to select ‘Add’ or press ‘Ctrl + A’, followed by locating the same in the ‘Shader’ submenu. Do not forget to add the ‘Mix Shader’ node, which is again, present in the ‘Shader’ submenu, to the node tree.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p>
<p>Plug in the Transparent BSDF output into the top Shader input of the Mix Shader, while dragging the latter into the connecting link between the Material Output and Principle BSDF nodes. This enables the Mix Shader node to pass through the two output generating nodes. The resultant ‘Transparency Effect’ can be seen on the viewpoint object within a few seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong></p>
<p>Make an additional connection of two fresh nodes into the node tree as follows:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Transparent BSDF output to the Mix Shader input</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Principal BSDF output to the Mix Shader input</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Mix Shader output to the Surface input</p>
<p>This will finally fetch a transparent material output for the selected image object.</p>

Here’s what you need to do to take up the creation process:</p>
<p><img

                      alt="Selected Image for Background Transparency in Blender"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p>Begin with choosing a suitable image to create a transparent background in either of the Eevee or Cycles render engines, followed by navigating to the ‘Render Properties’ tab in the software’s main interface. Click on the same to get a related drop down menu for activating selected image effects.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Blender-tips-how-to-make-blender-render-transparent-background-8.JPG"
                      alt="Filmora- Media Import Interface"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Drag to Timeline</strong></p>
<p>The next step is to drag your image selection from the software’s media library to its editor timeline. Either right click the image and select ‘Insert’ option from the submenu that appears, or use the conventional ‘Drag and Drop’ method to accomplish this task.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Blender-tips-how-to-make-blender-render-transparent-background-9.JPG"
                      alt="Filmora- Image Timeline Dragging"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Transparency Adjustments</strong></p>
<p>Once the image reaches the timeline, tap the same to see the ‘Settings’ tab get opened. Navigate through the tab options until you find ‘Chroma Key Settings’. Enable the ‘Chroma Key’ with a right side toggle to see your selected image get transparent with a ‘Green’ color in the background.</p>
<p>An alternative to the above method is to hit the ‘Color Picker’ option to the right of the ‘Select Color’ tab and navigate to a desired section of the image to make it transparent with a single click.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Filmora- Image Transparency Adjustments"
                ></p>
<p>If you observe partial transparency in the resultant image background, consider making additional adjustments in ’Chroma Key’ setting parameters like, offset, edge thickness, tolerance, edge feather, etc., to ensure that the image background is totally transparent. When the final artwork makes you happy, tap ‘OK’.</p>

                      alt="Filmora- Additional Chroma Key Settings"
