<h5 id="Step-1-Be-Clear-About-Your-Objective"><a href="#Step-1-Be-Clear-About-Your-Objective" class="headerlink" title="Step 1 Be Clear About Your Objective"></a>Step 1 Be Clear About Your Objective</h5><p>Before you start finding video content marketing companies, you should be clear about the goals you want to achieve through video marketing.

But you cannot take their promises for granted. Instead, evaluate their capabilities by reviewing their portfolio consisting of their past projects. You can assess their quality by judging their creativity, work style, production value, and marketing techniques from their past works. Once you are convinced of their skills and capabilities, you can shortlist them.</p>

This is because their past experience will help them understand your objectives and targeted audiences better. They are likely to be aware of the things that work and do not work with the audiences in your industry. Besides, they will be capable of finding opportunities and identifying challenges faster during the marketing process. Therefore, agencies with experience in your industry should get priority on your list.</p>

Customer testimonials can reveal insights for you to judge the strengths and weaknesses of the agency. You can form an opinion on their professionalism, communication style, operational techniques, and customer satisfaction. You should check the reviews and feedback on their websites and ask for references from their past customers.</p>

Every company invests in video marketing, but only a few are successful in their efforts. The key to their success lies in their creative thinking and innovative approach. Creativity makes video content attention-grabbing, long-lasting, and highly sharable.</p>
<p>Similarly, innovative marketing techniques will give you a significant edge over your competitors. You can judge a video marketing agency’s creativity if they pitch unique ideas, creative storytelling, and innovative marketing approaches. Watch out for the reviews to determine if the company has a proven record of creativity in their field.</p>

The reach in the digital world depends on optimization. That is why when you choose a <strong>marketing video agency</strong> near you, ensure they understand optimization principles. Proper search engine optimization helps a video rank higher in search results and get more organic audiences.</p>
<p>Optimization techniques vary for search engines, video streaming websites, and social media platforms. A video marketing agency should have expertise in optimization for organic reach and generating leads.</p>

<h5 id="Step-7-Dive-Into-the-Process"><a href="#Step-7-Dive-Into-the-Process" class="headerlink" title="Step 7 Dive Into the Process"></a>Step 7 Dive Into the Process</h5><p>You should choose a video agency that is more open about its operation and process of execution. They must explain the entire process, from concept development to final delivery. Similarly, they should be open to suggestions, flexible in approaches, and adaptable during challenges.</p>
<p>Understanding the execution process will help you determine instinctively if the agency is worth your investment. There should be clarity in the thought process and executive plan with deadline and budget for your peace of mind and satisfaction.</p>

<h5 id="Step-8-Focus-on-Communication"><a href="#Step-8-Focus-on-Communication" class="headerlink" title="Step 8 Focus on Communication"></a>Step 8 Focus on Communication</h5><p>Communication is a highly underrated skill in the professional world, especially when outsourcing your work to an agency. Without proper communication, there cannot be a proper collaboration with the <strong>video marketing company</strong>. If you cannot share your feedback or get involved in the required process, your goals and objectives will stay unachieved.</p>
<p>Therefore, while discussing the execution plan, you should emphasize communication. For example, you can check how often you will get updates and how responsive and proactive the agency will be with suggestions and feedback. Communication enhances transparency in execution and boosts customer satisfaction.</p>

It is time to request a proposal or quotation from the interested agencies. You should reiterate your goals, objectives, expectations, and requirements so the agencies can provide tailored proposals accordingly.</p>
<p>You can also clarify any doubts and assess their professionalism and communication well. The proposals can reveal the level of service you will get. The more detailed the proposal, the deeper you can evaluate the service and make the final selection accordingly.</p>

You should also calculate your return on investment so that your investment brings in the expected results without damaging you monetarily.

<p>Mobile applications with user-friendly interface, allowing us to manipulate the footage quickly, easily choose our preferred formats and effects and adjust the clips according to the requirements our target platforms set; more time-consuming and advanced software with even more options, but which seem to require us to be more skilled and experienced in editing.</p>
<p>Even though editing, as other innovative and creative actions, is limitless in its possibilities, sometimes we just need to make a little change in our project and it’s quite enough for us to be satisfied with our work and material. One of the things which is rather simple to do, but sometimes essential, when it comes to making our clips better and more picturesque for the audience, is cropping a video.</p>
<p>Cropping, in its essence, is great to “hide” some unnecessary objects in our video, and&#x2F;or highlight the main ones. In this article, we discuss how to crop a video in a software called DaVinci Resolve, in simple little steps, how to export our work and lastly, what would be the alternate way to do the same in other computer program.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-crop-a-video-in-Davinci-Resolve"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-crop-a-video-in-Davinci-Resolve" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How to crop a video in Davinci Resolve"></a>Part 1. How to crop a video in Davinci Resolve</h2><p>First and foremost, let’s get to know Davinci Resolve! As mentioned above, it is a software, so let’s be well-aware that we have to download and install it on our computer systems. Of course, it takes a bit of time, but to be able to use an advanced software, it’s totally worth it. If we are to search for the information about Davinci Resolve, we come across the following description: “color grading and non-linear video editing application for macOS, Windows, and Linux”. So, no matter which system we have, we can count on this software, which is a real advantage!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="crop-video-davinci"
                ></p>

<p>Now, back to cropping – so, you want to crop the video you took or got somehow, and you also think about using Davinci Resolve? Cropping, in most cases, meaning different applications, platforms and software, is not a complicated task at all, and you can do it in a very short amount of time in Davinci Resolve, too. Therefore, let’s delve into the steps on how to do it!</p>
<p>First, download and install the software, and when it is finished, launch it. You will see a totally clean program, until you add the video you want to work on. To do so, you have to find File in the top menu, find Import and then choose Media.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-davinci-2.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>Then it will open a new window where you can choose your file…</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-davinci-3.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>Your chosen file will be added in Media Pool, and to direct it into the sequence, you have to drag and drop it there.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-davinci-4.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-davinci"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-davinci-5.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>And then you might have difficulty to find the crop button. But here it is – below the screen, on the left, there are two icons, and the second one says – Tools…</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-davinci-6.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-davinci"
                ></p>
<p> Click on the Tools button and more options will appear down the screen where the video clip is shown. And there, you will notice the famous Crop icon, just the second one, which will put your clip in a new window with the option below to crop each side, plus, to add feather around the cropped video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="crop-video-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>When you are ready to make a video bigger and adjust it to a frame size, you need to choose Transform button, left to the Crop icon. You can “touch” the dots on the video and manually manage the size of your cropped clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p><img

                      alt="crop-video-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>When you are ready to save the video you cropped, find Quick Export – you will see the button above the clip, on the right. A little window with settings will appear, so you can choose the format you want to save your video in, and then, of course, click on Export for the last time.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p>So, in this article, we have discussed software Davinci Resolve and how to crop a video there. A step by step, written guides help you make the best out of your video clips and never lose track of what you are doing, also, comparing different video editing platforms and tools will make you understand which one works best for you or&#x2F;and your company. Another part of this article was Wondershare Filmora X and how to crop a video there, also, with a detailed guide there. We hope you know a little more about programs, editing, and your own choice!</p>
<p>To touch upon the functions, Davinci Resolve includes modules for video editing, color correction, audio mixing and effects, and visual effects. The interface of it is quite advanced, but would be well and soon understandable for someone who has ever used a similar editing software, such as Adobe Premiere Pro. If you are interested in everything the software has to offer, we recommend watching this very viral beginner <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63Ln33O4p4c" >tutorial <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>Now, back to cropping – so, you want to crop the video you took or got somehow, and you also think about using Davinci Resolve? Cropping, in most cases, meaning different applications, platforms and software, is not a complicated task at all, and you can do it in a very short amount of time in Davinci Resolve, too. Therefore, let’s delve into the steps on how to do it!</p>
<p>First, download and install the software, and when it is finished, launch it. You will see a totally clean program, until you add the video you want to work on. To do so, you have to find File in the top menu, find Import and then choose Media.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-davinci-2.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>Then it will open a new window where you can choose your file…</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-davinci-3.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>Your chosen file will be added in Media Pool, and to direct it into the sequence, you have to drag and drop it there.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-davinci-4.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-davinci"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-davinci-5.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>And then you might have difficulty to find the crop button. But here it is – below the screen, on the left, there are two icons, and the second one says – Tools…</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-davinci-6.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-davinci"
                ></p>
<p> Click on the Tools button and more options will appear down the screen where the video clip is shown. And there, you will notice the famous Crop icon, just the second one, which will put your clip in a new window with the option below to crop each side, plus, to add feather around the cropped video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="crop-video-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>When you are ready to make a video bigger and adjust it to a frame size, you need to choose Transform button, left to the Crop icon. You can “touch” the dots on the video and manually manage the size of your cropped clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="crop-video-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>When you are ready to save the video you cropped, find Quick Export – you will see the button above the clip, on the right. A little window with settings will appear, so you can choose the format you want to save your video in, and then, of course, click on Export for the last time.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
