However, one common drawback that all of them had was versatility. They offered high-speed manipulation settings but with limited additional features. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a world-class, all-in-one video editing software. Anyone can use it, from a beginner to a professional or from an Android user to an iOS user.</p>
<p>When you enter this <strong>slow-motion video converter</strong>, it displays two types of speed modification. One is the Uniform Speed option, while the other one is Speed Ramping. Both of them excel at their tasks and offer custom speed and duration settings. Filmora has recently introduced the “Optical Flow” option in its latest V13 upgrade. This helps to smoothen out a slo-mo video by adding frame rates.</p>

To do so, first, choose the “Speed” tab from the bottom toolbar. Then tap the “Speed Effects” option and specify your speed as X2, X4, etc.</p>

                      alt="speed video up using splice - set effect"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4. Add a speed point</strong><br>Just tap the white “+” button to add a speed point to your video.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Determine an endpoint</strong><br>Now position the yellow line once more at the point where you intend to end the effect. Next, click on the white “+” button again and you will have specified the endpoint.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6. Set the desired speed</strong><br>Finally, choose the segment whose speed you wish to adjust. Use the “Slider” at the bottom to set the speed you want for your video. Then save and share your video.</p>
