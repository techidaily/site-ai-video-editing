<p>Step 1: Open Filmora and remove all the pieces of the footage. Then arrange the rest of the footage as you see fit. Click on “Effects” on the upper left corner of your screen and then on “Filters”. Click on the Old Video effect and then drop it. After you add the filter on the segment of your video, you can drag the end of it to cover the whole duration of the movies. Click twice on the filter if you want to adjust the filter settings. Enter the desired values on the “Fade” parameter, “Frequency”, and “Alpha” options. Press “OK”, and this step is concluded.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 2: You can apply the black and white filters to any project in Filmora. It is very simple. Add one of the filters above the video you want to add the effect and drag one of the corners to adjust the duration. You can change the intensity through the alpha slider.</p>

                      alt="old film overlay 2"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: In Filmora, you can add sepia tone rise or sun-kissed filters to your video. You are able to add desaturated filters while keeping colors like blue and green and with that create the old film style. If you want more brown and red tones, you can use the Sun-Kisser filter that highlights those colors. Adjust the filters with the alpha slider to change intensity.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 4: Under the black and white subcategory, you can find Ash and Willow filters. What these do is desaturate the contrast or exposure values as well as preset brightness and bring an older tone to your videos.</p>
<p>Step 5: You can correct any kind of filter. With the Advanced Color Correction Tab, you can navigate through features like Preset and Adjustment and desaturate your video. By clicking on the “Preset tab,” you can open a larger variety of presets, including the Old Film and Black &amp; White presets.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 1: Open Filmora and remove all the pieces of the footage. Then arrange the rest of the footage as you see fit. Click on “Effects” on the upper left corner of your screen and then on “Filters”. Click on the Old Video effect and then drop it. After you add the filter on the segment of your video, you can drag the end of it to cover the whole duration of the movies. Click twice on the filter if you want to adjust the filter settings. Enter the desired values on the “Fade” parameter, “Frequency”, and “Alpha” options. Press “OK”, and this step is concluded.</p>

                      alt="old film overlay 1"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: You can apply the black and white filters to any project in Filmora. It is very simple. Add one of the filters above the video you want to add the effect and drag one of the corners to adjust the duration. You can change the intensity through the alpha slider.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="old film overlay 2"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: In Filmora, you can add sepia tone rise or sun-kissed filters to your video. You are able to add desaturated filters while keeping colors like blue and green and with that create the old film style. If you want more brown and red tones, you can use the Sun-Kisser filter that highlights those colors. Adjust the filters with the alpha slider to change intensity.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 4: Under the black and white subcategory, you can find Ash and Willow filters. What these do is desaturate the contrast or exposure values as well as preset brightness and bring an older tone to your videos.</p>
<p>Step 5: You can correct any kind of filter. With the Advanced Color Correction Tab, you can navigate through features like Preset and Adjustment and desaturate your video. By clicking on the “Preset tab,” you can open a larger variety of presets, including the Old Film and Black &amp; White presets.</p>

                      alt="mute audio feature in filmora v13"
                ></p>
<h3 id="Method-2-Use-the-Audio-Detach-feature-3"><a href="#Method-2-Use-the-Audio-Detach-feature-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Use the Audio Detach feature"></a>Method 2: Use the Audio Detach feature</h3><p>Now, let’s turn our focus to a different, efficient way. The Audio Detach function becomes a potent feature for separating audio from videos. Let’s check out its detailed instructions for precisely separating audio and video.</p>
<h4 id="Step1Upload-Your-Video-3"><a href="#Step1Upload-Your-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="Step1Upload Your Video"></a>Step1Upload Your Video</h4><p>First, select the video clip whose audio you want to extract. You can start by clicking “Import” and then navigating to the relevant folder on your hard drive.</p>
<p>While you pick more files, keep the “Ctrl” button down to select them all at once. The main editing dashboard will show thumbnails of all the currently loaded files. You can see a preview in the right-hand window when you double-click them.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/02/the-best-way-to-remove-audio-from-your-videos-2.jpg"
                      alt="import media in filmora v13"
                ></p>
<h4 id="Step2Cut-Out-the-Music-3"><a href="#Step2Cut-Out-the-Music-3" class="headerlink" title="Step2Cut Out the Music"></a>Step2Cut Out the Music</h4><p>Now, you should drag videos from the dashboard into the Video Timeline. After that, you can right-click the video to choose the “Audio Detach” option.</p>
<p>The Music Timeline will immediately display a new audio file. Here, you can see the original video’s soundtrack. Now, pressing the “Delete” button can remove the sounds.</p>
<p>You can also detach audio from multiple video files. Remember, all the files will mesh together perfectly on the Video Timeline.</p>
<p>Thus, you need to click the application icon on the left-hand side of the screen and choose “Save As…” to create new project files if you need to extract audio from more than one file. Then, export each output file individually after reloading the project file.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="audio detach in filmora v13"
                ></p>
<h4 id="Step3Download-the-Video-3"><a href="#Step3Download-the-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="Step3Download the Video"></a>Step3Download the Video</h4><p>To be sure this is what you need, double-tap the file in the Video Timeline. You can add suitable music files to the clip if needed. To save only the video track, click the “Create” option directly. A popup will open up, asking you to choose a format before you can save it to your PC.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/02/the-best-way-to-remove-audio-from-your-videos-3.jpg"
                      alt="export video in filmora v13"
                ></p>
<p>The Music Timeline will immediately display a new audio file. Here, you can see the original video’s soundtrack. Now, pressing the “Delete” button can remove the sounds.</p>
<p>You can also detach audio from multiple video files. Remember, all the files will mesh together perfectly on the Video Timeline.</p>
<p>Thus, you need to click the application icon on the left-hand side of the screen and choose “Save As…” to create new project files if you need to extract audio from more than one file. Then, export each output file individually after reloading the project file.</p>
<p>Now you know how to <strong>remove audio from videos</strong> in Wondershare <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>Filmora</strong></a>. As you can see, removing background noise from videos is a breeze using Filmora. You don’t need extensive experience or expensive software packages.</p>
<p>Follow the simple steps outlined above, even if this is your first time. You may remove distracting or unnecessary audio from your file in just a few minutes.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>As you can see, your ability to control the audio in video editing defines the viewing experience. It is about not just transforming video material but also expanding possibilities. This silent space is where imagination soars.</p>
<p>It’s a technique to make your video clips more adaptable. Thus, they can transcend language obstacles, legal limitations, and distractions.</p>
<p>Think of a vacation video where the beautiful sights and sounds of the busy streets are in front. It will allow the audience to lose themselves in the lively atmosphere completely. If you remove the audio from this clip, it can become livelier.</p>
<p>In short, sound removal is crucial in creating a more engaging story. It changes the viewer’s experience by focusing on visuals and increasing engagement. You can use Filmora’s powerful audio removal features. The software streamlines the editing process without compromising the quality of the video. Learn to use silence as a tool to tell stories and make people feel things in your videos.</p>
