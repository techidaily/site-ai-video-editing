Traditional PPT files produced by PowerPoint have many drawbacks, including the fact that the content of your presentations may be readily edited and reused by others.</p>
<p>The Save to Video option in 2010 and subsequent versions of PowerPoint addresses this problem by allowing users to produce video files that may be readily shared on social media, video sharing sites, or utilized in eLearning courses. The built-in PPT file conversion function in newer versions of PowerPoint has several restrictions that prohibit you from picking the video file type or incorporating embedded media files in the PowerPoint presentation video.</p>
<p>That’s why we’ve compiled a list of the top five video to ppt converter to make the process of turning a PowerPoint presentation into a movie as simple and enjoyable as possible.</p>

<h2 id="4-Solutions-to-Resize-a-WebM-File"><a href="#4-Solutions-to-Resize-a-WebM-File" class="headerlink" title="4 Solutions to Resize a WebM File"></a>4 Solutions to Resize a WebM File</h2><p>People resize videos for many reasons, the most common one being to reduce file size. Others might be to meet a specification, or for compatibility. When you resize a video file, you reduce its file size considerably- making it load faster on devices, reduce processing time, and save a lot of space. Most people prefer watching videos that are smaller in size compared to larger ones, that’s why some social media sites like Instagram, Tiktok, etc have preferred video resolutions, so if you are a user on these sites you might want to resize your video to fit.</p>
<p>The biggest concern most people have about resizing videos is whether it will retain its quality, another concern is that you don’t want to crop out your video while resizing. If the format of the video is mp4, wmv, avi, etc which usually have very large size, resizing it might be a bit of a problem because the video quality will reduce a lot, but if it’s a WebM video file, you can still achieve a good video quality even after multiple compression or changing its resolution, that’s because its codecs- VP8 and VP9 were designed specifically for that, and it’s supported by all browsers.</p>
<p>In the course of this article, we’re assuming you already have a WebM video and you want to resize it, and still maintain its quality so you can upload on your favourite websites without any hassles. We have handpicked some proven methods to help you with that, let’s see them:</p>
<h2 id="Method-1-Resize-WebM-file-with-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Method-1-Resize-WebM-file-with-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Resize WebM file with Wondershare Filmora"></a>Method 1: Resize WebM file with Wondershare Filmora</h2><p>Wondershare <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a great video editing software that comes with a lot of features. You can easily perform basic editing techniques in a few minutes. It also comes with lots of filters to make your videos pop.</p>
<p>For video resizing, Filmora offers you a couple of options: First you have an option of changing the resolution just before you export your video; you also have the option of cropping your videos to your preferred size and cutting out redundant parts of your videos to save space; but the third option is what we’ll show you in this guide, because we imagine you already have your video exported and you just want to resize. You can easily do that by changing the aspect ratio and we’ll show you in a few steps:</p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>

<p>For macOS 10.14 or later</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Go to the official Wondershare Filmora website and download the software.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Install Wondershare Filmora on your PC and double click to launch.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Change your aspect ratio. When you launch Filmora, you’re allowed to choose your preferred aspect ratio on the start page.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/resize-webm-1.png"
                      alt="resize-webm"
                ></p>
<p>Select your preferred aspect ratio from the list of options- 16:9 (widescreen), 4:3 (standard), 1:1 (Instagram), 9:16 (portrait). For example, if you import a 16:9 video file into Filmora, and set it to 1:1 aspect ratio then, the final output file will be 1:1, which is the perfect aspect ratio for Instagram posts.</p>
<p>You’ll see below that I selected 1:1 for instagram. After you are done selecting your preferred aspect ratio, hit ‘New Project’.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="resize-webm"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Import your WebM video. After you must have selected your preferred aspect ratio, the next step is to import the video you want to resize; you can do this by clicking on the import icon shown below. Once done, drag the video to the timeline also shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/resize-webm-3.png"
                      alt="resize-webm"

<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="resize-webm"
                ></p>
<p>A floating window will appear and you’ll be asked to change project settings to match the media. Click on ‘Keep project settings’. Filmora will change the aspect ratio of the original video you imported to your preferred aspect ratio.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                     lazyload

                      alt="resize-webm"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Save your video. Once the video is now properly placed in the timeline, next thing is hit ‘export’ to save your video. You can go to the ‘format tab’ to change the video output format to WebM or whatever format you choose then hit ‘Export’.</p>

<h2 id="Method-2-How-to-resize-WebM-file-with-VLC"><a href="#Method-2-How-to-resize-WebM-file-with-VLC" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: How to resize WebM file with VLC"></a>Method 2: How to resize WebM file with VLC</h2><p>VLC is a free and open source multimedia player. It is arguably the best media player out there and that’s for a reason- it can play almost everything without the need for any external codecs.</p>
<p>The playback feature is amazing but that’s not the only thing it can do. VLC outshines most other media players because of some extra features it possesses. It resizes and converts media files, downloads and adds subtitles, records screen, as well as is customizable in settings and expandable via plugins.</p>
<p>What we want to use in this guide is its media resizing feature, so let’s show you how you can use it in these steps:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download VLC Media player from the official VLC page and install it on your windows or Mac PC.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Launch VLC after installing by double-clicking on the software.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Click “Media” in the toolbar.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Select “Convert &#x2F; Save”. You can also tap shortcut keys Ctrl + R to quickly open a new window.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="resize-webm"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Click “Add”. You can load one or more video files. Here, I’ll choose a colour grading video on my desktop. You can see it has the extension ‘.webm’. After loading the video file you want to resize, click “Convert &#x2F; Save” again.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/resize-webm-9.png"

                      alt="resize-webm"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong>: Choose your desired output profile type. With VLC, you can resize video to MP4, WebM, TS, and other formats.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8</strong>: Click the settings icon to access the settings window and select the video codec where you can adjust parameters like frame rate, bitrate, resolution, etc to change video file size. I changed the frame rate of my video to 30fps which is ideal for high quality videos. Also click the resolution tab and set your desired resolution then click save.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Go to the official Wondershare Filmora website and download the software.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Install Wondershare Filmora on your PC and double click to launch.</p>

<p>Select your preferred aspect ratio from the list of options- 16:9 (widescreen), 4:3 (standard), 1:1 (Instagram), 9:16 (portrait). For example, if you import a 16:9 video file into Filmora, and set it to 1:1 aspect ratio then, the final output file will be 1:1, which is the perfect aspect ratio for Instagram posts.</p>
<p>You’ll see below that I selected 1:1 for instagram. After you are done selecting your preferred aspect ratio, hit ‘New Project’.</p>

It is arguably the best media player out there and that’s for a reason- it can play almost everything without the need for any external codecs.</p>
<p>The playback feature is amazing but that’s not the only thing it can do. VLC outshines most other media players because of some extra features it possesses. It resizes and converts media files, downloads and adds subtitles, records screen, as well as is customizable in settings and expandable via plugins.</p>
<p>What we want to use in this guide is its media resizing feature, so let’s show you how you can use it in these steps:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download VLC Media player from the official VLC page and install it on your windows or Mac PC.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Launch VLC after installing by double-clicking on the software.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Click “Media” in the toolbar.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Select “Convert &#x2F; Save”. You can also tap shortcut keys Ctrl + R to quickly open a new window.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Click “Add”. You can load one or more video files. Here, I’ll choose a colour grading video on my desktop. You can see it has the extension ‘.webm’. After loading the video file you want to resize, click “Convert &#x2F; Save” again.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong>: Choose your desired output profile type. With VLC, you can resize video to MP4, WebM, TS, and other formats.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8</strong>: Click the settings icon to access the settings window and select the video codec where you can adjust parameters like frame rate, bitrate, resolution, etc to change video file size. I changed the frame rate of my video to 30fps which is ideal for high quality videos. Also click the resolution tab and set your desired resolution then click save.</p>

<p>For macOS 10.14 or later</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Go to the official Wondershare Filmora website and download the software.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Install Wondershare Filmora on your PC and double click to launch.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Change your aspect ratio. When you launch Filmora, you’re allowed to choose your preferred aspect ratio on the start page.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>Select your preferred aspect ratio from the list of options- 16:9 (widescreen), 4:3 (standard), 1:1 (Instagram), 9:16 (portrait). For example, if you import a 16:9 video file into Filmora, and set it to 1:1 aspect ratio then, the final output file will be 1:1, which is the perfect aspect ratio for Instagram posts.</p>
<p>You’ll see below that I selected 1:1 for instagram. After you are done selecting your preferred aspect ratio, hit ‘New Project’.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Import your WebM video. After you must have selected your preferred aspect ratio, the next step is to import the video you want to resize; you can do this by clicking on the import icon shown below. Once done, drag the video to the timeline also shown below.</p>

<p>For macOS 10.14 or later</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Go to the official Wondershare Filmora website and download the software.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Install Wondershare Filmora on your PC and double click to launch.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Change your aspect ratio. When you launch Filmora, you’re allowed to choose your preferred aspect ratio on the start page.</p>

                      alt="resize-webm"
                ></p>
<p>Select your preferred aspect ratio from the list of options- 16:9 (widescreen), 4:3 (standard), 1:1 (Instagram), 9:16 (portrait). For example, if you import a 16:9 video file into Filmora, and set it to 1:1 aspect ratio then, the final output file will be 1:1, which is the perfect aspect ratio for Instagram posts.</p>
<p>You’ll see below that I selected 1:1 for instagram. After you are done selecting your preferred aspect ratio, hit ‘New Project’.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Import your WebM video. After you must have selected your preferred aspect ratio, the next step is to import the video you want to resize; you can do this by clicking on the import icon shown below. Once done, drag the video to the timeline also shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="resize-webm"
                ></p>
<p>A floating window will appear and you’ll be asked to change project settings to match the media. Click on ‘Keep project settings’. Filmora will change the aspect ratio of the original video you imported to your preferred aspect ratio.</p>

It is arguably the best media player out there and that’s for a reason- it can play almost everything without the need for any external codecs.</p>
<p>The playback feature is amazing but that’s not the only thing it can do. VLC outshines most other media players because of some extra features it possesses. It resizes and converts media files, downloads and adds subtitles, records screen, as well as is customizable in settings and expandable via plugins.</p>
<p>What we want to use in this guide is its media resizing feature, so let’s show you how you can use it in these steps:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download VLC Media player from the official VLC page and install it on your windows or Mac PC.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Launch VLC after installing by double-clicking on the software.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Click “Media” in the toolbar.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Select “Convert &#x2F; Save”. You can also tap shortcut keys Ctrl + R to quickly open a new window.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="resize-webm"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Click “Add”. You can load one or more video files. Here, I’ll choose a colour grading video on my desktop. You can see it has the extension ‘.webm’. After loading the video file you want to resize, click “Convert &#x2F; Save” again.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/resize-webm-9.png"

                      alt="resize-webm"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong>: Choose your desired output profile type. With VLC, you can resize video to MP4, WebM, TS, and other formats.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8</strong>: Click the settings icon to access the settings window and select the video codec where you can adjust parameters like frame rate, bitrate, resolution, etc to change video file size. I changed the frame rate of my video to 30fps which is ideal for high quality videos. Also click the resolution tab and set your desired resolution then click save.</p>

<p>You only need one green screen software – OBS. The reason why OBS is the most recommended for streaming is because once you have set it up properly, you can do literally anything you can think of with the software (either with or without added plug-ins).</p>
<h2 id="Chroma-Key-Settings-in-OBS"><a href="#Chroma-Key-Settings-in-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Chroma Key Settings in OBS"></a>Chroma Key Settings in OBS</h2><p>Chroma keying has become incredibly popular nowadays. People use it not just for gaming, but also in Zoom conferences, live interviews, talk shows, etc. Although it may feel complicated at first glance, setting up Chroma Key in OBS Studio is actually incredibly easy.</p>
<p>Have a look at the simple steps you need to take to set up a green screen in OBS:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you have the following equipment prepared: a solid green background, webcam or video camera, lighting, and OBS Studio.</li>
<li>Download the latest stable version of OBS Studio from the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://obsproject.com/" >official website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and install the software. Open OBS and let the Auto-Configuration Wizard optimize the software’s settings based on your hardware.</li>
<li>Now you can add a video source.</li>
<li>Right-click on the video source you’ve created and select Filter.</li>
<li>Click the + button under the Effects Filters section and select Chroma Key.</li>
<li>Type in a name for this effect layer.</li>
<li>After you add a chroma key, OBS will automatically create and adjust the baseline settings for the filter. You can experiment with the sliders and settle when you are satisfied with the result.</li>
<li>Make sure you aren’t wearing any green or reflective material. You can double-check the performance on the preview screen.</li>
<li>If things are working smoothly, you are all set to start streaming with the green screen on.</li>
</ol>
<p>Pro tip:</p>
<p>You can follow the instructions above and live stream to multiple platforms at once with Restream. Multistreaming to platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Twitch, and LinkedIn allows you to drastically increase the audience reach and grow your followers.</p>

<li>Evenly light your green screen so you can get a good key.</li>
<li>Watch out for light flares. Use some a matte box or your trusty paw to block out any unwanted light.</li>
<li>When lighting, try to create as much separation between your subject and the green screen as you can.</li>
<li>Shutter speed: Minimize motion blur by raising your shutter speed to 1&#x2F;80 or 1&#x2F;100</li>
<li>Aperture: Setting your aperture to f4 or f5.6 will give you slightly more depth of field, which will blur and smooth out your green screen.</li>
<li>Format: Set your camera to the best recording format it has.</li>
