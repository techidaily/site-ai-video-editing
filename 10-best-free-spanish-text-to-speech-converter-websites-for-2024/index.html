<p>Text to Speech (TTS) is a technology that basically converts digital text into artificial audio. In this article, we’ll be sharing with you the 10 best Spanish text-to-speech converter websites that you can use for free. But before actually moving to the list, here is a little information on this topic.</p>
<p>When it comes to free text to speech converter websites, there are a lot of them on the internet but not all of them support the Spanish language as the majority of websites only support English. While creating this list of best free Spanish text to speech converter websites, we made sure to include only the trustworthy and legit sites that have positive feedback and don’t misuse your data or information because cybersecurity is a serious issue and today’s internet is full of scams and frauds. So one thing we can assure you is that all the TTS websites listed in this article are not only free but trustworthy as well.</p>
<p>As we all know, free stuff always comes with limitations (in most cases). However, we have tried our very best to provide you with a list of the best TTS converter websites that offer the highest benefits with the lowest limitations for free. Therefore, some websites in this list might be completely free while some might have a free plan to use but whatever they might be, know that they offer the best for something that’s free and includes support for Spanish.</p>

But it can also be used to remove the background of an animated GIF. Here, we will discuss the step-by-step approach to removing an animated GIF background.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Import The GIF File</strong></p>
<p>This can be done in 2 ways. One is clicking and dragging the file from the file location on the computer, into Photoshop. The second way is to click on the “File” menu of Photoshop. Then tap on “Open” and double click on the desired GIF file.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/why-your-transparent-gif-Is-hard-to-remove-and-how-to-do-with-It-1.jpg"
                      alt="import file photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Set Up The Project</strong></p>
<p>It is required to edit each frame separately for deleting the background of an animated GIF (<strong>gif remove bg</strong>). For this:</p>
<p>Find the “Video Group” option on the right side of Photoshop. Right-click on it and tap on the “Ungroup layers” option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/why-your-transparent-gif-Is-hard-to-remove-and-how-to-do-with-It-2.jpg"
                      alt="ungroup video photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>This will give you the video layer, which you want to edit. Right-click on “layer 1” and tap on the “Convert to smart object” option. Again right-click on “Layer 1” and click on “Edit Contents”.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/why-your-transparent-gif-Is-hard-to-remove-and-how-to-do-with-It-3.jpg"
                      alt="converted to so photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>You will get a new Photoshop tap for the editing of GIF files. Just freely close the original tab.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Begin The Editing Part</strong></p>
<p>Find the blue line called the Timeline at the bottom of the screen. This Timeline will help you to edit the GIF. To make your editing easy, you can zoom on the frames with the help of a slider located at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>For a better outcome, the frame-by-frame deletion of the GIF background is advisable. It might be a little time-consuming but it is the most appropriate and accurate approach. So, delete the background from each frame independently.</p>
<p>To move from one frame of the GIF to another, hold and move the blue arrow having a red line.</p>
<p>\</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Delete The Transparent GIF Background</strong></p>
<p>Now, delete the background of each frame of your GIF. To delete the background of any particular frame, click on that frame. For this, you can either use a “Quick Selection Tool” or a “Polygonal Lasso Tool”. You will get the final result that will be background free.</p>

But it can also be used to remove the background of an animated GIF. Here, we will discuss the step-by-step approach to removing an animated GIF background.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Import The GIF File</strong></p>
<p>This can be done in 2 ways. One is clicking and dragging the file from the file location on the computer, into Photoshop. The second way is to click on the “File” menu of Photoshop. Then tap on “Open” and double click on the desired GIF file.</p>

                      alt="import file photoshop"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Set Up The Project</strong></p>
<p>It is required to edit each frame separately for deleting the background of an animated GIF (<strong>gif remove bg</strong>). For this:</p>
<p>Find the “Video Group” option on the right side of Photoshop. Right-click on it and tap on the “Ungroup layers” option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/why-your-transparent-gif-Is-hard-to-remove-and-how-to-do-with-It-2.jpg"
                      alt="ungroup video photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>This will give you the video layer, which you want to edit. Right-click on “layer 1” and tap on the “Convert to smart object” option. Again right-click on “Layer 1” and click on “Edit Contents”.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="converted to so photoshop"
                ></p>
<p>You will get a new Photoshop tap for the editing of GIF files. Just freely close the original tab.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Begin The Editing Part</strong></p>
<p>Find the blue line called the Timeline at the bottom of the screen. This Timeline will help you to edit the GIF. To make your editing easy, you can zoom on the frames with the help of a slider located at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>For a better outcome, the frame-by-frame deletion of the GIF background is advisable. It might be a little time-consuming but it is the most appropriate and accurate approach. So, delete the background from each frame independently.</p>
<p>To move from one frame of the GIF to another, hold and move the blue arrow having a red line.</p>

<p>Using Plastuer or BioniX wallpaper changer as a 3rd party software is the best way to use animated gifs for your desktop.</p>
<p>As a starting point, we’ll cover plastuer, which uses WebGL and chromium-browser to make gifs as your background.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="plastuer"
                ></p>
<p>The software includes selecting different screens where you want the wallpaper to appear, making it possible to apply it to different screens at once.</p>
<p>To select the gif you want:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can paste the URL of the gif you want to use.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can also use the “create playlist” field to add multiple gifs as your background.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can select a file from your device using the “select file” option.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Or you can choose from hundreds of gifs present in the plastuer library.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can disable the wallpaper whenever you wish by clicking on the “disable wallpaper” option.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="plastuer 2"
                ></p>
<p><strong>How to use the bioniX wallpaper changer?</strong></p>
<p>BioniX comes with several options that one may need to apply to their Windows device’s background, and animated gif backgrounds are one of them.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="bionix wallpaper changer"
                ></p>
<p>You will need to download the software and once it is installed, launch it on your PC to apply cool gif backgrounds. To choose files from the device itself, you will have to use the shortcut command “CTRL+F”, or you can also choose to insert the URL of the gif you want to use as your background.</p>
<p>Once your image gets uploaded into the software, double click on it to set it as your windows wallpaper. You can also choose a launch of gifs, create a playlist, and select the timer to change wallpaper regularly.</p>
