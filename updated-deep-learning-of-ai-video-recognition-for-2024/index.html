<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-AI-Video-Recognition-and-How-Does-Video-Recognition-Work"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-AI-Video-Recognition-and-How-Does-Video-Recognition-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is AI Video Recognition and How Does Video Recognition Work?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What is AI Video Recognition and How Does Video Recognition Work?</strong></h2><p><strong>AI Video Recognition</strong> is the capability of machines to obtain, analyze, and process information received from videos. It allows us to quickly assess video data by detecting objects, behaviors, people, and vehicles of concern.</p>
<p>In today’s world, we all look at video as a piece of critical evidence used in different situations such as security investigations and law enforcement because it holds a lot of valuable data. In addition, video is seen as a very unclear format lacking context, scheme, and structure, making it hard to deal with. But with the use of AI in machines, you can effectively handle data with video recognition.</p>
<p>Also, video recognition is not the same as facial or image recognition, regardless of its name, even though they are interrelated. Video recognition is referred to as video content analysis or intelligent video analytics because it entails many tasks. Thus, AI is used in video recognition to rapidly reduce the time for research from weeks or months to seconds and process mass video data.</p>
<p>Video recognition employs AI to complete the tasks by applying enhanced deep learning (DL) and computer vision (CV) models to live video streams or recorded video footage. The following are the most common ways <strong>AI video recognition</strong> works:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Classification of Image: It allows the selection of the right category for a video</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Localization: It helps to locate a target object in the video</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Detection of Object: Categorize and locate the object in the video</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Identification of Object: Instances of the object of interest</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Tracking of Object: It can track the object’s trajectory, which will change in the video.</p>

It is the ability to use Artificial Intelligence to quickly process mass video data and reduce the required time for analysis.</p>
<p>Alternatively, facial recognition describes a biometric technology beyond recognizing when a human face is present (Facial detection). Facial recognition attempts to establish the owner of a particular face. AI Facial recognition works by quickly utilizing a computer application that captures an individual’s face’s digital image, sometimes taken from a video frame, and compares it to images stored in the database records.</p>

It allows us to quickly assess video data by detecting objects, behaviors, people, and vehicles of concern.</p>
<p>In today’s world, we all look at video as a piece of critical evidence used in different situations such as security investigations and law enforcement because it holds a lot of valuable data. In addition, video is seen as a very unclear format lacking context, scheme, and structure, making it hard to deal with. But with the use of AI in machines, you can effectively handle data with video recognition.</p>
<p>Also, video recognition is not the same as facial or image recognition, regardless of its name, even though they are interrelated. Video recognition is referred to as video content analysis or intelligent video analytics because it entails many tasks. Thus, AI is used in video recognition to rapidly reduce the time for research from weeks or months to seconds and process mass video data.</p>
<p>Video recognition employs AI to complete the tasks by applying enhanced deep learning (DL) and computer vision (CV) models to live video streams or recorded video footage. The following are the most common ways <strong>AI video recognition</strong> works:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Classification of Image: It allows the selection of the right category for a video</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Localization: It helps to locate a target object in the video</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Detection of Object: Categorize and locate the object in the video</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Identification of Object: Instances of the object of interest</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Tracking of Object: It can track the object’s trajectory, which will change in the video.</p>

<p>Alternatively, facial recognition describes a biometric technology beyond recognizing when a human face is present (Facial detection). Facial recognition attempts to establish the owner of a particular face. AI Facial recognition works by quickly utilizing a computer application that captures an individual’s face’s digital image, sometimes taken from a video frame, and compares it to images stored in the database records.</p>

An object (usually a line) moves across the screen, revealing the next scene, while simultaneously removing (or wiping) the previous scene and when used properly, they can create a very powerful effect. It involves creative fading in and out transitions to give a more dramatic look.</p>

</ol>
<p>The latest video editing software offer the export your edited video in multiple formats, out of which 4k, 8k and HD resolution formats are preferable for majority of the professional video editors. It is necessary that even after the video is uploaded to a platform, the pixels do not decrease and the quality of the video is maintained. Although attractive to the viewers, the higher the resolution, the more the data with which you must deal. It is suggested that a standard or default resolution is chosen to play and replay the video in different computers.</p>

<li>Compression rate, bit depth, bit</li>
</ol>
<p>The amount of data the camera records each second is referred to as bit rate. Every single second of a video is subject to significant data processing by cameras. The higher the quality of the video, the more is the bit rate. Bit depth refers to the number of colors your camera can read per pixel. Common bit depths are 8-bit and 10-bit, which enable a camera to read 256 million or 1.07 billion colors respectively. To upload your edited video, a compression is usually required to convert your resolution to internet quality so that the upload can be made simpler, without distorting the video resolution.</p>

<p>If you are a professional video or image creator, you know what aspect ratio is and why aspect ratio is important. Even people passionate about their cameras and visual art enthusiasts know it. If you are a newbie, Let us make it easy for you. This article will talk about the vertical phone aspect ratio ratio, its definition, types, iPhone vertical video dimensions, etc. We’ll also provide you solid tips on mobile vertical video size and how to create phone vertical videos easily. Let’s jump into the topic and see what you can learn.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Phone-Aspect-Ratio-Vertical"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Phone-Aspect-Ratio-Vertical" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical?"></a>Part 1 What is Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical?</h2><p>The vertical phone aspect ratio is the “proportional” relationship between the screen’s width and height. For example, if your image or video has an aspect ratio of 4:5, it simply means the width of the screen (photo or video) is four times the height of the image.</p>
<p>The vertical phone aspect ratio is the “proportional” relationship between the screen’s width and height. For example, if your image or video has an aspect ratio of 4:5, it simply means the width of the screen (photo or video) is four times the height of the image.</p>
<p>Back in the television days, you might have seen certain old pictures with black padding on either side of the screen. It was just that they were shot in different aspect ratios and your television screen had different aspect ratios.</p>
<h3 id="Aspect-Ratio-Vs-Resolution"><a href="#Aspect-Ratio-Vs-Resolution" class="headerlink" title="Aspect Ratio Vs Resolution"></a>Aspect Ratio Vs Resolution</h3><p>Remember that aspect ratio does not refer to the physical size of an image or its dimensions in pixels (resolution). So aspect ratio 3:1 does not refer to the actual width and height of the image or video; it just describes their relationship.</p>
<p>You are wrong if you think aspect ratio is just another fancy name for resolution. Think again. Check out how it is calculated.</p>

<h3 id="Aspect-Ratio-Calculator"><a href="#Aspect-Ratio-Calculator" class="headerlink" title="Aspect Ratio Calculator"></a>Aspect Ratio Calculator</h3><p>To get the resolution, you need to multiply width times the height. To get aspect ratio, the formula is: Divide the width by the height or simply divide the long side by the short side.</p>
<p>There are multiple online aspect ratio calculators available. Check out the value for both the images and the videos generated through the photo ratio calculator for your ease.</p>

<p>For example, the aspect ratio of 3:1 may be an image of 3m wide and 1m high. At the same time it can be 3 feet wide and 1 foot high. For further simplification, consider dimensions in pixels: a 6000×4000 image has 3:2 aspect ratios.</p>
<p>Always remember this small but crucial point. The aspect ratio refers to the image or video you captured or recorded and the display (or screen) in which your video or image would be displayed.</p>
<h3 id="Why-is-the-aspect-ratio-important"><a href="#Why-is-the-aspect-ratio-important" class="headerlink" title="Why is the aspect ratio important?"></a>Why is the aspect ratio important?</h3><p>In the age of web content, asking why aspect ratio is important? Some may consider it naïve. Images need to be uploaded at different aspect ratios for different uses (desktop vs. mobile or blog vs. social media). Incorrect aspect ratio affects your final image and end-user experience.</p>
<p>Choice of the wrong aspect ratio can eliminate the potential for editing (cropping and resizing). In addition, using the correct aspect ratios saves you from facing the trouble of distortion or clipping.</p>

                ></p>
<p>If you have seen a square-shaped image, it had probably a 1:1 aspect ratio. It simply means both sides (width and height of the image) are equal. It was initially the aspect ratio of square television sets. However, this is commonly used for print photos, mobile screens, and social platforms.</p>
<p>● 3:2 Ratio</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>Initially used for classic 35 mm film and still photography, aspect ratio 3:5 is still used on some laptops, tablets, and handheld game consoles. The famous example of this aspect ratio Images framed at 1080×720 pixels or 6″x4″.</p>
<p>● 5:4 Ratio</p>

                ></p>
<p>It was commonly used for photography and art prints. For Images having dimensions, 8″x10″ and 16x20 have the 5:4 aspect ratios.</p>

<p>Like the image aspect ratios, video aspect ratios would also profoundly affect its composition and thus how your directed viewers perceive it. Some common mobile vertical video size or video aspect ratios are given below.</p>
<p>● 16:9 Ratio</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>If you have seen presentation slides, computer monitors, or widescreee seen this slimmer and more elongated rectangular-shaped 16:9 Ratio. This is the standardized widescreen aspect ratio that you see everywhere on the web. In terms of pixel common dimension for 16:9 is 1920×1080 pixels and 1280×720 pixels.</p>
<p>● 9:16 Ratio (Vertical)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>When smartphones started coming with video capabilities, this Ratio became popular. Likewise, today this Ratio is trendy for social media platforms with video story capabilities.</p>
<p>The Instagram story typically consists of 1080x1920 pixels, which in terms of aspect ratio is 9:16. Most phones, such as iPhone, have a feature that allows you to record footage in both (16:9 as well as 9:16).</p>
<h3 id="Phone-aspect-ratio-vertical"><a href="#Phone-aspect-ratio-vertical" class="headerlink" title="Phone aspect ratio vertical"></a>Phone aspect ratio vertical</h3><p>Back in the day, taking aspect ratio vertical (portrait mode) footage was considered unprofessional and a sign of an amateur. But the digital revolution has changed that. Now from unforgivable sin, the vewayal mode has practically become a mainstream media sensation. Vertical style has now become the dominant format.</p>

<p>Phone aspect ratio vertical simply means taller screen than wider. The most common type is 9:16 (1080x1920 pixels), a typical vertical videos aspect ratio. Although this phone aspect ratio vertical comes in a few more shapes and sizes such as 4:5, 2:3.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Tips-to-Create-Phone-Vertical-Videos"><a href="#Part-3-Tips-to-Create-Phone-Vertical-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Tips to Create Phone Vertical Videos"></a>Part 3 Tips to Create Phone Vertical Videos</h2><p>Creating vertical videos is crucial for getting engagements and growing your brand. It is easy with a phone because most smartphones, by default, record in 9:16, which is the standard vertical aspect ratio. But with a camera, you have to manually edit to the correct aspect ratio before you shoot it.</p>
<p>You can also shoot horizontally and then change it to vertical, but it needs professional videographer expertise.</p>
<p>Who wants to rotate their phones watching videos? Well, as far as the trend, Let us see some tiny but handy tips for creating vertical phone videos.</p>
<h3 id="1-Choose-the-correct-aspect-ratio"><a href="#1-Choose-the-correct-aspect-ratio" class="headerlink" title="1. Choose the correct aspect ratio"></a>1. Choose the correct aspect ratio</h3><p>Video taller than the 1:1 aspect ratio is commonly considered Vertical video. Types of these vertical aspects ratio include 4:5 (social), 2:3 and 9:16. They are all taller than they are wide, thus vertical.</p>
<p>Choosing the correct aspect ratio for your vertical video, always think about why and where you intend to use the video. The second important thing you should consider is your plans for editing that video.</p>
<p>Cropping horizontal can be irritating and sometimes disappointing at the same time. Producing a 9:16 vertical frame at HD resolution from a horizontal HD frame may result in very pixelated and low-quality footage.</p>
<p>If, for some reason, you still want first to shoot it horizontal and then change it back to mobile vertical video size. You may need to shoot in 4K horizontally to get extra pixels to work with. It can later be cropped in the sides to 9:16 (Vertical phone aspect ratio). Plus, you won’t need to scale it anymore.</p>
<h3 id="2-Direct-your-viewer’s-eyes"><a href="#2-Direct-your-viewer’s-eyes" class="headerlink" title="2. Direct your viewer’s eyes"></a>2. Direct your viewer’s eyes</h3><p>For hooking social media viewers, you need to put your most interesting visual upfront. These include GIFs, colourful stop-motion or looping animation. Always try to match your first couple of shots with your overall brand personality.</p>
<p>3. Screen splitting into two or more</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-11.png"
                      alt="screen splitting"
                ></p>
<p>A tall vertical screen can be styled with multiple horizontal clips on top of each other. These clips must relate to your relevant content and overall look. Natural lines or patterns can help display them in the most creative ways.</p>
<h3 id="4-Be-close-to-your-subject"><a href="#4-Be-close-to-your-subject" class="headerlink" title="4. Be close to your subject"></a>4. Be close to your subject</h3><p>For producing an intimate experience with the vertical frame, you should get closer to the subject. Most of the action will be positioned to the centre as your viewers scroll. Do not let cut off or cover up your main subject by any text and make sure you leave enough room for text, emojis and stickers.</p>
<h3 id="5-Filling-the-vertical-space"><a href="#5-Filling-the-vertical-space" class="headerlink" title="5. Filling the vertical space"></a>5. Filling the vertical space</h3><p>First, make sure that your subject is vertical-friendly. Then get closer and fill the space within the vertical frame. The vertical frame can be filled through the following:</p>
<p>● Up-close shot (if the subject is personal).</p>
<p>● Raising the camera high and tilting it down (to film things like a long, empty road).</p>
<p>● Bird’s-eye view from above.</p>
<h3 id="5-Rule-of-Third"><a href="#5-Rule-of-Third" class="headerlink" title="5. Rule of Third"></a>5. Rule of Third</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-10.png"
                      alt="rule of third"
                ></p>
<p>This photography rule says not to place the main subject directly in the center of the frame. Create more dynamic composition by creating imaginary (Horizontal &amp; Vertical) lines that divide your frame into thirds.</p>
<p>You have to place your subject either on the lines or where the lines meet up. And guess what? You don’t need to draw imaginary nowadays. Most cameras and smartphones provide you with this option.</p>
<h3 id="6-Avoid-Shaking"><a href="#6-Avoid-Shaking" class="headerlink" title="6. Avoid Shaking"></a>6. Avoid Shaking</h3><p>You do not want to distract your viewers with shaky camera moments. Normal pan and 360-degree rotation are acceptable or maybe even essential. But moving side to side too quickly will make it difficult for the camera to process that information. You better use a selfie stick or gimbal.</p>
<p>Now, check out the best vertical video ratios for various social platforms.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Phone-Aspect-Ratio-Vertical-1"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Phone-Aspect-Ratio-Vertical-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical?"></a>Part 1 What is Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical?</h2><p>The vertical phone aspect ratio is the “proportional” relationship between the screen’s width and height. For example, if your image or video has an aspect ratio of 4:5, it simply means the width of the screen (photo or video) is four times the height of the image.</p>
<p>The vertical phone aspect ratio is the “proportional” relationship between the screen’s width and height. For example, if your image or video has an aspect ratio of 4:5, it simply means the width of the screen (photo or video) is four times the height of the image.</p>
<p>Back in the television days, you might have seen certain old pictures with black padding on either side of the screen. It was just that they were shot in different aspect ratios and your television screen had different aspect ratios.</p>
<h3 id="Aspect-Ratio-Vs-Resolution-1"><a href="#Aspect-Ratio-Vs-Resolution-1" class="headerlink" title="Aspect Ratio Vs Resolution"></a>Aspect Ratio Vs Resolution</h3><p>Remember that aspect ratio does not refer to the physical size of an image or its dimensions in pixels (resolution). So aspect ratio 3:1 does not refer to the actual width and height of the image or video; it just describes their relationship.</p>
<p>You are wrong if you think aspect ratio is just another fancy name for resolution. Think again. Check out how it is calculated.</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>| |  Aspect Ratio | Resolution                                                     |                                                                                    |<br>| ————— | ————————————————————– | ———————————————————————————- |<br>| Definition      | The Ratio of the width of an image to the height of the image. | Total number of pixels displayed on your screen (computer, cell phone, television) |<br>| Commonly Used   | ● 1:1 ● 3:1 ● 3:2 ● 4:3 ● 5:4 ● 9:1 ● 16:9                     | ● 640x480 ● 800x600 ● 1024x768                                                     |</p>
<h3 id="Aspect-Ratio-Calculator-1"><a href="#Aspect-Ratio-Calculator-1" class="headerlink" title="Aspect Ratio Calculator"></a>Aspect Ratio Calculator</h3><p>To get the resolution, you need to multiply width times the height. To get aspect ratio, the formula is: Divide the width by the height or simply divide the long side by the short side.</p>
<p>There are multiple online aspect ratio calculators available. Check out the value for both the images and the videos generated through the photo ratio calculator for your ease.</p>

<p>For example, the aspect ratio of 3:1 may be an image of 3m wide and 1m high. At the same time it can be 3 feet wide and 1 foot high. For further simplification, consider dimensions in pixels: a 6000×4000 image has 3:2 aspect ratios.</p>
<p>Always remember this small but crucial point. The aspect ratio refers to the image or video you captured or recorded and the display (or screen) in which your video or image would be displayed.</p>
<h3 id="Why-is-the-aspect-ratio-important-1"><a href="#Why-is-the-aspect-ratio-important-1" class="headerlink" title="Why is the aspect ratio important?"></a>Why is the aspect ratio important?</h3><p>In the age of web content, asking why aspect ratio is important? Some may consider it naïve. Images need to be uploaded at different aspect ratios for different uses (desktop vs. mobile or blog vs. social media). Incorrect aspect ratio affects your final image and end-user experience.</p>
<p>Choice of the wrong aspect ratio can eliminate the potential for editing (cropping and resizing). In addition, using the correct aspect ratios saves you from facing the trouble of distortion or clipping.</p>

                ></p>
<p>If you have seen a square-shaped image, it had probably a 1:1 aspect ratio. It simply means both sides (width and height of the image) are equal. It was initially the aspect ratio of square television sets. However, this is commonly used for print photos, mobile screens, and social platforms.</p>
<p>● 3:2 Ratio</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>Initially used for classic 35 mm film and still photography, aspect ratio 3:5 is still used on some laptops, tablets, and handheld game consoles. The famous example of this aspect ratio Images framed at 1080×720 pixels or 6″x4″.</p>
<p>● 5:4 Ratio</p>

                ></p>
<p>It was commonly used for photography and art prints. For Images having dimensions, 8″x10″ and 16x20 have the 5:4 aspect ratios.</p>

<p>Like the image aspect ratios, video aspect ratios would also profoundly affect its composition and thus how your directed viewers perceive it. Some common mobile vertical video size or video aspect ratios are given below.</p>
<p>● 16:9 Ratio</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>If you have seen presentation slides, computer monitors, or widescreee seen this slimmer and more elongated rectangular-shaped 16:9 Ratio. This is the standardized widescreen aspect ratio that you see everywhere on the web. In terms of pixel common dimension for 16:9 is 1920×1080 pixels and 1280×720 pixels.</p>
<p>● 9:16 Ratio (Vertical)</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>When smartphones started coming with video capabilities, this Ratio became popular. Likewise, today this Ratio is trendy for social media platforms with video story capabilities.</p>
<p>The Instagram story typically consists of 1080x1920 pixels, which in terms of aspect ratio is 9:16. Most phones, such as iPhone, have a feature that allows you to record footage in both (16:9 as well as 9:16).</p>
<h3 id="Phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-1"><a href="#Phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-1" class="headerlink" title="Phone aspect ratio vertical"></a>Phone aspect ratio vertical</h3><p>Back in the day, taking aspect ratio vertical (portrait mode) footage was considered unprofessional and a sign of an amateur. But the digital revolution has changed that. Now from unforgivable sin, the vewayal mode has practically become a mainstream media sensation. Vertical style has now become the dominant format.</p>

<p>Phone aspect ratio vertical simply means taller screen than wider. The most common type is 9:16 (1080x1920 pixels), a typical vertical videos aspect ratio. Although this phone aspect ratio vertical comes in a few more shapes and sizes such as 4:5, 2:3.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Tips-to-Create-Phone-Vertical-Videos-1"><a href="#Part-3-Tips-to-Create-Phone-Vertical-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Tips to Create Phone Vertical Videos"></a>Part 3 Tips to Create Phone Vertical Videos</h2><p>Creating vertical videos is crucial for getting engagements and growing your brand. It is easy with a phone because most smartphones, by default, record in 9:16, which is the standard vertical aspect ratio. But with a camera, you have to manually edit to the correct aspect ratio before you shoot it.</p>
<p>You can also shoot horizontally and then change it to vertical, but it needs professional videographer expertise.</p>
<p>Who wants to rotate their phones watching videos? Well, as far as the trend, Let us see some tiny but handy tips for creating vertical phone videos.</p>
<h3 id="1-Choose-the-correct-aspect-ratio-1"><a href="#1-Choose-the-correct-aspect-ratio-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Choose the correct aspect ratio"></a>1. Choose the correct aspect ratio</h3><p>Video taller than the 1:1 aspect ratio is commonly considered Vertical video. Types of these vertical aspects ratio include 4:5 (social), 2:3 and 9:16. They are all taller than they are wide, thus vertical.</p>
<p>Choosing the correct aspect ratio for your vertical video, always think about why and where you intend to use the video. The second important thing you should consider is your plans for editing that video.</p>
<p>Cropping horizontal can be irritating and sometimes disappointing at the same time. Producing a 9:16 vertical frame at HD resolution from a horizontal HD frame may result in very pixelated and low-quality footage.</p>
<p>If, for some reason, you still want first to shoot it horizontal and then change it back to mobile vertical video size. You may need to shoot in 4K horizontally to get extra pixels to work with. It can later be cropped in the sides to 9:16 (Vertical phone aspect ratio). Plus, you won’t need to scale it anymore.</p>
<h3 id="2-Direct-your-viewer’s-eyes-1"><a href="#2-Direct-your-viewer’s-eyes-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Direct your viewer’s eyes"></a>2. Direct your viewer’s eyes</h3><p>For hooking social media viewers, you need to put your most interesting visual upfront. These include GIFs, colourful stop-motion or looping animation. Always try to match your first couple of shots with your overall brand personality.</p>
<p>3. Screen splitting into two or more</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-11.png"
                      alt="screen splitting"
                ></p>
<p>A tall vertical screen can be styled with multiple horizontal clips on top of each other. These clips must relate to your relevant content and overall look. Natural lines or patterns can help display them in the most creative ways.</p>
<h3 id="4-Be-close-to-your-subject-1"><a href="#4-Be-close-to-your-subject-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Be close to your subject"></a>4. Be close to your subject</h3><p>For producing an intimate experience with the vertical frame, you should get closer to the subject. Most of the action will be positioned to the centre as your viewers scroll. Do not let cut off or cover up your main subject by any text and make sure you leave enough room for text, emojis and stickers.</p>
<h3 id="5-Filling-the-vertical-space-1"><a href="#5-Filling-the-vertical-space-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Filling the vertical space"></a>5. Filling the vertical space</h3><p>First, make sure that your subject is vertical-friendly. Then get closer and fill the space within the vertical frame. The vertical frame can be filled through the following:</p>
<p>● Up-close shot (if the subject is personal).</p>
<p>● Raising the camera high and tilting it down (to film things like a long, empty road).</p>
<p>● Bird’s-eye view from above.</p>
<h3 id="5-Rule-of-Third-1"><a href="#5-Rule-of-Third-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Rule of Third"></a>5. Rule of Third</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-10.png"
                      alt="rule of third"
                ></p>
<p>This photography rule says not to place the main subject directly in the center of the frame. Create more dynamic composition by creating imaginary (Horizontal &amp; Vertical) lines that divide your frame into thirds.</p>
<p>You have to place your subject either on the lines or where the lines meet up. And guess what? You don’t need to draw imaginary nowadays. Most cameras and smartphones provide you with this option.</p>
<h3 id="6-Avoid-Shaking-1"><a href="#6-Avoid-Shaking-1" class="headerlink" title="6. Avoid Shaking"></a>6. Avoid Shaking</h3><p>You do not want to distract your viewers with shaky camera moments. Normal pan and 360-degree rotation are acceptable or maybe even essential. But moving side to side too quickly will make it difficult for the camera to process that information. You better use a selfie stick or gimbal.</p>
<p>Now, check out the best vertical video ratios for various social platforms.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Phone-Aspect-Ratio-Vertical-2"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Phone-Aspect-Ratio-Vertical-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical?"></a>Part 1 What is Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical?</h2><p>The vertical phone aspect ratio is the “proportional” relationship between the screen’s width and height. For example, if your image or video has an aspect ratio of 4:5, it simply means the width of the screen (photo or video) is four times the height of the image.</p>
<p>The vertical phone aspect ratio is the “proportional” relationship between the screen’s width and height. For example, if your image or video has an aspect ratio of 4:5, it simply means the width of the screen (photo or video) is four times the height of the image.</p>
<p>Back in the television days, you might have seen certain old pictures with black padding on either side of the screen. It was just that they were shot in different aspect ratios and your television screen had different aspect ratios.</p>
<h3 id="Aspect-Ratio-Vs-Resolution-2"><a href="#Aspect-Ratio-Vs-Resolution-2" class="headerlink" title="Aspect Ratio Vs Resolution"></a>Aspect Ratio Vs Resolution</h3><p>Remember that aspect ratio does not refer to the physical size of an image or its dimensions in pixels (resolution). So aspect ratio 3:1 does not refer to the actual width and height of the image or video; it just describes their relationship.</p>
<p>You are wrong if you think aspect ratio is just another fancy name for resolution. Think again. Check out how it is calculated.</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>| |  Aspect Ratio | Resolution                                                     |                                                                                    |<br>| ————— | ————————————————————– | ———————————————————————————- |<br>| Definition      | The Ratio of the width of an image to the height of the image. | Total number of pixels displayed on your screen (computer, cell phone, television) |<br>| Commonly Used   | ● 1:1 ● 3:1 ● 3:2 ● 4:3 ● 5:4 ● 9:1 ● 16:9                     | ● 640x480 ● 800x600 ● 1024x768                                                     |</p>
<h3 id="Aspect-Ratio-Calculator-2"><a href="#Aspect-Ratio-Calculator-2" class="headerlink" title="Aspect Ratio Calculator"></a>Aspect Ratio Calculator</h3><p>To get the resolution, you need to multiply width times the height. To get aspect ratio, the formula is: Divide the width by the height or simply divide the long side by the short side.</p>
<p>There are multiple online aspect ratio calculators available. Check out the value for both the images and the videos generated through the photo ratio calculator for your ease.</p>

<p>For example, the aspect ratio of 3:1 may be an image of 3m wide and 1m high. At the same time it can be 3 feet wide and 1 foot high. For further simplification, consider dimensions in pixels: a 6000×4000 image has 3:2 aspect ratios.</p>
<p>Always remember this small but crucial point. The aspect ratio refers to the image or video you captured or recorded and the display (or screen) in which your video or image would be displayed.</p>
<h3 id="Why-is-the-aspect-ratio-important-2"><a href="#Why-is-the-aspect-ratio-important-2" class="headerlink" title="Why is the aspect ratio important?"></a>Why is the aspect ratio important?</h3><p>In the age of web content, asking why aspect ratio is important? Some may consider it naïve. Images need to be uploaded at different aspect ratios for different uses (desktop vs. mobile or blog vs. social media). Incorrect aspect ratio affects your final image and end-user experience.</p>
<p>Choice of the wrong aspect ratio can eliminate the potential for editing (cropping and resizing). In addition, using the correct aspect ratios saves you from facing the trouble of distortion or clipping.</p>

                ></p>
<p>If you have seen a square-shaped image, it had probably a 1:1 aspect ratio. It simply means both sides (width and height of the image) are equal. It was initially the aspect ratio of square television sets. However, this is commonly used for print photos, mobile screens, and social platforms.</p>
<p>● 3:2 Ratio</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>Initially used for classic 35 mm film and still photography, aspect ratio 3:5 is still used on some laptops, tablets, and handheld game consoles. The famous example of this aspect ratio Images framed at 1080×720 pixels or 6″x4″.</p>
<p>● 5:4 Ratio</p>

                ></p>
<p>It was commonly used for photography and art prints. For Images having dimensions, 8″x10″ and 16x20 have the 5:4 aspect ratios.</p>

<p>Like the image aspect ratios, video aspect ratios would also profoundly affect its composition and thus how your directed viewers perceive it. Some common mobile vertical video size or video aspect ratios are given below.</p>
<p>● 16:9 Ratio</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>If you have seen presentation slides, computer monitors, or widescreee seen this slimmer and more elongated rectangular-shaped 16:9 Ratio. This is the standardized widescreen aspect ratio that you see everywhere on the web. In terms of pixel common dimension for 16:9 is 1920×1080 pixels and 1280×720 pixels.</p>
<p>● 9:16 Ratio (Vertical)</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>When smartphones started coming with video capabilities, this Ratio became popular. Likewise, today this Ratio is trendy for social media platforms with video story capabilities.</p>
<p>The Instagram story typically consists of 1080x1920 pixels, which in terms of aspect ratio is 9:16. Most phones, such as iPhone, have a feature that allows you to record footage in both (16:9 as well as 9:16).</p>
<h3 id="Phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-2"><a href="#Phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-2" class="headerlink" title="Phone aspect ratio vertical"></a>Phone aspect ratio vertical</h3><p>Back in the day, taking aspect ratio vertical (portrait mode) footage was considered unprofessional and a sign of an amateur. But the digital revolution has changed that. Now from unforgivable sin, the vewayal mode has practically become a mainstream media sensation. Vertical style has now become the dominant format.</p>

<p>Phone aspect ratio vertical simply means taller screen than wider. The most common type is 9:16 (1080x1920 pixels), a typical vertical videos aspect ratio. Although this phone aspect ratio vertical comes in a few more shapes and sizes such as 4:5, 2:3.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Tips-to-Create-Phone-Vertical-Videos-2"><a href="#Part-3-Tips-to-Create-Phone-Vertical-Videos-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Tips to Create Phone Vertical Videos"></a>Part 3 Tips to Create Phone Vertical Videos</h2><p>Creating vertical videos is crucial for getting engagements and growing your brand. It is easy with a phone because most smartphones, by default, record in 9:16, which is the standard vertical aspect ratio. But with a camera, you have to manually edit to the correct aspect ratio before you shoot it.</p>
<p>You can also shoot horizontally and then change it to vertical, but it needs professional videographer expertise.</p>
<p>Who wants to rotate their phones watching videos? Well, as far as the trend, Let us see some tiny but handy tips for creating vertical phone videos.</p>
<h3 id="1-Choose-the-correct-aspect-ratio-2"><a href="#1-Choose-the-correct-aspect-ratio-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Choose the correct aspect ratio"></a>1. Choose the correct aspect ratio</h3><p>Video taller than the 1:1 aspect ratio is commonly considered Vertical video. Types of these vertical aspects ratio include 4:5 (social), 2:3 and 9:16. They are all taller than they are wide, thus vertical.</p>
<p>Choosing the correct aspect ratio for your vertical video, always think about why and where you intend to use the video. The second important thing you should consider is your plans for editing that video.</p>
<p>Cropping horizontal can be irritating and sometimes disappointing at the same time. Producing a 9:16 vertical frame at HD resolution from a horizontal HD frame may result in very pixelated and low-quality footage.</p>
<p>If, for some reason, you still want first to shoot it horizontal and then change it back to mobile vertical video size. You may need to shoot in 4K horizontally to get extra pixels to work with. It can later be cropped in the sides to 9:16 (Vertical phone aspect ratio). Plus, you won’t need to scale it anymore.</p>
<h3 id="2-Direct-your-viewer’s-eyes-2"><a href="#2-Direct-your-viewer’s-eyes-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Direct your viewer’s eyes"></a>2. Direct your viewer’s eyes</h3><p>For hooking social media viewers, you need to put your most interesting visual upfront. These include GIFs, colourful stop-motion or looping animation. Always try to match your first couple of shots with your overall brand personality.</p>
<p>3. Screen splitting into two or more</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-11.png"
                      alt="screen splitting"
                ></p>
<p>A tall vertical screen can be styled with multiple horizontal clips on top of each other. These clips must relate to your relevant content and overall look. Natural lines or patterns can help display them in the most creative ways.</p>
<h3 id="4-Be-close-to-your-subject-2"><a href="#4-Be-close-to-your-subject-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Be close to your subject"></a>4. Be close to your subject</h3><p>For producing an intimate experience with the vertical frame, you should get closer to the subject. Most of the action will be positioned to the centre as your viewers scroll. Do not let cut off or cover up your main subject by any text and make sure you leave enough room for text, emojis and stickers.</p>
<h3 id="5-Filling-the-vertical-space-2"><a href="#5-Filling-the-vertical-space-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Filling the vertical space"></a>5. Filling the vertical space</h3><p>First, make sure that your subject is vertical-friendly. Then get closer and fill the space within the vertical frame. The vertical frame can be filled through the following:</p>
<p>● Up-close shot (if the subject is personal).</p>
<p>● Raising the camera high and tilting it down (to film things like a long, empty road).</p>
<p>● Bird’s-eye view from above.</p>
<h3 id="5-Rule-of-Third-2"><a href="#5-Rule-of-Third-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Rule of Third"></a>5. Rule of Third</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-10.png"
                      alt="rule of third"
                ></p>
<p>This photography rule says not to place the main subject directly in the center of the frame. Create more dynamic composition by creating imaginary (Horizontal &amp; Vertical) lines that divide your frame into thirds.</p>
<p>You have to place your subject either on the lines or where the lines meet up. And guess what? You don’t need to draw imaginary nowadays. Most cameras and smartphones provide you with this option.</p>
<h3 id="6-Avoid-Shaking-2"><a href="#6-Avoid-Shaking-2" class="headerlink" title="6. Avoid Shaking"></a>6. Avoid Shaking</h3><p>You do not want to distract your viewers with shaky camera moments. Normal pan and 360-degree rotation are acceptable or maybe even essential. But moving side to side too quickly will make it difficult for the camera to process that information. You better use a selfie stick or gimbal.</p>
<p>Now, check out the best vertical video ratios for various social platforms.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Phone-Aspect-Ratio-Vertical-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Phone-Aspect-Ratio-Vertical-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical?"></a>Part 1 What is Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical?</h2><p>The vertical phone aspect ratio is the “proportional” relationship between the screen’s width and height. For example, if your image or video has an aspect ratio of 4:5, it simply means the width of the screen (photo or video) is four times the height of the image.</p>
<p>The vertical phone aspect ratio is the “proportional” relationship between the screen’s width and height. For example, if your image or video has an aspect ratio of 4:5, it simply means the width of the screen (photo or video) is four times the height of the image.</p>
<p>Back in the television days, you might have seen certain old pictures with black padding on either side of the screen. It was just that they were shot in different aspect ratios and your television screen had different aspect ratios.</p>
<h3 id="Aspect-Ratio-Vs-Resolution-3"><a href="#Aspect-Ratio-Vs-Resolution-3" class="headerlink" title="Aspect Ratio Vs Resolution"></a>Aspect Ratio Vs Resolution</h3><p>Remember that aspect ratio does not refer to the physical size of an image or its dimensions in pixels (resolution). So aspect ratio 3:1 does not refer to the actual width and height of the image or video; it just describes their relationship.</p>
<p>You are wrong if you think aspect ratio is just another fancy name for resolution. Think again. Check out how it is calculated.</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>| |  Aspect Ratio | Resolution                                                     |                                                                                    |<br>| ————— | ————————————————————– | ———————————————————————————- |<br>| Definition      | The Ratio of the width of an image to the height of the image. | Total number of pixels displayed on your screen (computer, cell phone, television) |<br>| Commonly Used   | ● 1:1 ● 3:1 ● 3:2 ● 4:3 ● 5:4 ● 9:1 ● 16:9                     | ● 640x480 ● 800x600 ● 1024x768                                                     |</p>
<h3 id="Aspect-Ratio-Calculator-3"><a href="#Aspect-Ratio-Calculator-3" class="headerlink" title="Aspect Ratio Calculator"></a>Aspect Ratio Calculator</h3><p>To get the resolution, you need to multiply width times the height. To get aspect ratio, the formula is: Divide the width by the height or simply divide the long side by the short side.</p>
<p>There are multiple online aspect ratio calculators available. Check out the value for both the images and the videos generated through the photo ratio calculator for your ease.</p>

<p>For example, the aspect ratio of 3:1 may be an image of 3m wide and 1m high. At the same time it can be 3 feet wide and 1 foot high. For further simplification, consider dimensions in pixels: a 6000×4000 image has 3:2 aspect ratios.</p>
<p>Always remember this small but crucial point. The aspect ratio refers to the image or video you captured or recorded and the display (or screen) in which your video or image would be displayed.</p>
<h3 id="Why-is-the-aspect-ratio-important-3"><a href="#Why-is-the-aspect-ratio-important-3" class="headerlink" title="Why is the aspect ratio important?"></a>Why is the aspect ratio important?</h3><p>In the age of web content, asking why aspect ratio is important? Some may consider it naïve. Images need to be uploaded at different aspect ratios for different uses (desktop vs. mobile or blog vs. social media). Incorrect aspect ratio affects your final image and end-user experience.</p>
<p>Choice of the wrong aspect ratio can eliminate the potential for editing (cropping and resizing). In addition, using the correct aspect ratios saves you from facing the trouble of distortion or clipping.</p>

                ></p>
<p>If you have seen a square-shaped image, it had probably a 1:1 aspect ratio. It simply means both sides (width and height of the image) are equal. It was initially the aspect ratio of square television sets. However, this is commonly used for print photos, mobile screens, and social platforms.</p>
<p>● 3:2 Ratio</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>Initially used for classic 35 mm film and still photography, aspect ratio 3:5 is still used on some laptops, tablets, and handheld game consoles. The famous example of this aspect ratio Images framed at 1080×720 pixels or 6″x4″.</p>
<p>● 5:4 Ratio</p>

                ></p>
<p>It was commonly used for photography and art prints. For Images having dimensions, 8″x10″ and 16x20 have the 5:4 aspect ratios.</p>

<p>Like the image aspect ratios, video aspect ratios would also profoundly affect its composition and thus how your directed viewers perceive it. Some common mobile vertical video size or video aspect ratios are given below.</p>
<p>● 16:9 Ratio</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>If you have seen presentation slides, computer monitors, or widescreee seen this slimmer and more elongated rectangular-shaped 16:9 Ratio. This is the standardized widescreen aspect ratio that you see everywhere on the web. In terms of pixel common dimension for 16:9 is 1920×1080 pixels and 1280×720 pixels.</p>
<p>● 9:16 Ratio (Vertical)</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>When smartphones started coming with video capabilities, this Ratio became popular. Likewise, today this Ratio is trendy for social media platforms with video story capabilities.</p>
<p>The Instagram story typically consists of 1080x1920 pixels, which in terms of aspect ratio is 9:16. Most phones, such as iPhone, have a feature that allows you to record footage in both (16:9 as well as 9:16).</p>
<h3 id="Phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-3"><a href="#Phone-aspect-ratio-vertical-3" class="headerlink" title="Phone aspect ratio vertical"></a>Phone aspect ratio vertical</h3><p>Back in the day, taking aspect ratio vertical (portrait mode) footage was considered unprofessional and a sign of an amateur. But the digital revolution has changed that. Now from unforgivable sin, the vewayal mode has practically become a mainstream media sensation. Vertical style has now become the dominant format.</p>

<p>Phone aspect ratio vertical simply means taller screen than wider. The most common type is 9:16 (1080x1920 pixels), a typical vertical videos aspect ratio. Although this phone aspect ratio vertical comes in a few more shapes and sizes such as 4:5, 2:3.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Tips-to-Create-Phone-Vertical-Videos-3"><a href="#Part-3-Tips-to-Create-Phone-Vertical-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Tips to Create Phone Vertical Videos"></a>Part 3 Tips to Create Phone Vertical Videos</h2><p>Creating vertical videos is crucial for getting engagements and growing your brand. It is easy with a phone because most smartphones, by default, record in 9:16, which is the standard vertical aspect ratio. But with a camera, you have to manually edit to the correct aspect ratio before you shoot it.</p>
<p>You can also shoot horizontally and then change it to vertical, but it needs professional videographer expertise.</p>
<p>Who wants to rotate their phones watching videos? Well, as far as the trend, Let us see some tiny but handy tips for creating vertical phone videos.</p>
<h3 id="1-Choose-the-correct-aspect-ratio-3"><a href="#1-Choose-the-correct-aspect-ratio-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Choose the correct aspect ratio"></a>1. Choose the correct aspect ratio</h3><p>Video taller than the 1:1 aspect ratio is commonly considered Vertical video. Types of these vertical aspects ratio include 4:5 (social), 2:3 and 9:16. They are all taller than they are wide, thus vertical.</p>
<p>Choosing the correct aspect ratio for your vertical video, always think about why and where you intend to use the video. The second important thing you should consider is your plans for editing that video.</p>
<p>Cropping horizontal can be irritating and sometimes disappointing at the same time. Producing a 9:16 vertical frame at HD resolution from a horizontal HD frame may result in very pixelated and low-quality footage.</p>
<p>If, for some reason, you still want first to shoot it horizontal and then change it back to mobile vertical video size. You may need to shoot in 4K horizontally to get extra pixels to work with. It can later be cropped in the sides to 9:16 (Vertical phone aspect ratio). Plus, you won’t need to scale it anymore.</p>
<h3 id="2-Direct-your-viewer’s-eyes-3"><a href="#2-Direct-your-viewer’s-eyes-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Direct your viewer’s eyes"></a>2. Direct your viewer’s eyes</h3><p>For hooking social media viewers, you need to put your most interesting visual upfront. These include GIFs, colourful stop-motion or looping animation. Always try to match your first couple of shots with your overall brand personality.</p>
<p>3. Screen splitting into two or more</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-11.png"
                      alt="screen splitting"
                ></p>
<p>A tall vertical screen can be styled with multiple horizontal clips on top of each other. These clips must relate to your relevant content and overall look. Natural lines or patterns can help display them in the most creative ways.</p>
<h3 id="4-Be-close-to-your-subject-3"><a href="#4-Be-close-to-your-subject-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Be close to your subject"></a>4. Be close to your subject</h3><p>For producing an intimate experience with the vertical frame, you should get closer to the subject. Most of the action will be positioned to the centre as your viewers scroll. Do not let cut off or cover up your main subject by any text and make sure you leave enough room for text, emojis and stickers.</p>
<h3 id="5-Filling-the-vertical-space-3"><a href="#5-Filling-the-vertical-space-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Filling the vertical space"></a>5. Filling the vertical space</h3><p>First, make sure that your subject is vertical-friendly. Then get closer and fill the space within the vertical frame. The vertical frame can be filled through the following:</p>
<p>● Up-close shot (if the subject is personal).</p>
<p>● Raising the camera high and tilting it down (to film things like a long, empty road).</p>
<p>● Bird’s-eye view from above.</p>
<h3 id="5-Rule-of-Third-3"><a href="#5-Rule-of-Third-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Rule of Third"></a>5. Rule of Third</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-10.png"
                      alt="rule of third"
                ></p>
<p>This photography rule says not to place the main subject directly in the center of the frame. Create more dynamic composition by creating imaginary (Horizontal &amp; Vertical) lines that divide your frame into thirds.</p>
<p>You have to place your subject either on the lines or where the lines meet up. And guess what? You don’t need to draw imaginary nowadays. Most cameras and smartphones provide you with this option.</p>
<h3 id="6-Avoid-Shaking-3"><a href="#6-Avoid-Shaking-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Avoid Shaking"></a>6. Avoid Shaking</h3><p>You do not want to distract your viewers with shaky camera moments. Normal pan and 360-degree rotation are acceptable or maybe even essential. But moving side to side too quickly will make it difficult for the camera to process that information. You better use a selfie stick or gimbal.</p>
<p>Now, check out the best vertical video ratios for various social platforms.</p>
