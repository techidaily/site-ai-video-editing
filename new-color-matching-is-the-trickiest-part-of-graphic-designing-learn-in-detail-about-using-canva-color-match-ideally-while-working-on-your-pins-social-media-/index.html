<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-the-Canva-Color-Picker"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-the-Canva-Color-Picker" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is the Canva Color Picker?"></a>Part 1 What is the Canva Color Picker?</h2><p>Canva is one of the simplest and easiest ways of creating great and eye-catchy graphic designs. Color combinations help us to make these designs more attractive. But earlier, there were some limitations in Canva regarding the color picker tool; designers had to use browser extensions like ColorZilla to match the color combinations perfectly. They faced many problems while selecting the perfect color of their choice while designing their pins, social media content, logos, online invitations, etc. They had to find the perfect color code of their choice from an external source and paste it into the Canva, which was simply very time-consuming.</p>
<p>The most-awaited color picker tool was introduced in Canva at the end of November 202This new design tool makes the design very convenient while using Canva for graphic designing. With this tool, you don’t need to spend hours searching for the right color that matches the background. Color picker helps you to find a perfect color match according to the image, logo, or anything else uploaded on Canva.</p>

<p>But before using this new <strong>color match tool</strong>, you must ensure that:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You are using the updated version of the Canva desktop app.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You have the latest version of the browsers like Chrome, Mozilla, Internet Explorer, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Import Video in Filmora</p>
<p>To get started, launch Filmora on your device, select “New Project,” and choose the “Click here to import media” option. To proceed, add the video you want to apply motion tracking. Once the video is visible in the “Import Media” section, drag it to “Timeline.”</p>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Add Motion Tracking in the Video</p>

Adobe After Effects is a video editing platform that can help you perform <strong>video motion tracking</strong>. If you are a user of this tool, you can learn the steps to <strong>motion track</strong> your video below:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open Adobe After Effects on your computer and import your video files to the timeline of the platform. Add the object you wish to motion track on Adobe After Effects.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="import media to after effects"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Lead to the “Layer” tab from the top and select the “New” option from the drop-down menu. Continue to select “Null Object” to add a layer to the timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt=" create a null object layer"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select the video clip and continue to the “Animation” tab from the top. Select “Track Motion” from the drop-down menu that appears. This will generate a box for selecting the object for motion tracking. You can extend the box and drag it anywhere in the video clip. To check the motion tracking object, click the “Analyze Forward” button on the bottom-right corner of the screen.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Create a GIF or download one that meets your taste from different websites. Currently, we have many sites offering free GIFs; hence you don’t have to worry about copyright issues. Some top websites to consider are Giphy, Gifer, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Look for a site that can translate a GIF document to the APNG file. Don’t worry about this step since you can always google the top options. We currently have the ezgif site but technology changes every day; hence you can expect rising websites.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> A gif with nitro is neater, but a GIF without nitro works better than having an image.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Even without discord Nitro, you still have access to the <strong>cool animated discord profile pics if you have a discord server.</strong> Suppose you have an <strong>animated discord profile</strong>, and then we can only see one frame without discord nitro.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-make-Discord-PFP-a-GIF-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-make-Discord-PFP-a-GIF-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How to make Discord PFP a GIF?"></a>Part 3 <strong>How to make Discord PFP a GIF?</strong></h2><p>From the beginning of this piece until now, all we have discussed is getting or making a GIF. However, we will define the simplest way to make your profile pic a GIF in Discord in this case. Ensure that you read through this section.</p>
<p>Generally, discord nitro users are more privileged compared to normal discord users. Of course, the Nitro subscribers pay a fee to access these privileges. There are two options:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Making your profile picture a GIF</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Utilizing the Tenor GIFs</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Uploading them from your files</p>

                      alt="How to log into your account"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Visit the user settings gear icon and go to edit profile to access your account details.</p>
<p>Step 3: Click on your current profile or click on the Change Avatar option</p>
<p>Step 5: Use the available GIF search engine or upload files from your device. It depends on whether you are a Nitro subscriber or a normal user. Select your GIF and go to the Apply option to save the file</p>
<p>Step 6: Move to the escape button to exit the settings, and you realize that your PFP is officially a GIF.</p>

Otherwise, you need to look for GIFs from different websites and upload them.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The maximum resolution of a GIF is 128 by 128 pixels hence you need to be careful.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The GIF file size for discord is at most 8MBs.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can create a GIF instead of uploading it from free websites.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Put-a-GIF-in-Discord-profile-Picture-3"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Put-a-GIF-in-Discord-profile-Picture-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 How to Put a GIF in Discord profile Picture?"></a>Part 4 <strong>How to Put a GIF in Discord profile Picture?</strong></h2><p>Discord is quite a popular platform with millions of users worldwide. Thanks to the user-friendly interface it includes, this number is enormous, especially when you wish to edit your profile picture. In our case, we explain facts about having a GIF as a PFP in discord.</p>
<p>Like most social media platforms, this process is relatively easy. It only requires you to be a discord user, and it is better if you are a nitro subscriber. Why? Because the latter have the discord GIF options easing the process. Note that you can still add a GIF even without nitro.</p>
<p>The first point is to log into your account, go to setting and click on the edit your profile option. Upon clicking on the available PFP, you will automatically access a file dialogue that prompts you to include your GIF. Later save these changes and get <strong>a GIF profile in discord.</strong></p>
<p>GIFs are like looping or repetitive short videos; hence they need editing. Fortunately, we have the <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> editor, which includes multiple features which assist in editing your work.
