Anyone can do it, but before you get started, we will share some do’s and don’ts to help you get the best results.</p>
<p>In fact, there are many ways to set up a green screen, but the most cost-efficient way is with a green screen fabric. If you are using a green fabric as a DIY green screen, make sure you steam or iron it out, whether taping it to a wall or hanging it off the rack. Keep in mind the green screen should not leave any wrinkles.</p>
<p>It is because wrinkles will make lighting the green screen a nightmare, and uneven lighting will leave you with shadows and disappointing results. It would help if you also pulled the green screen tight to get a seamless background. The better you do with the setup, the easier it will be the key it out later</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Lighting-a-Green-Screen"><a href="#Part-3-Lighting-a-Green-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Lighting a Green Screen"></a>Part 3: Lighting a Green Screen</h2><p>It doesn’t matter how nice your green screen is. You won’t get good results if you don’t light it properly. When you light a green screen, be aware of these things.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure there are at least six feet of space between you and your green screen; therefore, you’re not casting a shadow that cannot be keyed out later.</li>
<li>Remember, any shadow on the green screen is bad. The lighting on the screen should be flat, even, and one-dimensional meaning. Please don’t place the screen leaning at an angle since they’ll make it harder to light evenly.</li>
<li>Do light yourself and your background separately. It will ensure your subject wouldn’t bleed into the green, which will create a halo around them.</li>
<li>After you key out the green screen and lighting, your subjects should emulate the lighting from your final footage. For example, if you know sunlight is coming from the left light, your subject is from the left direction as well.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Part-4-Keying-out-your-green-screen"><a href="#Part-4-Keying-out-your-green-screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Keying out your green screen"></a>Part 4. Keying out your green screen</h2><p>Once your footage is good, go into <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and import it into your timeline, then double-click it to find the chroma key menu. However, don’t stop there. Clicking the chroma key button is not enough to guarantee perfectly keyed footage, so play around with the offset tolerance edge thickness and edge feather. Lastly, adjust it to make sure your edit looks as good as possible.</p>

Datamoshing is a similar effect that displays errors and flaws in the video clips to leave an impression on the audience. In most terms, the datamoshing effect shares similarities with the glitch effect.</p>
<p>Henceforth, the write-up shall focus on the introduction of this effect along with its workability. The procedure to create datamosh After Effects would also be covered. So, let us begin!</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-4"><a href="#In-this-article-4" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What is the Datamoshing Effect?</a></p>

The datamoshing effect plays with the video compression to corrupt the pixels of the footage.</p>
<p>In this effect, the pixels glitch and appear to melt, duplicate, and create a projection organically. Also known as databending, it is a complicated technique in which movement of one layer is introduced to another layer of the video clip.</p>
<p>Lossy compression and removed frames help develop a psychedelic result effortlessly. Presently, datamosh After Effects has gained popularity as it helps bring change to the video and engages the audience.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-Does-Datamoshing-Effect-Work"><a href="#Part-2-How-Does-Datamoshing-Effect-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Does Datamoshing Effect Work?"></a>Part 2: How Does Datamoshing Effect Work?</h2><p>The sub-section informs the content creators and creative professionals regarding the workability of the datamoshing effect in video clips. Hence, let us commence this.</p>
<p>Datamoshing eliminates the new picture frame and keeps those frames that control the movement of the pixels. It leads to the picture pixels going into different directions instead of the usual one, thus, creating a glitch effect. These glitch effects are used in unique mediums to create a classy yet ancient vibe.</p>
<p>The datamoshing effect can be noticed between the cuts and motion. It is the process of corrupting the imagery in which the I-frames are replaced and P-frames are applied in the wrong picture. Let us dive right into two types of datamoshing.</p>
<p>The first type of datamoshing is created when the I-frame of the video is removed. In this scenario, the pixels from the previous scene are projected into the next scene smoothly. It gives the impression that the pixels have been tracked into the next shot.</p>
<p>The second kind of datamoshing, known to humankind, is when the d-frame of the video is duplicated. It leads the footage to show images and colors being bloomed together as the pixels are equivalent, coming through the same motion path.</p>

The datamoshing effect plays with the video compression to corrupt the pixels of the footage.</p>
<p>In this effect, the pixels glitch and appear to melt, duplicate, and create a projection organically. Also known as databending, it is a complicated technique in which movement of one layer is introduced to another layer of the video clip.</p>
<p>Lossy compression and removed frames help develop a psychedelic result effortlessly. Presently, datamosh After Effects has gained popularity as it helps bring change to the video and engages the audience.</p>

Hence, let us commence this.</p>
<p>Datamoshing eliminates the new picture frame and keeps those frames that control the movement of the pixels. It leads to the picture pixels going into different directions instead of the usual one, thus, creating a glitch effect. These glitch effects are used in unique mediums to create a classy yet ancient vibe.</p>
<p>The datamoshing effect can be noticed between the cuts and motion. It is the process of corrupting the imagery in which the I-frames are replaced and P-frames are applied in the wrong picture. Let us dive right into two types of datamoshing.</p>
<p>The first type of datamoshing is created when the I-frame of the video is removed. In this scenario, the pixels from the previous scene are projected into the next scene smoothly. It gives the impression that the pixels have been tracked into the next shot.</p>
<p>The second kind of datamoshing, known to humankind, is when the d-frame of the video is duplicated. It leads the footage to show images and colors being bloomed together as the pixels are equivalent, coming through the same motion path.</p>

The datamoshing effect plays with the video compression to corrupt the pixels of the footage.</p>
<p>In this effect, the pixels glitch and appear to melt, duplicate, and create a projection organically. Also known as databending, it is a complicated technique in which movement of one layer is introduced to another layer of the video clip.</p>
<p>Lossy compression and removed frames help develop a psychedelic result effortlessly. Presently, datamosh After Effects has gained popularity as it helps bring change to the video and engages the audience.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-Does-Datamoshing-Effect-Work-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-Does-Datamoshing-Effect-Work-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Does Datamoshing Effect Work?"></a>Part 2: How Does Datamoshing Effect Work?</h2><p>The sub-section informs the content creators and creative professionals regarding the workability of the datamoshing effect in video clips. Hence, let us commence this.</p>
<p>Datamoshing eliminates the new picture frame and keeps those frames that control the movement of the pixels. It leads to the picture pixels going into different directions instead of the usual one, thus, creating a glitch effect. These glitch effects are used in unique mediums to create a classy yet ancient vibe.</p>
<p>The datamoshing effect can be noticed between the cuts and motion. It is the process of corrupting the imagery in which the I-frames are replaced and P-frames are applied in the wrong picture. Let us dive right into two types of datamoshing.</p>
<p>The first type of datamoshing is created when the I-frame of the video is removed. In this scenario, the pixels from the previous scene are projected into the next scene smoothly. It gives the impression that the pixels have been tracked into the next shot.</p>
<p>The second kind of datamoshing, known to humankind, is when the d-frame of the video is duplicated. It leads the footage to show images and colors being bloomed together as the pixels are equivalent, coming through the same motion path.</p>

So, let us begin!</p>
<h3 id="Step-1-Rendering-the-Work-Area-3"><a href="#Step-1-Rendering-the-Work-Area-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Rendering the Work Area"></a>Step 1: Rendering the Work Area</h3><p>Open After Effects and click on the (+) sign to set the in and out points. Click on the “Datamosh” to render the work area. The timeline will showcase the clip. Click on “Remove Frames” from the left panel and add a new mosh marker by pressing the (+) button beside “Remove Frames.”</p>

                      alt="add mosh maker"
                ></p>
<h3 id="Step-2-I-Frame-Removal-3"><a href="#Step-2-I-Frame-Removal-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: I-Frame Removal"></a>Step 2: I-Frame Removal</h3><p>The new remove frame marker will be on the timeline. Drag it to the new scene and then hit “Datamosh.” The I-frame removal effect can be shown on the screen. Again, click on (+) to add a new mosh module. Press “Multiply” and then “Average” from the menus that appear. Hit “Average previous 3” afterward.</p>

                      alt="i-frame removal"
                ></p>
<h3 id="Step-3-Using-the-Hold-Frames-Function-3"><a href="#Step-3-Using-the-Hold-Frames-Function-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Using the Hold Frames Function"></a>Step 3: Using the Hold Frames Function</h3><p>Set the in and out points of this mosh marker and again hit “Datamosh.” The work area will be rendered. Now, open the mosh module and toggle on the “Hold Frames” feature. Also, toggle on the previous render. Press the “Datamosh” again.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-13.jpg"
                      alt="use hold frames function"
                ></p>
<h3 id="Step-4-Injecting-the-Frames-3"><a href="#Step-4-Injecting-the-Frames-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Injecting the Frames"></a>Step 4: Injecting the Frames</h3><p>Toggle the “Inject Frames” on and press use previous render. Hit “Datamosh” afterward. In this way, the clip will hold the frames and inject them into the transition. Enhance the intensity of the moshing algorithm and eliminate “Remove Frames” and “Inject Frames.” Use the previous render and again hit “Datamosh.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-14.jpg"
                      alt="inject frames"
                ></p>
<h3 id="Step-5-Playing-with-the-Acceleration-3"><a href="#Step-5-Playing-with-the-Acceleration-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 5: Playing with the Acceleration"></a>Step 5: Playing with the Acceleration</h3><p>Increase the acceleration and bring the intensity back to what it was. Again, use the previous render and click “Datamosh.” Now, improve the intensity and set the acceleration back to 0. Alter the “Blend” as much you need to mix the original and present motion of the transition. Press the “Datamosh.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/datamoshing-effect-to-footage-15.jpg"
                      alt="play with acceleration"
                ></p>
<h3 id="Step-6-Changing-the-Threshold-3"><a href="#Step-6-Changing-the-Threshold-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 6: Changing the Threshold"></a>Step 6: Changing the Threshold</h3><p>Moving on to the threshold feature, this function is a gatekeeper and decides if a pixel will be moshed. Inverse the intensity of the clip, change the blend to be 0, and set the threshold to be a small integer to find out the impact first. It can be enhanced later on. Uncheck the previous render if you are using the new clip for threshold. Hit “Datamosh” again. Now, export the video, and you are done with the datamoshing.</p>

                     lazyload

                      alt="change threshold"
                ></p>
