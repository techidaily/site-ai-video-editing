<p><strong>Quality</strong>: Another important factor to consider in video editing software is the quality and format of the video. There are many formats and quality of video content, therefore it is important to choose the one which supports your video format.</p>
<p><strong>Resources</strong>: Depending upon the requirements of the editing on your video, you should choose a video editor that should have all the video effects, music tracks, and other resources that you might need to apply to your video. Be careful not to select one with few resources.</p>
<p><strong>Compatability</strong>: The most important point is whether your PC, Mac, or Android platform can run the video editor you have heard the name from your friend. Consult the internet for compatibility of the software by checking its minimum specification requirement on its manual or docs.</p>

Practice before recording: Unless you are a pro, you should practice at least once before the actual recording. This will help you to execute your plan according to your script smoothly when you actually start recording. Besides, you can check if the frame, the camera, the mic, and everything else are working perfectly.</p>
<p>2. Only record the required screen: Screen recorders offer you the option to record the entire screen, any specific application window or any specific tab of your browser. In fact, you can even customize the screen recording area as per your requirements for better focus and better visual experience.</p>
<p>3. Keep it short: It is always necessary to keep the length of the video as short as possible without skipping the relevant points and important explanations. That is where a proper script before recording is crucial so that you can have a plan and execute it properly without stretching your explanation unnecessarily.</p>
<p>4. Speak slowly and clearly: The way you speak in the video can attract as well as repel audiences. If you speak too fast and if you have a weird accent, it is going to repel audiences. That is why it is important for you to speak slowly and clearly so that everyone can understand everything you speak and negate your accent to a greater extent.</p>
<p>5. Use screen drawing tools: If you are recording a video where you need to explain something, it is always better if you use screen drawing tools. In fact, it is important that you choose the screen recorder that offers drawing tools so that the video gets visually pleasing and impactful for audiences to understand effectively.</p>
<p>6. Cut out dead moments: When you are recording screen videos, there are going to be a lot of dead moments and boring pauses. You have to cut out those boring and dead moments while editing so that the video stays interesting and the audiences do not lose concentration. This will also help to tighten the length of the video.</p>
<p>7. End with a summary: Last but most importantly, you should offer a proper conclusion before ending the video. You need to summarize everything you have discussed in the video so that the audience can get a revision of all the important points. Besides, a proper ending rather than an abrupt ending can leave a positive impact regarding your video.</p>

<p>1. Recording options: An ideal screen recorder should have all the different options for recording your screen, webcam, system audio, and external audio from microphone. Besides, it should offer you the option to customize the recording area by selection. You should be able to record full screen, application window, and browser tab accurately.</p>
<p>2. Price: If you are serious about recording your screen video and uploading the recorded video on online platforms, you have to opt for a premium screen recorder. While purchasing a proprietary screen recorder, you need to compare the software price with its peers and ensure that you are getting more features for the price you are paying.</p>
<p>3. Customer support: You need to ensure that the screen recorder you are purchasing, they have a highly responsive customer support. This is a highly neglected factor but users suffer a lot when the customer support team is not responsive. Be sure that you will need to contact the customer support team at some time to learn more about certain features and troubleshoot in emergency situations.</p>
<p>4. Sharing options: When your ultimate goal is to share your recorded video online, you should check for the sharing options available in the screen recorder. There are screen recorders that allow sharing recorded and edited videos on online platforms, cloud storage platforms, and video streaming platforms. It should also offer you options to let you export videos in different file formats.</p>
<p>5. Video editing tools: You have to edit your recorded video to trim out unnecessary parts and add effects and filters to enhance your video content and video quality. Besides, you may need options to add music and voiceover as well as intro and outro. That is why you should opt for a screen recorder where a great video editor is available.</p>
<p>6. Customer Reviews: Last but most importantly, you should check the customer review of the screen recording software. Even when a screen recorder has loads of features, if the customer reviews are not good enough, you should not choose you. Besides, the customer reviews reveal the pros and cons of a screen recorder for your better understanding.</p>

Practice before recording: Unless you are a pro, you should practice at least once before the actual recording. This will help you to execute your plan according to your script smoothly when you actually start recording. Besides, you can check if the frame, the camera, the mic, and everything else are working perfectly.</p>
<p>2. Only record the required screen: Screen recorders offer you the option to record the entire screen, any specific application window or any specific tab of your browser. In fact, you can even customize the screen recording area as per your requirements for better focus and better visual experience.</p>
<p>3. Keep it short: It is always necessary to keep the length of the video as short as possible without skipping the relevant points and important explanations. That is where a proper script before recording is crucial so that you can have a plan and execute it properly without stretching your explanation unnecessarily.</p>
<p>4. Speak slowly and clearly: The way you speak in the video can attract as well as repel audiences. If you speak too fast and if you have a weird accent, it is going to repel audiences. That is why it is important for you to speak slowly and clearly so that everyone can understand everything you speak and negate your accent to a greater extent.</p>
<p>5. Use screen drawing tools: If you are recording a video where you need to explain something, it is always better if you use screen drawing tools. In fact, it is important that you choose the screen recorder that offers drawing tools so that the video gets visually pleasing and impactful for audiences to understand effectively.</p>
<p>6. Cut out dead moments: When you are recording screen videos, there are going to be a lot of dead moments and boring pauses. You have to cut out those boring and dead moments while editing so that the video stays interesting and the audiences do not lose concentration. This will also help to tighten the length of the video.</p>
<p>7. End with a summary: Last but most importantly, you should offer a proper conclusion before ending the video. You need to summarize everything you have discussed in the video so that the audience can get a revision of all the important points. Besides, a proper ending rather than an abrupt ending can leave a positive impact regarding your video.</p>

<p>1. Recording options: An ideal screen recorder should have all the different options for recording your screen, webcam, system audio, and external audio from microphone. Besides, it should offer you the option to customize the recording area by selection. You should be able to record full screen, application window, and browser tab accurately.</p>
<p>2. Price: If you are serious about recording your screen video and uploading the recorded video on online platforms, you have to opt for a premium screen recorder. While purchasing a proprietary screen recorder, you need to compare the software price with its peers and ensure that you are getting more features for the price you are paying.</p>
<p>3. Customer support: You need to ensure that the screen recorder you are purchasing, they have a highly responsive customer support. This is a highly neglected factor but users suffer a lot when the customer support team is not responsive. Be sure that you will need to contact the customer support team at some time to learn more about certain features and troubleshoot in emergency situations.</p>
<p>4. Sharing options: When your ultimate goal is to share your recorded video online, you should check for the sharing options available in the screen recorder. There are screen recorders that allow sharing recorded and edited videos on online platforms, cloud storage platforms, and video streaming platforms. It should also offer you options to let you export videos in different file formats.</p>

Besides, you may need options to add music and voiceover as well as intro and outro. That is why you should opt for a screen recorder where a great video editor is available.</p>
<p>6. Customer Reviews: Last but most importantly, you should check the customer review of the screen recording software. Even when a screen recorder has loads of features, if the customer reviews are not good enough, you should not choose you. Besides, the customer reviews reveal the pros and cons of a screen recorder for your better understanding.</p>
<h2 id="Part-8-Screen-Recording-Tips-and-Tricks-2"><a href="#Part-8-Screen-Recording-Tips-and-Tricks-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 8: Screen Recording Tips and Tricks"></a>Part 8: Screen Recording Tips and Tricks</h2><p>1. Practice before recording: Unless you are a pro, you should practice at least once before the actual recording. This will help you to execute your plan according to your script smoothly when you actually start recording. Besides, you can check if the frame, the camera, the mic, and everything else are working perfectly.</p>
<p>2. Only record the required screen: Screen recorders offer you the option to record the entire screen, any specific application window or any specific tab of your browser. In fact, you can even customize the screen recording area as per your requirements for better focus and better visual experience.</p>
<p>3. Keep it short: It is always necessary to keep the length of the video as short as possible without skipping the relevant points and important explanations. That is where a proper script before recording is crucial so that you can have a plan and execute it properly without stretching your explanation unnecessarily.</p>
<p>4. Speak slowly and clearly: The way you speak in the video can attract as well as repel audiences. If you speak too fast and if you have a weird accent, it is going to repel audiences. That is why it is important for you to speak slowly and clearly so that everyone can understand everything you speak and negate your accent to a greater extent.</p>
<p>5. Use screen drawing tools: If you are recording a video where you need to explain something, it is always better if you use screen drawing tools. In fact, it is important that you choose the screen recorder that offers drawing tools so that the video gets visually pleasing and impactful for audiences to understand effectively.</p>
<p>6. Cut out dead moments: When you are recording screen videos, there are going to be a lot of dead moments and boring pauses. You have to cut out those boring and dead moments while editing so that the video stays interesting and the audiences do not lose concentration. This will also help to tighten the length of the video.</p>
<p>7. End with a summary: Last but most importantly, you should offer a proper conclusion before ending the video. You need to summarize everything you have discussed in the video so that the audience can get a revision of all the important points. Besides, a proper ending rather than an abrupt ending can leave a positive impact regarding your video.</p>

<p>1. Recording options: An ideal screen recorder should have all the different options for recording your screen, webcam, system audio, and external audio from microphone. Besides, it should offer you the option to customize the recording area by selection. You should be able to record full screen, application window, and browser tab accurately.</p>
<p>2. Price: If you are serious about recording your screen video and uploading the recorded video on online platforms, you have to opt for a premium screen recorder.

Practice before recording: Unless you are a pro, you should practice at least once before the actual recording. This will help you to execute your plan according to your script smoothly when you actually start recording. Besides, you can check if the frame, the camera, the mic, and everything else are working perfectly.</p>
<p>2. Only record the required screen: Screen recorders offer you the option to record the entire screen, any specific application window or any specific tab of your browser. In fact, you can even customize the screen recording area as per your requirements for better focus and better visual experience.</p>
<p>3. Keep it short: It is always necessary to keep the length of the video as short as possible without skipping the relevant points and important explanations. That is where a proper script before recording is crucial so that you can have a plan and execute it properly without stretching your explanation unnecessarily.</p>
<p>4. Speak slowly and clearly: The way you speak in the video can attract as well as repel audiences. If you speak too fast and if you have a weird accent, it is going to repel audiences. That is why it is important for you to speak slowly and clearly so that everyone can understand everything you speak and negate your accent to a greater extent.</p>
<p>5. Use screen drawing tools: If you are recording a video where you need to explain something, it is always better if you use screen drawing tools. In fact, it is important that you choose the screen recorder that offers drawing tools so that the video gets visually pleasing and impactful for audiences to understand effectively.</p>
<p>6. Cut out dead moments: When you are recording screen videos, there are going to be a lot of dead moments and boring pauses. You have to cut out those boring and dead moments while editing so that the video stays interesting and the audiences do not lose concentration. This will also help to tighten the length of the video.</p>
<p>7. End with a summary: Last but most importantly, you should offer a proper conclusion before ending the video. You need to summarize everything you have discussed in the video so that the audience can get a revision of all the important points. Besides, a proper ending rather than an abrupt ending can leave a positive impact regarding your video.</p>

While using TikTok, you may find the need to highlight a certain section of the video that you’ve recorded to make it visible to users. It may be something that needs to be shown out of curiosity. To understand <strong>how to zoom in on TikTok after recording,</strong> go through the detailed steps presented as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> You need to start the process of downloading and installing TikTok on your device. Launch it on your phone and proceed by clicking the “+” icon on the bottom of the screen to record or create a new video across TikTok.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Zoom-In-On-TikTok-After-Recording-3"><a href="#Part-1-Zoom-In-On-TikTok-After-Recording-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Zoom In On TikTok After Recording"></a>Part 1: Zoom In On TikTok After Recording</h2><p>The Zoom In feature across any mobile platform has some specific uses and highlights a particular set of characteristics for its users. While using TikTok, you may find the need to highlight a certain section of the video that you’ve recorded to make it visible to users. It may be something that needs to be shown out of curiosity. To understand <strong>how to zoom in on TikTok after recording,</strong> go through the detailed steps presented as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> You need to start the process of downloading and installing TikTok on your device. Launch it on your phone and proceed by clicking the “+” icon on the bottom of the screen to record or create a new video across TikTok.</p>

                      alt="tap on plus icon"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Hold the red button of the recording and effectively create a video of your liking. Leave the button once you are done recording the video. As you’ve recorded the video, click on the “Tick” icon to proceed to the edit page of TikTok.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="record the video"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Find yourselves on the editing page of TikTok with a list of multiple editing options across the screen. Click on the “Effects” button and find the “Zoom” effect across the available list. To find the effect, let the editor cursor of the video reach the point where you want to add the Zoom in effect. Once it reaches the point of the video, hold the “Zoom” effect button for the specific time that you want to add the effect to your video. You can then conclude editing your video on TikTok and proceed to save it.</p>

<li>This puts you in more control of the video rather than improvising the need to zoom in on a video during recording.</li>
<li>Zoom into the specific part or portion of the video that you find necessary for covering the purpose. You cannot perform such actions while recording a video since the recording is quite restricted across a device.</li>
<li>Adding zoom in effect across the video gives it a proper effect that enhances the quality rather than depreciating it.</li>

<li>If you put in a zoom in effect on your video, this cannot be reverted back or zoomed out.</li>
<li>The frame rate of the video is heavily damaged by using such effects across your recorded video. As this is done through the software, there is a guaranteed decrease in the quality output of the video.</li>

This, however, had its disadvantages which have been featured above. As you are aware of these drawbacks, it is necessary for you to go through other options that are proficient and better for users on a similar scale.</p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> has made its name as a video editor in the market.

<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="create a new filmora project"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Upload Video</strong></p>
<p>As a new canvas opens on your front, you need to click on the “Arrow Head” icon under the “Media” tab to import the video file from TikTok that needs to be zoomed in.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="import tiktok video"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Cut Video Part to Slow Zoom</strong></p>
<p>Dissect the specific part of the video that you want to put in the slow zoom feature from Filmora. Take the red indicator across the timeline to the point where you want to start the specific part. Click the split icon on the red line to divide the video. Drag the indicator to the point where you want to end the specific part of the video for the slow zoom feature.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="split the tiktok video"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Set the Speed of the Clip</strong></p>
<p>Select the split part of the video and find the “Speed” icon on the edit menu at the top of the timeline. Select an appropriate speed that you want to work according to. You can find speeds as low as 0.5x in the ‘Slow’ section and speeds as high as 2x in the ‘Fast’ section.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="set your tiktok video speed"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Add Animation Keyframes</strong></p>
<p>To add animation keyframes, right-click on a certain clip of the TikTok video and select the “Add Animation” button from the option of “Animation” in the drop-down menu. Go across the “Customize” section in the “Animation” tab across the menu that opens up and move the indicator where you want to create a keyframe. Click on “Add’ and find a keyframe added to the video. Move the indicator further along the clip to add another animation, as two keyframes create an animation keyframe.</p>

                      alt="add animation keyframe to video"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Scale Clip Edge</strong></p>
<p>Once you are done adjusting your TikTok video, it is time to scale the clip according to your required settings. Double-click on the video to open a new set of settings on your front. Proceed by opening the menu of “Transform” across the menu. Find the “Scale” option in the provided list and adjust the scale settings as required. Once you are done, click on the “Export” button to conclude the process.</p>
