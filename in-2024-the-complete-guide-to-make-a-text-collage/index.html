Considering a few important ones will let you create an impressive collage in no time. Check out some useful tips and tricks to use text within the photo collage.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Identify if you wish to add the text as the focal point or not. If you are using the text as the first striking thing in the collage then ensure that it is eye-catchy and interesting.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Keep a good balance between the text and the images so that it does not look weird.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The color and the font of the text are among the most important factors to be considered. Make sure that both the text color as well as the font match and blend well with the theme and the images in the collage.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Keeping the background of the text simple, less detailed, and also clutter-free is important so that the text content comes out nicely.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Make sure only to add a few words or lines in your collage to make it look sophisticated. It’s majorly a photo collage with a dash of the text so keep it that way only and not vice-versa.</p>

<h2 id="How-to-Create-a-DIY-Green-Screen-Video-Effect"><a href="#How-to-Create-a-DIY-Green-Screen-Video-Effect" class="headerlink" title="How to Create a DIY Green Screen Video Effect?"></a>How to Create a DIY Green Screen Video Effect?</h2><p>No matter how big the budget of a Hollywood movie is, at the end of the day, it has to rely on the humble green screens for special video effects. The stunning studios from where your favorite YouTubers and gamers stream their videos are graphical video effects created through green screens. Even the studios that you see on TV channels are a graphical creation of green screens. You must be wondering how they could achieve such awesome graphics with a simple green screen.</p>
<p>All you need is a good-quality green fabric, a professional video editing software, and a camera. You may not believe it, but that is all you need for creating DIY green screen video effect. You do not have to be a professional video editor to edit the green screen on your videos and add any special video effect. In this article, you will learn how to create your own DIY green backdrop.</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-Green-Screen-Technique"><a href="#What-Is-Green-Screen-Technique" class="headerlink" title="What Is Green Screen Technique?"></a>What Is Green Screen Technique?</h2><p>A green screen is nothing but a green fabric. In a video, a green screen is placed in the background behind the subject. In the editing phase of the video, the green screen is replaced with any background image or video effect that stays intact in the video as long as possible. In short, the green screen technique involves superimposing photos and videos on the green screen in a video.</p>
<p>Starting from the video game industry, movie industry to video streaming and TV channels, the green screen technique is used everywhere. The stunning graphical component of these industries is totally dependent on the green screen technique. In fact, DIY green screen for zoom meetings and video conferencing is widely used. Along with that, YouTubers and Twitch streamers use DIY green screen for streaming live.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, instead of a green screen, you can use any other color of screen. However, green screens are widely used, and it has become a norm. The main point to remember when using a green screen is that nothing else should have green color such as the dresses the subject is wearing. Therefore, in technical terms, the green screen is referred to as Chroma Key, and you will find Chroma Key option instead of green screen in most video editors.</p>
<h2 id="Why-Use-Green-Screen-Technique"><a href="#Why-Use-Green-Screen-Technique" class="headerlink" title="Why Use Green Screen Technique?"></a>Why Use Green Screen Technique?</h2><p>The main reason why the green screen technique is used in movie and video making is that the video editor can replace the entire background at once instead of replacing the background frame by frame. Once you replace a green screen with an image or video effect, it stays the same throughout the video as long as required.</p>
<p>Therefore, the video editor can save a lot of time in editing and the editing stays uniform throughout which gives a realistic effect. If the green screen technique is not used and editing is done frame by frame of a video, there could be a manual error, inconsistent, and graphical glitches.</p>
<p>You can replace green screens with anything you want. It could be a still image of a beautiful studio with 3D effect like you see in case of YouTubers and gamers. It could be a moving, real-life landscape on any place in the world instead of a beautiful background picture. Similarly, it could be replaced by video effects such as explosions, stadiums full of people, battlefields, and likewise. At times, it could be live animations as you see on TV channels.</p>
<h2 id="How-To-Create-DIY-Green-Screen-Stand-Setup-and-Add-Green-Screen-Effect"><a href="#How-To-Create-DIY-Green-Screen-Stand-Setup-and-Add-Green-Screen-Effect" class="headerlink" title="How To Create DIY Green Screen Stand Setup and Add Green Screen Effect?"></a>How To Create DIY Green Screen Stand Setup and Add Green Screen Effect?</h2><p>If you want to have a green screen setup for your video, you need to have the following things ready.</p>
<ul>
<li>A green cloth that is large enough to cover the entire background.</li>
<li>A video editing software to replace green screen in your video with anything.</li>
<li>External light for more video clarity and a good camera with mic.</li>
</ul>
<p>Step 1: Setup DIY Green Backdrop</p>
<p>Your green fabric should be soft and bright. If you are going to be the subject of the video, make sure you are not wearing anything green. Moreover, do not keep any object within the video frame that is green in color. If there are too many green objects, you can use a blue screen.</p>
<p>When it comes to hanging the green cloth in the background, people find it very difficult. If your video frame is going to be a close-up to the subject, you can use a green screen panel to hang green cloth. A green screen panel generally has a collapsible structure for easy storage and transportation.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you need to install hooks in the wall if you are planning to replace the green screen with a studio-like scene so that the entire background of the video frame stays covered with green screen. You should opt for multiple green screens and stitch them together to cover the background completely.</p>
<p>Step 2: Setup Camera and Light</p>
<p>Whether you are shooting with a DSLR camera or smartphone camera or webcam, make sure you are shooting at least HD video quality so that the editing could be great. Lights are important when you are using green screen though they are not a necessity. The video quality and brightness get enhanced with lights. Diffused lights work the best and the background should be well-lit.</p>
<p>Most importantly, you have to place the lights in such a way that your body arms should not be casting any shadow on the green screen. You can either stand very close to the green screen or away from the green screen so that your shadow does not go till the green screen. Instead of starting to shoot the video from the very beginning, you should capture for a few seconds and make sure everything is perfect including the camera angle.</p>
<p>Step 3: Get The Best Video Editor For Green Screen Effect</p>
<p>There are various video editors available, but not all of them are suitable for green screen effect. We recommend Wondershare Filmora as the best video editor to apply green screen effects on your video while editing.

You can either stand very close to the green screen or away from the green screen so that your shadow does not go till the green screen. Instead of starting to shoot the video from the very beginning, you should capture for a few seconds and make sure everything is perfect including the camera angle.</p>
<p>Step 3: Get The Best Video Editor For Green Screen Effect</p>
<p>There are various video editors available, but not all of them are suitable for green screen effect. We recommend Wondershare Filmora as the best video editor to apply green screen effects on your video while editing.

Let’s Get Started</h2><p>Masking is a video effect that allows you to cut out a scene and use the overlay to duplicate, hide, modify, or reveal your video footage. Just think of it as cutting something on your video so you can see what’s in the bottom layer. So, without wasting time, let me show you how to mask a video in <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

<h3 id="Masking-Trick-1"><a href="#Masking-Trick-1" class="headerlink" title="Masking Trick 1:"></a><em>Masking Trick 1:</em></h3><p>First, you need to shoot footage to add the masking effect. To do that, find a doorway with enough space to walk back and forth before setting up a camera with a tripod facing the entrance. Make sure you set the camera at the center height of the door to prevent lens distortion.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="place the camera facing the door"
                ></p>
<p>With the tripod set up, film yourself walking behind the door toward the camera. Get close to the camera, then walk back to the door. Then, cross the doorway slowly before walking out of the frame. Now let’s get editing with Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="walk backwards"
                ></p>
<p>Step 1 Fire up Wondershare Filmora, then import the clip on the video editor. After that, move the clip to the timeline by merely dragging it. Add two clips on the first and second tracks.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="fire up wondershare filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2 Now proceed to hide the first track before adding a freeze frame on the second track. To do that, move the playhead to find the starting scene with the door frame without your subject. Then, right-click the clip and tap <strong>Add Freeze Frame</strong>. After that, extend the freeze frame area and cut out the rest of the clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="proceed to hide the first track"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3 Next, click the <strong>Effect</strong> button and find the <strong>Image Mask</strong> effect in the <strong>Utility</strong> folder. Now drag the effect to the top layer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="click the effect button"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4 Double-click the clip to open the video editing options, then choose a rectangle image mast under <strong>Video Effects</strong>. Ensure the mask is inverted by clicking the <strong>Invert Mask</strong> checkbox. Now adjust the mast to match the door frame before clicking <strong>Ok</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="double-click the clip"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5 Up to this point, unhide the first track, then find the scene where the subject appears on the door frame. On the first track, cut the clip before the subject appears on the stage before cutting the scene where the subject crosses the door frame for the second time on the second track. Now play the video to view your masking effect.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h3 id="Masking-Trick-2"><a href="#Masking-Trick-2" class="headerlink" title="Masking Trick: 2"></a><em>Masking Trick: 2</em></h3><p>In the second masking effect, we want to create a subject walking in and outside a tree. To do that, find a tree with a clear background, then place your camera to film the center of the tree trunk where the subject will be walking.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="create a subject walking in and outside a tree"
                ></p>
<p>Now film the subject walking from one side of the tree, stop for a second, and then turn back. They should repeat the same action, but this time they’ll walk forward outside the frame after the one-second stop. That’s all!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="film the subject walking from one side of the tree"
                ></p>
<p>Step 1 Import the clip on Filmora, then add the footage on the first and second timelines. After that, hide the first track, then find the scene where the subject walks forward away from the tree in the second track. Cut off the area before that action.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="import the clip on filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2 Next, click <strong>Effects</strong>, choose <strong>Utility</strong>, then drag the <strong>Image Mask</strong> effect on the second video track. Then, double-click the second clip, select <strong>Video Effects</strong>, and choose a rectangular option that masks the right side of the frame.</p>
<p>Now adjust the mask until it covers the entire right side of the tree. After that, unhide the first clip and move the second to match the first clip’s timing. You can also cut out everything outside the scene of the first clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>Step 3 Play the video to see your subject walking in both directions of the tree.</p>

<h3 id="Masking-Trick-3"><a href="#Masking-Trick-3" class="headerlink" title="Masking Trick 3:"></a><em>Masking Trick 3:</em></h3><p>For this masking illusion, we’ll create a video with a subject jumping over a house. So, set up your camera tripod on a low level in front of the building. You can also add a mark on the ground for your subject to know where to jump.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="create a video with a subject jumping over a house"
                ></p>
<p>Now tell your subject to walk to the marker before jumping and walking out of the scene.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="tell your subject to walk to the marker"
                ></p>
<p>Step 1 Import the clip into Filmora and add it to the first and second tracks. Now hide the first track before finding the scene without the subject in the second track and add a freeze frame. After that, extend the freeze frame area and cut out the rest of the clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="import the clip into filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2 Now, it’s time to customize the clip with a mask. To do that, head to the <strong>Utility</strong> folder under <strong>Effects</strong> and choose <strong>Image Mask</strong>. Click the <strong>Invert Mask</strong> box to invert the mask.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>Step 3 Double-click the video track and choose an image mask under <strong>Video Effects</strong>. Note that you may need several combinations of masks to mask out the sky and leave the building. So, play around with different masking shapes until the sky is covered.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 4 After masking, unhide the first track on the timeline before playing the video to find the scene where the subject appears and cut off everything before that scene. Also, find the scene where the subject jumps in the air and cut the clip in the second track. Then, delete everything after that scene.</p>

<h2 id="Conclusion-4"><a href="#Conclusion-4" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>That was easy, right? Playing around with Filmora’s masking tools can create incredible masking illusions like the ones we’ve discussed. And don’t forget this video editor has many more creative possibilities. You should try these masking tricks!</p>

<h3 id="Masking-Trick-1-1"><a href="#Masking-Trick-1-1" class="headerlink" title="Masking Trick 1:"></a><em>Masking Trick 1:</em></h3><p>First, you need to shoot footage to add the masking effect. To do that, find a doorway with enough space to walk back and forth before setting up a camera with a tripod facing the entrance. Make sure you set the camera at the center height of the door to prevent lens distortion.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="place the camera facing the door"
                ></p>
<p>With the tripod set up, film yourself walking behind the door toward the camera. Get close to the camera, then walk back to the door. Then, cross the doorway slowly before walking out of the frame. Now let’s get editing with Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="walk backwards"
                ></p>
<p>Step 1 Fire up Wondershare Filmora, then import the clip on the video editor. After that, move the clip to the timeline by merely dragging it. Add two clips on the first and second tracks.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>Step 2 Now proceed to hide the first track before adding a freeze frame on the second track. To do that, move the playhead to find the starting scene with the door frame without your subject. Then, right-click the clip and tap <strong>Add Freeze Frame</strong>. After that, extend the freeze frame area and cut out the rest of the clip.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>Step 3 Next, click the <strong>Effect</strong> button and find the <strong>Image Mask</strong> effect in the <strong>Utility</strong> folder. Now drag the effect to the top layer.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="click the effect button"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4 Double-click the clip to open the video editing options, then choose a rectangle image mast under <strong>Video Effects</strong>. Ensure the mask is inverted by clicking the <strong>Invert Mask</strong> checkbox. Now adjust the mast to match the door frame before clicking <strong>Ok</strong>.</p>

                      alt="double-click the clip"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5 Up to this point, unhide the first track, then find the scene where the subject appears on the door frame. On the first track, cut the clip before the subject appears on the stage before cutting the scene where the subject crosses the door frame for the second time on the second track. Now play the video to view your masking effect.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<h3 id="Masking-Trick-2-1"><a href="#Masking-Trick-2-1" class="headerlink" title="Masking Trick: 2"></a><em>Masking Trick: 2</em></h3><p>In the second masking effect, we want to create a subject walking in and outside a tree. To do that, find a tree with a clear background, then place your camera to film the center of the tree trunk where the subject will be walking.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="create a subject walking in and outside a tree"
                ></p>
<p>Now film the subject walking from one side of the tree, stop for a second, and then turn back. They should repeat the same action, but this time they’ll walk forward outside the frame after the one-second stop. That’s all!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="film the subject walking from one side of the tree"
                ></p>
<p>Step 1 Import the clip on Filmora, then add the footage on the first and second timelines. After that, hide the first track, then find the scene where the subject walks forward away from the tree in the second track. Cut off the area before that action.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="import the clip on filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2 Next, click <strong>Effects</strong>, choose <strong>Utility</strong>, then drag the <strong>Image Mask</strong> effect on the second video track. Then, double-click the second clip, select <strong>Video Effects</strong>, and choose a rectangular option that masks the right side of the frame.</p>
<p>Now adjust the mask until it covers the entire right side of the tree. After that, unhide the first clip and move the second to match the first clip’s timing. You can also cut out everything outside the scene of the first clip.</p>

<p>Step 5 Up to this point, unhide the first track, then find the scene where the subject appears on the door frame. On the first track, cut the clip before the subject appears on the stage before cutting the scene where the subject crosses the door frame for the second time on the second track. Now play the video to view your masking effect.</p>

<h3 id="Masking-Trick-2-2"><a href="#Masking-Trick-2-2" class="headerlink" title="Masking Trick: 2"></a><em>Masking Trick: 2</em></h3><p>In the second masking effect, we want to create a subject walking in and outside a tree. To do that, find a tree with a clear background, then place your camera to film the center of the tree trunk where the subject will be walking.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="create a subject walking in and outside a tree"
                ></p>
<p>Now film the subject walking from one side of the tree, stop for a second, and then turn back. They should repeat the same action, but this time they’ll walk forward outside the frame after the one-second stop. That’s all!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>Step 1 Import the clip on Filmora, then add the footage on the first and second timelines. After that, hide the first track, then find the scene where the subject walks forward away from the tree in the second track. Cut off the area before that action.</p>

<p>Step 2 Next, click <strong>Effects</strong>, choose <strong>Utility</strong>, then drag the <strong>Image Mask</strong> effect on the second video track. Then, double-click the second clip, select <strong>Video Effects</strong>, and choose a rectangular option that masks the right side of the frame.</p>
<p>Now adjust the mask until it covers the entire right side of the tree. After that, unhide the first clip and move the second to match the first clip’s timing. You can also cut out everything outside the scene of the first clip.</p>

<h3 id="Masking-Trick-3-2"><a href="#Masking-Trick-3-2" class="headerlink" title="Masking Trick 3:"></a><em>Masking Trick 3:</em></h3><p>For this masking illusion, we’ll create a video with a subject jumping over a house. So, set up your camera tripod on a low level in front of the building. You can also add a mark on the ground for your subject to know where to jump.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="create a video with a subject jumping over a house"
                ></p>
<p>Now tell your subject to walk to the marker before jumping and walking out of the scene.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="tell your subject to walk to the marker"
                ></p>
<p>Step 1 Import the clip into Filmora and add it to the first and second tracks. Now hide the first track before finding the scene without the subject in the second track and add a freeze frame. After that, extend the freeze frame area and cut out the rest of the clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>Step 2 Now, it’s time to customize the clip with a mask. To do that, head to the <strong>Utility</strong> folder under <strong>Effects</strong> and choose <strong>Image Mask</strong>. Click the <strong>Invert Mask</strong> box to invert the mask.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 3 Double-click the video track and choose an image mask under <strong>Video Effects</strong>. Note that you may need several combinations of masks to mask out the sky and leave the building. So, play around with different masking shapes until the sky is covered.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 4 After masking, unhide the first track on the timeline before playing the video to find the scene where the subject appears and cut off everything before that scene. Also, find the scene where the subject jumps in the air and cut the clip in the second track. Then, delete everything after that scene.</p>

<h3 id="Masking-Trick-1-3"><a href="#Masking-Trick-1-3" class="headerlink" title="Masking Trick 1:"></a><em>Masking Trick 1:</em></h3><p>First, you need to shoot footage to add the masking effect. To do that, find a doorway with enough space to walk back and forth before setting up a camera with a tripod facing the entrance. Make sure you set the camera at the center height of the door to prevent lens distortion.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="place the camera facing the door"
                ></p>
<p>With the tripod set up, film yourself walking behind the door toward the camera. Get close to the camera, then walk back to the door. Then, cross the doorway slowly before walking out of the frame. Now let’s get editing with Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="walk backwards"
                ></p>
<p>Step 1 Fire up Wondershare Filmora, then import the clip on the video editor. After that, move the clip to the timeline by merely dragging it. Add two clips on the first and second tracks.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>Step 2 Now proceed to hide the first track before adding a freeze frame on the second track. To do that, move the playhead to find the starting scene with the door frame without your subject. Then, right-click the clip and tap <strong>Add Freeze Frame</strong>. After that, extend the freeze frame area and cut out the rest of the clip.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 4 Double-click the clip to open the video editing options, then choose a rectangle image mast under <strong>Video Effects</strong>. Ensure the mask is inverted by clicking the <strong>Invert Mask</strong> checkbox. Now adjust the mast to match the door frame before clicking <strong>Ok</strong>.</p>

<p>Step 5 Up to this point, unhide the first track, then find the scene where the subject appears on the door frame. On the first track, cut the clip before the subject appears on the stage before cutting the scene where the subject crosses the door frame for the second time on the second track. Now play the video to view your masking effect.</p>
