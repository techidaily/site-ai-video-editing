This Article Will Show You How to Do that Easily</h2><p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a powerful tool and with the know-how can make your art be more than just a still image. Whether it is for a music video or a portfolio showreel, there are better ways than just inserting an image and letting it fade to the next still image. We can make use of effects and transitions to put our art to better use.</p>
<p>In this guide I’m going to show a couple of ways to enhance your images within <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for your videos.</p>
<h2 id="Transitions"><a href="#Transitions" class="headerlink" title="Transitions"></a>Transitions</h2><p>By inserting a transition to your image, you can add some diversity to how the viewer first see’s your image, You may want to emphasis a certain element of your art and therefore would select a transition that zooms in on that element before zooming out to the whole image or maybe you have a painting of a cyberpunk angel and wish to have the image enter in a grid formation. The point is that by experimenting with transitions and trying to select the best ones based on the element in your work you will achieve a better first impression. This is true for all aspects of video creation.</p>
<p>Having multiple transitions can create a unique look for your videos with minimal understanding of how to create a transition but there needs to be an understanding of how the layers work in <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> being that a layer on top is in front of the one below, remember this when you start to add transitions as sometime you may need to duplicate your art as to keep it in the shot.</p>

<p>As you can see here, I have duplicated my image onto separate channels as to always keep the image in the scene.</p>

                      alt="duplicated image onto separate channels"
                ></p>
<p>In the image above you can see how I used multiple transitions, I did this as my image is off center and I wanted to emphasize that, I picked transitions that had clear symmetry and lines so that the viewer had a reference point of where center was without me having to place that in my art. This is a very useful way of adding information to your art without telling the viewer directly. As for the color theory, I went with oranges and yellows predominantly here as they are neighboring colors on the color wheel and we know they work well together with my main color of yellow. As for the composition I have tried to keep all the eye-catching points along the top third of the image as to create a piece more pleasing to the eye even with all this information going on.</p>
<h2 id="Effects"><a href="#Effects" class="headerlink" title="Effects"></a>Effects</h2><p>The inclusion of effect onto your art should not be discouraged depending on what the art is used for, in my example i created this as though it was album art and the musician wanted to upload a simple music video using that art, on its own it is static and can loose engagement but by applying relevant effects you can capture the viewer’s eye and make the listening experience more enjoyable. Effects can also be stacked to create unique assets for your art and help tell a story, if your art includes fire why not add a fire effect breaking the stillness of the image or maybe your art has motion, you could include a motion effect to your still image and give the viewer more information.</p>
<p>Even when using effects you can use fundamentals such as color theory or composition to better enhance your imagery.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>In this image you can see I have added an audio visualizer effect as well as a spectral light effect. I did this to reinforce the face of my image having a strong light source, it creates dynamic movement and the audio visualizer was added due to the nature of the video being music oriented but I felt this could have been done better. The composition of the audio visualizer was front and center and seemed boring and uninteresting. This is where the research into art fundamentals comes into play as remembering the rule of thirds and how all the main features of the image are in the top horizontal third, we can make use of the vertical thirds to gain a better composition and hopefully create more engagement.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>As you can see, we have duplicated the audio visualizer and made better use of the thirds nor having opposing placement within the scene, the same information is being given by the effect but we have managed to use the space more effectively and created a visually pleasing aesthetic to our video. Trick like this can make your still image feel more animated and have more purpose within the video itself.</p>
<h2 id="Adding-Titles-and-Text"><a href="#Adding-Titles-and-Text" class="headerlink" title="Adding Titles and Text"></a>Adding Titles and Text</h2><p>Adding text is another way of adding information to your art. It’s said an image can speak a thousand words but sometimes you need words to talk for an image. When words are needed for your video, there should be some thought into how them words are presented as just selecting any text and inserting that to your video may look jarring to the viewer and result in a loss of interest towards your videos. Selecting the right transition for your text or the color or even the font can have different results and can help with affordance depending on what you’re looking to portray.</p>

                ></p>
<p>In my example I wanted to say thank you and felt sharp edges would seem formal and because of the main image it would be too similar so I went with a font that was more rounded. When inserting text onto a scene such as this one you are given a lot of information for your selections, we already have color in there to help us choose our font and background color, I went with yellow and pink due to the fact it was already in the scene and I didn’t want to take the attention away from the focus. The way the text transitions onto the screen secures just enough attention to itself that the viewer knows it’s there and can read it if they wish to. If I wanted to gain full attention i would have picked a transition that overlaps the key element and picked complementary colors on the opposite sides of the color wheel guaranteeing the viewer’s eyes would notice and engage with the motion.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>By incorporating all the art fundamentals and skills we have learned we can use the tools provided by <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> more effectively and create dynamic and engaging videos that are aesthetically pleasing for our audience. Upon learning the many different types and styles of transitions, effects, and titles we can enhance our artwork for use within our video.

However, the real essence lies in taking a practical experience of working with the program to comprehensively understand the slideshow design process in detail.</p>
<p>Adhering to the aforesaid concern, let us try hands at having an in depth understanding of different aspects of working on a slideshow presentation within the program interface through the following stepwise tutorial guide:</p>
<p><strong>User’s Guide to Work With the Icecream Slideshow Maker Program</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Download and Install Icecream Slideshow Creator</strong></p>
<p>To begin with, visit the official website of the program to download the same in your Windows device. Once the download is successful, you will need to save and run the program’s installation files sin your system. Having done that, you will be directed to the software’s ‘Installation Wizard’ to initiate a quick an easy installation process.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Icecream Slideshow Maker"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Import Media Files</strong></p>
<p>Post a successful installation, proceed to launch the program and wait for the latter’s welcome screen to appear. In the launch screen, navigate to and tap any one of the ‘Add Photo’ or ‘Add Folder’ buttons at the top left corner to import either a single media file, or an entire media folder to the program’s editing workspace.</p>
<p>Instead of using the ‘Add Folder’ option at the top left, you can also select multiple files by pressing and holding the ‘Ctrl’ key son your system’s keyboard and import them to the editor timeline, all at once. You can alternatively, click on the ‘Add Files to Start Your Photostory’ tab in the center of the software’s welcome screen to import the required media files.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/How-to-make-a-slideshow-with-icecream-slideshow-maker-2.JPG"
                      alt="Icecream Slideshow Maker- Media Selection Interface"
                ></p>
<p>Clicking on any of the aforesaid buttons or tabs will direct you to a ‘File Explorer’ window, where you can make the desired media selections. Your choices are however; filtered according to their respective file formats and only those in line with the formats supported by the Icecream Slideshow creator program are imported to the timeline.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Configure the Presentation Settings</strong></p>
<p>As soon as you finish the media import process, the editing workspace bifurcates to present the ‘Queue’ window at the left and ‘Preview and Settings’ window at the right side of the screen. This is the space where you can proceed to configure your presentation settings.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>File Sorting</strong></p>
<p>To sort the arrangement of a media file, navigate to the ‘File Queue Panel’ at the left and click on the desired file, while using the ‘Arrow Keys’ at the right to change the latter’s position in the queue, or choose to delete it from the queue by tapping the ‘Recycle Bin’ icon beside the file.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Duration and Transition Adjustments</strong></p>
<p>Proceeding further, you can try hands at customizing the duration and transition effects for each of the added media files within the queue. All you need to do is, navigate to and click on the respective tabs within the window. Hit the ‘Time’ button to adjust the screen time of the slides or click on the ‘Transitions’ tab to include suitable animation effects between successive slides for a smooth presentation flow.</p>
<p>You can even stick with a random transition effect to add to the slides, or choose to add no transition effect at all. The inbuilt slideshow player the right side of the editor workspace automatically plays the preview of the applied transition effects. The ‘Transition’ and ‘Time’ settings are the sole customizations that you can apply individually to the slides, the rest of the effects being universally applicable to all the presentation slides together.</p>
<p>If you are interested to apply a particular transition and play duration to all the slides, navigate to and click within the gray bar at the bottom of the file queue to apply the same transition and time characteristics to all the slides of the presentation. You can even opt to delete all the added media files at the same time by tapping the ‘Clear List’ button.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Media Resolution</strong></p>
<p>Working with the Icecream slideshow creator program, you are allowed to adjust the output resolution of your slideshow in the preview window at the right side of the editor timeline. The resolution range lies between 640 x 480 to 1600 x 1200 pixels. Moving further, you can set common play duration for all the transition effects within different slides of the presentation that you have included within the queue.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Aspect Ratio</strong></p>
<p>You can choose to either keep the actual aspect ratio of the media files or customize the same to fit into the screen size. To go with the former choice, click within the ‘Scale to Fit’ checkbox. In case you wish to stick to the latter option, click inside the ‘Original Ratio’ checkbox. To learn more about working with any of the aforesaid settings, navigate to and click on the ‘Question Mark’ icon alongside each setting.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Audio Settings</strong></p>
<p>To add upbeat background music to your presentation, navigate to and tap the ‘Add Audio’ button at the bottom left corner of the ‘Preview’ window. You can choose a desired audio track from your system and use the same as the background sound of the slideshow.</p>
<p>You are additionally, permitted to configure the added music track in line with your specific preferences using the ‘Fade’ and ‘Offset’ settings at the right side of the selected music file. To play the audio track immediately with a time shift, choose to set a negative offset value. Likewise, enter a positive offset value to start playing the track after the lapse of a specified time period.</p>
