<h2 id="Preparing-the-footage"><a href="#Preparing-the-footage" class="headerlink" title="Preparing the footage"></a>Preparing the footage</h2><p>There are not many restrictions on preparing the footage for this effect. However, depending on the results you’re aiming for, you might need to consider a few things.</p>
<p>First, a wider view and some camera panning, or tilting will deliver a better result as it provides angle variations. This will later enhance the dynamic of the scene, making it feels even more uncanny.</p>
<p>Then, while you’re at it, you need to also figure out the purpose of the video itself. If you want to upload it to certain platforms where vertical videos are more popular, you will want to work on that as well. When you’re shooting your footage, make sure that you’re taking it at the correct angle that would fit the ratio you’re aiming for.</p>
<p>Last but not least, consider the length of the footage. If you’re planning to make a bumper video, you might want a quick yet comprehensive shot of the objects you want to highlight. You can always trim and adjust the timing later, but it is better to also plan it early.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> Compiling 3 short stories into a single movie, this one is an experiment of brilliance in the anime world</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> The directors aim to tell the stories in an animated poetic style that suits the theme of the plot.</p>
<p>Introduced to the anime cinema in 1987, Neo-Tokyo was initially addressed as Manie Manie: Labyrinth Tales. The movie is a split-up craft of the biggest names in the anime world and features shots directed by Yoshiaki Kawajiri, Katsuhiro Otomo and Rintaro.

<p>As of ‘The Running Man’ directed by Yoshiaki Kawajiri, the latter is an ugly science fiction noir short that draws its inspiration from Blade Runner.

This legendary sports star of a dangerous running tournament was then reported to have imbibed fatal psionic tendencies.</p>
<p>Reserving the best for the last, here enters ‘Construction Cancellation Order’, the last short directed by Katsuhiro Omoto. The story progresses with the journey of Tsutomu Sugioka, who is sent to a fictitious and remote area in Aloana Republic, a city in South America by his seniors. His job is to shut down Facility 444, a remote construction project of his Japanese company.</p>
<p>Put collectively, Neo-Tokyo is a masterpiece of technical excellence that showcases the bright future of amine movies, provided that they are crafted by the most unique film creators of the anime world.</p>
<p><strong>Hot Comments</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The movie is a fantastic and cohesive alignment of 3 non-connected stories in one frame to represent an integration that is nothing short of magic</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The movie is a gorgeous play of twisted blocks and designs that conveniently takes the shape of a really great anthology flick</p>
