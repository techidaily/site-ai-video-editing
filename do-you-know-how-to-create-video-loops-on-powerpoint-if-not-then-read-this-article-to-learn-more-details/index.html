<h2 id="Best-Tips-for-Better-Event-Videography"><a href="#Best-Tips-for-Better-Event-Videography" class="headerlink" title="Best Tips for Better Event Videography"></a>Best Tips for Better Event Videography</h2><p>There is no doubt that if you have an upcoming corporate event, you will want to record it using professional</p>
<p>corporate event video production. This is something that can’t be stressed enough. Providing video footage of events is an excellent method to raise people’s awareness of your brand, as well as interest in and enthusiasm for the work that your firm does.</p>
<p>Let’s start!</p>

                ></p>
<h2 id="1-A-quality-corporate-event-video-represents-your-business"><a href="#1-A-quality-corporate-event-video-represents-your-business" class="headerlink" title="1. A quality corporate event video represents your business"></a>1. A quality corporate event video represents your business</h2><p>People who are watching your corporate event video aren’t just learning about who your company is and what your company does. They’re also learning about your commitment to quality. If your event video looks like it was shot off the cuff by an employee on someone’s phone, people may assume you take that kind of approach to your business and service to your customers.</p>
<p>You don’t, but it’s an easy assumption to make. A professionally shot, high-quality video signals to viewers that your company appreciates quality and seeks it out in everything they do. It also shows your attention to detail and what they can expect when they choose your business to handle their own occasions or services.</p>
<h2 id="2-A-professional-videographer-is-capable-of-editing"><a href="#2-A-professional-videographer-is-capable-of-editing" class="headerlink" title="2. A professional videographer is capable of editing"></a>2. A professional videographer is capable of editing</h2><p>Videoing your corporate event is about more than just filming, it’s knowing how to cut the event together, how to mix the shots and the sound, and add music and any subtle effects or graphics that will make the video really shine. There is a lot that goes into post-production that an amateur simply cannot replicate.</p>
<p>Editing your video without the benefit of a dedicated studio with years of experience just won’t have the same</p>
<p>effect when it comes to amplifying the energy and mission of your event. It also will not show the level of detail that your video could contain if a professional corporate event video production company did it.</p>
<h2 id="3-A-professional-video-is-completed-on-schedule"><a href="#3-A-professional-video-is-completed-on-schedule" class="headerlink" title="3. A professional video is completed on schedule"></a>3. A professional video is completed on schedule</h2><p>It can take longer than you anticipate if you opt to handle your corporate or conference videos yourself or</p>
<p>delegate the task to one of your workers. Without a lot of post-production knowledge, it could take a lot of trial and error to put your material together in a way that produces the desired outcome.</p>
<p>If you’re trying to summarize an event and demonstrate to stakeholders or customers how effective it was, you might not have time for that. Even though unforeseen issues might always arise, if you and a competent</p>
<p>videographer agree on a finish date, they will be able to deliver. This is crucial if you want to utilize your video</p>
<p>to promote a recent event or for marketing purposes.</p>
<h2 id="4-A-skilled-videographer-avoids-interference"><a href="#4-A-skilled-videographer-avoids-interference" class="headerlink" title="4. A skilled videographer avoids interference"></a>4. A skilled videographer avoids interference</h2><p>A skilled videographer is trained to film an event without getting in the way, so things can keep going as usual.</p>
<p>If you’re not used to doing professional videography, you might not realize you’re bothering your guests and</p>
<p>messing up the event while you’re trying to film it. This can turn people off and hurt your finished product, as</p>
<p>well as the success of your event. If your occasion is streamed online, you don’t want the videographer to get in the way or become visible in the frame your live show.</p>
<h2 id="5-A-video-that-is-done-well-tells-a-story"><a href="#5-A-video-that-is-done-well-tells-a-story" class="headerlink" title="5. A video that is done well tells a story"></a>5. A video that is done well tells a story</h2><p>Companies with experience creating videos do more than just capture actions digitally, they also find the story</p>
<p>in the event they are recording and use their videography skills to tell that story. This storyline is defined in</p>
<p>what they choose to shoot, when they shoot it and how they edit it all together. It’s that storyline that is going</p>
<p>to capture the attention from the audience and give your video the desired impact.</p>
<p>It’s also going to stir up emotions and passion in your audience, creating momentum in your company and with your customers that will last until your next event. Remember that any video you share with your customers or employees is a video marketing exercise that helps you build brand awareness. Let your corporate event video reflect positively on your business.</p>
<h2 id="6-A-videographer-has-a-shot-list"><a href="#6-A-videographer-has-a-shot-list" class="headerlink" title="6. A videographer has a shot list"></a>6. A videographer has a shot list</h2><p>It is not enough to simply create a list; you must also put it to good use. The idea that you should plan your shot and then execute your plan is a fundamental element of production. Create a strategy and put it into action since your videographer will be knowing his job to adhere to this concept regardless of whether or not they are aware of it.</p>
<p>Also, get things you may or may not need for editing. It is usually excellent practice to use some B roll audio</p>
<p>and video, in addition to establishing shots, no matter what kind of event you are filming, be it a wedding or a business function. If you anticipate that it will be overly crowded during the event, take your creative shoton a pleasant day that occurs before the main event.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>We sincerely hope that some of these pointers will be of assistance to you as you navigate the area of special</p>
<p>events videos. Whether you are able to employ all of them or not will depend on your client, the event, and</p>
<p>your own workflow; nonetheless, the takeaway from this anecdote is that you should be prepared for the</p>
<p>worst-case scenario and find that you are better equipped to offer the best possible results. There won’t be</p>
<p>many situations that you won’t be able to manage with grace and professionally if you have the ability to</p>
<p>remain calm, cool, and professional.</p>

As an Added Bonus, We Have Also Included the Method to Perform the Same Actions in WonderShare Filmora</h2><p>Video Editing is an art form dependent on various elements and factors that are part of your video; this means people, items, or objects in the background can often make or break the viewing experience.</p>
<p>Can you imagine having shot a scene with impeccable attention to detail, but a small uncontrollable action leaves a portion of an unwanted cable or equipment in the frame? Bummer, right? But luckily, due to the power of video editing software, it is not hard to deal with such problems.</p>
<p>A way to work with such clips is to use the crop function while editing, as it can help emphasize or detract attention from a particular part of any video project.</p>
<p><strong>Author’s Note:</strong> While filming, try to capture footage in the highest resolution allowed by the available camera hardware; this will give you more room to play with while using the crop function.</p>
<p>To preface, CyberLink PowerDirector is a free video editing tool capable of accomplishing this and providing a professional touch to your video projects. And like other competing software, the program not only allows you to crop into clips but also uses keyframes to modify aspects like panning and zoom. So to help you perform this action, in this article, we list the steps you will need for cropping into video clips with PowerDirector. As an added bonus, we have also included the method to perform the same actions in WonderShare Filmora.</p>
<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> <em>We documented the steps in this guide with PowerDirector 365 and WonderShare Filmora X.</em></p>

<p><em>If you do not already have CyberLink PowerDirector 365, download the software by visiting</em> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.cyberlink.com/products/powerdirector-video-editing-software/features%5Fen%5FIN.html"><em>Cyberlink’s official website</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Create a new video project in Cyberlink PowerDirector 365 by choosing Full Mode.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="crop-video-in-powerdirector"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Full Mode in Cyberlink PowerDirector 365 provides access to a full-featured video editing tool, similar to Wondershare Filmora. The other available options cater to distinct video types.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Import media onto the Timeline from the Media Library; in this guide, we have gone ahead and used the pre-existing stock footage.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="crop-video-in-powerdirector"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now, click on the video file on the Timeline; this will activate the video toolbar giving you access to the various controls built into PowerDirector 365. Hover over the tools open, following which you need to click on the Crop, Zoom, and Pan option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-in-powerdirector-3.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-in-powerdirector"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Pick either corner of the frame visible around the video and set the area you want the clip to focus upon; following this, click Save.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="crop-video-in-powerdirector"
                ></p>
<p>This action will crop the video clip according to your desired size.</p>
<p><strong>Tip</strong>:</p>
<p>The activation of Keyframes while cropping will allow you to create an effect that slowly zooms into the footage. To do this, set Keyframe Point 1 at a specific time (say the fifth second) and at one zoom level (say zero) and create Keyframe Point 2 at another time (fifteenth second) and a different zoom level (say fifty). So, between the fifth second and fifteenth second, the zoom will steadily increase and raise emphasis on an object. You can also add an element of position to this action if you want the focus to be on something not in the center of the screen.</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Keyframes while Video Editing is a software-based feature that allows you to set In and Out Points, giving clips between the two positions different properties that change as the playhead continues to move. These properties can be increased zoom, rotation, different colors, or even a gradual pan.</p>
<p>We recommend experimenting with this feature if you want to bring a more dynamic feeling to your video project.</p>

<p>An emphasis on quick accessibility is present with Filmora, and we believe this is a huge plus for beginning creators. The use of iconography resemblant to mobile software is another aspect that helps increase familiarity.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Pick any edge within the visible box and resize them to select the portion you want to keep in the clip.</p>

<p>For macOS 10.14 or later</p>
<p>Once you have the software open, follow the steps listed below.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Import the Media File into your Video Project.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="crop-video-in-powerdirector"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Drag the clip onto the Timeline and then select it to activate further interactions.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="crop-video-in-powerdirector"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Choose the Crop Options (marked in Red) to open the Crop window.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="crop-video-in-powerdirector"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Pick any edge within the visible box and resize them to select the portion you want to keep in the clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>Having read this bit of the guide, we believe you may have noticed how Filmora is more convenient due to the easier access it provides to the crop function.</p>
<h2 id="The-Bottom-Line-5"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line-5" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>So, at the end of the day, both software listed in this article are fully functional and highly-capable video editing tools, but saving time spent in front of the computer is a huge factor for any video editor.</p>
<p>And Wondershare Filmora does just that with its modern iconography and increased accessibility. With its thoughtful, less-frills approach, Filmora is the one to pick if you do not want to be bogged down by needless menus and have to hunt for actions that will help you create a video that you would want to watch yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Full Mode in Cyberlink PowerDirector 365 provides access to a full-featured video editing tool, similar to Wondershare Filmora. The other available options cater to distinct video types.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Import media onto the Timeline from the Media Library; in this guide, we have gone ahead and used the pre-existing stock footage.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-in-powerdirector-2.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-in-powerdirector"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now, click on the video file on the Timeline; this will activate the video toolbar giving you access to the various controls built into PowerDirector 365. Hover over the tools open, following which you need to click on the Crop, Zoom, and Pan option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-in-powerdirector-3.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-in-powerdirector"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Pick either corner of the frame visible around the video and set the area you want the clip to focus upon; following this, click Save.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-in-powerdirector-4.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-in-powerdirector"
                ></p>
<p>This action will crop the video clip according to your desired size.</p>
<p><strong>Tip</strong>:</p>
<p>The activation of Keyframes while cropping will allow you to create an effect that slowly zooms into the footage. To do this, set Keyframe Point 1 at a specific time (say the fifth second) and at one zoom level (say zero) and create Keyframe Point 2 at another time (fifteenth second) and a different zoom level (say fifty). So, between the fifth second and fifteenth second, the zoom will steadily increase and raise emphasis on an object. You can also add an element of position to this action if you want the focus to be on something not in the center of the screen.</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Keyframes while Video Editing is a software-based feature that allows you to set In and Out Points, giving clips between the two positions different properties that change as the playhead continues to move. These properties can be increased zoom, rotation, different colors, or even a gradual pan.</p>
<p>We recommend experimenting with this feature if you want to bring a more dynamic feeling to your video project.</p>
