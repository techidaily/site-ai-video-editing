                      alt=" Effect menu"
                ></p>
<p>Now, it’s time to focus on adding effects to clips for an impressive video. For such a thing, you should proceed by focusing on the LAYER button on the interface. By clicking the LAYER button, you can access a specific menu with multiple options. One of these options is the EFFECT button. When you click on this particular button, it will take you to the effect menus. In case you have the paid version you can go with the GET MORE option in the EFFECT menu. It will be useful in getting more effective options. You can also download the effects to keep using them regularly.</p>
