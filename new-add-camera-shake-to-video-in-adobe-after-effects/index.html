You know, those cool shake effects that you may have seen on an amateur or professional video on the web? Well, if you have, then you probably thought it was impossible. The camera shake effect is a technique applied to the clips where shaky camera movements cause the image to appear more cinematic and real. Applying a camera shake effect is to hide your flaws when shooting a video.</p>
<p>Camera shake is often mistaken for poor cinematography. It can enhance your video. For instance, if you’re filming something like a car chase or any other scene where there’s lots of movement and action, the inclusion of a camera shake can help make it more realistic.</p>
<p>A camera shake effect can be an excellent way of adding a sense of realism to your videos. Whether you’re making a video that’s meant to be taken as a real scene, such as one depicting a robbery, or one that’s supposed to be shot in a documentary style, such as making a movie, you can use this as an effective tool. You can consider adding camera shakes to your videos due to the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>This camera shake effect makes your video more creative. If you want to make, your video different from those other businesses produce, adding this effect will be a good idea.</li>
<li>Your audience will be able to relate better to your video if they’ve seen similar videos before.</li>
<li>Adding a camera shake to your video will make it more interesting and engaging for your viewers.</li>
<li>It’s a great way to mask any mistakes you might have made during the video production. After all, we aren’t perfect humans, so we can’t make perfect videos every time!”</li>
<li>You can use camera shakes to simulate the feeling of being in an environment that is free from control (such as being on a boat).</li>
<li>You can use them to create a sense of urgency for the viewer&#x2F;audience by adding motion blur to the sequence.</li>

Using it correctly can add subtle motion to a static frame, emphasize an important object, and even make a character quiver in fear! In this tutorial, you will learn how to effectively use the wiggle expression to affect a layer throughout the Composition.</p>
<h3 id="Step-1-Select-the-layer-you-want-to-shake-from-your-After-Effects-file"><a href="#Step-1-Select-the-layer-you-want-to-shake-from-your-After-Effects-file" class="headerlink" title="Step 1. Select the layer you want to shake from your After Effects file"></a>Step 1. Select the layer you want to shake from your After Effects file</h3><p>Suppose you have an image or video of an object and want to apply it to shake effect, then it is quite easy. Just follow the steps described below.</p>

Press the alt&#x2F;option key, then click the stopwatch next to “position.”"></a>Step 2. Press the alt&#x2F;option key, then click the stopwatch next to “position.”</h3><p>You are adding an “expression” to the timeline when the position text turns red, and you begin typing. Using a coding language adapted from javascript, you can apply complex motion to layers.</p>
<p>By pressing the alt&#x2F;option again on the stopwatch, you can edit your expression anytime-or by clicking the arrow beside “position” and then double-clicking the text in the timeline.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

Enter “Wiggle (3,8)” and adjust the settings accordingly"></a>Step 3. Enter “Wiggle (3,8)” and adjust the settings accordingly</h3><p>In this expression, the first number indicates the frequency of Wiggle – basically, how quickly it appears to tremble. Its amplitude is the second number, which indicates how far it moves. The numbers are adjustable as you wish. Layers will shake dramatically but slowly when they use Wiggle (2,40). The “Wiggle (10,3)” command makes a layer move quickly without too much movement in one direction.</p>
<h3 id="Step-4-Adjust-the-frame-rate-of-your-Composition"><a href="#Step-4-Adjust-the-frame-rate-of-your-Composition" class="headerlink" title="Step 4. Adjust the frame rate of your Composition"></a>Step 4. Adjust the frame rate of your Composition</h3><p>In order to make the overall effect more “choppy,” you can reduce the frame rate of the video by going to Composition&gt; Composition settings. After Effects uses a frame rate of 24.5, you can go as low as “8” if you want a choppy feel.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>Your entire Composition will become choppier if you reduce the frame rate, so it might not be worth it if you have other moving elements in your Composition. Only adjust the frame rate of the layer containing the wiggling object if you want it to affect that layer.</p>

<p>1. Recording options: An ideal screen recorder should have all the different options for recording your screen, webcam, system audio, and external audio from microphone. Besides, it should offer you the option to customize the recording area by selection. You should be able to record full screen, application window, and browser tab accurately.</p>
<p>2. Price: If you are serious about recording your screen video and uploading the recorded video on online platforms, you have to opt for a premium screen recorder.

<p>3. Customer support: You need to ensure that the screen recorder you are purchasing, they have a highly responsive customer support. This is a highly neglected factor but users suffer a lot when the customer support team is not responsive. Be sure that you will need to contact the customer support team at some time to learn more about certain features and troubleshoot in emergency situations.</p>

Practice before recording: Unless you are a pro, you should practice at least once before the actual recording. This will help you to execute your plan according to your script smoothly when you actually start recording. Besides, you can check if the frame, the camera, the mic, and everything else are working perfectly.</p>
<p>2. Only record the required screen: Screen recorders offer you the option to record the entire screen, any specific application window or any specific tab of your browser. In fact, you can even customize the screen recording area as per your requirements for better focus and better visual experience.</p>
<p>3. Keep it short: It is always necessary to keep the length of the video as short as possible without skipping the relevant points and important explanations. That is where a proper script before recording is crucial so that you can have a plan and execute it properly without stretching your explanation unnecessarily.</p>
<p>4. Speak slowly and clearly: The way you speak in the video can attract as well as repel audiences. If you speak too fast and if you have a weird accent, it is going to repel audiences. That is why it is important for you to speak slowly and clearly so that everyone can understand everything you speak and negate your accent to a greater extent.</p>
<p>5. Use screen drawing tools: If you are recording a video where you need to explain something, it is always better if you use screen drawing tools. In fact, it is important that you choose the screen recorder that offers drawing tools so that the video gets visually pleasing and impactful for audiences to understand effectively.</p>
<p>6. Cut out dead moments: When you are recording screen videos, there are going to be a lot of dead moments and boring pauses. You have to cut out those boring and dead moments while editing so that the video stays interesting and the audiences do not lose concentration. This will also help to tighten the length of the video.</p>
<p>7. End with a summary: Last but most importantly, you should offer a proper conclusion before ending the video. You need to summarize everything you have discussed in the video so that the audience can get a revision of all the important points. Besides, a proper ending rather than an abrupt ending can leave a positive impact regarding your video.</p>

But you don’t have to worry about it anymore let’s begin:</p>

<p><strong>Learning curve</strong>: You should keep in mind which editing software is complex to learn and which one is easy in comparison with that. If you didn’t keep this in mind you might end up wasting your time by downloading and trying in vain.</p>
<p><strong>Quality</strong>: Another important factor to consider in video editing software is the quality and format of the video. There are many formats and quality of video content, therefore it is important to choose the one which supports your video format.</p>
<p><strong>Resources</strong>: Depending upon the requirements of the editing on your video, you should choose a video editor that should have all the video effects, music tracks, and other resources that you might need to apply to your video. Be careful not to select one with few resources.</p>
<p><strong>Compatability</strong>: The most important point is whether your PC, Mac, or Android platform can run the video editor you have heard the name from your friend. Consult the internet for compatibility of the software by checking its minimum specification requirement on its manual or docs.</p>

This will also help to tighten the length of the video.</p>
<p>7. End with a summary: Last but most importantly, you should offer a proper conclusion before ending the video. You need to summarize everything you have discussed in the video so that the audience can get a revision of all the important points. Besides, a proper ending rather than an abrupt ending can leave a positive impact regarding your video.</p>

<p><strong>Compatability</strong>: The most important point is whether your PC, Mac, or Android platform can run the video editor you have heard the name from your friend. Consult the internet for compatibility of the software by checking its minimum specification requirement on its manual or docs.</p>

<p>1. Recording options: An ideal screen recorder should have all the different options for recording your screen, webcam, system audio, and external audio from microphone. Besides, it should offer you the option to customize the recording area by selection. You should be able to record full screen, application window, and browser tab accurately.</p>
<p>2. Price: If you are serious about recording your screen video and uploading the recorded video on online platforms, you have to opt for a premium screen recorder. While purchasing a proprietary screen recorder, you need to compare the software price with its peers and ensure that you are getting more features for the price you are paying.</p>
<p>3. Customer support: You need to ensure that the screen recorder you are purchasing, they have a highly responsive customer support. This is a highly neglected factor but users suffer a lot when the customer support team is not responsive. Be sure that you will need to contact the customer support team at some time to learn more about certain features and troubleshoot in emergency situations.</p>
<p>4. Sharing options: When your ultimate goal is to share your recorded video online, you should check for the sharing options available in the screen recorder. There are screen recorders that allow sharing recorded and edited videos on online platforms, cloud storage platforms, and video streaming platforms. It should also offer you options to let you export videos in different file formats.</p>

Besides, you may need options to add music and voiceover as well as intro and outro. That is why you should opt for a screen recorder where a great video editor is available.</p>
<p>6. Customer Reviews: Last but most importantly, you should check the customer review of the screen recording software.

<h2 id="Part-8-Screen-Recording-Tips-and-Tricks-2"><a href="#Part-8-Screen-Recording-Tips-and-Tricks-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 8: Screen Recording Tips and Tricks"></a>Part 8: Screen Recording Tips and Tricks</h2><p>1. Practice before recording: Unless you are a pro, you should practice at least once before the actual recording. This will help you to execute your plan according to your script smoothly when you actually start recording. Besides, you can check if the frame, the camera, the mic, and everything else are working perfectly.</p>
<p>2. Only record the required screen: Screen recorders offer you the option to record the entire screen, any specific application window or any specific tab of your browser. In fact, you can even customize the screen recording area as per your requirements for better focus and better visual experience.</p>
<p>3. Keep it short: It is always necessary to keep the length of the video as short as possible without skipping the relevant points and important explanations. That is where a proper script before recording is crucial so that you can have a plan and execute it properly without stretching your explanation unnecessarily.</p>
<p>4. Speak slowly and clearly: The way you speak in the video can attract as well as repel audiences. If you speak too fast and if you have a weird accent, it is going to repel audiences. That is why it is important for you to speak slowly and clearly so that everyone can understand everything you speak and negate your accent to a greater extent.</p>
<p>5. Use screen drawing tools: If you are recording a video where you need to explain something, it is always better if you use screen drawing tools. In fact, it is important that you choose the screen recorder that offers drawing tools so that the video gets visually pleasing and impactful for audiences to understand effectively.</p>
<p>6. Cut out dead moments: When you are recording screen videos, there are going to be a lot of dead moments and boring pauses. You have to cut out those boring and dead moments while editing so that the video stays interesting and the audiences do not lose concentration. This will also help to tighten the length of the video.</p>
<p>7. End with a summary: Last but most importantly, you should offer a proper conclusion before ending the video. You need to summarize everything you have discussed in the video so that the audience can get a revision of all the important points. Besides, a proper ending rather than an abrupt ending can leave a positive impact regarding your video.</p>

<p>2. Price: If you are serious about recording your screen video and uploading the recorded video on online platforms, you have to opt for a premium screen recorder.

Practice before recording: Unless you are a pro, you should practice at least once before the actual recording. This will help you to execute your plan according to your script smoothly when you actually start recording. Besides, you can check if the frame, the camera, the mic, and everything else are working perfectly.</p>
<p>2. Only record the required screen: Screen recorders offer you the option to record the entire screen, any specific application window or any specific tab of your browser. In fact, you can even customize the screen recording area as per your requirements for better focus and better visual experience.</p>
<p>3. Keep it short: It is always necessary to keep the length of the video as short as possible without skipping the relevant points and important explanations. That is where a proper script before recording is crucial so that you can have a plan and execute it properly without stretching your explanation unnecessarily.</p>
<p>4. Speak slowly and clearly: The way you speak in the video can attract as well as repel audiences. If you speak too fast and if you have a weird accent, it is going to repel audiences. That is why it is important for you to speak slowly and clearly so that everyone can understand everything you speak and negate your accent to a greater extent.</p>
<p>5. Use screen drawing tools: If you are recording a video where you need to explain something, it is always better if you use screen drawing tools. In fact, it is important that you choose the screen recorder that offers drawing tools so that the video gets visually pleasing and impactful for audiences to understand effectively.</p>
<p>6. Cut out dead moments: When you are recording screen videos, there are going to be a lot of dead moments and boring pauses. You have to cut out those boring and dead moments while editing so that the video stays interesting and the audiences do not lose concentration. This will also help to tighten the length of the video.</p>
<p>7. End with a summary: Last but most importantly, you should offer a proper conclusion before ending the video. You need to summarize everything you have discussed in the video so that the audience can get a revision of all the important points. Besides, a proper ending rather than an abrupt ending can leave a positive impact regarding your video.</p>

Talking of the most recent add-ons to the already long list of utilities, storyboards have emerged as a revolution in the field of motion graphic customization and design.</p>
<p>Diving a bit deeper into understanding the credibility of storyboards, let us move ahead with having an insight of different aspects and elements of the same in the upcoming sections of this article:</p>
<p><strong>What is a Storyboard?</strong></p>
<p>Attempting to define a <strong>storyboard</strong>, you can regard the utility as a sequential setup of sketches, images, elements and illustrations that create a road map to address a video editing task. Dividing the entire process into a series of individual processes, the aforesaid facility caters to ease out the video creation task.</p>
<p>Moving ahead to draft a technical explanation of storyboards, they are a collection of chronologically arranged drawings, supplemented with video customization elements, such as dialogues, camera direction and other allied detailing. The fundamental merit of these visual arrangements lies in the sequential and scene unfolding of a video footage.</p>
<p>This in turn, works to simplify the film creation process, while ensuring the latter’s cohesiveness and facilitating the elimination of errors and inconsistencies. It is a common mistake to regard storyboards as a midway and optional utility, these trial and error representations are quite essential to ensure a flawless video output in the final stage of design. The facility works additionally to minimize unnecessary production delays, while significantly cutting down on the overall creation cost.</p>
<p>Having a visibility more or less similar to a comic strip, storyboards have a varying scale of design, ranging from being modestly simple to explicitly complex, in cohesion with the specific creation requirements. These visual scripts are mostly hand crafted, through there are a host of storyboard creation software packages and programs available in the IT design market, as well as across the web.</p>
<p>Extending our discussion a bit further, let us have a walk-through of the essential storyboard categories and types in what follows next:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Traditional Storyboards</strong></p>
<p>These are a logically placed sequence of hand crafted drawings in ink or pencil for representing the video filming chronology, prior to the start of the actual creation process. You can conveniently observe the sequential arrangement of your video elements through these storyboards by placing them at a suitable space, like your studio wall.</p>
<p>You are granted the liberty to add as much detailing to these drawings as you wish, while using them for filming either a single or a series of film shots. These easily editable storyboards are often supplemented with written text notes for describing the events of a specific scene.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Thumbnail Storyboards</strong></p>
<p>These are rather small storyboards, mostly of a postage stamp size, that depict a sequence of the video elements and scenes on separate paper pieces. Owing to their miniature size, these storyboards are relatively easier to craft, require a lesser creation time and have much fewer details in comparison to their traditional counterparts.</p>
<p>This category of storyboards comes credible in catering a quick jot down of video creation ideas, before you proceed to analyze each element in a more comprehensive manner through the traditional alternatives.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Animated Storyboards</strong></p>
<p>This class of storyboards comes into play when you aim to craft complex video outlines, while supplementing the same with additional elements of music and dialogues. These are designed essentially to depict the general scene flow through the characteristics of time and pace in a series of animated sketches.</p>
<p>As of creating these storyboards, there is a diversity of online and software based utilities to address the concern. Such facilities work to integrate the images within a sketch into a single video, while adding life to the footage within a span of several minutes. The creation process is quite simple, without a download or software learning requirement.</p>

While the utility works to define a sequential arrangement of shots and elements in a specific video scene, the real effort lies in converting a text centered movie or scene script into a storyboard. Talking of the ways to address this concern, let us discuss about these storyboard essentials in some detail in what follows next:</p>
<p><strong>What Comes First – Script or Storyboard?</strong></p>
<p>Before beginning to comment on the sequence of the aforesaid elements within a film production process, let us first proceed to have an understanding of the terms in a fundamental sense. A script is essentially a text based document that presents a cumulative picture of the video story by unveiling the latter’s storyline and theme. Storyboards on the other hand, are pictorial representations of sequentially arranged shots of the movie with a much more comprehensive detailing.</p>
<p>Going through the above definitions, the obvious and logical sequence of filming out a video is quite clear with scripts preceding the storyboards. Talking a bit on the credibility aspect of these video production stages, the film’s script caters to provide an elementary insight into some of the most essential visual commands. Crafting a storyboard on the other hand, is dedicated towards depicting a detailed follow through of each shot in line with the events described in the script.</p>
<p>Working towards a classic and professional video production task, hence demands a drafting of the latter’s script, which is then succeeded by crafting a storyboard. This facilitates a seamless and easy video creation process with lesser ambiguities. Having talked enough about scripts and storyboards, let us now move ahead with creating storyboards from a film script in the following section:</p>
<p><strong>User’s Guide to Transform a Script into a Storyboard</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Identify and Pen Down an Amazing Content Idea</strong></p>
<p>Begin with identifying a captivating story idea that you desire of implementing into a video production.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2: Let’s Start Storyboarding!</strong></p>
<p>Move ahead to planning the sequential placement of shots and scenes of the story in line with the script that you have just created. It is a great idea to pick an array of 4-6 movement shots for a particular scene, so that you can have a sufficient cell spacing to expand the detailing of shot elements. This further caters to a convenient and spatial arrangement of the cells on a standard sized paper.</p>
<p>You can now start to create your storyboard by adding labels to the scenes, penning down the directions, including the specific character dialogues and suitable images.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3: Prepare a Layout of Your Storyboards</strong></p>
<p>When you are done with adding all the elements of the script into the storyboard cells, proceed to lay them out in a specific pattern. This step comes quite handy in checking for the continuity and detailing accuracy of the depicted shots. You can further, improvise the elements if needed, or advance to the next step if everything seems fine.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4: Revise Your Craft</strong></p>

In an otherwise case however, you may need to make a revision of the crafted storyboard for a much more detailed and comprehensive observation. You can work to include an elusive paly of effects, lighting cues, background music and characters, camera motions, and a series of additional elements that seem to uplift your creation.</p>
<p>Paying attention to the aspect or revising your storyboards caters to a much more improvised and professionally sound presentation of your video production idea in front of the target audience.

<p><strong>How Can I Get Better at Storyboarding?</strong></p>
<p>Speaking in the light of film production assets and utilities, storyboarding is more of a creative art rather than a customary process or production stage. While it requires consistent effort and practice to master the craft, adhering to some handy tips and tricks can be of great help to improve your skills at creating expressive and finely detailed storyboards.</p>
<p>Heading towards sorting the aforesaid query, the following section presents a concise description of a few amazing and unique storyboard creation guidelines and tricks to present the storyboarding craft at its best:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Stop Aiming to Become a Perfectionist</strong></p>
<p>Considering the fact that you are crafting the storyboard just for the purpose of depicting a sequence of video shots, do not aim at defining every element in comprehensive detail. Instead of making a fresh attempt to depict every minor change, pay more attention towards highlighting the significant points of action within a particular scene.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Prefer Numbering the Storyboard Panels</strong></p>
<p>Since the storyboard you are creating works as a blueprint for the video creation team, it should be convenient to understand and navigate through. Presenting the cells of your storyboard in a numbered sequence tends to provide an easy follow through of the same to the rest of your viewers.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Explore Your Imagination</strong></p>
<p>Your storyboard happens to be the inaugural representation of your video production idea and script in front of the potential audience. You should hence, proceed with the latter’s crafting process while keeping a close reference with the drafted script. Also, it becomes greatly important to add the imaginative element to your creation to avoid creating an bland and customary impression on the audience.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Feedback Has a Great Importance</strong></p>
<p>Make sure to showcase your storyboard to your project investors, prior to beginning with the film creation process. This will aid you with an escape from the unnecessary changes that can pop out from the audience at the last minute, leading to an unwanted financial expense. Pay attention to gather and work on the feedback of the viewers and start the actual creation process only after everything seems to be well settled.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Enjoy Your Work</strong></p>
<p>Enjoying the different aspects of your work is the key to achieve mastery at your craft and a welcoming response from the audience. Accepted that the storyboarding process is mind straining and time consuming, but taking on the challenge with a fun centered attitude will let your hard work shine on in front of the viewers.</p>
<p><strong>Creating Storyboards with Wondershare Filmora</strong></p>
<p>Creating storyboards in the traditional paper and pencil format is undoubtedly an absolute fun activity, but it has the limitations of a customary image drawing.

<p>Browsing through the heap of alternatives across the web and the IT market, you can conveniently choose to work with the Wondershare <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> to address the concern.

<p>When aiming to quickly address the concern of creating storyboards, picking up an online template is a better option in comparison to the traditional pencil and paper drawing. As of working with the web based alternatives, you can add sketches, scripts and notes within the storyboard cells to make them more impressive and detailed.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>What should be the ideal expanse of a storyboard?</strong></p>
<p>There is no hard and fast rule to decide the optimum number of cells or pages for your storyboard. The page count may have variations in line with the content and detailing of the scenes they are crafted to showcase.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Is it essential to include every shot within the storyboard?</strong></p>
<p>On a general note, every shot within your script does not require an inclusion within the storyboard. The answer to this query however, largely depends on the intensity of detailing you wish to add and the diversity of ideas and elements you want to incorporate within the storyboard of a specific film scene.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>What are the essentials of a good storyboard?</strong></p>
<p>When attempting to create a good storyboard, pay attention to the fluent transition of the text centered ideas into pictorial representations. Your video script should possess the right quantity of information to make anyone easily understand the content depiction without having a prior walk-through of your script. Abstain from creating an information overflow either, lest you would end up hiding away the relevant details.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>What are the major parts of a storyboard?</strong></p>
<p>A well-crafted storyboard comprises of 4 important elements. There are namely, the subject of the shot or scene, a suitable and cohesive background, a properly angled camera shot of the main character within the scene and a responsive camera movement.</p>
