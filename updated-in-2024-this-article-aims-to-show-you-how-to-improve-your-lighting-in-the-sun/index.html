            <h2 id="This-Article-Aims-to-Show-You-How-to-Improve-Your-Lighting-in-the-Sun"><a href="#This-Article-Aims-to-Show-You-How-to-Improve-Your-Lighting-in-the-Sun" class="headerlink" title="This Article Aims to Show You How to Improve Your Lighting in the Sun"></a>This Article Aims to Show You How to Improve Your Lighting in the Sun</h2><p>Shooting outdoors is a challenge in most situations. We have to deal with the sun being overexposed or the background is too dark.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll show you how to light with the sun the easiest way. These simple and effective tips can help you block the harsh sun and make it to your advantage!</p>
<h2 id="1-Preparation"><a href="#1-Preparation" class="headerlink" title="1) Preparation"></a>1) Preparation</h2><p>You may need those things to film under the harsh sun:</p>
<ol>
<li>An ND filter for your lens</li>
<li>A flag to block the sun. It can be anything like a black poster.</li>
<li>A white poster to bounce the sunlight.</li>
<li>Artificial light equipment.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now let’s see when and how to use them against the strong sunlight!</p>
<h2 id="2-Direct-to-the-Sun"><a href="#2-Direct-to-the-Sun" class="headerlink" title="2) Direct to the Sun"></a>2) Direct to the Sun</h2><p>If we want a specific background for our shot but our talent has to face the sun, here are some tips you can do to undermine the unflattering light or the blindness.</p>
<p><strong>1. Pick up an ND filter on your lens</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/len.jpg"
                      alt="pick up an nd filter on lens"
                ></p>
<p>We use it outside so we can open our aperture to get nice blurry backgrounds without overexposing our footage.</p>
<p><strong>2. Use a “flag” to block or shape the sunlight</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/black-flag.jpg"
                      alt="black flag"
                ></p>
<p>Using a black piece of poster board works perfectly fine, hold it up to the sun. Also, remember to angle your “flag” to create harsh lines or fully shade your talent.</p>
<p><strong>3. Adjust your camera to fit the environment</strong></p>
<p>For example, you can change the exposure of your camera to match the talent’s face giving a more silhouette look.</p>
<h2 id="3-Back-to-the-Sun"><a href="#3-Back-to-the-Sun" class="headerlink" title="3) Back to the Sun"></a>3) Back to the Sun</h2><p>Have you ever been filming outside only to see your talent dark in the frame with the background blown out with light? To fix the problem, the simplest way is to use a “bounce”.</p>
<p>By using a “bounce”, we can reflect the light from the sun to our talent. Make sure to lift the bounce and move it around to get the right amount of light on your talent.</p>
<p>This should give us a nice look with the sun backlighting our subject and the bounce filling in the shadows and giving us soft light on our talent’s face!</p>
<h2 id="4-Artificial-lighting"><a href="#4-Artificial-lighting" class="headerlink" title="4) Artificial lighting"></a>4) Artificial lighting</h2><p>If we want to control our lighting better, we will want to use artificial lights in combination with the sun.</p>
<p>For example, weather changes. As you shot, the sun will move and make lighting challenging to keep consistent.</p>
<p>In that case, we can use the <strong>flag technique</strong> that we used before to block the harsh sunlight and then use our lights on our talent’s face, this keeps our lighting more consistent than if we relied on just the natural light.</p>
<p>Now, take a look at the comparison with all the lighting conditions we create:</p>
<ol>
<li>Flag VS Flag &amp; Light</li>
</ol>

<p>~ Some FAQs about FLV Videos:</p>

<p>FLV is basically used to publish or distribute videos on the Internet. Many social platforms and web pages (such as youtube, Hulu, e.t.c.) use .flv files as it provide high-quality synchronized audio and video in compact file size.

It is quite easy to use and has some useful features like Speed, Adding subtitles, Audio sync, e.t.c.</p>
<p><strong>Is .flv file easy to edit?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Flv vs Mp4 which is better?</strong></p>
<p>FLV format was quite popular back in 2010 as it provides high-quality compressed video for the internet. It takes less space which makes it easy to download and transfer quickly. Nowadays MP4 format is used more as it is versatile and is compatible with almost all devices like Mobile, PC, TV, e.t.c.

<p>~ Some FAQs about FLV Videos:</p>
<p><strong>why is .flv format used?</strong></p>
<p>FLV is basically used to publish or distribute videos on the Internet. Many social platforms and web pages (such as youtube, Hulu, e.t.c.) use .flv files as it provide high-quality synchronized audio and video in compact file size. It was mostly used for embedded videos on these platforms. It is compatible with most browsers and devices even with older phones and computers.</p>
<p><strong>How to play .FLV files?</strong></p>
<p>To play .flv files a flash player is required. Which is pre-installed in almost most of the computers and browsers, if that’s not the case. Then you need a good video player which supports .flv format. Therefore VLC media prayer is a good choice. It is quite easy to use and has some useful features like Speed, Adding subtitles, Audio sync, e.t.c.</p>
<p><strong>Is .flv file easy to edit?</strong></p>
<p>FLV is just a format, It can be edited like any other format. Steps may differ from software to software. But don’t worry as I have mentioned the steps of some popular FLV video editors above.</p>
<p><strong>Can the .flv file be converted?</strong></p>
<p>If you don’t want to stick with the .flv format for long enough and want to switch over to a more convenient format then you can try these converters.</p>
<p><strong>VLC Media Player:</strong> Yes, apart from being a video player it can convert video formats. It’s quite easy to use.</p>

<p>Open HandBrake-“Drop a file” screen will appear &gt;&gt; Select the specific file you one to convert &gt;&gt; Select Destination filder &gt;&gt; Click “Start encoding”.</p>
<p><strong>Flv vs Mp4 which is better?</strong></p>
<p>FLV format was quite popular back in 2010 as it provides high-quality compressed video for the internet. It takes less space which makes it easy to download and transfer quickly. Nowadays MP4 format is used more as it is versatile and is compatible with almost all devices like Mobile, PC, TV, e.t.c. FLV uses H.263 codec while MP4 uses  codec which provides better quality after compression. Still .flv file is a better choice for streaming platforms as one of the most common software used for streaming is OBS studio and it produces .flv files.</p>

<p><strong>Which Should I choose Free or Paid FLV Editor</strong> <strong>:</strong></p>
<p> Are you confused to choose the FLV editor for you? Then look for the one that suits your other needs. Like if you want an editor only to crop or trim videos then save your money and go for a free video editor. But if you want some extra features to enhance your workflow or have some cash then go for paid software.

<p>~ Some FAQs about FLV Videos:</p>
<p><strong>why is .flv format used?</strong></p>
<p>FLV is basically used to publish or distribute videos on the Internet. Many social platforms and web pages (such as youtube, Hulu, e.t.c.) use .flv files as it provide high-quality synchronized audio and video in compact file size. It was mostly used for embedded videos on these platforms. It is compatible with most browsers and devices even with older phones and computers.</p>
<p><strong>How to play .FLV files?</strong></p>
<p>To play .flv files a flash player is required. Which is pre-installed in almost most of the computers and browsers, if that’s not the case. Then you need a good video player which supports .flv format. Therefore VLC media prayer is a good choice. It is quite easy to use and has some useful features like Speed, Adding subtitles, Audio sync, e.t.c.</p>
<p><strong>Is .flv file easy to edit?</strong></p>
<p>FLV is just a format, It can be edited like any other format. Steps may differ from software to software. But don’t worry as I have mentioned the steps of some popular FLV video editors above.</p>
<p><strong>Can the .flv file be converted?</strong></p>
<p>If you don’t want to stick with the .flv format for long enough and want to switch over to a more convenient format then you can try these converters.</p>
<p><strong>VLC Media Player:</strong> Yes, apart from being a video player it can convert video formats. It’s quite easy to use.</p>
<p>Simply Open VLC Media Player &gt;&gt; Click Media tab &gt;&gt; Click “Convert&#x2F;Save” &gt;&gt; On pop up menu Select “Add” to add file (can add multiple files also) &gt;&gt; Click “Convert&#x2F;Save” &gt;&gt; Add Destination folder and File Format (to convert in) then click “Start”.</p>
<p><strong>Hand Brake:</strong> It is another popular video converter that can convert a .flv file into almost any file format.</p>
<p>Open HandBrake-“Drop a file” screen will appear &gt;&gt; Select the specific file you one to convert &gt;&gt; Select Destination filder &gt;&gt; Click “Start encoding”.</p>
<p><strong>Flv vs Mp4 which is better?</strong></p>
<p>FLV format was quite popular back in 2010 as it provides high-quality compressed video for the internet. It takes less space which makes it easy to download and transfer quickly. Nowadays MP4 format is used more as it is versatile and is compatible with almost all devices like Mobile, PC, TV, e.t.c. FLV uses H.263 codec while MP4 uses  codec which provides better quality after compression. Still .flv file is a better choice for streaming platforms as one of the most common software used for streaming is OBS studio and it produces .flv files.</p>
<p> <strong>It is available for both Windows and Mac.</strong></p>

With so many video marketing companies ready to scam you, the question boils down to how to find a high-quality agency that can provide the expected results. Here are some crucial steps to judge if a marketing video agency is worth your time and money.</p>
<h5 id="Step-1-Be-Clear-About-Your-Objective-3"><a href="#Step-1-Be-Clear-About-Your-Objective-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 1 Be Clear About Your Objective"></a>Step 1 Be Clear About Your Objective</h5><p>Before you start finding video content marketing companies, you should be clear about the goals you want to achieve through video marketing. For some brands, the goal could be increasing brand awareness and visibility by driving website traffic. For others, it could be generating leads and boosting sales. Once you are clear about your goals and expectations, you can start finding agencies that specialize in fulfilling your objectives.</p>

But you cannot take their promises for granted. Instead, evaluate their capabilities by reviewing their portfolio consisting of their past projects. You can assess their quality by judging their creativity, work style, production value, and marketing techniques from their past works. Once you are convinced of their skills and capabilities, you can shortlist them.</p>

This is because their past experience will help them understand your objectives and targeted audiences better. They are likely to be aware of the things that work and do not work with the audiences in your industry. Besides, they will be capable of finding opportunities and identifying challenges faster during the marketing process. Therefore, agencies with experience in your industry should get priority on your list.</p>
