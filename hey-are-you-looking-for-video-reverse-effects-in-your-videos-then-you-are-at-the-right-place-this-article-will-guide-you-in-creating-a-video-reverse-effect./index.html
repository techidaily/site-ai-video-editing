Are You Looking for Video Reverse Effects in Your Videos? Then, You Are at the Right Place. This Article Will Guide You in Creating a Video Reverse Effect</h2><p>All great video editors use phenomenal video effects in their videos. One of the most professional effects is the reverse video effect. This unique effect is always challenging for the makers to shoot and portray on the screen flawlessly.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is intriguing and always draws the audience’s attention. In this article, you will learn to shoot and edit the video for reverse effects using Filmora. But first, we will learn what does video reverse effect mean. So let us get into this!</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Video-Reverse-Effect"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Video-Reverse-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Video Reverse Effect?"></a>Part 1. What Is Video Reverse Effect?</h2><p>It is a special video effect in which a motion of things starts in the backward direction. This unique effect is used to intrigue the audience.</p>
<p>For example, if a bullet is fired from a gun. With the reverse effect, you can rewind the footage, and the shot goes back into the gun. So today, you can easily rewind fast action scenes and get a wow reaction from the audience.</p>
<h3 id="Famous-Examples-of-Reverse-Effect-in-Films"><a href="#Famous-Examples-of-Reverse-Effect-in-Films" class="headerlink" title="Famous Examples of Reverse Effect in Films"></a>Famous Examples of Reverse Effect in Films</h3><p><strong>1- Demolition of a Wall (1896)</strong></p>
<p>Filmmakers first used this striking effect in 1896 in a 90 seconds film, “Demolition of a wall.” Louis Lumiere was the one who made that video. Below is shown an image from the film.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>2- Tenet (2020)</strong></p>
<p>It is a viral film by Christopher Nolan, which was a great success. He explained the concept of reverse entropy, in which you start moving back chronologically in time instead of forward. This concept is all shown through this special video reverse effect. Unfortunately, the audience had difficulty digesting this unique concept, which generated an awful response.</p>

How To Shoot Video Reverse Effect?</h2><p>The reverse effect is unique, so special attention should be paid while filming a video. This section will cover some of the crucial prerequisites to film a video.</p>
<h3 id="Steady-Camera"><a href="#Steady-Camera" class="headerlink" title="Steady Camera"></a>Steady Camera</h3><p>It would be best to have your camera placed on a steady surface or mounted on a tripod stand to lock the focus. We will split the area and perform different tasks to make it look smooth. The audience will not get the idea that you completed the tasks separately. And it helps in the editing process as well.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h3 id="A-Spacious-Area"><a href="#A-Spacious-Area" class="headerlink" title="A Spacious Area"></a>A Spacious Area</h3><p>You will need a spacious area in which you will perform different tasks. Make sure your camera stands still while shooting all the frames of video. In an ample space, it becomes easier to do movements freely. It also helps prevent glitches in the final product.</p>
<h3 id="Splitting-of-Area-into-Portions"><a href="#Splitting-of-Area-into-Portions" class="headerlink" title="Splitting of Area into Portions"></a>Splitting of Area into Portions</h3><p>Now you have to split your area into portions. Each task is in its part of the frame, and actions in one frame should not pass over into another. You will do one activity per portion. It makes the editing process a lot easier. Finally, we get all three videos to merge and make it look like a single video.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Choose Files</p>
<p>Select several files on your computer using the “Choose Files” button or the dropdown menu to select an online file from a URL, Google Drive, or Dropbox. The file size of an image can be up to 200 megabytes. You can use a file analyzer to gain detailed information about a source image, including its size, resolution, quality, and transparent color.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="Choose file"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Choose Image Format</p>
<p>Determine the image format, quality, and size you want to use. You choose to use the original image size or select “Change width and height” and enter a custom image size. 1920x1080 is an example of a [width]x[height] format. Only a few image formats support the picture quality choice, such as JPG, WEBP, or AVIF. The value ranges from 1 (lowest picture quality and highest compression) to 100 (highest image quality and lowest compression) (best quality but least effective compression). If this field is left blank, the converter will use the estimated quality of your input image if found; otherwise, 92 by default. JPG, PNG, TIFF, GIF, HEIC, BMP, PS, PSD, WEBP, TGA, DDS, EXR, J2K, PNM, or SVG are examples of target image formats.</p>

It is a series of frames (a PNG image) that represent an animation sequence, producing a visual effect comparable to a GIF. APNG files support 24-bit pictures with 8-bit transparency.

<p>Make changes to the image. You can resize or rescale the image before saving it as a PNG file, and you can even add text using your software’s Text tool. This is, however, wholly optional.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Choose Save as</strong></p>
<p>PNG is the top format for saving images. Choose “Save as” from the “File” menu in the editor’s upper left corner.</p>
<p>In the File Name window, provide the name you want for the file.</p>
<p>Under the File Name field, click the “Save as type” drop-down option to see all of the image’s possible formats.</p>
<p>Click “Save” after selecting “PNG.” The file will be saved as a PNG file in the same directory as the original.</p>

<p>The GIF image format is a bitmap image format that supports up to 8 bits per pixel. APNG (Animated Portable Network Graphics) is a format for animated images that supports 24 bits per pixel and 8 bits of transparency, which is not available in GIFs. Backward compatibility with non-animated PNG files is also maintained.</p>
<p>Because the initial frame of an APNG file saves as a regular PNG stream, it can display by most conventional PNG decoders. Extra chunks can hold frame speed data and different animation frames (as provided by the original PNG specification).</p>
<p>Is APNG superior to GIF? APNG files are smaller and have more outstanding quality than GIF files. However, GIF is more compatible than APNG. Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome, and Opera support APNG, while practically all online browsers support GIF.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Choose Files</p>
<p>Select several files on your computer using the “Choose Files” button or the dropdown menu to select an online file from a URL, Google Drive, or Dropbox. The file size of an image can be up to 200 megabytes. You can use a file analyzer to gain detailed information about a source image, including its size, resolution, quality, and transparent color.</p>

                      alt="Choose file"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Choose Image Format</p>
<p>Determine the image format, quality, and size you want to use. You choose to use the original image size or select “Change width and height” and enter a custom image size. 1920x1080 is an example of a [width]x[height] format. Only a few image formats support the picture quality choice, such as JPG, WEBP, or AVIF. The value ranges from 1 (lowest picture quality and highest compression) to 100 (highest image quality and lowest compression) (best quality but least effective compression). If this field is left blank, the converter will use the estimated quality of your input image if found; otherwise, 92 by default. JPG, PNG, TIFF, GIF, HEIC, BMP, PS, PSD, WEBP, TGA, DDS, EXR, J2K, PNM, or SVG are examples of target image formats.</p>

It is a series of frames (a PNG image) that represent an animation sequence, producing a visual effect comparable to a GIF. APNG files support 24-bit pictures with 8-bit transparency. You can convert non-animated GIF files to APNG format. APNG files have the same.png extension as PNG files and can be opened by software like Mozilla Firefox, Chrome with APNG compatibility, and iOS 10’s iMessage apps.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Save</strong></p>
<p>Make sure PNG is selected from the drop-down list of formats in the following box, then click “Save.”</p>

                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Compress</strong></p>
<p>The compression rate is set to “Best” by default, but the Save Options box contains a few extras to check if you want a bit more control over the compression of your file. The file size will be determined by changing the compression rate; the higher the value, the less compression will be utilized when saving your image.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Open Paint</strong></p>
<p>Open an image-editing program on your computer, such as Paint for Windows or Paintbrush for Mac. Simply double-click the software’s icon on your desktop, or choose it from your applications list.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Go to saved Images</strong></p>
<p>Open the image you already saved. Navigate to the window where you saved the image. Click-hold it, drag it, and drop it onto the editor to display the image.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Resize Image</strong></p>
<p>Make changes to the image. You can resize or rescale the image before saving it as a PNG file, and you can even add text using your software’s Text tool. This is, however, wholly optional.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Choose Save as</strong></p>
<p>PNG is the top format for saving images. Choose “Save as” from the “File” menu in the editor’s upper left corner.</p>
<p>In the File Name window, provide the name you want for the file.</p>
<p>Under the File Name field, click the “Save as type” drop-down option to see all of the image’s possible formats.</p>
<p>Click “Save” after selecting “PNG.” The file will be saved as a PNG file in the same directory as the original.</p>

<p>The GIF image format is a bitmap image format that supports up to 8 bits per pixel. APNG (Animated Portable Network Graphics) is a format for animated images that supports 24 bits per pixel and 8 bits of transparency, which is not available in GIFs. Backward compatibility with non-animated PNG files is also maintained.</p>
<p>Because the initial frame of an APNG file saves as a regular PNG stream, it can display by most conventional PNG decoders. Extra chunks can hold frame speed data and different animation frames (as provided by the original PNG specification).</p>
<p>Is APNG superior to GIF? APNG files are smaller and have more outstanding quality than GIF files. However, GIF is more compatible than APNG. Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome, and Opera support APNG, while practically all online browsers support GIF.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Choose Files</p>
<p>Select several files on your computer using the “Choose Files” button or the dropdown menu to select an online file from a URL, Google Drive, or Dropbox. The file size of an image can be up to 200 megabytes. You can use a file analyzer to gain detailed information about a source image, including its size, resolution, quality, and transparent color.</p>

                      alt="Choose file"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Choose Image Format</p>
<p>Determine the image format, quality, and size you want to use. You choose to use the original image size or select “Change width and height” and enter a custom image size. 1920x1080 is an example of a [width]x[height] format. Only a few image formats support the picture quality choice, such as JPG, WEBP, or AVIF. The value ranges from 1 (lowest picture quality and highest compression) to 100 (highest image quality and lowest compression) (best quality but least effective compression). If this field is left blank, the converter will use the estimated quality of your input image if found; otherwise, 92 by default. JPG, PNG, TIFF, GIF, HEIC, BMP, PS, PSD, WEBP, TGA, DDS, EXR, J2K, PNM, or SVG are examples of target image formats.</p>

What Is APNG (Animated Portable Network Graphics )"></a>1. What Is APNG (Animated Portable Network Graphics )</h3><p>The .apng (Animated Portable Network Graphics) extension is an unofficial extension to the Portable Network Graphics format (PNG ). It is a series of frames (a PNG image) that represent an animation sequence, producing a visual effect comparable to a GIF. APNG files support 24-bit pictures with 8-bit transparency. You can convert non-animated GIF files to APNG format. APNG files have the same.png extension as PNG files and can be opened by software like Mozilla Firefox, Chrome with APNG compatibility, and iOS 10’s iMessage apps.</p>

                      alt="Select image"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Click Open</strong></p>
<p>Click “Open” when you’ve navigated to your picture.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Go to Save As</strong></p>
<p>After you’ve opened the file, go to File &gt; Save As.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Save</strong></p>
<p>Make sure PNG is selected from the drop-down list of formats in the following box, then click “Save.”</p>

<p>The compression rate is set to “Best” by default, but the Save Options box contains a few extras to check if you want a bit more control over the compression of your file.

<p><strong>Step 1: Open Paint</strong></p>
<p>Open an image-editing program on your computer, such as Paint for Windows or Paintbrush for Mac. Simply double-click the software’s icon on your desktop, or choose it from your applications list.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Go to saved Images</strong></p>
<p>Open the image you already saved. Navigate to the window where you saved the image. Click-hold it, drag it, and drop it onto the editor to display the image.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Resize Image</strong></p>
<p>Make changes to the image. You can resize or rescale the image before saving it as a PNG file, and you can even add text using your software’s Text tool. This is, however, wholly optional.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Choose Save as</strong></p>
<p>PNG is the top format for saving images. Choose “Save as” from the “File” menu in the editor’s upper left corner.</p>
<p>In the File Name window, provide the name you want for the file.</p>
<p>Under the File Name field, click the “Save as type” drop-down option to see all of the image’s possible formats.</p>
<p>Click “Save” after selecting “PNG.” The file will be saved as a PNG file in the same directory as the original.</p>

<p>The GIF image format is a bitmap image format that supports up to 8 bits per pixel. APNG (Animated Portable Network Graphics) is a format for animated images that supports 24 bits per pixel and 8 bits of transparency, which is not available in GIFs. Backward compatibility with non-animated PNG files is also maintained.</p>
<p>Because the initial frame of an APNG file saves as a regular PNG stream, it can display by most conventional PNG decoders. Extra chunks can hold frame speed data and different animation frames (as provided by the original PNG specification).</p>
<p>Is APNG superior to GIF? APNG files are smaller and have more outstanding quality than GIF files. However, GIF is more compatible than APNG. Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome, and Opera support APNG, while practically all online browsers support GIF.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Choose Files</p>
<p>Select several files on your computer using the “Choose Files” button or the dropdown menu to select an online file from a URL, Google Drive, or Dropbox. The file size of an image can be up to 200 megabytes. You can use a file analyzer to gain detailed information about a source image, including its size, resolution, quality, and transparent color.</p>

                      alt="Choose file"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Choose Image Format</p>
<p>Determine the image format, quality, and size you want to use. You choose to use the original image size or select “Change width and height” and enter a custom image size. 1920x1080 is an example of a [width]x[height] format. Only a few image formats support the picture quality choice, such as JPG, WEBP, or AVIF. The value ranges from 1 (lowest picture quality and highest compression) to 100 (highest image quality and lowest compression) (best quality but least effective compression). If this field is left blank, the converter will use the estimated quality of your input image if found; otherwise, 92 by default. JPG, PNG, TIFF, GIF, HEIC, BMP, PS, PSD, WEBP, TGA, DDS, EXR, J2K, PNM, or SVG are examples of target image formats.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Click on Convert Now</p>
<p>Click the “Convert Now” option to begin the batch conversion. If one server fails, it will automatically attempt another; please be patient while converting. The resultant files will be in the “Conversion Results” section. Click the icon to display the QR code for the file or save it to an online storage like Google Drive or Dropbox.</p>

FAQ</h2><h3 id="1-What-Is-APNG-Animated-Portable-Network-Graphics-3"><a href="#1-What-Is-APNG-Animated-Portable-Network-Graphics-3" class="headerlink" title="1. What Is APNG (Animated Portable Network Graphics )"></a>1. What Is APNG (Animated Portable Network Graphics )</h3><p>The .apng (Animated Portable Network Graphics) extension is an unofficial extension to the Portable Network Graphics format (PNG ). It is a series of frames (a PNG image) that represent an animation sequence, producing a visual effect comparable to a GIF. APNG files support 24-bit pictures with 8-bit transparency. You can convert non-animated GIF files to APNG format. APNG files have the same.png extension as PNG files and can be opened by software like Mozilla Firefox, Chrome with APNG compatibility, and iOS 10’s iMessage apps.</p>

<p>Click File &gt; Open to bring up the photo you wish to convert to PNG.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/2018-08-16_11h20_31.png?trim=1,1&bg-color=000&pad=1,1"
                      alt="Select image"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Click Open</strong></p>
<p>Click “Open” when you’ve navigated to your picture.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/2018-08-16_11h21_15.png?trim=1,1&bg-color=000&pad=1,1"
                      alt="Click Open"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Go to Save As</strong></p>
<p>After you’ve opened the file, go to File &gt; Save As.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Go to Save As"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Save</strong></p>

                      alt="Save "
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Compress</strong></p>
<p>The compression rate is set to “Best” by default, but the Save Options box contains a few extras to check if you want a bit more control over the compression of your file. The file size will be determined by changing the compression rate; the higher the value, the less compression will be utilized when saving your image.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Open Paint</strong></p>
<p>Open an image-editing program on your computer, such as Paint for Windows or Paintbrush for Mac. Simply double-click the software’s icon on your desktop, or choose it from your applications list.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Go to saved Images</strong></p>
<p>Open the image you already saved. Navigate to the window where you saved the image. Click-hold it, drag it, and drop it onto the editor to display the image.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Resize Image</strong></p>
<p>Make changes to the image. You can resize or rescale the image before saving it as a PNG file, and you can even add text using your software’s Text tool. This is, however, wholly optional.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Choose Save as</strong></p>
<p>PNG is the top format for saving images. Choose “Save as” from the “File” menu in the editor’s upper left corner.</p>
<p>In the File Name window, provide the name you want for the file.</p>
<p>Under the File Name field, click the “Save as type” drop-down option to see all of the image’s possible formats.</p>
<p>Click “Save” after selecting “PNG.” The file will be saved as a PNG file in the same directory as the original.</p>
