The VHS format is a consumer-level analog video cassette recording standard for videotaping. The acronym VHS referred to Vertical Helical Scan and was eventually modified as the popularity of this technology increased.</p>
<p>Produced by a Japan Victor Company, the technology uses a magnetic tape measuring half an inch. By the 1950s, magnetic tape video recording had become a vital part of the television industry. The technology is exclusively utilized in professional settings like TV studios and medical imaging (fluoroscopy).</p>
<p>As consumer access to videotape increased in the 1970s, a new economy centered on home video emerged, drastically altering the economics of the film and television industries. By 1980, VHS had captured 70% of the market and had established itself as the industry standard for entertainment and instruction.</p>
<p>The original standard has a picture quality equivalent to that of analog television. High-definition television content could be recorded and re-created using digital VHS (D-VHS). Progressively, a new format was launched dubbed S-VHS (Super VHS), which featured improved video quality from 240 to 400 lines; however, people did not use it extensively.</p>
<p>VHS tape, compared to its competition at the time, Betamax tapes had longer tape lifespans. VHS tapes were preferred because they recorded three times as long as Betamax tapes because of their higher storage capacity.</p>
<p>The last VHS recorder manufacturer, Funai Electric of Japan, discontinued manufacturing in 2016 after the introduction of DVDs into the market.</p>

Here are some main components:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Learning purpose</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A detailed description of communication</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Informatory Strategies to teach the learners</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Format should be perfect according to the topic</p>

<h3 id="03Why-do-you-need-a-Storyboard"><a href="#03Why-do-you-need-a-Storyboard" class="headerlink" title="03Why do you need a Storyboard?"></a>03Why do you need a Storyboard?</h3><p>A Storyboard is a process of pre- production. It lets you know how your story is going to flow. You will get to know the mistakes in the early stages if you make a storyboard and this will help you to save your money and time. Here are some essentials because of which you need to have a storyboard.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Is this concept is going to work? -</strong> A storyboard lets you know whether the concept is going to work out or not. A storyboard helps the client to confirm whether the concept will work or not.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Arranging Shots -</strong> A Storyboard lets you to tell you story in a limited time frame in the best way. In commercials we don’t have much time. It is like you have 60 seconds, 30 seconds, or sometimes it is just 15 seconds. So, it is the best way to make every shot count.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Saving Money -</strong> Before making the final product, it is better to have an accepted storyboard from your client. In complex animations, it takes a lot of time and money so it is better to have an approved storyboard. This will let you know how the final product would look like. This will let the client know what is on your mind.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Recognizing the mistakes -</strong> On a storyboarding phase, you can recognize the mistakes related to the media, narration or any other details. This will save your energy, time and money and then you will be ready for the production phase.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Agreement with punch lines and dialogues -</strong> When you are creating a storyboard you can check whether the dialogues and punch lines work together as you have planned before. It is very important to check that the dialogues and punches are delivered in the exact way that you have imagined.</p>
<h3 id="04How-to-Label-Storyboards"><a href="#04How-to-Label-Storyboards" class="headerlink" title="04How to Label Storyboards?"></a>04How to Label Storyboards?</h3><p>If you are using numerous storyboards for the same shot, keeping the shots labeled is important so that everything is arranged in an order and your team can stay focused and organized. If you will use any software it will name the panel numbers automatically. In case you are not using any software and your client wants to delete, add or move a panel then you can’t name that panel.</p>
<p>For example: Panel_7_New_New_New. It will be very difficult to figure out and also time consuming. The correct way to do is this: Project name_ Script#_Scene_Frame_01.JPG</p>
<h3 id="05Do-Storyboards-have-Dialogues"><a href="#05Do-Storyboards-have-Dialogues" class="headerlink" title="05Do Storyboards have Dialogues?"></a>05Do Storyboards have Dialogues?</h3><p>Storyboards have dialogues and you can include dialogues which will flow underneath the panels for each and every scene. If you want, you can save it on your drawing. You can name the angles and just specify them “OTS 1” and “OTS 2” with the corresponding dialogues.</p>

It lets you know how your story is going to flow. You will get to know the mistakes in the early stages if you make a storyboard and this will help you to save your money and time. Here are some essentials because of which you need to have a storyboard.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Is this concept is going to work? -</strong> A storyboard lets you know whether the concept is going to work out or not. A storyboard helps the client to confirm whether the concept will work or not.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Arranging Shots -</strong> A Storyboard lets you to tell you story in a limited time frame in the best way. In commercials we don’t have much time. It is like you have 60 seconds, 30 seconds, or sometimes it is just 15 seconds. So, it is the best way to make every shot count.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Saving Money -</strong> Before making the final product, it is better to have an accepted storyboard from your client. In complex animations, it takes a lot of time and money so it is better to have an approved storyboard. This will let you know how the final product would look like. This will let the client know what is on your mind.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Recognizing the mistakes -</strong> On a storyboarding phase, you can recognize the mistakes related to the media, narration or any other details. This will save your energy, time and money and then you will be ready for the production phase.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Agreement with punch lines and dialogues -</strong> When you are creating a storyboard you can check whether the dialogues and punch lines work together as you have planned before. It is very important to check that the dialogues and punches are delivered in the exact way that you have imagined.</p>
<h3 id="04How-to-Label-Storyboards-1"><a href="#04How-to-Label-Storyboards-1" class="headerlink" title="04How to Label Storyboards?"></a>04How to Label Storyboards?</h3><p>If you are using numerous storyboards for the same shot, keeping the shots labeled is important so that everything is arranged in an order and your team can stay focused and organized. If you will use any software it will name the panel numbers automatically. In case you are not using any software and your client wants to delete, add or move a panel then you can’t name that panel.</p>
<p>For example: Panel_7_New_New_New. It will be very difficult to figure out and also time consuming. The correct way to do is this: Project name_ Script#_Scene_Frame_01.JPG</p>
<h3 id="05Do-Storyboards-have-Dialogues-1"><a href="#05Do-Storyboards-have-Dialogues-1" class="headerlink" title="05Do Storyboards have Dialogues?"></a>05Do Storyboards have Dialogues?</h3><p>Storyboards have dialogues and you can include dialogues which will flow underneath the panels for each and every scene.

It lets you know how your story is going to flow. You will get to know the mistakes in the early stages if you make a storyboard and this will help you to save your money and time. Here are some essentials because of which you need to have a storyboard.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Is this concept is going to work? -</strong> A storyboard lets you know whether the concept is going to work out or not. A storyboard helps the client to confirm whether the concept will work or not.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Arranging Shots -</strong> A Storyboard lets you to tell you story in a limited time frame in the best way. In commercials we don’t have much time. It is like you have 60 seconds, 30 seconds, or sometimes it is just 15 seconds. So, it is the best way to make every shot count.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Saving Money -</strong> Before making the final product, it is better to have an accepted storyboard from your client. In complex animations, it takes a lot of time and money so it is better to have an approved storyboard. This will let you know how the final product would look like. This will let the client know what is on your mind.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Recognizing the mistakes -</strong> On a storyboarding phase, you can recognize the mistakes related to the media, narration or any other details. This will save your energy, time and money and then you will be ready for the production phase.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Agreement with punch lines and dialogues -</strong> When you are creating a storyboard you can check whether the dialogues and punch lines work together as you have planned before. It is very important to check that the dialogues and punches are delivered in the exact way that you have imagined.</p>

If you will use any software it will name the panel numbers automatically. In case you are not using any software and your client wants to delete, add or move a panel then you can’t name that panel.</p>
<p>For example: Panel_7_New_New_New. It will be very difficult to figure out and also time consuming. The correct way to do is this: Project name_ Script#_Scene_Frame_01.JPG</p>
<h3 id="05Do-Storyboards-have-Dialogues-2"><a href="#05Do-Storyboards-have-Dialogues-2" class="headerlink" title="05Do Storyboards have Dialogues?"></a>05Do Storyboards have Dialogues?</h3><p>Storyboards have dialogues and you can include dialogues which will flow underneath the panels for each and every scene.

It lets you know how your story is going to flow. You will get to know the mistakes in the early stages if you make a storyboard and this will help you to save your money and time. Here are some essentials because of which you need to have a storyboard.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Is this concept is going to work? -</strong> A storyboard lets you know whether the concept is going to work out or not. A storyboard helps the client to confirm whether the concept will work or not.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Arranging Shots -</strong> A Storyboard lets you to tell you story in a limited time frame in the best way. In commercials we don’t have much time. It is like you have 60 seconds, 30 seconds, or sometimes it is just 15 seconds. So, it is the best way to make every shot count.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Saving Money -</strong> Before making the final product, it is better to have an accepted storyboard from your client. In complex animations, it takes a lot of time and money so it is better to have an approved storyboard. This will let you know how the final product would look like. This will let the client know what is on your mind.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Recognizing the mistakes -</strong> On a storyboarding phase, you can recognize the mistakes related to the media, narration or any other details. This will save your energy, time and money and then you will be ready for the production phase.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Agreement with punch lines and dialogues -</strong> When you are creating a storyboard you can check whether the dialogues and punch lines work together as you have planned before. It is very important to check that the dialogues and punches are delivered in the exact way that you have imagined.</p>

If you will use any software it will name the panel numbers automatically. In case you are not using any software and your client wants to delete, add or move a panel then you can’t name that panel.</p>
<p>For example: Panel_7_New_New_New. It will be very difficult to figure out and also time consuming. The correct way to do is this: Project name_ Script#_Scene_Frame_01.JPG</p>
<h3 id="05Do-Storyboards-have-Dialogues-3"><a href="#05Do-Storyboards-have-Dialogues-3" class="headerlink" title="05Do Storyboards have Dialogues?"></a>05Do Storyboards have Dialogues?</h3><p>Storyboards have dialogues and you can include dialogues which will flow underneath the panels for each and every scene.

It allows us to quickly assess video data by detecting objects, behaviors, people, and vehicles of concern.</p>
<p>In today’s world, we all look at video as a piece of critical evidence used in different situations such as security investigations and law enforcement because it holds a lot of valuable data. In addition, video is seen as a very unclear format lacking context, scheme, and structure, making it hard to deal with. But with the use of AI in machines, you can effectively handle data with video recognition.</p>
<p>Also, video recognition is not the same as facial or image recognition, regardless of its name, even though they are interrelated. Video recognition is referred to as video content analysis or intelligent video analytics because it entails many tasks. Thus, AI is used in video recognition to rapidly reduce the time for research from weeks or months to seconds and process mass video data.</p>
<p>Video recognition employs AI to complete the tasks by applying enhanced deep learning (DL) and computer vision (CV) models to live video streams or recorded video footage. The following are the most common ways <strong>AI video recognition</strong> works:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Classification of Image: It allows the selection of the right category for a video</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Localization: It helps to locate a target object in the video</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Detection of Object: Categorize and locate the object in the video</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Identification of Object: Instances of the object of interest</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Tracking of Object: It can track the object’s trajectory, which will change in the video.</p>

It is the ability to use Artificial Intelligence to quickly process mass video data and reduce the required time for analysis.</p>
<p>Alternatively, facial recognition describes a biometric technology beyond recognizing when a human face is present (Facial detection). Facial recognition attempts to establish the owner of a particular face. AI Facial recognition works by quickly utilizing a computer application that captures an individual’s face’s digital image, sometimes taken from a video frame, and compares it to images stored in the database records.</p>

<p>Alternatively, facial recognition describes a biometric technology beyond recognizing when a human face is present (Facial detection). Facial recognition attempts to establish the owner of a particular face. AI Facial recognition works by quickly utilizing a computer application that captures an individual’s face’s digital image, sometimes taken from a video frame, and compares it to images stored in the database records.</p>

It allows us to quickly assess video data by detecting objects, behaviors, people, and vehicles of concern.</p>
<p>In today’s world, we all look at video as a piece of critical evidence used in different situations such as security investigations and law enforcement because it holds a lot of valuable data. In addition, video is seen as a very unclear format lacking context, scheme, and structure, making it hard to deal with. But with the use of AI in machines, you can effectively handle data with video recognition.</p>
<p>Also, video recognition is not the same as facial or image recognition, regardless of its name, even though they are interrelated. Video recognition is referred to as video content analysis or intelligent video analytics because it entails many tasks. Thus, AI is used in video recognition to rapidly reduce the time for research from weeks or months to seconds and process mass video data.</p>
<p>Video recognition employs AI to complete the tasks by applying enhanced deep learning (DL) and computer vision (CV) models to live video streams or recorded video footage. The following are the most common ways <strong>AI video recognition</strong> works:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Classification of Image: It allows the selection of the right category for a video</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Localization: It helps to locate a target object in the video</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Detection of Object: Categorize and locate the object in the video</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Identification of Object: Instances of the object of interest</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Tracking of Object: It can track the object’s trajectory, which will change in the video.</p>

<p>AI software can develop and build an intelligent application from the beginning with the help of deep learning capabilities and Machine learning. In addition, <strong>video recognition AI is the machine’s capacity to analyze, obtain, and process information that it receives from a visual source, specifically video. The video recognition systems help computers comprehend the information received in the large volumes of video feeds, frame by frame.</strong></p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-AI-Video-Recognition-and-How-Does-Video-Recognition-Work-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-AI-Video-Recognition-and-How-Does-Video-Recognition-Work-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is AI Video Recognition and How Does Video Recognition Work?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What is AI Video Recognition and How Does Video Recognition Work?</strong></h2><p><strong>AI Video Recognition</strong> is the capability of machines to obtain, analyze, and process information received from videos. It allows us to quickly assess video data by detecting objects, behaviors, people, and vehicles of concern.</p>
<p>In today’s world, we all look at video as a piece of critical evidence used in different situations such as security investigations and law enforcement because it holds a lot of valuable data. In addition, video is seen as a very unclear format lacking context, scheme, and structure, making it hard to deal with. But with the use of AI in machines, you can effectively handle data with video recognition.</p>
<p>Also, video recognition is not the same as facial or image recognition, regardless of its name, even though they are interrelated. Video recognition is referred to as video content analysis or intelligent video analytics because it entails many tasks. Thus, AI is used in video recognition to rapidly reduce the time for research from weeks or months to seconds and process mass video data.</p>
<p>Video recognition employs AI to complete the tasks by applying enhanced deep learning (DL) and computer vision (CV) models to live video streams or recorded video footage. The following are the most common ways <strong>AI video recognition</strong> works:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Classification of Image: It allows the selection of the right category for a video</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Localization: It helps to locate a target object in the video</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Detection of Object: Categorize and locate the object in the video</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Identification of Object: Instances of the object of interest</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Tracking of Object: It can track the object’s trajectory, which will change in the video.</p>

It is the ability to use Artificial Intelligence to quickly process mass video data and reduce the required time for analysis.</p>
<p>Alternatively, facial recognition describes a biometric technology beyond recognizing when a human face is present (Facial detection). Facial recognition attempts to establish the owner of a particular face. AI Facial recognition works by quickly utilizing a computer application that captures an individual’s face’s digital image, sometimes taken from a video frame, and compares it to images stored in the database records.</p>
