<p>When recording audio, there are numerous factors to consider. Some spaces can generate more reverb than others, like a cluttered echo effect due to various factors, including reflective surfaces, distant objects, and large, cavernous spaces. This will allow you to <strong>remove echo auditions</strong> for use in podcasts, movies, and musical compositions.</p>

Whether rogue hosts or instruments, Adobe Audition has a solution to help you regain control and make your audio sound great. We’ll demonstrate how to eliminate echo in Adobe Audition in this tutorial. <strong>Adobe Auditions can reduce echo</strong> from your video files in a few steps. Want to learn how?</p>
<p>Well, here are the five prime steps.</p>
<h5 id="Step1-Pick-Audio"><a href="#Step1-Pick-Audio" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Pick Audio"></a>Step1 Pick Audio</h5><p>Load the project you are currently working on in Audition, and then choose the audio file with the echo that needs removal. Choose a segment of the waveform that is relatively quiet to eliminate some of the ambient noise that your camera or another nearby device may have caused.</p>
<p>Select “Capture Noise Print” from the contextual menu visible when you right-click on the portion. This will assist the Audition in differentiating the primary audio from any background noise.</p>
<h5 id="Step2-Begin-Noise-Removal"><a href="#Step2-Begin-Noise-Removal" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Begin Noise Removal"></a>Step2 Begin Noise Removal</h5><p>Select the noise that you want to get rid of, and then go to “Effects” &gt; “Noise Reduction &#x2F; Restoration” &gt; “Noise Reduction (process).” After selecting “Select Entire File,” play your audio file again to see whether the background noise got eliminated.</p>
<p>You may also make the gating effect more noticeable by going to the Advanced tab and lowering the Spectral Decay Rate. When satisfied with the adjustments, you may make them permanent by clicking the “Apply” button.</p>

                      alt="noise reduction and restoration adobe audition"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step3-Add-Effects"><a href="#Step3-Add-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Add Effects"></a>Step3 Add Effects</h5><p>Next, choose “Dynamics Processing” from the “Effects” menu after clicking on “Amplitude and Compression.”</p>
<p>This will load an effect like compression, which you can then utilize to modify the waveform. You should be able to see a diagonal line that extends from one side of the Dynamics Processing display to the other when you first launch the program. It will affect the echo if you drag on this line so tiny that it bends below the default route. You will need to experiment with the line’s location and compare the new audio to the old one until you get a satisfactory result.</p>
<h5 id="Step4-Apply-Effect"><a href="#Step4-Apply-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Apply Effect"></a>Step4 Apply Effect</h5><p>After adjusting the Dynamics Processing settings to your satisfaction, ensure that your complete waveform is chosen before clicking the OK button to apply the effect.</p>
<p>Your audio’s amplitude, or loudness, will reduce as a result; however, you may restore the original level by selecting “Effects” &gt; “Amplitude and Compression” &gt; “Normalize” from the menu bar.</p>

<p>Select “Effects” followed by “Filter and EQ” and then “Parametric Equalizer” from the menu. You will get access to seven primary frequency bands to work with by default and a low-pass and high-pass band devoted to their respective functions. We need a few bands to eliminate those undesirable frequencies in the middle.</p>
<p>When you hear a harsh sound, start by amplifying one band (and the Q value of that band), then gently proceed across the frequency range until you reach the next band. After that, bring the band below 0 dB so that it may remove some of the roughness.</p>

<p>So, here are a few recording tips.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Keep things quiet</strong>. When recording audio, pay more attention to the peaceful sounds in the background. There may be humming from machines with fans, buzzing from lights, or jingling from your pet’s collar. Pay attention to where you are recording and find ways to shut down anything else.</li>
<li><strong>Put your mobile phone in airplane mode</strong>. Phones send out signals when they receive calls or do searches in the background that the recording system can pick up. By putting your phones in “airplane mode,” you can stop them from making noises during good takes.</li>
<li><strong>Minimize echo</strong>. Set up your recording space, so your voice stays on the walls only a little and back to your microphone. Use things that soak up the sound instead of reflecting it, like a thick rug or a comforter. You can make your voice echo in post-production if you want it to.</li>
<li><strong>Upgrade your microphone</strong>. The hardware you use will be the most significant limit to what you can record. You can improve your recordings by plugging an external microphone into the microphone jack on your camera or with a professional microphone to record the sound separately.</li>
<li><strong>Adjust your levels</strong>. Before you hit the record button, check to see how loud the sound you want to record is. Adjust your levels (the sensitivity of your microphone) until the sound is between -6 DBS and -12 DBS. This range allows your sound room’s source to get louder without the recorded sound getting cut off. Don’t worry because you can always increase the editing volume.</li>
<li><strong>Start with a sound cue</strong>. If you’re recording separate audio that you’ll later sync to your video, start your recording with a short, loud sound like a clap or a high-pitched “beep.” Later, while editing, finding the part where your video and the additional audio match will be much easier.</li>
<li><strong>Move toward the sound</strong>. Move your microphone close to the sound you want to record. The closer your microphone is to the sound source, the lower you can set your microphone’s sensitivity. If you turn down your levels, sounds you don’t want to record will also sound less loud.</li>

<p><strong>Why does editing take so much time and what to do for that?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Too many choices.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>It completely depends upon how many choices you are giving yourself while editing a video. It takes time to make choices. For example, if your friend asks you to buy a card (any card) from the store. You go into the store and start searching cards from more than 50000 cards, it takes time. On the other hand, if your friend asks you to buy a card for his uncle’s pet dog. This time it becomes easier for you to go straight and choose from the pet cards without moving around the birthday and anniversary cards.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Amount of footage.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>It depends upon how much footage you have on your edit and what kind of content you are editing. Some of the content is really complex and takes a lot of time like V-logging but at the same time, you may have content that requires very less edit or zero edit.</p>
<p>The video editing will become a slit and a quick process for you compared to what it was a few years back. But there are a few key things that really speed up the editing process.</p>
<p>I am going to discuss from beginning to end how to edit a video.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Outline</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You should take a paper and write down what you are going to say about your video. It would make your editing easy because you have already structured your content.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Avoid distractions</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>While editing you make a <strong>flow state</strong> in which the editing process becomes easier. But when you got distracted it takes a lot of time to get back to that flow state.</p>
<ul>
<li>My <strong>kids</strong> are my big distraction so, I usually start my editing process after they go to bed. (You can set yours).</li>
<li>Keep your <strong>phone</strong> away because it is another distraction that consumes most of your time.</li>
<li>Don’t keep <strong>re-watching</strong> your video all the time. Usually, people edit the first clip and before starting to edit the second clip they watch the first clip. After that, they edit the second clip and then re-watch the first and the second clip. It is also wasting a lot of your time. Do it at the end.</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s why the Davinci Resolve has got its name as a <strong>finishing application</strong> of movies. People come in and color grade their videos. As it is a very powerful software hence if you are working with an old computer and that’s not really a powerful computer, the Davinci Resolve would not be going to work properly for you.</p>
<p>It completely depends upon how many choices you are giving yourself while editing a video. It takes time to make choices. For example, if your friend asks you to buy a card (any card) from the store. You go into the store and start searching cards from more than 50000 cards, it takes time. On the other hand, if your friend asks you to buy a card for his uncle’s pet dog. This time it becomes easier for you to go straight and choose from the pet cards without moving around the birthday and anniversary cards.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Amount of footage.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>It depends upon how much footage you have on your edit and what kind of content you are editing. Some of the content is really complex and takes a lot of time like V-logging but at the same time, you may have content that requires very less edit or zero edit.</p>
<p>The video editing will become a slit and a quick process for you compared to what it was a few years back. But there are a few key things that really speed up the editing process.</p>
<p>I am going to discuss from beginning to end how to edit a video.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Outline</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You should take a paper and write down what you are going to say about your video. It would make your editing easy because you have already structured your content.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Avoid distractions</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>While editing you make a <strong>flow state</strong> in which the editing process becomes easier. But when you got distracted it takes a lot of time to get back to that flow state.</p>
<ul>
<li>My <strong>kids</strong> are my big distraction so, I usually start my editing process after they go to bed. (You can set yours).</li>
<li>Keep your <strong>phone</strong> away because it is another distraction that consumes most of your time.</li>
<li>Don’t keep <strong>re-watching</strong> your video all the time. Usually, people edit the first clip and before starting to edit the second clip they watch the first clip. After that, they edit the second clip and then re-watch the first and the second clip. It is also wasting a lot of your time. Do it at the end.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is an important feature you should know.</p>
<ul>
<li>Select the video and hit the <strong>speed</strong></li>
<li>You can select <strong>slow, fast, normal,</strong> and the most interesting one is <strong>speed ramping.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Speed ramping</strong> allows you to set automatically made patterns to slow down then fast again slow. It will create a cinematic effect in the video. But this feature is only for paid users.</li>

<p>The video editing will become a slit and a quick process for you compared to what it was a few years back. But there are a few key things that really speed up the editing process.</p>
<p>I am going to discuss from beginning to end how to edit a video.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Outline</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You should take a paper and write down what you are going to say about your video. It would make your editing easy because you have already structured your content.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Avoid distractions</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>While editing you make a <strong>flow state</strong> in which the editing process becomes easier. But when you got distracted it takes a lot of time to get back to that flow state.</p>
<ul>
<li>My <strong>kids</strong> are my big distraction so, I usually start my editing process after they go to bed. (You can set yours).</li>
<li>Keep your <strong>phone</strong> away because it is another distraction that consumes most of your time.</li>
<li>Don’t keep <strong>re-watching</strong> your video all the time. Usually, people edit the first clip and before starting to edit the second clip they watch the first clip. After that, they edit the second clip and then re-watch the first and the second clip. It is also wasting a lot of your time. Do it at the end.</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s why the Davinci Resolve has got its name as a <strong>finishing application</strong> of movies. People come in and color grade their videos. As it is a very powerful software hence if you are working with an old computer and that’s not really a powerful computer, the Davinci Resolve would not be going to work properly for you.</p>
<p>It completely depends upon how many choices you are giving yourself while editing a video. It takes time to make choices. For example, if your friend asks you to buy a card (any card) from the store. You go into the store and start searching cards from more than 50000 cards, it takes time. On the other hand, if your friend asks you to buy a card for his uncle’s pet dog. This time it becomes easier for you to go straight and choose from the pet cards without moving around the birthday and anniversary cards.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Amount of footage.</strong></li>

<p>It depends upon how much footage you have on your edit and what kind of content you are editing. Some of the content is really complex and takes a lot of time like V-logging but at the same time, you may have content that requires very less edit or zero edit.</p>

<p>Let me know in the comments about your thoughts on these tools. You could also make your own pros and cons of these mp4 video croppers.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Capable of cropping various types of videos including MP4, WebM, AVI and many more. This means that it can also output different formats and encoding. This article may seem to focus on mp4 format but if in the future that you would need a different format then this may come in handy.</li>
<li>The power to set the cropping size and ratio more effectively. There are also presets available to help you transform it into video square, 4:3, 16:9, 3:2 and many more. Having a cropping area that you can easily adjust is such a helpful feature.</li>
<li>It shows the display configuration info for imported mp4 video files.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The maximum file size is only 100 mb (megabyte). Which means that you have to consider if your mp4 video file would not exceed this limit. A disadvantage indeed especially for those who have a video recorder that saves it in high quality. There is also a fear that the user would be hassled by trimming longer videos into shorter clips just to meet this requirement.</li>
<li>The video preview is not the same as the final output. The quality in the preview may be shown as having a much lower quality.</li>
<li>Other video file formats may not play due to incompatibility. This may be a huge disadvantage especially if you’re looking for efficiency in getting stuff done.</li>

<h2 id="Top-5-Best-Video-to-PPT-Converters"><a href="#Top-5-Best-Video-to-PPT-Converters" class="headerlink" title="Top 5 Best Video to PPT Converters"></a>Top 5 Best Video to PPT Converters</h2><p>Almost three decades after its debut, Microsoft PowerPoint has become a hallmark of professionalism and quality in the presentation software industry. Traditional PPT files produced by PowerPoint have many drawbacks, including the fact that the content of your presentations may be readily edited and reused by others.</p>
<p>The Save to Video option in 2010 and subsequent versions of PowerPoint addresses this problem by allowing users to produce video files that may be readily shared on social media, video sharing sites, or utilized in eLearning courses. The built-in PPT file conversion function in newer versions of PowerPoint has several restrictions that prohibit you from picking the video file type or incorporating embedded media files in the PowerPoint presentation video.</p>
<p>That’s why we’ve compiled a list of the top five video to ppt converter to make the process of turning a PowerPoint presentation into a movie as simple and enjoyable as possible.</p>
