As Well Framing and Lighting of the Setup Are Illustrated in This Article</h2><p>To visually represent the story in the music video, cinematography shots are helpful. It’ll obviously and pleasing and eye-catchy effect in your video. These major requirements for making that cinematography can be covered as the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Light a subject</li>
<li>Create atmosphere</li>
<li>Light a set</li>
<li>Camera techniques</li>
<li>Aspect ratio</li>
<li>Framing</li>
<li>Camera movement</li>
</ol>
<p>Before, we go deeper to the details on how to make a cinematography for music, let us know first about the cinematography for music video. Everything is represented in this article, from the camera movement to the setting of the lights in the studio. You will also learn about aspect ratio and framing while making shots from the DSLR.</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-Cinematography"><a href="#What-Is-Cinematography" class="headerlink" title="What Is Cinematography?"></a>What Is Cinematography?</h2><p>Cinematography covers all aspects of how a movie or music video is made, including choosing the lighting for the scene. The type of camera equipment to use, how to frame your photographs, and how to decide on camera movement are also included in this. Let’s move toward the next lines to get the cool cinematography on display.</p>
<h2 id="Light-a-subject"><a href="#Light-a-subject" class="headerlink" title="Light a subject"></a>Light a subject</h2><p>Although you may assume that cinematography is just concerned with the usage of the camera, lighting plays an equally important role. While planning your photographs, you should think about how the scene is lit and how your subject is illuminated.</p>

                ></p>
<p>The cinematographer should consider the hard and soft lights for perfect illustrations during shooting. These are depicted with the following requirements!</p>
<h3 id="Hard-light-and-soft-light"><a href="#Hard-light-and-soft-light" class="headerlink" title="Hard light and soft light"></a>Hard light and soft light</h3><p>The cinematographers mainly focus on the hard and soft lights during filmmaking. The <strong>hard lights</strong> give a softer look to the subject. They are pointing to the light sources which are closer to the subject in the video. It makes the photographs and shots harsher and more dramatic.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="hard light on the subject"
                ></p>
<p>The <strong>soft light</strong> is trying to wrap around the subject. It gives diffused shadows and soft edges to the character of the music video.</p>

                      alt="note"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> To get better results of the soft look, you need to add diffusion to lower the intensity.</p>
<h2 id="Create-Atmosphere"><a href="#Create-Atmosphere" class="headerlink" title="Create Atmosphere"></a>Create Atmosphere</h2><p>You need a haze machine to create the atmosphere and give the environment true vibes. The haze machine gives a foggy appearance in every shoot and scene.</p>

<h2 id="Light-a-Set"><a href="#Light-a-Set" class="headerlink" title="Light a Set"></a>Light a Set</h2><p>To give proper lights in the set is illustrated with the help of an example as shown below!</p>
<h3 id="Examples"><a href="#Examples" class="headerlink" title="Examples"></a>Examples</h3><p>In this music video of the 3lau’s, the main prop used is a bus, which is presented in the middle of the set and lit very well. The bus is rounded by many tungsten lights, which give a resemblance to those street lights. They are set up automatically in such a way that this stimulates the real movement of the bus on the road.</p>

                ></p>
<p>The three projectors are set to give the street footage at the back scene to add more realism.</p>
<p>The three lights are set in the queue by the production team to get the memory of the protagonist. In the setup, soft lights are also added on top of all the upper windows of the bus to give blue interior light to the bus.</p>
<h2 id="Camera-Techniques"><a href="#Camera-Techniques" class="headerlink" title="Camera Techniques"></a>Camera Techniques</h2><p>The cameras used during filming play a major role in giving the cinematographic shots. All the techniques shown below are applied to the DSLRs and even the smartphones you use for filming.</p>
<h3 id="Prime-lenses"><a href="#Prime-lenses" class="headerlink" title="Prime lenses"></a>Prime lenses</h3><p>The foremost and most helpful lenses in filming are called prime lenses, which have fixed focal lengths. There is no Johns to zoom out and zoom-in in prime lenses.</p>
<p>For filming, we need to choose the right level of zoom, which the DP does by picking the right lens for the footage.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>In the close-up scenes, there is a requirement for a wider field of view which also depends on the aspect ratio of shooting.</p>
<h2 id="Aspect-Ratio"><a href="#Aspect-Ratio" class="headerlink" title="Aspect Ratio"></a>Aspect Ratio</h2><p>In filmy view, the most appropriate aspect ratio is 2.35, which is also a cinematic ratio. There is also another ratio of 16:9, which is a wider ratio. While 2.35 gives a more narrow perspective as compared to the prior one.</p>

<p>Whenever we use a microscope, we are dealing with the aspect ratio and narrowing down to the required point where we want to look, and this is all about framing, which is discussed as shown below!</p>
<h2 id="Framing"><a href="#Framing" class="headerlink" title="Framing"></a>Framing</h2><p>Framing is a way used to illustrate the concepts such as the rule of thirds and leading lines. To give customized headroom to the subject, the framing is used from the top of the head and the top of the frame.</p>
<h2 id="Camera-Movement"><a href="#Camera-Movement" class="headerlink" title="Camera Movement"></a>Camera Movement</h2><p>The camera movement actually shows the real story presented in the music video. The camera movements used for filming are mainly the pedestal, truck, pan, tilt, and roll.</p>

<p>Whenever the protagonist looks out the bus’s window, the camera operator will use the “Dolly” and “Trucking” movements.</p>
<h3 id="Trucking-Movement"><a href="#Trucking-Movement" class="headerlink" title="Trucking Movement"></a>Trucking Movement</h3><p>The trucking movement of the camera is done in left-to-right motion in the filming. This is used for emotional purposes and whenever the subject is in a pull-out shot.</p>
<h3 id="Dolly-Movement"><a href="#Dolly-Movement" class="headerlink" title="Dolly Movement"></a>Dolly Movement</h3><p>The dolly movement of the camera is done by moving towards or away from the subject. This often gives a sense of importance to the character.</p>

<p>In the recent few years, Augmented Reality (AR) has evolved from a sci-fi concept to one of the most prominent technologies in the world. Due to its vast applications, AR has already seeped into many industries and the education world is one of them. <strong>Augmented Reality in classrooms</strong> can do wonders for the kids and enhance the overall learning experience. Not to mention, by combining AR with other intuitive technologies like Virtual Reality (VR) and Mixed Reality (MR), teachers can uplift the entire learning experience for students and make boring topics slightly more intriguing.</p>
<p>The truth is that conventional teaching methods are now becoming obsolete and many educational institutes and universities are incorporating AR to make teaching more fun. Keeping that in mind, we are going to share a detailed insight into how AR integration can help the entire edtech world.

Users can access an AR-based application directly on their smartphones and get access to the entire course material right away. Moreover, teachers can also access AR-based platforms on their laptops and make teaching more interactive for everyone.</p>
<h3 id="02Better-Student-Engagement"><a href="#02Better-Student-Engagement" class="headerlink" title="02Better Student Engagement"></a>02Better Student Engagement</h3><p>Speaking of interaction, AR has the potential to make learning more engaging for the students. Even the most boring topics can be brought to life by bringing technology like AR into the picture. One of the ways to do this is to gamify the technology and turn conventional training into something more intuitive. This way all the students will sit through the entire lesson and stay engaged till the end.</p>
<h3 id="03Practical-Learning"><a href="#03Practical-Learning" class="headerlink" title="03Practical Learning"></a>03Practical Learning</h3><p>Another major advantage of <strong>Augmented Reality in teaching</strong> is its ability to boast practical learning.

However, we can still benefit by combining technologies like AR with conventional teaching methods to achieve an all-around success. With <strong>Augmented Reality in schools,</strong> students will have the liberty to learn the practical implementation of all the theoretical knowledge they’ve acquired during the lectures.</p>
<h3 id="05Affordable"><a href="#05Affordable" class="headerlink" title="05Affordable"></a>05Affordable</h3><p>Finally, the biggest reason why universities, colleges, and training institutes must consider integrating AR into the entire curriculum is its affordability. Since colleges don’t actually need any expensive equipment to access an AR-based tech platform, they won’t have to spend thousands of dollars in the beginning. And, due to its affordable nature, it’s also easier to make AR readily available to all the students.</p>

<p>In the recent few years, Augmented Reality (AR) has evolved from a sci-fi concept to one of the most prominent technologies in the world. Due to its vast applications, AR has already seeped into many industries and the education world is one of them. <strong>Augmented Reality in classrooms</strong> can do wonders for the kids and enhance the overall learning experience. Not to mention, by combining AR with other intuitive technologies like Virtual Reality (VR) and Mixed Reality (MR), teachers can uplift the entire learning experience for students and make boring topics slightly more intriguing.</p>
<p>The truth is that conventional teaching methods are now becoming obsolete and many educational institutes and universities are incorporating AR to make teaching more fun. Keeping that in mind, we are going to share a detailed insight into how AR integration can help the entire edtech world. We’ll also share some of the real-world examples of <strong>Augmented Reality (AR) in teaching</strong> so that you can understand its benefits in the education sector.</p>

Augmented Reality is an immersive technology that combines various virtual elements with the real world. Unlike Virtual Reality (VR), AR doesn’t completely take users away from the real world. Instead, it overlays a few virtual elements onto the physical world to make things more immersive. Let’s understand this with the help of an example.</p>

<p>If you download IKEA’s phone app, it has a feature that allows you to virtually place different pieces of furniture in your home&#x2F;office. So, before buying something from the IKEA store, you can evaluate if it would look good at your place or not. Like IKEA, there are several other examples of Augmented Reality that prove its benefits in today’s tech-savvy society. So, let’s explore some of the advantages of incorporating <strong>Augmented Reality in classrooms</strong> and the education sector.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Benefits-of-Augmented-Reality-in-Education-1"><a href="#Part-2-Benefits-of-Augmented-Reality-in-Education-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2  Benefits of Augmented Reality in Education"></a>Part 2  Benefits of Augmented Reality in Education</h2><h3 id="01No-Special-Equipment-Required-1"><a href="#01No-Special-Equipment-Required-1" class="headerlink" title="01No Special Equipment Required"></a>01No Special Equipment Required</h3><p>One of the biggest advantages of Augmented Reality over other immersive technologies is that it doesn’t require any special equipment. Users can access an AR-based application directly on their smartphones and get access to the entire course material right away. Moreover, teachers can also access AR-based platforms on their laptops and make teaching more interactive for everyone.</p>
<h3 id="02Better-Student-Engagement-1"><a href="#02Better-Student-Engagement-1" class="headerlink" title="02Better Student Engagement"></a>02Better Student Engagement</h3><p>Speaking of interaction, AR has the potential to make learning more engaging for the students. Even the most boring topics can be brought to life by bringing technology like AR into the picture. One of the ways to do this is to gamify the technology and turn conventional training into something more intuitive. This way all the students will sit through the entire lesson and stay engaged till the end.</p>
<h3 id="03Practical-Learning-1"><a href="#03Practical-Learning-1" class="headerlink" title="03Practical Learning"></a>03Practical Learning</h3><p>Another major advantage of <strong>Augmented Reality in teaching</strong> is its ability to boast practical learning. For example, different training institutes can help trainees get familiar with the inner elements of a machine without having to go near the physical machine itself. This also reduces security threats in the workplace and protects training institutes from compromising million-dollar equipment.</p>
<h3 id="04Combined-Learning-1"><a href="#04Combined-Learning-1" class="headerlink" title="04Combined Learning"></a>04Combined Learning</h3><p>Our education sector is at a stage where it’s not possible to directly transition from textbooks to complete tech-based learning. However, we can still benefit by combining technologies like AR with conventional teaching methods to achieve an all-around success. With <strong>Augmented Reality in schools,</strong> students will have the liberty to learn the practical implementation of all the theoretical knowledge they’ve acquired during the lectures.</p>
<h3 id="05Affordable-1"><a href="#05Affordable-1" class="headerlink" title="05Affordable"></a>05Affordable</h3><p>Finally, the biggest reason why universities, colleges, and training institutes must consider integrating AR into the entire curriculum is its affordability. Since colleges don’t actually need any expensive equipment to access an AR-based tech platform, they won’t have to spend thousands of dollars in the beginning. And, due to its affordable nature, it’s also easier to make AR readily available to all the students.</p>

The technology has managed to garner immense popularity in the education sector and many institutes are relishing its benefits while making learning more fun and interactive for the students. So, as promised in the beginning of the article, here are some of the real-world examples of <strong>Augmented Reality in classrooms</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="01Exploring-the-Universe-With-Skyview-1"><a href="#01Exploring-the-Universe-With-Skyview-1" class="headerlink" title="01Exploring the Universe With Skyview"></a>01Exploring the Universe With Skyview</h3><p>Skyview is a smartphone application that lets users get familiar with the cosmos. To be more precise, students can use the app to know details about different stars they see during the night from their rooftop. To do this, all they have to do is point the camera towards the night sky and the app automatically overlays information regarding the most popular stars on the screen. In fact, they can even use the app to identify the location of planets and nearby satellites. Sounds fun, right?</p>

<p>If you download IKEA’s phone app, it has a feature that allows you to virtually place different pieces of furniture in your home&#x2F;office. So, before buying something from the IKEA store, you can evaluate if it would look good at your place or not. Like IKEA, there are several other examples of Augmented Reality that prove its benefits in today’s tech-savvy society. So, let’s explore some of the advantages of incorporating <strong>Augmented Reality in classrooms</strong> and the education sector.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Benefits-of-Augmented-Reality-in-Education-2"><a href="#Part-2-Benefits-of-Augmented-Reality-in-Education-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2  Benefits of Augmented Reality in Education"></a>Part 2  Benefits of Augmented Reality in Education</h2><h3 id="01No-Special-Equipment-Required-2"><a href="#01No-Special-Equipment-Required-2" class="headerlink" title="01No Special Equipment Required"></a>01No Special Equipment Required</h3><p>One of the biggest advantages of Augmented Reality over other immersive technologies is that it doesn’t require any special equipment. Users can access an AR-based application directly on their smartphones and get access to the entire course material right away. Moreover, teachers can also access AR-based platforms on their laptops and make teaching more interactive for everyone.</p>
<h3 id="02Better-Student-Engagement-2"><a href="#02Better-Student-Engagement-2" class="headerlink" title="02Better Student Engagement"></a>02Better Student Engagement</h3><p>Speaking of interaction, AR has the potential to make learning more engaging for the students. Even the most boring topics can be brought to life by bringing technology like AR into the picture. One of the ways to do this is to gamify the technology and turn conventional training into something more intuitive. This way all the students will sit through the entire lesson and stay engaged till the end.</p>
<h3 id="03Practical-Learning-2"><a href="#03Practical-Learning-2" class="headerlink" title="03Practical Learning"></a>03Practical Learning</h3><p>Another major advantage of <strong>Augmented Reality in teaching</strong> is its ability to boast practical learning. For example, different training institutes can help trainees get familiar with the inner elements of a machine without having to go near the physical machine itself. This also reduces security threats in the workplace and protects training institutes from compromising million-dollar equipment.</p>
<h3 id="04Combined-Learning-2"><a href="#04Combined-Learning-2" class="headerlink" title="04Combined Learning"></a>04Combined Learning</h3><p>Our education sector is at a stage where it’s not possible to directly transition from textbooks to complete tech-based learning. However, we can still benefit by combining technologies like AR with conventional teaching methods to achieve an all-around success. With <strong>Augmented Reality in schools,</strong> students will have the liberty to learn the practical implementation of all the theoretical knowledge they’ve acquired during the lectures.</p>
<h3 id="05Affordable-2"><a href="#05Affordable-2" class="headerlink" title="05Affordable"></a>05Affordable</h3><p>Finally, the biggest reason why universities, colleges, and training institutes must consider integrating AR into the entire curriculum is its affordability. Since colleges don’t actually need any expensive equipment to access an AR-based tech platform, they won’t have to spend thousands of dollars in the beginning. And, due to its affordable nature, it’s also easier to make AR readily available to all the students.</p>

<h3 id="03Distance-Learning-With-Mondly-3"><a href="#03Distance-Learning-With-Mondly-3" class="headerlink" title="03Distance Learning With Mondly"></a>03Distance Learning With Mondly</h3><p>Mondly is a language learning platform that’s designed to help students learn different languages in an interactive manner. With the platform, users get a dedicated virtual assistant that helps them work on their skills more effectively. The app replicates real-life settings in many ways and users can get a strong grasp on the desired language.</p>

<h3 id="04Froggipedia-3"><a href="#04Froggipedia-3" class="headerlink" title="04Froggipedia"></a>04Froggipedia</h3><p>This is where things get interesting. Froggipedia is a great example of <strong>Augmented Reality in teaching</strong>. It’s basically a smartphone app that lets users explore the internal organs of a frog in a virtual environment. It means students would no longer have to get involved in the mess that dissecting an actual frog creates in the classroom and still get familiar with each organ easily.</p>

<h3 id="05Effective-Marketing-3"><a href="#05Effective-Marketing-3" class="headerlink" title="05Effective Marketing"></a>05Effective Marketing</h3><p>Another example of <strong>Augmented Reality in the teaching</strong> world has nothing to do with learning, but the marketing aspect of the industry. With AR-based platforms, universities and colleges can market their brands among the target consumers and get a higher number of applications in return. They can launch digital publications and AR-powered videos to maximize engagement and achieve the desired results through their marketing campaigns.</p>

<h3 id="06Virtual-Classrooms-3"><a href="#06Virtual-Classrooms-3" class="headerlink" title="06Virtual Classrooms"></a>06Virtual Classrooms</h3><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has propelled the growth of virtual classrooms as many schools still haven’t resumed physical classes to restrict the virus’s spread. In VR classrooms, mixed reality - a combination of VR and AR - can help students stay engaged, even if they are sitting apart from each other. Virtual Classrooms will eliminate boredom from remote learning and keep the engagement level high for students.</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="07Secure-Training-3"><a href="#07Secure-Training-3" class="headerlink" title="07Secure Training"></a>07Secure Training</h3><p>As we mentioned earlier, AR integration makes training more effective and risk-free. For example, with Microsoft Holo-lens, medical students understand the inner anatomy of the human body and understand complex procedures without having to risk a patient’s life. Once they are confident and know about each organ, they can move towards the next procedure and gain expertise in the particular domain more effectively.</p>
<h3 id="08Google-Expeditions-3"><a href="#08Google-Expeditions-3" class="headerlink" title="08Google Expeditions"></a>08Google Expeditions</h3><p>For a student, exploring the world is a great way to familiarize himself with different cultures. But, it’s not always possible for young kids to go on trips alone. Well, not anymore! Thanks to virtual tour platforms like Google Expeditions, teachers can take their students on virtual trips to different corners of the world, be it Mount Everest Base Camp or the Eiffel Tower in Paris.</p>

<h3 id="09Augmented-Reality-in-Museums-3"><a href="#09Augmented-Reality-in-Museums-3" class="headerlink" title="09Augmented Reality in Museums"></a>09Augmented Reality in Museums</h3><p>The younger generation craves interactivity. They don’t have the time to read brochures in a Museum. That’s the reason why many Museums have started to launch AR-powered tech to keep the visitors engaged and let them learn various historical facts more precisely. For instance, in a nature-themed museum, visitors can experience digital animals and their position in history.</p>
<h3 id="10Virtual-Speech-3"><a href="#10Virtual-Speech-3" class="headerlink" title="10Virtual Speech"></a>10Virtual Speech</h3><p>Not particularly an Augmented Reality (AR) example, Virtual Speech is a combination of AR and VR that lets users virtually practice their public speaking skills without going on a real stage. This is a great tool to fight stage fear and speak with confidence in front of an actual crowd.</p>

<h2 id="●-Ending-Thoughts-→-7"><a href="#●-Ending-Thoughts-→-7" class="headerlink" title="● Ending Thoughts →"></a><strong>●</strong> Ending Thoughts <strong>→</strong></h2><p><strong>●</strong> Augmented Reality (AR) is no longer a thing of the past. It has become an emerging technology that has seeped into different industries including the education world.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> There are many advantages of integrating AR into the education world. For example, AR integration makes learning more interactive and fun for the students.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> There are dozens of real-life examples of Augmented Reality in education that are a clear indication of how AR can transform the entire education industry.</p>
