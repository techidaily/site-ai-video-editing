But many of us can’t afford this, so read this article to get an alternative.</p>
<p>You can use smartphones to record cinematic shots if you don’t have expensive lenses. You’ll learn about filming and editing those shots into Wondershare Filmora to get professional results in the below lines.</p>
<p>But before we get into the filming process, having a general idea about the topic can help a lot. So first, let’s understand what cinematic videos are!</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-a-Cinematic-Video"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-a-Cinematic-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is a Cinematic Video?"></a>Part 1. What Is a Cinematic Video?</h2><p>The world of cinema has developed and has high recording quality. A cinematic video is a video that is recorded to look more like a movie. These shots excel in all aspects of a video, such as Color, aspect ratio, and lighting techniques.</p>
<p>Most of the cinematic footage required unique cameras, i.e., <strong>IMAX</strong> cameras for movies. But these cameras are really costly and only suitable for large-scale production.</p>
<p>With the understanding of cinematic videos, you can now use alternative ways to record a cinematic video without an expensive camera. You can also record a cinematic video using only a smartphone with a few requirements.</p>
<p>Scroll below to learn more about what you need to record a cinematic video!</p>

Requirements to Record a Cinematic Video"></a>Part 2. Requirements to Record a Cinematic Video</h2><p>To record a professional video with cinematic effects, you must have the following equipment in your studio:</p>
<h3 id="1-A-Gimbal-Stabilizer"><a href="#1-A-Gimbal-Stabilizer" class="headerlink" title="1. A Gimbal Stabilizer"></a>1. A Gimbal Stabilizer</h3><p>When you are recording footage from your smartphone, a significant issue that can disturb your video quality is the shaking of your phone. You may have to record while walking, or it could even be a static shot.</p>
<p>If the phone is held in your hands without support, you will end up with shaky footage. This will eventually ruin your video.</p>
<p>A gimbal stabilizer allows you to stabilize your footage with a handheld stand. Many gimbal stabilizers are available in the market, but for reference, we would be looking at the <strong>Q3</strong> Gimbal from <strong>Zhiyun</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Zhiyun Stabilizer Shooting Modes</strong></p>
<p>There are many modes on different Gimbals, but the Locking and the POV mode are the most useful, which are illustrated as shown below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Locking mode:</strong> This mode allows you to lock all three motors of the Gimbal and allows your phone to remain fixed at a certain angle. Due to this, you can shoot your footage from multiple positions while keeping the camera fixed at one angle.</li>
<li><strong>The POV mode</strong> will allow you to unlock all the axes. This mode will also adjust in all three axes when moving around. This feature gives you more freedom of movement.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Extra Features of Zhiyun Q3 Stabilizer</strong></p>
<p>When you are shooting a video using the Gimbal stabilizer, you come across a point where you want extra light. Thus, the Q3 stabilizer comes with a built-in <strong>flashlight.</strong></p>
<p>This flashlight will not only light up those small corners of a dark room but also make a huge difference. If you are recording to focus on an object, such as a product, this flashlight will greatly help you.</p>

<p>Now that we have learned about the requirements for recording a cinematic video. Let’s look at the different cinematic movements you can use to record from your Smartphone.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Top-3-Cinematic-Movements-to-Record-From-a-Smartphone"><a href="#Part-3-Top-3-Cinematic-Movements-to-Record-From-a-Smartphone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Top 3 Cinematic Movements to Record From a Smartphone"></a>Part 3. Top 3 Cinematic Movements to Record From a Smartphone</h2><p>You may have watched many movies or TV shows, but the general audience usually ignores the effort put into a shot. Only an experienced videographer can detect the difference between a great cinematic shot and a poor one.</p>
<p>Of the great cinematic shots, some are described in this article. These shots can easily record by using a smartphone. The cinematic movements explained below are the best choice. Here we will look at the three camera movements you can record on your smartphone.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Reveal Movement.</li>
<li>The 180° Presentation Movement.</li>
<li>The Following Movement.</li>
</ul>
<p>First, let’s take a look at the Reveal movement.</p>
<h3 id="1-The-Reveal-Movement"><a href="#1-The-Reveal-Movement" class="headerlink" title="1. The Reveal Movement"></a>1. The Reveal Movement</h3><p>This is the most popular movement used in cinematic shooting from your smartphone. With a Gimbal, the Reveal movement is one of the easiest shots to master. But for this, you will need to learn it first.</p>
<p>The Reveal Movement is a shot taken with an object as a perspective. The shot starts from a static object in the foreground. It could be focused at first, but as the camera moves, the focus will be diverted to reveal our target object. This is known as the Reveal Movement.</p>
<p>To shoot the reveal movement, follow the steps mentioned as shown:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, ensure your phone is connected properly to the <strong>Gimbal</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Align</strong> your Smartphone camera behind the static object.</li>
<li>Guide the target individual to be ready as you move the camera to reveal them.</li>
<li>Slowly move the camera, focusing on the static object to change its focus on your main object.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-8.gif"
                      alt="the reveal movement"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Make sure to practice and experiment a lot with the steps. Try to be more creative and innovative. With every video you shoot, you gain experience with the errors.</p>
<p>Another thing to remember is that when you are shooting a Reveal movement using the Gimbal, it is best to put it in <strong>Locking mode</strong>. This mode works the best as it allows the camera to stay fixed in one frame making your footage seem balanced and of quality.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h3 id="2-The-180°-Presentation-Movement"><a href="#2-The-180°-Presentation-Movement" class="headerlink" title="2. The 180° Presentation Movement"></a>2. The 180° Presentation Movement</h3><p>The next movement we will be looking at will be the 180° presentation movement. The 180° presentation will move in a half-circle fashion. It will move from one side of the subject to the other side. This will allow you to cover the overall subject’s view.</p>
<p>Apart from that, it will allow you to capture the background with much clarity and detail to maintain a general sense of the ambiance. Making a 180° presentation shot is fairly easy to do so. With its multiple uses, you can use this method in any scenario.</p>
<p>As we will move from one side to the other in a circular manner, we need to fix the frame of our video to move along. Using the <strong>POV</strong> <strong>mode</strong> of the Zhiyun Gimbal stabilizer will be the best option in this sense.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="gimbal fixed in pov mode"
                ></p>
<p>Setting the Gimbal in POV mode will allow you to shoot the video from more than one angle while keeping the video balanced. Follow the steps mentioned to shoot a 180° presentation video:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, start recording from one side of the subject while keeping the Gimbal in the POV mode.</li>
<li>Slowly start moving in front of the subject in an arch.</li>
<li>When you face the subject, do not stop and keep moving to complete the arch.</li>
<li>When you reach the end of the arch, close the video.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="the 180° presentation movement"
                ></p>
<p>By following the steps mentioned, you can create the 180° presentation movement using a smartphone. Now, move forward to learn about “The Following movement.”</p>
<h3 id="3-The-Following-Movement"><a href="#3-The-Following-Movement" class="headerlink" title="3. The Following Movement"></a>3. The Following Movement</h3><p>You can use “The following movement” when recording a scene in which the object moves in random directions. Or when there is a high degree of movement of your object in the video, and you want to fix the focus of your footage to that object.</p>
<p>The Following movement is not technically a movement, but a setting that will allow you to record the footage while keeping the object and the video frame focused. In this type of footage, we will use the Zhiyun Cami app to focus on our target object.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="drawing a square to focus the subject"
                ></p>
<p>To focus on our subject in the video by Cami app, follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li>When recording the video, make sure to put the Gimbal on a tripod stand.</li>
<li>After that, open the <strong>Cami</strong> app and draw a square over the object you want to keep in focus.</li>
<li>Now, the camera will shift its angle to its perspective wherever the object goes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Congratulations! You have now successfully created a cinematic video using Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Using expensive equipment to record a cinematic video can be a reliable step. But it is not in everyone’s budget. You can also use a smartphone to record a cinematic video by the steps mentioned above and give it a professional look by editing on Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<p>Although it might seem strange initially, but the time is close when everyone will create cinematic videos from their smartphones.</p>
<p>Another thing to remember is that when you are shooting a Reveal movement using the Gimbal, it is best to put it in <strong>Locking mode</strong>. This mode works the best as it allows the camera to stay fixed in one frame making your footage seem balanced and of quality.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h3 id="2-The-180°-Presentation-Movement-1"><a href="#2-The-180°-Presentation-Movement-1" class="headerlink" title="2. The 180° Presentation Movement"></a>2. The 180° Presentation Movement</h3><p>The next movement we will be looking at will be the 180° presentation movement. The 180° presentation will move in a half-circle fashion. It will move from one side of the subject to the other side. This will allow you to cover the overall subject’s view.</p>
<p>Apart from that, it will allow you to capture the background with much clarity and detail to maintain a general sense of the ambiance. Making a 180° presentation shot is fairly easy to do so. With its multiple uses, you can use this method in any scenario.</p>
<p>As we will move from one side to the other in a circular manner, we need to fix the frame of our video to move along. Using the <strong>POV</strong> <strong>mode</strong> of the Zhiyun Gimbal stabilizer will be the best option in this sense.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="gimbal fixed in pov mode"
                ></p>
<p>Setting the Gimbal in POV mode will allow you to shoot the video from more than one angle while keeping the video balanced. Follow the steps mentioned to shoot a 180° presentation video:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, start recording from one side of the subject while keeping the Gimbal in the POV mode.</li>
<li>Slowly start moving in front of the subject in an arch.</li>
<li>When you face the subject, do not stop and keep moving to complete the arch.</li>
<li>When you reach the end of the arch, close the video.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="the 180° presentation movement"
                ></p>
<p>By following the steps mentioned, you can create the 180° presentation movement using a smartphone. Now, move forward to learn about “The Following movement.”</p>
<h3 id="3-The-Following-Movement-1"><a href="#3-The-Following-Movement-1" class="headerlink" title="3. The Following Movement"></a>3. The Following Movement</h3><p>You can use “The following movement” when recording a scene in which the object moves in random directions. Or when there is a high degree of movement of your object in the video, and you want to fix the focus of your footage to that object.</p>
<p>The Following movement is not technically a movement, but a setting that will allow you to record the footage while keeping the object and the video frame focused. In this type of footage, we will use the Zhiyun Cami app to focus on our target object.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="drawing a square to focus the subject"
                ></p>
<p>To focus on our subject in the video by Cami app, follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li>When recording the video, make sure to put the Gimbal on a tripod stand.</li>
<li>After that, open the <strong>Cami</strong> app and draw a square over the object you want to keep in focus.</li>
<li>Now, the camera will shift its angle to its perspective wherever the object goes.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

It is an easy way to connect with people and show emotions to them. In the same way, slideshow videos also are important in their place. Slides are the collection of traditional photos or negatives which are out of trend now. And slideshow videos are the perfect way to use those slides and relieve those faded memories with loved ones. Creating the slideshow video is also easy and can be done easily with the help of some tools. You don’t need to be professional, but the only need is to follow certain tips carefully. Here, we are sharing the essential tips to prepare a great slideshow video. Also, you will get to know about the best tool for video creation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Tell a story</strong></p>
<p>Prepare the slideshow video in the form of storytelling. Whatever is the theme of your slideshow, prepare the script of the video right from the start. Make a meaningful and impressive story. Select and collect the raw materials according to the requirement.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Keep it cohesive</strong></p>
<p>The cohesion of photos or images is very important in a video slideshow. It is advised not to mix and match still photos and videos in 1 slideshow. Also, choose the photos belonging to the same color family. Mixing different varieties of photos divert the attention of the viewer. Also, one warm photo, then one cool and so on are not the efficient choices for a slideshow. All the images should appear as part of one color family and are similar to one another. Always maintain the quality of photos throughout the slideshow. Gradual jumps between grainy portrait mode photos and some screenshots, meanwhile photos of other modes lead to distracting the viewer and blurring their experience.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Make it personal</strong></p>
<p>Video slideshows are a powerful tool to show your personality and your personal message. The videos should contain your feelings. So, customize them and make them as personal as you can. Give your uniqueness to your slideshows. For this, you can customize the color palette, text, etc and make them unique and personal. So that the people with whom you share the videos may also feel your touch.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Keep slideshow videos short</strong></p>
<p>There might be different aims for creating a slideshow video. You might want to share it with loved ones or any of your friends’ circle. Or you might be wanting it to post as an ad on social media platforms such as Instagram, or Facebook. Whatever the purpose of your making the video, keep them concise and short. Short video clips are best for grabbing the attention of the viewers. Everyone does not find it interesting to watch long-form videos. If you are aiming to make a longer-form video slideshow which contains both images and video clips, then keep each photo for 3 to 5 seconds and each video clip a maximum of 20 seconds. It is recommended to maintain the user’s interest throughout.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Create a storyboard to plan your slideshow video</strong></p>
<p>As we have already discussed in the above point, the video should depict your story. Also, it should be in sync to make it more compelling. Creating a storyboard or outline is the perfect way to predict the right flow as well as choose the right elements for the video.</p>
<p>The storyboard helps to prepare a plan and develop the logical sequence of the photos. Also, if you want to add photos, video clips, texts, etc in a single slideshow, the storyboard can help to outline the sequence. With this, you will be able to create a video that will be logically correct.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Add text to videos and images to convey your message clearly</strong></p>
<p>Text or captions are very crucial to be added to the slideshow especially if you are preparing them for social media. People these days do watch the videos by keeping the sound off on social media. So, they will not be able to get your message without captions. Keep all your key messages highlighted in the video. The first few seconds of the video play an important role. It is the deciding factor whether the viewer will watch the whole video or will just bounce back. So, give a captivating hook to the slideshow to capture the viewer’s attention and make them hit the unmute button.</p>

<p>There might be different aims for creating a slideshow video. You might want to share it with loved ones or any of your friends’ circle. Or you might be wanting it to post as an ad on social media platforms such as Instagram, or Facebook. Whatever the purpose of your making the video, keep them concise and short. Short video clips are best for grabbing the attention of the viewers. Everyone does not find it interesting to watch long-form videos. If you are aiming to make a longer-form video slideshow which contains both images and video clips, then keep each photo for 3 to 5 seconds and each video clip a maximum of 20 seconds. It is recommended to maintain the user’s interest throughout.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Create a storyboard to plan your slideshow video</strong></p>
<p>As we have already discussed in the above point, the video should depict your story. Also, it should be in sync to make it more compelling. Creating a storyboard or outline is the perfect way to predict the right flow as well as choose the right elements for the video.</p>
<p>The storyboard helps to prepare a plan and develop the logical sequence of the photos. Also, if you want to add photos, video clips, texts, etc in a single slideshow, the storyboard can help to outline the sequence. With this, you will be able to create a video that will be logically correct.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Add text to videos and images to convey your message clearly</strong></p>
<p>Text or captions are very crucial to be added to the slideshow especially if you are preparing them for social media. People these days do watch the videos by keeping the sound off on social media. So, they will not be able to get your message without captions. Keep all your key messages highlighted in the video. The first few seconds of the video play an important role. It is the deciding factor whether the viewer will watch the whole video or will just bounce back. So, give a captivating hook to the slideshow to capture the viewer’s attention and make them hit the unmute button.</p>

It is an easy way to connect with people and show emotions to them. In the same way, slideshow videos also are important in their place. Slides are the collection of traditional photos or negatives which are out of trend now. And slideshow videos are the perfect way to use those slides and relieve those faded memories with loved ones.

Here, we are sharing the essential tips to prepare a great slideshow video. Also, you will get to know about the best tool for video creation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Tell a story</strong></p>
<p>Prepare the slideshow video in the form of storytelling. Whatever is the theme of your slideshow, prepare the script of the video right from the start. Make a meaningful and impressive story. Select and collect the raw materials according to the requirement.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Keep it cohesive</strong></p>
<p>The cohesion of photos or images is very important in a video slideshow. It is advised not to mix and match still photos and videos in 1 slideshow. Also, choose the photos belonging to the same color family. Mixing different varieties of photos divert the attention of the viewer. Also, one warm photo, then one cool and so on are not the efficient choices for a slideshow. All the images should appear as part of one color family and are similar to one another. Always maintain the quality of photos throughout the slideshow. Gradual jumps between grainy portrait mode photos and some screenshots, meanwhile photos of other modes lead to distracting the viewer and blurring their experience.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Make it personal</strong></p>
<p>Video slideshows are a powerful tool to show your personality and your personal message. The videos should contain your feelings. So, customize them and make them as personal as you can. Give your uniqueness to your slideshows. For this, you can customize the color palette, text, etc and make them unique and personal. So that the people with whom you share the videos may also feel your touch.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Keep slideshow videos short</strong></p>
<p>There might be different aims for creating a slideshow video. You might want to share it with loved ones or any of your friends’ circle. Or you might be wanting it to post as an ad on social media platforms such as Instagram, or Facebook. Whatever the purpose of your making the video, keep them concise and short.

It is recommended to maintain the user’s interest throughout.</p>
