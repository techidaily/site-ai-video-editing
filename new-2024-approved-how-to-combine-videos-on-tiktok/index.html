<p>Many people continue to ask how to combine videos on TikTok. If you saw a video that grabbed your attention but consisted of several recordings, you might be wondering how you can combine the videos for TikTok. In this article, we’ll provide all the solutions you need. We’ll explore the best ways to combine videos on TikTok without surpassing the time limit the platform specified. On that note, let’s begin.</p>
<p><strong>2 Practical Ways to Combine Videos on TikTok</strong></p>
<p>This section will explore two practical ways to help you combine videos on TikTok. First, follow the steps outlined to complete the process.</p>
<p><strong>Using the TikTok Camera</strong></p>
<p>You can first combine videos on TikTok by using its official camera. To achieve this, follow the steps outlined below to combine your videos seamlessly.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, visit TikTok and click the ‘+’ icon at the bottom of the screen.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/combile-tiktok-videos-1.jpg"
                      alt="combile-tiktok-videos-"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Once you do this, you can advance to recording the clips you want.</li>
<li>Click the timer button at the top of the screen to choose how long you would like to shoot your video; you can select 5 seconds, 10 seconds, etc.</li>
<li>Before starting the countdown, drag the red bar by the audio track to where you want the clip to end.</li>
<li>You can repeat the recording many times to have many clips recorded.</li>
<li>Once you’re done recording, click the ‘adjust clip’ icon to adjust your video clips.</li>
<li>After adjusting, hit the ‘done’ button and have your combined video.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can go ahead and share with your followers and the general public.</p>
<p><strong>Use the Combining Function</strong></p>
<p>The second practical way you can combine TikTok videos into a single video is by using the app’s built-in combining function. To find out how you can use this technique for your videos, follow the steps outlined below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Once you have the TikTok app on your device, open it and go to the menu bar. Select the ‘+’ button; it should be at the end of the screen.</li>
<li>Instead of recording through the TikTok camera, choose the ‘upload’ button, and it will take you to your device storage, where you can select the videos you would like to upload on TikTok.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/combile-tiktok-videos-2.jpg"
                      alt="combile-tiktok-videos-"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Now, choose the ‘select multiple’ option at the left corner of your screen. Once you select this option, you can select different videos you would like to join together. Once you are satisfied with your choice, hit the ‘next’ button.</li>
<li>TikTok will allow you to combine the videos for up to 60 seconds. You can customize the video arrangement according to your preference.</li>
<li>If you’re satisfied with the final video result, click the next option, and you can share it on your TikTok account.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Step 3: Add Filters and More Effects</strong></p>

These tools usually work in three simple steps.</p>
<ul>
<li>Analyze the footage,</li>
<li>Separate the subject or “subjects” from the background,</li>
<li>Switch backgrounds.</li>
</ul>
<p>The process starts when a user uploads a video clip. The tool analyzes the footage and separates the subjects from the background. The user can select other available pre-made backgrounds or upload a preferred one to the platform. After this process, users can share the finished video or save it to their devices. Other kinds of background changers only merge a transparent clip with a background.</p>
