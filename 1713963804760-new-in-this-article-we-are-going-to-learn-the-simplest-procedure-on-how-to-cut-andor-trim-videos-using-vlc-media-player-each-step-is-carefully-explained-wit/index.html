Each Step Is Carefully Explained, with Screenshots Attached</h2><p>Other than playing videos and music, VLC Media Player can also be used as a video editing tool. While advanced video editing requires unconventional and powerful video editing software, VLC offers a simpler and easy-to-learn process of cutting and&#x2F;or trimming videos.</p>
<p>You can cut a section of your video and make shorter video clips. This means that you can now get rid of parts of a video that you do not need and preserve those that you like. VLC automatically saves the video clips made, so you do not have to save them again.</p>
<p>In this article, we are going to learn the simplest procedure on how to cut and&#x2F;or trim videos using VLC Media Player. Each step is carefully explained, with screenshots attached.</p>

<p><strong>To Cut&#x2F;Trim Videos with Wondershare Filmora:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Drag and Drop the Video</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Assuming that you have already downloaded and installed Wondershare Filmora app, click to open. There are two ways through which you can locate your video.</p>
<p>One, you can opt to drag and drop the video from its location to the app’s timeline. Secondly, you can right click on the space at the top left then select the video to be edited from the dialogue box that will appear.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Trimming the video</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>After dropping the video on the timeline, it is likely to take up a lot of space, especially if it is long.</p>
<p>To trim the video from the beginning, place your cursor at the starting point and wait for the pointer to appear. Then move the point forward. To trim from the end, place the cursor at that point, hold and move the pointer forward till the required point.</p>

<p>Trimming the video does not mean that you lose the parts. It is more like shortening it to fit in place.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Cutting the video</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Unlike trimming, cutting involves getting rid of a section of the video completely. To do so, you need to first of all isolate that section.</p>
<p>With the video on the timeline, move and point your cursor at the starting point of the video and click on the scissors icon at the top. Then move it to the end of the video section and click on the scissors icon again. By so doing, you will have selected that section.</p>
<p>Once the section has been selected, right click on the video, select and click to delete. You can then drag the remaining parts to make them one.</p>

<p>After cutting or trimming, you can choose to add several effects to the video. Transitions, watermarks, cropping, resizing, ripple effects among others are some of the changes you could make. All these appear on the menu at the top.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Save and&#x2F;or Import your video</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The final step is saving or importing your file to prevent its loss. By clicking on the ‘Import’ button, you save the file to the Media Library. By selecting ‘save as’, you select the location where you want to store your file.</p>

<p><strong>To Cut&#x2F;Trim Videos with Wondershare Filmora:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Drag and Drop the Video</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Assuming that you have already downloaded and installed Wondershare Filmora app, click to open. There are two ways through which you can locate your video.</p>
<p>One, you can opt to drag and drop the video from its location to the app’s timeline. Secondly, you can right click on the space at the top left then select the video to be edited from the dialogue box that will appear.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Trimming the video</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>After dropping the video on the timeline, it is likely to take up a lot of space, especially if it is long.</p>
<p>To trim the video from the beginning, place your cursor at the starting point and wait for the pointer to appear. Then move the point forward. To trim from the end, place the cursor at that point, hold and move the pointer forward till the required point.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="cut-video-vlc"
                ></p>
<p>Trimming the video does not mean that you lose the parts. It is more like shortening it to fit in place.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Cutting the video</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Unlike trimming, cutting involves getting rid of a section of the video completely. To do so, you need to first of all isolate that section.</p>
<p>With the video on the timeline, move and point your cursor at the starting point of the video and click on the scissors icon at the top. Then move it to the end of the video section and click on the scissors icon again. By so doing, you will have selected that section.</p>
<p>Once the section has been selected, right click on the video, select and click to delete. You can then drag the remaining parts to make them one.</p>

                      alt="go to color"
                ></p>
<p>Step6 Finally, hide this layer just like before. Repeat the same steps for the last clip but make this clip the blue layer by leaving the Temperature at zero and setting the Tint to -100.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="setting the tint to -100"
                ></p>
<p>Step7 Double-click the clip in the top layer, click the Video Tab, and open the Compositing options. Set the Blending Mode of this top layer to Soft Light.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="click the video tab"
                ></p>
<p>Now click on the clip in your preview window and move the image over by pressing the left Arrow key on your keyboard a few times. Once you’re happy with the top clip, hide that layer by clicking the eye icon.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/glitch_effect_12.jpg"
                      alt="click on the clip in your preview window"
                ></p>
<p>Step8 To make the middle layer visible, double-click the clip in your mid layer and set the Blending Mode of this layer to Screen.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/glitch_effect_13.jpg"
                      alt="double-click the clip in your mid layer"
                ></p>
<p>Now click on your clip in the preview window and press the Right key as many times as you did before. Finally, make all the layers visible by clicking the eye icon.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/glitch_effect_14.jpg"
                      alt="press the right key"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Vignette</strong></p>
<p>A vignette is a dark border that fades around the frame’s edges in Filmora. You can easily add a vignette effect to your video by using these steps:</p>
<p>Step1 First, click the Effects Tab and type in Vignette.</p>
<p>Step2 Next, drag the Vignette Radius effect to a layer above your previous three layers.</p>
<p>Step3 Now adjust the length to match the other clips.</p>
<p><strong>VHS static effects</strong></p>
<p>A VHS effect is a grainy distortion that resembles an old analog video cassette recording. To apply the VHS static effects:</p>
<p>Step1 Click the Effects tab.</p>
<p>Step2 Search for the VHS static and drag it to a new layer above everything else.</p>
<p>Step3 Extend one of the effects to match the length of your previous clips.</p>
<p><strong>VCR Distortion</strong></p>
<p>VCR Distortion effect will make your video look highly glitched. To apply this effect:</p>
<p>Step1 Click on the Effects tab.</p>
<p>Step2 Search for VCR Distortion, then drag and drop this effect over your previous layer.</p>

<li>One of the best ways to use the VCR Distortion effect is to cut it short and intersperse it around your video in random parts.</li>
<li>The glitch Distortion effect is very intense, so we recommend cutting this effect very short and dropping it at random parts of your video.</li>
<li>You can also use these effects as a sneaky way to hide Cuts in your video.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Summary-1"><a href="#Summary-1" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>You can use glitch effects created or inspired by faulty video equipment as a powerful storytelling tool. These effects can help you change the tone of the entire video by adding a specific visual aesthetic and making the narrative simpler to convey and more approachable for the audience.</p>
<p>We recommend using Filmora 11 for adding built-in glitch effects. You can also use this app to create custom glitch effects within a few minutes.</p>
