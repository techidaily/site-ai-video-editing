<p><strong>Green Screen Effects</strong></p>
<p>1. Balance Beam</p>
<p>Ever wanted to walk across a small beam way high up in the air? Me neither, but you can make a cool effect that looks like you did. Throwing a green screen on the ground and then building a balance beam over top of it you can start recording the main shot. Strap a GoPro to your head and look down while walking across the beam.</p>
<p>2. Shrink Effect</p>
<p>Okay this one is really easy. Take some footage of a person walking in front of a green screen, ideally looking at something to be featured in the main shot to sell the effect. Then take a close up of a small object. Key out the green behind the person, take the footage and drop it over your close up, and then scale it to match. Duplicate it, mirror it horizontally to act as a reflection and then drop the opacity and add some blur to make it look more realistic. It’s a fun little trick.</p>
<p>3. Floating Object</p>
<p>This is a simple one, making an object appear to be floating. This is another two clip shot. First, take a shot with the object hanging in front of a blue screen. Then on the same location, take another shot but while pretending to levitate the hammer. Masking around the hammer will get rid of the string for hanging, key out the blue, and then dropping it on top of the other clip is all you need.</p>

<p>A green screen is a green surface used as a background when filming so that any image can replace the screen behind the actor or presenter. Shooting with a green screen involves filming a person or adding visual effects in front of a solid color. Then, by digitally removing or “keying out” that color, you can drop that scene onto the background of your choice in post-production. Removing the colored background is also referred to as “chroma keying.”</p>
<p><strong>Steps with Images</strong></p>
<p>The first step is to record footage in front of a green screen so that you can import it into WeVideo as a media file. To capture footage that is optimal for the Green Screen effect, please ensure the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is ample lighting distributed evenly around you with no shadows.</li>
<li>You are in front of a <strong>solid background with no creases</strong>. Green or blue is the recommended color for your background.</li>
<li>The quality of your camera is high enough so that the footage is not pixelated or grainy. 720p HD footage or above is recommended.</li>
</ul>
<p>Step 2) Add media to the Timeline</p>
<p>Once you’ve captured the footage you want to use for the Green Screen effect, import that media file and add it to the Timeline. Remember to place the green screen footage in the Video 2 track and the clip you would like to use as the background in the Video 1 track.</p>
<p>If you are using more than two video tracks, place the green screen footage in the track above whichever track holds the background footage to ensure proper layering techniques are used.</p>
<p> Step 3) Open the clip editor</p>
<p>Double click on the green screen clip in the Timeline to open the clip editor. In the clip editor, navigate to the Color Keying tab.</p>
<p> Step 4) Use the color picker tool</p>
<p>Select the color picker tool and then click anywhere on the green screen footage to apply the effect.</p>
<p> Step 5) _<em>(optional)</em> Adjust the color settings</p>
<p>The Green Screen effect should automatically apply without the need to adjust the color settings. However, if you would like to make these additional modifications, you can use the scroll bars to make the following adjustments:</p>
<ul>
<li>**<strong>Show</strong>- You can select Mask to reveal a black and white representation of the mask you are applying using the color keying tool. Notice that the black area represents transparent sections of your video, while the white area represents opaque sections.</li>
<li>**<strong>Color Balance</strong>- This adjusts how selective the effect is. The further right you scroll, the wider the range of tints and shades are removed.</li>
<li>**<strong>Color Sensitivity</strong>- This smooths out any pixelation and rough edges of color that remain.</li>
<li>**<strong>Defringe</strong>- This helps reduce color bleeding at the edges of your mask. The left and right sliders control the level of white and black respectively to help match the edges of the mask with your new background color.</li>

<p> Step 5) _<em>(optional)</em> Adjust the color settings</p>
<p>The Green Screen effect should automatically apply without the need to adjust the color settings. However, if you would like to make these additional modifications, you can use the scroll bars to make the following adjustments:</p>
<ul>
<li>**<strong>Show</strong>- You can select Mask to reveal a black and white representation of the mask you are applying using the color keying tool. Notice that the black area represents transparent sections of your video, while the white area represents opaque sections.</li>
<li>**<strong>Color Balance</strong>- This adjusts how selective the effect is. The further right you scroll, the wider the range of tints and shades are removed.</li>
<li>**<strong>Color Sensitivity</strong>- This smooths out any pixelation and rough edges of color that remain.</li>
<li>**<strong>Defringe</strong>- This helps reduce color bleeding at the edges of your mask. The left and right sliders control the level of white and black respectively to help match the edges of the mask with your new background color.</li>

<p>Save and Export: Then you can save or export the video.</p>
<p>A green screen is a green surface used as a background when filming so that any image can replace the screen behind the actor or presenter. Shooting with a green screen involves filming a person or adding visual effects in front of a solid color. Then, by digitally removing or “keying out” that color, you can drop that scene onto the background of your choice in post-production. Removing the colored background is also referred to as “chroma keying.”</p>
<p><strong>Steps with Images</strong></p>
<p>The first step is to record footage in front of a green screen so that you can import it into WeVideo as a media file. To capture footage that is optimal for the Green Screen effect, please ensure the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is ample lighting distributed evenly around you with no shadows.</li>
<li>You are in front of a <strong>solid background with no creases</strong>. Green or blue is the recommended color for your background.</li>
<li>The quality of your camera is high enough so that the footage is not pixelated or grainy. 720p HD footage or above is recommended.</li>
</ul>
<p>Step 2) Add media to the Timeline</p>
<p>Once you’ve captured the footage you want to use for the Green Screen effect, import that media file and add it to the Timeline. Remember to place the green screen footage in the Video 2 track and the clip you would like to use as the background in the Video 1 track.</p>
<p>If you are using more than two video tracks, place the green screen footage in the track above whichever track holds the background footage to ensure proper layering techniques are used.</p>
<p> Step 3) Open the clip editor</p>
<p>Double click on the green screen clip in the Timeline to open the clip editor. In the clip editor, navigate to the Color Keying tab.</p>
<p> Step 4) Use the color picker tool</p>
<p>Select the color picker tool and then click anywhere on the green screen footage to apply the effect.</p>
<p> Step 5) _<em>(optional)</em> Adjust the color settings</p>
<p>The Green Screen effect should automatically apply without the need to adjust the color settings. However, if you would like to make these additional modifications, you can use the scroll bars to make the following adjustments:</p>
