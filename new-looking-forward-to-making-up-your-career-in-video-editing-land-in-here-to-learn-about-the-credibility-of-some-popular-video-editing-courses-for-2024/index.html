                ></p>
<p>Step2 After that, you need to hold the coin with the fingers part of one hand and tap down on the coin. Make sure it looks like the coin is going through straight to the glass.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="hold the coin with the fingers"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 You need someone else to drop the other coin from the top. Meanwhile, you are pretending to tap a coin on the glass. You don’t need to worry about someone else hand in the frame. Since you can remove it easily with the masking feature in Filmora.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step2 Drag and drop the clip onto the first track of the timeline.Afterward, move the playhead to the right and find the spot where you tapped the coin last time before your friend drops the other coin. Additionally, make sure it is in the middle of the tapping action and cut.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="drag and drop the clip onto the first track"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 Then move the playhead to the right and find the spot where your friend drops the coin while you tap without the coin in your hand. Make sure it is in the middle of the tapping action, and the position of your hand roughly matches that in the last cut and make a cut.</p>

                      alt="move the playhead to the right"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 Now you need to delete the middle part and play it back. Indeed, cutting on action is the key to creating the illusion that the action is continued without editing.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="remove your friend&#39;s hand in the frame"

                ></p>
<p>Step7 Here you can see the mask is applied.First, adjust the angle and position of the mask to only show the top part of the frame. Then you have to change the Blur Strength to add more blur to the edge of the mask.</p>
