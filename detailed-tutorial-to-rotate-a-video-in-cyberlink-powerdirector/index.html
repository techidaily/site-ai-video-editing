But the way one presents it or goes about filming clips also has a profound effect on the end product. And as you may know, not every aspect of a video production activity always goes without hiccups. But editing can come in clutch as it can easily solve minor problems like skewed footage that was shot at the wrong angle or is upside down (an issue that can happen while using mobile phones).</p>
<p>Thus, with this article, we will be looking at steps to rotate a video in Cyberlink PowerDirector to help you when required. We have also mentioned the steps you will need to follow in Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> <em>We documented the steps in this guide with PowerDirector 365 and WonderShare Filmora X.</em></p>
<h2 id="Steps-to-Rotate-Videos-with-CyberLink-PowerDirector"><a href="#Steps-to-Rotate-Videos-with-CyberLink-PowerDirector" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Rotate Videos with CyberLink PowerDirector"></a>Steps to Rotate Videos with CyberLink PowerDirector</h2><p>Put yourself in a situation where you’ve just finished filming a project with your smartphone but end up realizing that the footage isn’t in the right orientation by default. While the error has an easy fix on most smartphones, you can also perform this action with video editing tools.</p>
<p>Also, while this form of rotating might be the most basic implementation of the feature, you can often use the feature to add a dynamic nature to your video with Keyframes.</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Keyframes in Video Editing is a software feature that allows an editor to set start and endpoints (denoted by In and Out Markers), presenting the opportunity to custom clip properties between the two positions. The set changes occur gradually as the playhead continues moving through the clip. Properties that can undergo modification with this method are zoom, rotation, colors, positions, etc.</p>
<p>The process of rotating clips is fairly straightforward; once you have PowerDirector 365 open, follow the steps listed below.</p>
<p><em>If you do not have CyberLink PowerDirector 365, download the software by visiting</em> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.cyberlink.com/products/powerdirector-video-editing-software/features%5Fen%5FUS.html"><em>Cyberlink’s official website</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Create a new video project in Cyberlink PowerDirector 365 and choose Full Mode.</p>

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="rotate-videos-powerdirector"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Full Mode in Cyberlink PowerDirector 365 will provide users access to a full-featured video editing tool similar in function to Wondershare Filmora. The other option available is Ad Designer.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, import media onto the Timeline from the Media Library.</p>
<p>For this guide, we used the pre-existing stock footage in Cyberlink PowerDirector.</p>

<p>Once you have a new project open in Filmora, follow the steps listed below.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Import a Media File to edit into your Video Project.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Choose the Edit Option (marked in Red).</p>
<p>This will bring up the Edit Window in the left-top corner of your screen.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p>Click on the Keyframe Button (marked in Green) to access the Keyframe Menu that allows you to set points between which a decided amount of rotation can happen.</p>

<h2 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>This marks the end of our guide on how to rotate video in PowerDirector 365 and Wondershare Filmora X. Now, while both software are high-capable tools, we feel the keyframe-based working on rotation in Filmora is a lot more intuitive and easy to use. The ability to only have number-based rotation within the edit menu is also a positive, as rotating with a swivel like in PowerDirector isn’t always the most accurate.</p>
<p>And lastly, the modern iconography-based design of Wondershare Filmora is a factor to keep in mind, as this increases usability manifolds.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Full Mode in Cyberlink PowerDirector 365 will provide users access to a full-featured video editing tool similar in function to Wondershare Filmora. The other option available is Ad Designer.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, import media onto the Timeline from the Media Library.</p>

<h2 id="The-Bottom-Line-2"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line-2" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>This marks the end of our guide on how to rotate video in PowerDirector 365 and Wondershare Filmora X. Now, while both software are high-capable tools, we feel the keyframe-based working on rotation in Filmora is a lot more intuitive and easy to use. The ability to only have number-based rotation within the edit menu is also a positive, as rotating with a swivel like in PowerDirector isn’t always the most accurate.</p>
<p>And lastly, the modern iconography-based design of Wondershare Filmora is a factor to keep in mind, as this increases usability manifolds.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Full Mode in Cyberlink PowerDirector 365 will provide users access to a full-featured video editing tool similar in function to Wondershare Filmora. The other option available is Ad Designer.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, import media onto the Timeline from the Media Library.</p>
<p>For this guide, we used the pre-existing stock footage in Cyberlink PowerDirector.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now, click on the video file on the Timeline; this will activate the video in the Preview Window. And it will provide you with access to the rotation circle, allowing you to change the orientation of the source file.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p><strong>EXTRA</strong></p>
<p>Rotation added in the PiP Designer will function as a keyframe-based rotation action. Right-click on the video in the preview window, choose Edit and then Modify to access this menu.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="rotate-videos-powerdirector"
                ></p>
<p>Following this, you can click on the Motion Tab, go into Rotation Settings, and modify the angle with greater precision. In the Preview Window, you will now be able to see the rotating video.</p>

Accessing the rotate function while available in the forefront, the use of PiP Designer didn’t feel intuitive.</p>
<p>In Wondershare <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , rotating footage only happens via the Edit Option, and this straightforward approach felt simple. As for those who want to use Keyframes, the integration of this feature right above the Timeline is an appreciated convenience.</p>
<p>This emphasis on quick accessibility is present with almost every function in Filmora, and we believe this to be a significant advantage. The use of modern and unique iconography also increases familiarity, an aspect that will always be welcoming to new and budding creators.</p>
<p><em>If you do not already have Wondershare Filmora, you can download the software by visiting the official website.</em></p>

<h2 id="How-To-Make-A-Video-Longer"><a href="#How-To-Make-A-Video-Longer" class="headerlink" title="How To Make A Video Longer"></a>How To Make A Video Longer</h2><p>These days when you head on to social media, you can easily find 4-5 seconds video clips on the internet. However, many social media platforms like YouTube, Instagram, and other videos sharing platforms require you to make your video longer to meet the site’s minimum length requirements. So, for example, although Instagram’s minimum length is 3 seconds, you might want to find ways to engage your audience longer.</p>
<p>This article will describe the best ways to make a video longer. We’ll also offer a bonus tip on how you can edit your video to make it look better and attract more audience. On that note, let’s take a look.</p>
<p><strong>6 Best Methods to Make a Video Longer</strong></p>
<p>There are many methods out there to make your video longer. This section will touch on the six best methods to make a video longer.</p>
<p><strong>Loop the Video</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/make-video-longer-1.jpg"
                      alt="make-video-longer-"
                ></p>
<p>One of the best ways to make your video longer for most social media platforms is to loop the video. When you replay the video several times in a single row, it helps to multiply its length. An example is taking a 2-second video and looping it 4x. This automatically makes it into an 8-second video clip. With looping, you can simply replay the action of the clip rather than altering it in any way.</p>
<p>Many video editing software today allows you to loop your video for free. You have to upload the video and choose how many times you would like to loop it, and the software will get to work.</p>
<p><strong>Slow Down the Video Speed</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/make-video-longer-2.jpg"
                      alt="make-video-longer-"
                ></p>
<p>We would all agree that slow-motion makes everything seem longer automatically. You can utilize the same technique when you want to make a video longer. When you slow down a video clip, every second lasts longer. Using the slow-motion effect on a 3-second video will make the video 6 or even 9 seconds longer.</p>
<p><strong>Add an Intro and Outro</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/make-video-longer-3.jpg"
                      alt="make-video-longer-"
                ></p>
<p>Intro and outro are scenes you add before and after the video; these scenes are popular in YouTube videos. More generally, an intro is like a trailer. It shows the audience what the video is about, and the outro scene is usually used to show more information about the video maker. Adding an intro and outro to your video can add 2-4 seconds to your video clips.</p>
<p>It’s quite easy to add an intro and outro to any video. You can create them separately and then merge them with your video. The intro must be something relevant to the video clip; an example is adding a fast photo slideshow to the beginning of your video or a black frame. Relevant intro and outro scenes will make your video longer and maybe more engaging.</p>
<p><strong>Add Images to the Video</strong></p>
<p>This is another trick that most bloggers use to make their videos longer. It is an old trick in the book and makes your video significantly longer, depending on the number of videos you’re adding. A single picture can add a second or two to your video. You can simply use a video editor to merge the video clip and pictures into one seamless file.</p>
<p><strong>Boomerang Your Video</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/make-video-longer-4.jpg"
                      alt="make-video-longer-"
                ></p>
<p>If you have plans to upload your media to Instagram, then a top feature you can use to make your video longer is the boomerang feature. Instagram introduced the Boomerang feature to play short video clips forward and then repeat their reverse. So by using the Boomerang feature, you don’t only add a memory effect to your video, but you also make your video longer.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can manually append your video clip to a reversed version; this option allows you to make a boomerang from an existing clip. Apart from Instagram, you can utilize many other editing tools to create a boomerang from an existing video.</p>
<p><strong>Add More Content to Your Video Clip</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/make-video-longer-5.jpg"
                      alt="make-video-longer-"
                ></p>
<p>Another step you can take is to add more materials to your video. This doesn’t necessarily mean you have to get your camera out and start shooting more scenes to add to your video. Instead, you can simply access online media libraries and get amazing materials from there that are relevant to your video clip.</p>
<p>Today, most professional video editors offer you access to royalty-free photos and music material. You can simply browse through their collections and pick materials relevant to your video. For example, you could add a soundtrack and videos or GIFs that make your videos engaging. Adding extra content to your video clip can make it longer by 10 seconds.</p>

<p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>
<p>Social media platforms are great for gaining recognition and promoting your brand. However, there are times when you don’t meet the right video length, and you would like to make your video longer. With the six methods explained above, you can make your video as long as you want and also make your video more engaging. Additionally, you can use Wondershare Filmora to make your video more professional-looking. It offers you hundreds of effects and filters you can use to optimize your video.</p>
<p><strong>Meta Description:</strong> If your video is short and you need to make it longer, this article gives you six methods to make a video longer and optimize them.</p>
<p>One of the best ways to make your video longer for most social media platforms is to loop the video. When you replay the video several times in a single row, it helps to multiply its length. An example is taking a 2-second video and looping it 4x. This automatically makes it into an 8-second video clip. With looping, you can simply replay the action of the clip rather than altering it in any way.</p>
<p>Many video editing software today allows you to loop your video for free. You have to upload the video and choose how many times you would like to loop it, and the software will get to work.</p>
<p><strong>Slow Down the Video Speed</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="make-video-longer-"
                ></p>
<p>We would all agree that slow-motion makes everything seem longer automatically. You can utilize the same technique when you want to make a video longer. When you slow down a video clip, every second lasts longer. Using the slow-motion effect on a 3-second video will make the video 6 or even 9 seconds longer.</p>
<p><strong>Add an Intro and Outro</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="make-video-longer-"
                ></p>
<p>Intro and outro are scenes you add before and after the video; these scenes are popular in YouTube videos. More generally, an intro is like a trailer. It shows the audience what the video is about, and the outro scene is usually used to show more information about the video maker. Adding an intro and outro to your video can add 2-4 seconds to your video clips.</p>
<p>It’s quite easy to add an intro and outro to any video. You can create them separately and then merge them with your video. The intro must be something relevant to the video clip; an example is adding a fast photo slideshow to the beginning of your video or a black frame. Relevant intro and outro scenes will make your video longer and maybe more engaging.</p>
<p><strong>Add Images to the Video</strong></p>
<p>This is another trick that most bloggers use to make their videos longer. It is an old trick in the book and makes your video significantly longer, depending on the number of videos you’re adding. A single picture can add a second or two to your video. You can simply use a video editor to merge the video clip and pictures into one seamless file.</p>
<p><strong>Boomerang Your Video</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

The impact of content depends on how many people see it. It means finding new ways to get it into real and virtual places where customers and users might be.</p>
<p>Depending on the context, podcasting can be a perfect alternative for sharing content.</p>
<p>This article will address your questions about the easiest way to turn a blog into a podcast. Let’s begin with the reasons why you should do a podcast.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Why-You-Should-Podcast"><a href="#Part-1-Why-You-Should-Podcast" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Why You Should Podcast"></a>Part 1. Why You Should Podcast</h2><p>Podcasts are one of the simplest and most cost-effective ways. It helps to advertise yourself and your products to a highly targeted audience.

<h3 id="Repurposing-of-Content"><a href="#Repurposing-of-Content" class="headerlink" title="Repurposing of Content"></a>Repurposing of Content</h3><p>Podcasters can maximize their potential for successful episodes and repurposing their podcast into multiple content pieces.</p>
<p>This podcasting strategy can help you reach more people by putting your podcasts on more channels and engaging more people who might be interested.</p>
<h3 id="More-Fulfilling-than-Articles"><a href="#More-Fulfilling-than-Articles" class="headerlink" title="More Fulfilling than Articles"></a>More Fulfilling than Articles</h3><p>Unlike music, news, TV, and social media, podcast listeners don’t have to watch the screen like they do with YouTube videos or TV shows. This means they can listen while walking or driving home from work.</p>
<p>Podcasts are the best way to get people to pay attention and make fundamental societal changes. They can keep people interested for a long time, so you can go into detail and get personal without turning off your audience.</p>
<h3 id="Minimal-Start-Up-Costs"><a href="#Minimal-Start-Up-Costs" class="headerlink" title="Minimal Start-Up Costs"></a>Minimal Start-Up Costs</h3><p>To start a podcast, you can spend a little money. Even some of the most famous podcasts use a microphone, a computer, and software for recording. But it’s common to spend more money on advertising and better hosting.</p>
<p>Starting a podcast doesn’t cost much, as you can get everything you need for about $145.</p>
<h3 id="Expansion-of-Search-Potential"><a href="#Expansion-of-Search-Potential" class="headerlink" title="Expansion of Search Potential"></a>Expansion of Search Potential</h3><p>In the past few years, many big brands and small to medium-sized businesses have started using podcasts as a marketing strategy. This is because podcasts are becoming more and more popular and can help raise your company’s profile.</p>
<p>Podcasting is another way to disseminate your study to a broader audience, whether that audience consists of policymakers or interested citizens.</p>
<h3 id="Potential-to-Monetize"><a href="#Potential-to-Monetize" class="headerlink" title="Potential to Monetize"></a>Potential to Monetize</h3><p>Using an affiliate program podcast, you can earn money. Businesses can increase their income by offering paid advertising sponsorships to monetize podcasts. Suppose you accept an affiliate offer to sell ads. In that case, you become the company’s voice and put recorded ads in your podcast episodes.</p>
<p>The most common way to make money from a podcast is through sponsorship. It’s also the easiest way to make money because you don’t have to make or sell anything. You just have to make a deal with a sponsor.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Why-Are-Writers-Hesitant-to-Start-a-Podcast"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Are-Writers-Hesitant-to-Start-a-Podcast" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Why Are Writers Hesitant to Start a Podcast?"></a>Part 2. Why Are Writers Hesitant to Start a Podcast?</h2><p>Even after knowing all these benefits, writers are still hesitant to start a podcast. One of the main reasons a writer may be reluctant to launch a podcast is the cost of the necessary equipment. You will need at least $80 to $500 for this unpromissing business.</p>
<p>However, let me tell you a secret that many podcastors didn’t buy any audio equipment for the launch of their podcast channel on Spotify.</p>
<p>Moreover, many writers don’t want to show their voice through recordings. This is because they couldn’t just make a recording and hand it off to a sound specialist. Besides, finding their voice through the stories they write is the routine.</p>
<p>But we all need to get the truth that many podcastors don’t record a single word of the podcast with their own voice. Due to a solution: text-to-speech, technology like this has been around for a while and continues to improve.</p>
<p>The two important issues have been solved, so what are you waiting for? Platform building has always relied heavily on content marketing. With blog posts and social media, additional support was provided, and now podcasts are becoming more commonplace.</p>

How to Turn a Text Into a Podcast?</h2><h3 id="Text-To-Speech"><a href="#Text-To-Speech" class="headerlink" title="Text To Speech"></a>Text To Speech</h3><p>To turn your text into audible content, Text-to-speech (TTS) is an assistive technology. With a single click, TTS reads your written text aloud. Many people also use it for writing and editing to maintain audience concentration.</p>
<p>Text-to-speech technology is compatible with all digital devices, including computers, tablets, and smartphones. Increasing numbers of websites and products now have developed this function. For example, you can find it within the trusted video editing software like Filmora.

<p><strong>Why we regard text to speech as a good</strong></p>
<p>For writers, imagination is the only tool to construct their stories. To bring our stories to life, all we need is a laptop. The same holds for text-to-speech technologies, which can significantly assist writing and editing by allowing the author to hear their words without using their voice.</p>
<ul>
<li>Text-to-speech applications can assist you in repurposing your material.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your written work can be converted into spoken language or a podcast. A podcast can be converted into a YouTube video with a few alterations. All of these factors can help you reach new audiences.</p>
<p>Repurposing material permits your audience to consume it in a variety of ways. The audience can read, listen to, or view your content.</p>
<ul>
<li>Text-to-speech systems enable authors to create information that is accessible.</li>
</ul>
<p>As per World Health Organization, there are almost 285 million visually impaired persons and 39 million blind people. We writers can create a more inclusive world by constantly keeping accessibility in mind.</p>
<p><strong>The limitations of text to speech</strong></p>
<p>Text-to-speech software is becoming increasingly lifelike thanks to technological advancements. However, it cannot still express genuine human emotions. However, this should allow you to utilize these tools. The positives significantly exceed the disadvantages, and technology is continually improving.</p>
