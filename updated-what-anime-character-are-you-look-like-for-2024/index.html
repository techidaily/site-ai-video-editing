<p><strong>Specific Personality Traits: The Pragmatic Ones</strong></p>
<p>The pragmatic personality trait belongs to those who prefer a logical approach over an emotional one while making important decisions. If you have a pragmatic nature, you might stick to the straightforward attitude of looking at things, ahead of inclining towards the empathetic side. Entering into the anime world, you may find a series of characters resembling this specific aspect of your personality. One such character example is Kiritsugu Emiya from the anime series called Fate&#x2F;Zero.</p>
<p>Talking about the character in some detail, this character has a habit of sacrificing the smaller assets while hoping for bigger and greater opportunities. The habit eventually forces him to take certain painful and unwanted decisions. Mentioning a personal aspect, this one is a relatable character trait to my own personality. Considering the fact that I myself follow the line of logic to find out solutions to challenges and situations, I bear a complete resemblance with the character.</p>
<p>A downside of the pragmatic traits is their double faceted appearance to the viewers in case the latter fail to interpret the character in a correct form. It is a common assumption about these characters is that they wear a pretentious form to hide the actual aspects of personality from the onlookers.</p>

The following are some of the most frequently encountered issues when using KMPlayer to rotate video.</p>
<ul>
<li>After rotating a video, the video appears without a black bar, which may be irritating to some of you who are used to seeing black bars. In addition, there is no workaround for this because it is the default setting of the software.</li>
<li>You may occasionally receive an error message such as “class not registered,” which will cause your videos to be closed while you are watching them.</li>
<li>Additionally, the screen may turn blue.</li>
<li>The message “Login required” appears from time to time, which is a source of considerable irritation.</li>
<li>It is also not uncommon to see that some portions of a media file are able to run while other portions of the same media file are unable to run.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we talk about reliable and affordable alternatives to KM Player, Wonder Share Filmora is the best alternative for rotating videos.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that it is one of the most user-friendly pieces of software currently available, this video spinning software achieves its goal without sacrificing image quality in the process.

<p>Users have been experiencing difficulties while editing films on the platform, according to the company, and the most recent update to Filmora includes a new manual rotation option in the video editing interface, which the company claims will alleviate this issue.</p>
<p>As a result, users no longer have to be concerned about films reverting to their original position when exporting videos to other formats because they can rotate videos to any angle they desire.</p>

Whether you have a real mouseless experience or want to take it as a challenge, let’s get the things clear first.</p>
<ul>
<li>We need to create a <strong>20 seconds</strong> music video.</li>
<li>We will only be using the footage from the <strong>stock library</strong>.</li>
<li>We will be using music from the <strong>Wondershare</strong> Filmora <strong>library</strong>.</li>
<li>We will have 5 minutes to <strong>review</strong> the footage and the music available.</li>
<li>And most importantly, we don’t have a <strong>keyboard</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Step 1. Review your footage</p>
<p>Our first and most crucial step will be to use our imagination and creativity. So get those neurons firing, and let us go!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="reviewing the footage"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Head to the <strong>stock media</strong> folder on the bar mentioned above, the Wondershare Filmora.</li>
<li>Or you can simply look towards the left window, where you will find the sample <strong>videos tab.</strong></li>
<li>Click on the sample videos tab, and a new <strong>window</strong> will appear on the library screen.</li>
<li>Here you will find almost more than <strong>20 videos.</strong></li>
<li>So apart from using the actual recorded footage, we will work our way with what we have from <strong>default</strong>.</li>
<li>For the music, we would be scrolling in the <strong>stock audio library.</strong></li>
<li>Click on the <strong>audio tab</strong> above and start <strong>scrolling</strong>.</li>
<li>You will also find some categories in the <strong>left window</strong>.</li>
<li>Choose the category of your choice and <strong>listen</strong> to the audio.</li>
</ul>
<p>Do whatever suit you best. Keep in mind you only have 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Step 2. Pick music for your clips</p>
<p>Suppose you have found audio that speaks your vibe. The next step would be to find a video that tallies that audio. Let us suppose we have audio that is of the hip-hop genre. Let that creativity shine now!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="drone shot of rooftops"
                ></p>
<p>If you like to add a more <strong>classical vibe</strong>, pick a classical song or audio from the audio library.</p>
<ul>
<li>After picking the song, move on to the sample videos tab and search for videos that match a <strong>classic vibe.</strong></li>
<li>Now random <strong>close-up shots</strong> of a piano, cinematic footage of a big <strong>orchestra</strong>, or simple landscapes with minimalistic movement while focusing on a single object, consider the example below.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p>Now that a scenario is constructed, our next step is to arrange these clips in the Wondershare Filmora timeline.</p>
<p>Step 3. Download the clips and audio</p>
<p><strong>You have 15 minutes to create the music video. Start the timer!</strong> Once you have selected a sample video and audio that matches your scenario, you can <strong>download</strong> them from the bottom right icon on the thumbnail. Only if you still need to download them.</p>
<p>Step 4. Insert the audio into the timeline</p>
<ul>
<li>The first step is to drag the audio to the <strong>timeline</strong>.</li>
<li>Now play the <strong>audio</strong> from the start. If you can work with the audio as a whole, then it’s perfect.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want your audio to <strong>start</strong> at a certain point. You have to follow the below-mentioned steps. It is as simple as that!</p>

<li><strong>Right-click</strong> on the audio file. Select split.</li>
<li>Your audio file will split into two parts.</li>
<li>Delete the prior file and drag the file ahead to the start of the timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p>The next step is to add the videos to the timeline.</p>
<p>Step 5. Add the video to the timeline</p>
<p>When you have your audio in the timeline, your next step is adding the video. After you have trimmed or split your audio to your wish, follow the below steps.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Click</strong> and <strong>drag</strong> to drop the video clips where you want the video to start.</li>
<li><strong>Play</strong> the audio first is a good feature for where you want your video to insert.</li>
<li>Then adjust the <strong>timeline</strong> slider on that point.</li>
<li>Simply drag your video and drop it into the timeline.</li>
</ul>
