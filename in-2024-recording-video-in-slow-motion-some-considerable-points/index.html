It’s the only way to highlight important aspects of sports and action scenes. Recording in slow motion is not difficult when you will learn <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>how to record slow-motion video</strong></a>. Before learning, let’s understand important aspects you should look at while recording.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Frame Rate:</strong> For slow-motion video, choosing the right frame rate is crucial. A higher framerate, such as 120fps and 240fps, allows smoother playback. So, before recording, ensure that your camera supports a good framerate.</li>
<li><strong>Resolution:</strong> Maintaining high-resolution videos is important to get good quality. Usually, slow-motion footage uses 4K and HD (High Definition) resolution. Having a high video resolution means providing clarity in details in videos.</li>
<li><strong>Shutter Speed:</strong> It refers to the speed at which the camera closes and controls exposure. Adjust the shutter speed to faster mode to capture every crisp in slow motion. It will prevent motion blur and help in freezing fast-moving objects.</li>
<li><strong>Audio Consideration:</strong> You should know that recording slow motion will affect the original audio. Meanwhile, some cameras preserve the original sound. So, be prepared and test your camera’s audio speed to ease the editing process.</li>
<li><strong>Focus and Stability:</strong> Minimize your camera shake and enable a stabilizer or tripod. Stable footage is essential to enhance the video quality. Moreover, try to keep your main subject in camera focus. In this regard, you can use manual focus control if necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Editing Software Compatibility:</strong> Another thing that you must consider is tool compatibility. It’s better to check it before recording so you will not regret it later. Check your editing tools are supporting the file format of the recorded slow-motion video.</li>
<li><strong>Storage Space:</strong> The <strong>“</strong>No More Storage” sign is a nightmare when you have recorded a perfect shot. Slow-motion videos consume large storage because of high resolution and frame rate. Thus, consider this aspect before recording to avoid inconvenience and arrange storage media.</li>
</ul>

A phenomenon that arises here is, can we slow down the normally recorded video? The simple answer is yes. There are many editing apps designed for this purpose. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html" >Adobe Premiere Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is one such editing app to slow down the pre-recorded videos.</p>
<h5 id="Step-1-2"><a href="#Step-1-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h5><p>Access your Adobe Premiere Pro application and import a video in the timeline. Identify the frame rate of your video clip for a non-choppy playback.</p>

It’s the only way to highlight important aspects of sports and action scenes. Recording in slow motion is not difficult when you will learn <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>how to record slow-motion video</strong></a>. Before learning, let’s understand important aspects you should look at while recording.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Frame Rate:</strong> For slow-motion video, choosing the right frame rate is crucial. A higher framerate, such as 120fps and 240fps, allows smoother playback. So, before recording, ensure that your camera supports a good framerate.</li>
<li><strong>Resolution:</strong> Maintaining high-resolution videos is important to get good quality. Usually, slow-motion footage uses 4K and HD (High Definition) resolution. Having a high video resolution means providing clarity in details in videos.</li>
<li><strong>Shutter Speed:</strong> It refers to the speed at which the camera closes and controls exposure. Adjust the shutter speed to faster mode to capture every crisp in slow motion. It will prevent motion blur and help in freezing fast-moving objects.</li>
<li><strong>Audio Consideration:</strong> You should know that recording slow motion will affect the original audio. Meanwhile, some cameras preserve the original sound. So, be prepared and test your camera’s audio speed to ease the editing process.</li>
<li><strong>Focus and Stability:</strong> Minimize your camera shake and enable a stabilizer or tripod. Stable footage is essential to enhance the video quality. Moreover, try to keep your main subject in camera focus. In this regard, you can use manual focus control if necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Editing Software Compatibility:</strong> Another thing that you must consider is tool compatibility. It’s better to check it before recording so you will not regret it later. Check your editing tools are supporting the file format of the recorded slow-motion video.</li>
<li><strong>Storage Space:</strong> The <strong>“</strong>No More Storage” sign is a nightmare when you have recorded a perfect shot. Slow-motion videos consume large storage because of high resolution and frame rate. Thus, consider this aspect before recording to avoid inconvenience and arrange storage media.</li>
</ul>

A phenomenon that arises here is, can we slow down the normally recorded video? The simple answer is yes. There are many editing apps designed for this purpose. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html" >Adobe Premiere Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is one such editing app to slow down the pre-recorded videos.</p>
<h5 id="Step-1-5"><a href="#Step-1-5" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h5><p>Access your Adobe Premiere Pro application and import a video in the timeline. Identify the frame rate of your video clip for a non-choppy playback.</p>

They provide you with the essential tools to make the best GIFs out of any video you want.</p>
<p>So here is a step-by-step method to help you make your GIFs in Photoshop and impress your friends.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: One of the most important steps is to choose the video you want to use in your GIF. GIFs are supposed to be short and express what you want to in that concise sequence, and that’s why choosing a correct sequence of the right length is very important.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now you will have to download the video file to your computer and continue to trim it down to as few frames as possible, and choose the frames that convey the message as accurately as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Import the video to Photoshop by going to “File” &gt; “Import” &gt; “Video frames to layers.” Choose the video file you need, and it will appear in the form of separate frames. Now you can select whether you want the entire video or small bits of it; you can also limit the import to any frame to manage the size and time of the video. You can choose different color gradients and many other things according to your preference. And then go to “file” and select “save for web.”</p>

They provide you with the essential tools to make the best GIFs out of any video you want.</p>
<p>So here is a step-by-step method to help you make your GIFs in Photoshop and impress your friends.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: One of the most important steps is to choose the video you want to use in your GIF. GIFs are supposed to be short and express what you want to in that concise sequence, and that’s why choosing a correct sequence of the right length is very important.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now you will have to download the video file to your computer and continue to trim it down to as few frames as possible, and choose the frames that convey the message as accurately as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Import the video to Photoshop by going to “File” &gt; “Import” &gt; “Video frames to layers.” Choose the video file you need, and it will appear in the form of separate frames. Now you can select whether you want the entire video or small bits of it; you can also limit the import to any frame to manage the size and time of the video. You can choose different color gradients and many other things according to your preference. And then go to “file” and select “save for web.”</p>

They provide you with the essential tools to make the best GIFs out of any video you want.</p>
<p>So here is a step-by-step method to help you make your GIFs in Photoshop and impress your friends.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: One of the most important steps is to choose the video you want to use in your GIF. GIFs are supposed to be short and express what you want to in that concise sequence, and that’s why choosing a correct sequence of the right length is very important.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now you will have to download the video file to your computer and continue to trim it down to as few frames as possible, and choose the frames that convey the message as accurately as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Import the video to Photoshop by going to “File” &gt; “Import” &gt; “Video frames to layers.” Choose the video file you need, and it will appear in the form of separate frames. Now you can select whether you want the entire video or small bits of it; you can also limit the import to any frame to manage the size and time of the video. You can choose different color gradients and many other things according to your preference. And then go to “file” and select “save for web.”</p>

Read This"></a>Want to Convert MP4 Video To 60 FPS GIF? Read This</h2><p>GIFs have become a popular way to share short and engaging videos online. They are widely used on social media platforms and messaging apps, making it easy to share moments, reactions, and emotions with friends and family. But not all GIFs are created equal. Some GIFs can look choppy and low-quality, detracting from the viewing experience.</p>
<p>To improve the quality of your GIFs, you can convert your MP4 videos to 60 FPS (frames per second). This will give your GIFs a smooth, fluid motion that looks professional and visually appealing. In this article, we’ll go over the steps you need to follow to convert your MP4 videos to 60 FPS GIFs and create high-quality GIFs that are perfect for sharing online.</p>

<h2 id="Why-Convert-MP4-to-60-FPS-GIF"><a href="#Why-Convert-MP4-to-60-FPS-GIF" class="headerlink" title="Why Convert MP4 to 60-FPS GIF?"></a>Why Convert MP4 to 60-FPS GIF?</h2><p>GIFs are a great way to share short, eye-catching videos online, but not all are made the same. GIFs with low frame rates tend to look choppy, and the motion could be smoother, making the video look unprofessional and detracting from the overall viewing experience. On the other hand, GIFs with higher frame rates look smoother, and the motion is more fluid, making the video more visually appealing.</p>
<p>Converting your MP4 videos to GIFs has several benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Smoother Motion:</strong> By converting MP4s to GIFs, you increase the frame rate of your GIFs, giving them a smoother and more fluid motion.</li>
<li><strong>Increased Detail:</strong> Higher frame rates allow for more detail and clarity in fast-moving scenes, making the video more engaging and easier to watch.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced Ghosting:</strong> A higher frame rate reduces the “ghosting” effect in low-frame rate GIFs, making the video clearer and reducing distractions.</li>
<li><strong>High-Quality Videos:</strong> Converting MP4s to GIFs eliminates the ghosting effect and creates high-quality GIFs that are perfect for sharing online.</li>
<li><strong>Increased Engagement:</strong> High-quality GIFs will engage and entertain your audience, making them more likely to share and interact with your content.</li>
</ul>
<p>Converting MP4s to GIFs is a great way to improve the overall quality of your GIFs and create visually appealing videos that are perfect for sharing online. Whether you’re sharing a reaction, a moment, or an emotion, a high-quality GIF will engage and entertain your audience.</p>
<h3 id="Can-I-Get-a-60-FPS-GIF"><a href="#Can-I-Get-a-60-FPS-GIF" class="headerlink" title="Can I Get a 60 FPS GIF?"></a>Can I Get a 60 FPS GIF?</h3><p>While it’s true that many people search for 60 FPS GIFs, it’s important to understand that there is no such thing as a true 60 FPS GIF.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>GIFs are an image format designed to display simple animations. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF" >GIF files store delay time between frames <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which is defined as multiples of 1&#x2F;100th of a second. Value 1 would give you 100 FPS; value 2 would already have half of 100 FPS, that is, 50 FPS; value 3 would give you 33.3 FPS GIF, etc. So there are 20 FPS GIFs, 33.3 FPS GIFs, 50 FPS GIFs, and 100 FPS GIFs.</p>
<p>In addition, many websites or programs (including Google Chrome) ignore value 1 (100 FPS GIFs) and default to a much slower animation speed when viewing GIF files. Therefore, 100 FPS GIFs are technically possible but are rarely used. Value 2 (50 FPS) is the most you can get.</p>
<p>If you want to create high-quality animations, consider using MP4s or alternative image formats better suited for high frame rates and detailed animations.</p>
<p>That being said, some websites may have a “60 FPS GIFs” category, but it’s important to understand that most of the content in these categories is not 60 FPS. Instead, it’s likely to be either an MP4 video or a GIF with a lower frame rate, like 50 FPS, labeled as “60 FPS” for marketing purposes.</p>
<h2 id="Is-There-Any-60-FPS-GIF-Maker"><a href="#Is-There-Any-60-FPS-GIF-Maker" class="headerlink" title="Is There Any 60 FPS GIF Maker?"></a>Is There Any 60 FPS GIF Maker?</h2><p>Unfortunately, there is no such thing as a 60 FPS GIF maker. As mentioned before, there is no 60 FPS GIF, so it is impossible to create a 60 FPS GIF using traditional methods. However, many excellent video-to-GIF converters in the market allow you to set the GIF frame rate.</p>
<p>These video-to-GIF converters allow you to convert MP4 videos to GIFs with a higher frame rate, which can give your GIFs a smoother and more fluid motion. While these GIFs may not be 60 FPS, they can still provide a significant quality improvement compared to traditional GIFs.</p>

<h2 id="People-Also-Ask"><a href="#People-Also-Ask" class="headerlink" title="People Also Ask"></a>People Also Ask</h2><p>Here are some of the most frequently asked questions about converting MP4 to GIF and other related topics:</p>
<h4 id="Q1-Can-a-GIF-be-30-FPS"><a href="#Q1-Can-a-GIF-be-30-FPS" class="headerlink" title="Q1. Can a GIF be 30 FPS?"></a>Q1. Can a GIF be 30 FPS?</h4><p>It is impossible to get an exact 30 FPS GIF. Frame rate refers to the number of images (frames) displayed per second in a video or animation. That frame rate is stored as an integer (n) that defines n&#x2F;100ths of a second. So you can specify a frame of 1&#x2F;100 second (100 FPS), 2&#x2F;100 second (50 FPS), 3&#x2F;100 second (33.33 FPS), 4&#x2F;100 second (25 FPS), etc. but not something like 3.3333…&#x2F;100 second (30 FPS).</p>
<h4 id="Q2-How-Do-I-Get-the-FPS-of-a-GIF"><a href="#Q2-How-Do-I-Get-the-FPS-of-a-GIF" class="headerlink" title="Q2. How Do I Get the FPS of a GIF?"></a>Q2. How Do I Get the FPS of a GIF?</h4><p>To determine the speed or frame rate of a GIF, you can use online tools that show the delay time between its frames in milliseconds. The frame rate of a GIF is calculated by counting how many delays fit in 1 second of animation. The delay time determines the playback speed and can be adjusted to increase or decrease the frame rate. These tools also allow you to preview the speed changes and compare the input and output GIFs.</p>
<h4 id="Q3-What-FPS-Should-a-GIF-Be"><a href="#Q3-What-FPS-Should-a-GIF-Be" class="headerlink" title="Q3. What FPS Should a GIF Be?"></a>Q3. What FPS Should a GIF Be?</h4><p>GIF files store delay time between frames in whole hundredths of a second. They typically run between 10 and 100 frames per second (FPS). The common frame rate for a GIF is 10 FPS, 20 FPS, 12.5 FPS, 25 FPS, and 50 FPS. With online tools, it’s possible to determine and change the speed of a GIF.</p>
<h4 id="Q4-What-Is-the-Max-FPS-for-a-GIF"><a href="#Q4-What-Is-the-Max-FPS-for-a-GIF" class="headerlink" title="Q4. What Is the Max FPS for a GIF?"></a>Q4. What Is the Max FPS for a GIF?</h4><p>The maximum fps for a GIF is 100 FPS, but browsers or consumer screens do not support it. The browser-engine image decoders will automatically reduce the framerate to 10 fps, playing it ten times slower. If a GIF appears slow, the browser has reset the speed to 10 fps. Some software and devices may support higher frame rates.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>GIF is a popular format for short animations and videos. The frame rate of a GIF determines its playback speed, which is usually set at 10, 20, 12.5, 25, and 50 per second. However, the highest possible frame rate that can be represented in the GIF format is 100 FPS, but most browsers and consumer screens cannot display it accurately.</p>
<p>There are various tools available, both online and desktop-based, that can convert videos to GIFs and adjust their frame rate as desired. With these tools, you can create high-quality, personalized GIFs that fit your specific needs and preferences.</p>

<h2 id="People-Also-Ask-1"><a href="#People-Also-Ask-1" class="headerlink" title="People Also Ask"></a>People Also Ask</h2><p>Here are some of the most frequently asked questions about converting MP4 to GIF and other related topics:</p>
<h4 id="Q1-Can-a-GIF-be-30-FPS-1"><a href="#Q1-Can-a-GIF-be-30-FPS-1" class="headerlink" title="Q1. Can a GIF be 30 FPS?"></a>Q1. Can a GIF be 30 FPS?</h4><p>It is impossible to get an exact 30 FPS GIF. Frame rate refers to the number of images (frames) displayed per second in a video or animation. That frame rate is stored as an integer (n) that defines n&#x2F;100ths of a second. So you can specify a frame of 1&#x2F;100 second (100 FPS), 2&#x2F;100 second (50 FPS), 3&#x2F;100 second (33.33 FPS), 4&#x2F;100 second (25 FPS), etc. but not something like 3.3333…&#x2F;100 second (30 FPS).</p>
<h4 id="Q2-How-Do-I-Get-the-FPS-of-a-GIF-1"><a href="#Q2-How-Do-I-Get-the-FPS-of-a-GIF-1" class="headerlink" title="Q2. How Do I Get the FPS of a GIF?"></a>Q2. How Do I Get the FPS of a GIF?</h4><p>To determine the speed or frame rate of a GIF, you can use online tools that show the delay time between its frames in milliseconds. The frame rate of a GIF is calculated by counting how many delays fit in 1 second of animation. The delay time determines the playback speed and can be adjusted to increase or decrease the frame rate. These tools also allow you to preview the speed changes and compare the input and output GIFs.</p>
<h4 id="Q3-What-FPS-Should-a-GIF-Be-1"><a href="#Q3-What-FPS-Should-a-GIF-Be-1" class="headerlink" title="Q3. What FPS Should a GIF Be?"></a>Q3. What FPS Should a GIF Be?</h4><p>GIF files store delay time between frames in whole hundredths of a second. They typically run between 10 and 100 frames per second (FPS). The common frame rate for a GIF is 10 FPS, 20 FPS, 12.5 FPS, 25 FPS, and 50 FPS. With online tools, it’s possible to determine and change the speed of a GIF.</p>
<h4 id="Q4-What-Is-the-Max-FPS-for-a-GIF-1"><a href="#Q4-What-Is-the-Max-FPS-for-a-GIF-1" class="headerlink" title="Q4. What Is the Max FPS for a GIF?"></a>Q4. What Is the Max FPS for a GIF?</h4><p>The maximum fps for a GIF is 100 FPS, but browsers or consumer screens do not support it. The browser-engine image decoders will automatically reduce the framerate to 10 fps, playing it ten times slower. If a GIF appears slow, the browser has reset the speed to 10 fps. Some software and devices may support higher frame rates.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>GIF is a popular format for short animations and videos. The frame rate of a GIF determines its playback speed, which is usually set at 10, 20, 12.5, 25, and 50 per second. However, the highest possible frame rate that can be represented in the GIF format is 100 FPS, but most browsers and consumer screens cannot display it accurately.</p>
<p>There are various tools available, both online and desktop-based, that can convert videos to GIFs and adjust their frame rate as desired. With these tools, you can create high-quality, personalized GIFs that fit your specific needs and preferences.</p>

After discussing about the ways to make Mac compatible slideshow presentations on external software platforms, as well as on the device itself, let us now have an insight into the process of creating slideshows on online utilities in the following section:</p>
<p><strong>User’s Guide to Create Online Slideshow Presentations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Launch a Preferred Online Tool</strong></p>
<p>In any of your favorite web browsers, navigate to and launch any desired online slideshow creator tool from its official website. As of now, let us proceed with using the Kapwing video slideshow maker.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Upload Media Files</strong></p>
<p>Browse through the media gallery of your device to select and upload the desired set of images, GIFs and videos to the Kapwing video slideshow maker online tool. You can also ‘Drag and Drop’ the media directly to the tool’s editor workspace.</p>

                ></p>
<p>In addition to choosing media files from your device, you can directly import the same from online sources, like, YouTube, Twitter, etc., by copying the media link and pasting it within the tool’s media URL box. The Kapwing slideshow maker allows you to work with a series of media file formats, such as, MOV, JPG, GIF, MP4, PNG, among others.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Sort and Edit Your Presentation</strong></p>
<p>Once all the media files are imported to the workspace, you can use the ‘Slideshow Preview’ to sort the Images and videos within the presentation in a desired sequence of appearance. As far as editing the slideshow is concerned, you can set the orientation of the slides to landscape, square or a 9:16 aspect ratio.</p>
<p>There are options to crop the images and videos to include specific sections, while simultaneously adjusting their screen time. You can further, complement the presentation with a cohesive soundtrack in the background and include different graphic elements, like, stickers, titles and text annotations to craft the perfect slideshow.</p>

The Kapwing video maker will now transform your media into an MP4 slideshow presentation, which you are free to either save locally in your device, or share with your social media peers.</p>
