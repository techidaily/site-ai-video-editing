It all started when I filmed a certain place during a trip and somebody told me to upload it on YouTube. At first, I was hesitant doing that because I have no clue of what is YouTube. So, I did research and got curious, so I decided to upload the video. Time went by and I started to learn how to vlog.</p>

<li>A teaser – wherein your aim is to caught the attention of your viewers.</li>
<li>An intro – what is your channel all about.</li>
<li>The body of the vlog – the part wherein you’re explaining everything in depth, elaborating things about the topic you chose to share. In this part, you can insert the so called <strong>“<strong>call of action</strong>“</strong> - wherein you can tell your viewers to subscribe, to like and comment something about your vlog you’re tackling.

My YouTube journey was not as easy that even my friends didn’t recognize my endeavors. But still, I continue what I’m doing because I love it. It’s a hobby that at the same time, I’m learning something new on the process. And also, with the help of vlogging, I’m starting to gain my self-esteem that I forgot for many years back.</p>

<p>What Have I Encountered on the Way</p>
<p>It’s not easy to become a Youtuber, because you, yourself is the only one that you’ve got. You are the director – managing everything all at once. The artist (youtuber) - the one who’s going to talk in front of the camera. The scriptwriter – the one who’s in charge of the whole story of the video and even the editor- the one who’ll edit the video afterwards.</p>
<p>On YouTube platform, you have to be consistent. It doesn’t mean that you need to upload a video thrice in a week, but even a video will do. After all, it’s quality over quantity. You’ll have to think what kind of video you’ll upload because you need to give your viewers or audiences something significant out of your vlog. YouTube is the second largest search engine next to Google, so most of the people are searching for answers to their questions. Or even searching solutions to their problems. So, if you have something to offer, why not share it for free.</p>
<p>If you’re a new YouTuber, you don’t need to have high-end equipment’s for vlogging. Anyone can start up by using his&#x2F;her mobile phone. I used to vlog using my Samsung S-6. Mobile phone nowadays, can record a high-definition resolution. You can add a tripod so that your phone can be sturdy during your filming session. Just film during day time so that you can minimize yourself from buying a ring light. A lavalier microphone can be a useful add-on so that your viewers or audiences can hear your voice clearly.</p>

What to Do As a YouTuber</h2><p>As a Youtuber, you should find your own niche. Something that you’re passionate about. Something denoting products, services, or interests that appeal to a small, specialized section of the population. Something that you’re a hundred percent that you can deliver to them loud and clear.</p>

<p>What to Do As a YouTuber</p>
<p>As a YouTuber, you should be yourself in front of the camera. At first it will be awkward, but in time you’ll get used to it. Speak with your heart and not with your mind because when you start to think of the things that you need to say, you’ll get distracted. But when you speak whatever is in your heart at that very moment, you can create miracles and wonders.</p>
<p>It’s okay that you stutter once in a while. Even a reporter experiencing that kind of phenomena and besides, no one is perfect. Everything that you said unnecessarily can be omitted during the editing process. During editing, the first thing that you need to do is to put all the raw videos in your video editor’s timeline. Cut all the unnecessary part specially the so called, <strong>“<strong>dead air</strong>“</strong> or the part that you’re starting to think and not to talk at all. And your viewers can only see are all dead silence. After that you can add your personal touch. You can add your watermark (your trademark in other words), lower third green screens, subtitle if necessary (the hardest part to be honest) if you’re doing it manually. Some cool stickers, effects and transitions.</p>

<li><strong>Storytelling:</strong> Make sure the slow-motion clip supports the idea you’re attempting to portray. Your scenes will have more impact if you tell them with a thoughtful narrative.</li>
<li><strong>Editing:</strong> Try different speeds when editing your clip to achieve the best impact. Consider including sound effects or music to accompany the slow-motion images.</li>
<li><strong>Timing:</strong> Select the appropriate times to record in slow motion. You shouldn’t slow down your entire video. Instead, you can apply the effect to draw attention to acts or feelings.</li>
<li><strong>Frame Rate:</strong> Slow-motion videos are usually shot at a greater frame rate. Frame rates of 60, 120, 240, or even higher are common as they make the video look smoother.</li>
<li><strong>Shutter Speed:</strong> For precise and sharp results, use a fast shutter speed camera. This lessens the likelihood of motion blur in every slow-motion frame.</li>

<p>This article will dive into how you can access the modern-day features available in video editing software. From these features, you can alter the speed of your video easily. However, before we get into the step-by-step guide, let’s understand what fast and slow-mo videos are.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-Are-Fast-and-Slow-Motion-Videos"><a href="#Part-1-What-Are-Fast-and-Slow-Motion-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Are Fast and Slow Motion Videos?"></a>Part 1. What Are Fast and Slow Motion Videos?</h2><p>As the name suggests, fast-motion videos are the ones that have been sped up from their average speed.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Similarly, slow-motion videos are the ones that have been slowed down from their average speed. The slow-motion effect, also known as the slow-mo effect, is widespread in modern cinema.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p>Now that we know what Fast and slow-motion videos are. Let’s understand their applications. Or how you can use them in your videos. Scroll below to learn more!</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Why-Should-You-Change-the-Speed-of-Your-Videos"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Should-You-Change-the-Speed-of-Your-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Why Should You Change the Speed of Your Videos?"></a>Part 2. Why Should You Change the Speed of Your Videos?</h2><p>The answer to this question would be that it’s a personal creative decision that will allow you to make your videos more engaging.</p>
<h3 id="Fast-Motion-Videos"><a href="#Fast-Motion-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Fast Motion Videos"></a>Fast Motion Videos</h3><p>Fast-motion videos are used in many areas of filming. For example, you can speed up your videos to create a funny video or shorten its length.</p>
<p>The fast-motion effect has many applications, such as cooking tutorial videos. For example, the step-by-step process of a cooking tutorial can be too long to fit into a single video. Or it could also help you in cases where you want to keep the length of the video short.</p>
<p>The fast motion of the steps will allow the viewer to quickly grasp the whole process without watching the entire video.</p>
<h3 id="Slow-Motion-Videos"><a href="#Slow-Motion-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Slow Motion Videos"></a>Slow Motion Videos</h3><p>You can also slow down your videos to give the viewers a more detailed perspective of a scene. Or you can also create a slow-mo video that offers a general surreal vibe.</p>
<p>A famous example is in action films. The producers of the first <strong>Matrix</strong> film used the Slow-mo effect in the famous bullet dodging scene.</p>
<p><img

<p>You may wonder how the film producers made the slow-mo effect. The technology at that time was less developed than the recent day. So, even you can create a slow-mo effect.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Drag</strong> the cursor to select the video clips you want.</li>
<li>Then, drop them in the Filmora import window.</li>

<p>Filmora supports various formats for your video clips. They include the <strong>Mp4</strong>,   <strong>AVI</strong>, <strong>MOV</strong>, <strong>GIFs,</strong> and more.</p>
<p>After you have imported your video clips, add them to the timeline as shown below!</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Add-The-Video-Clips-to-The-Timeline"><a href="#Step3-Add-The-Video-Clips-to-The-Timeline" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Add The Video Clips to The Timeline"></a>Step3 Add The Video Clips to The Timeline</h5><p>After you’ve imported clips in the Import window, drag them onto the timeline. Follow the steps outlined below to accomplish this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drag</strong> the clips into the import window and select them.</li>
<li>Then, <strong>insert</strong> them into the timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="wondershare filmora adding clips to the timeline"
                ></p>
<p>Now that we have our video clips in the timeline, we can start adjusting the speed.</p>
<h5 id="Step4-Open-the-Speed-Adjustment-Panel"><a href="#Step4-Open-the-Speed-Adjustment-Panel" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Open the Speed Adjustment Panel"></a>Step4 Open the Speed Adjustment Panel</h5><p>The speed adjustment panel, or the Uniform Speed, is the feature of Filmora that allows you to change the speed of your video. For example, to open the Unifrom Speed panel, do as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> on the video clip.</li>
<li>In the <strong>pop-up</strong> column, scroll down till you see the <strong>Unifrom Speed</strong> option and click on it.</li>
<li>The speed controls will be shown in the import window.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-8.png"
                      alt="wondershare filmora unifrom speed tab"
                ></p>
<p>In the speed control panel, you can see the speed adjuster slider. A number will usually mark this at the end. This number tells you the current speed your video is calibrated in and how fast or slow the motion effects will be.</p>
<p><strong>1.00</strong> is always the average speed. <strong>0.5</strong> being half and <strong>2.00</strong> being double the average speed. To control the speed through the slider, you will need to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>To increase the speed:</strong> Type in the number you want your rate to be. Or, drag the slider to the right as you wish.</li>
<li><strong>To decrease the speed:</strong> Type in a number less than the standard 1.00, or you can drag the slider to the left as you wish.</li>
</ul>
<p>The number of your speed can be an inconvenience if you have no prior experience. Instead, render the video and play it from the beginning with the changes that you made. It gives you a better idea of the speed of your video.</p>

<p>Wait till Wondershare Filmora finishes exporting your video. Then, another window will pop up for a reminder when the shipping is done.</p>
<p>These were the methods by which you can change the speed of your video using the Speed Adjustment panel. Now let’s move on to the following method to adjust the speed via the Duration panel.</p>
<h3 id="2-Change-Speed-via-the-Duration-Panel"><a href="#2-Change-Speed-via-the-Duration-Panel" class="headerlink" title="2. Change Speed via the Duration Panel"></a>2. Change Speed via the Duration Panel</h3><p>The duration panel is one the most valuable features of Wondershare Filmora as it allows you to change the video speed by duration adjustment.</p>
<p>This feature is typically helpful when you have a space between video clips and want to fill it. By measuring the time between the two clips, you can adjust the duration of your video.</p>
<p>It will ultimately hasten the speed of your video. The hastening in rate will depend upon the gap. The smaller the gap, the faster the video will be. Similarly, the greater the gap is, the longer the video will be.</p>
<p>Apart from the Speed Adjustment Panel, the Duration Panel has the advantage of editing the speed of your video by simply typing in the text.</p>
<h5 id="Step1-Import-Video-Clips-to-Timeline"><a href="#Step1-Import-Video-Clips-to-Timeline" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Import Video Clips to Timeline"></a>Step1 Import Video Clips to Timeline</h5><p>After downloading Filmora, the next step is importing your video clips. To do so, follow the steps outlined below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Locate and click the <strong>Import</strong> icon in the upper left corner of the Filmora Home Interface.</li>
<li>Choose the videos to be edited, then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that you have imported files into Filmora, you can add them to the Timeline. Notice the steps mentioned ahead:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drag the clips into the import window and select them.</li>
<li>Then, insert them into the timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can begin the editing process now that the clips are in the timeline.</p>
<h5 id="Step2-Open-The-Duration-Panel"><a href="#Step2-Open-The-Duration-Panel" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Open The Duration Panel"></a>Step2 Open The Duration Panel</h5><p>The Duration Panel comes attached to the <strong>Unifrom Speed Panel</strong>. To access the Duration Panel, follow the steps ahead:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Right-click</strong> on the video clip.</li>
<li>In the pop column, scroll below to <strong>Unifrom Speed</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>It will open the uniform speed panel in the import window. Below the speed of the controls, you can notice The Duration Panel.</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Change-The-Speed-of-The-Video"><a href="#Step3-Change-The-Speed-of-The-Video" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Change The Speed of The Video"></a>Step3 Change The Speed of The Video</h5><p>In The Duration Panel, you can see the average speed of your video clip. Now, if you want to <strong>reduce</strong> the speed of your video, you have to <strong>increase</strong> the duration of your video. Similarly, if you’re going to <strong>increase</strong> the speed of your video, you would have to <strong>decrease</strong> the duration.</p>
<h5 id="Slow-Down-The-Video"><a href="#Slow-Down-The-Video" class="headerlink" title="Slow Down The Video"></a>Slow Down The Video</h5><p>To slow down the video clip, follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li>In The Duration Panel, <strong>Increase</strong> the time of the video.</li>
<li>Type in a number bigger than the normal value</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the average speed of the video is <strong>00:01:00:00,</strong> increasing the value of the duration to <strong>00:02:00:00</strong> will reduce the speed of your video by half.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<h5 id="Speed-Up-The-Video"><a href="#Speed-Up-The-Video" class="headerlink" title="Speed Up The Video"></a>Speed Up The Video</h5><p>To increase the speed of your video, follow as guided ahead:</p>
<ul>
<li>In The Duration Panel, <strong>decrease</strong> the time of the video.</li>
<li>Type in a number smaller than the normal value</li>
</ul>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the normal video speed is <strong>00:01:00:00,</strong> decreasing the value of the duration to <strong>00:00:30:00</strong> will increase the speed of your video by double.</p>

<p>Filmora supports various formats for your video clips. They include the <strong>Mp4</strong>,   <strong>AVI</strong>, <strong>MOV</strong>, <strong>GIFs,</strong> and more.</p>
<p>After you have imported your video clips, add them to the timeline as shown below!</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Add-The-Video-Clips-to-The-Timeline-1"><a href="#Step3-Add-The-Video-Clips-to-The-Timeline-1" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Add The Video Clips to The Timeline"></a>Step3 Add The Video Clips to The Timeline</h5><p>After you’ve imported clips in the Import window, drag them onto the timeline. Follow the steps outlined below to accomplish this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drag</strong> the clips into the import window and select them.</li>
<li>Then, <strong>insert</strong> them into the timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-7.png"
                      alt="wondershare filmora adding clips to the timeline"
                ></p>
<p>Now that we have our video clips in the timeline, we can start adjusting the speed.</p>
<h5 id="Step4-Open-the-Speed-Adjustment-Panel-1"><a href="#Step4-Open-the-Speed-Adjustment-Panel-1" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Open the Speed Adjustment Panel"></a>Step4 Open the Speed Adjustment Panel</h5><p>The speed adjustment panel, or the Uniform Speed, is the feature of Filmora that allows you to change the speed of your video. For example, to open the Unifrom Speed panel, do as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> on the video clip.</li>
<li>In the <strong>pop-up</strong> column, scroll down till you see the <strong>Unifrom Speed</strong> option and click on it.</li>
<li>The speed controls will be shown in the import window.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-8.png"
                      alt="wondershare filmora unifrom speed tab"
                ></p>
<p>In the speed control panel, you can see the speed adjuster slider. A number will usually mark this at the end. This number tells you the current speed your video is calibrated in and how fast or slow the motion effects will be.</p>
<p><strong>1.00</strong> is always the average speed. <strong>0.5</strong> being half and <strong>2.00</strong> being double the average speed. To control the speed through the slider, you will need to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>To increase the speed:</strong> Type in the number you want your rate to be. Or, drag the slider to the right as you wish.</li>
<li><strong>To decrease the speed:</strong> Type in a number less than the standard 1.00, or you can drag the slider to the left as you wish.</li>
</ul>
<p>The number of your speed can be an inconvenience if you have no prior experience. Instead, render the video and play it from the beginning with the changes that you made. It gives you a better idea of the speed of your video.</p>

<h5 id="Step5-Detach-The-Audio-1"><a href="#Step5-Detach-The-Audio-1" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Detach The Audio"></a>Step5 Detach The Audio</h5><p>The corresponding audio also gets affected when you slow down or speed up a video. In this scenario, you can also choose to detach the audio beforehand. It allows you to maintain the original playback speed. To detach the audio, follow the steps as mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Right-click</strong> on the video clip.</li>
<li>In the pop-up column, scroll down to the <strong>Detach Audio</strong> option and click on it.</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                      alt="wondershare filmora detaching audio"
                ></p>
<p>It will create an audio file in a separate audio tab in the timeline. You can adjust this audio according to your liking. You can edit the detached audio by:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> on the audio file.</li>
<li>A settings menu will open in the import window.</li>
<li>Adjust the <strong>Fade</strong> options for your Audio.</li>
<li>Drag the <strong>Fade out</strong> slider to the right to Fade out your Audio.</li>
<li>To Fade in your Audio, drag the <strong>Fade in</strong> slider to the right.</li>
</ul>

                      alt="wondershare filmora adjusting detached audio"
                ></p>
<p>You can also remove the background noise and the pitch of the audio if you want. You can also replace the video’s original audio with a new one. Click on the audio file and press <strong>Del</strong> on the keyboard to delete it. To add new audio, do as mentioned ahead:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on The <strong>Audio</strong> icon above the import window.</li>
<li>Browse The Audio that matches the vibe of your video.</li>
<li>Drag and drop it below your video clip.</li>
</ul>

                ></p>
<p>Doing so would have created alternate audio for your video. Play the video from the start and confirm your changes.</p>

<p>Wait till Wondershare Filmora finishes exporting your video. Then, another window will pop up for a reminder when the shipping is done.</p>
<p>These were the methods by which you can change the speed of your video using the Speed Adjustment panel. Now let’s move on to the following method to adjust the speed via the Duration panel.</p>
<h3 id="2-Change-Speed-via-the-Duration-Panel-1"><a href="#2-Change-Speed-via-the-Duration-Panel-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Change Speed via the Duration Panel"></a>2. Change Speed via the Duration Panel</h3><p>The duration panel is one the most valuable features of Wondershare Filmora as it allows you to change the video speed by duration adjustment.</p>
<p>This feature is typically helpful when you have a space between video clips and want to fill it. By measuring the time between the two clips, you can adjust the duration of your video.</p>
<p>It will ultimately hasten the speed of your video. The hastening in rate will depend upon the gap. The smaller the gap, the faster the video will be. Similarly, the greater the gap is, the longer the video will be.</p>
<p>Apart from the Speed Adjustment Panel, the Duration Panel has the advantage of editing the speed of your video by simply typing in the text.</p>
<h5 id="Step1-Import-Video-Clips-to-Timeline-1"><a href="#Step1-Import-Video-Clips-to-Timeline-1" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Import Video Clips to Timeline"></a>Step1 Import Video Clips to Timeline</h5><p>After downloading Filmora, the next step is importing your video clips. To do so, follow the steps outlined below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Locate and click the <strong>Import</strong> icon in the upper left corner of the Filmora Home Interface.</li>
<li>Choose the videos to be edited, then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that you have imported files into Filmora, you can add them to the Timeline. Notice the steps mentioned ahead:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drag the clips into the import window and select them.</li>
<li>Then, insert them into the timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can begin the editing process now that the clips are in the timeline.</p>
<h5 id="Step2-Open-The-Duration-Panel-1"><a href="#Step2-Open-The-Duration-Panel-1" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Open The Duration Panel"></a>Step2 Open The Duration Panel</h5><p>The Duration Panel comes attached to the <strong>Unifrom Speed Panel</strong>. To access the Duration Panel, follow the steps ahead:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Right-click</strong> on the video clip.</li>
<li>In the pop column, scroll below to <strong>Unifrom Speed</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>It will open the uniform speed panel in the import window. Below the speed of the controls, you can notice The Duration Panel.</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Change-The-Speed-of-The-Video-1"><a href="#Step3-Change-The-Speed-of-The-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Change The Speed of The Video"></a>Step3 Change The Speed of The Video</h5><p>In The Duration Panel, you can see the average speed of your video clip. Now, if you want to <strong>reduce</strong> the speed of your video, you have to <strong>increase</strong> the duration of your video. Similarly, if you’re going to <strong>increase</strong> the speed of your video, you would have to <strong>decrease</strong> the duration.</p>
<h5 id="Slow-Down-The-Video-1"><a href="#Slow-Down-The-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="Slow Down The Video"></a>Slow Down The Video</h5><p>To slow down the video clip, follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li>In The Duration Panel, <strong>Increase</strong> the time of the video.</li>
<li>Type in a number bigger than the normal value</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the average speed of the video is <strong>00:01:00:00,</strong> increasing the value of the duration to <strong>00:02:00:00</strong> will reduce the speed of your video by half.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="wondershare filmora adjusting slowing down the video"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Speed-Up-The-Video-1"><a href="#Speed-Up-The-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="Speed Up The Video"></a>Speed Up The Video</h5><p>To increase the speed of your video, follow as guided ahead:</p>
<ul>
<li>In The Duration Panel, <strong>decrease</strong> the time of the video.</li>
<li>Type in a number smaller than the normal value</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the normal video speed is <strong>00:01:00:00,</strong> decreasing the value of the duration to <strong>00:00:30:00</strong> will increase the speed of your video by double.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
