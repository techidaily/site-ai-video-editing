If You Want to Start Video Shooting, Then You Shouldn’t Miss Time Lapse Video. This Article Will Show You some Ideas over This</h2><p>Are you thinking of stepping out of the familiar world of still photography to make a time-lapse video?</p>
<p>As you all know I am a fan of travel videos and time-lapse video because why not? There is no denying that time-lapse techniques are a perfect medium for travel videos.</p>
<p>In this article will give you some ideas to get started in time-lapse video or photography and let’s define what a time-lapse video and what makes them great.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-Time-Lapse"><a href="#What-is-Time-Lapse" class="headerlink" title="What is Time Lapse"></a>What is Time Lapse</h2><p>Time-lapse is a creative filming and video editing technique that manipulates how the frame rate is captured. Frame rate is the number of images or frames appearing in a second of video. In most videos, the frame rate and playback speed are the same. In a time-lapse video, the frame rate is stretched out far more: when played back at average speed, time appears to be sped up.</p>
<p>Time-lapse can also refer to a camera’s shutter speed (How long the camera’s shutter remains open to let light in). A similar effect to time-lapse is found in stop-motion videos. The subject doesn’t move but seems to be in motion because it’s manually or repeatedly moved and then photographed. The images are then strung together to create video-like motion.</p>

                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/time-lapse-car-video.jpg"
                      alt="time lapse car video"
                ></p>
<h2 id="How-Time-lapse-Works"><a href="#How-Time-lapse-Works" class="headerlink" title="How Time-lapse Works"></a>How Time-lapse Works</h2><p>Time-lapse photography is a technique that records a scene or objects that change at a slow speed and turns it into a video that plays back at high speed.</p>
<p>Most time-lapse videos are projected at a speed of 30 frames per second. The frame rate of your time-lapse video can be determined in the editing process, but you will need to account for how quickly the action is taking place in the camera or your video will be a collection if stills. Consider what FPS you want to use in your video. You need to capture that many frames per second to create a time-lapse effect. If you’re shooting a 10 second video at 30fps, you should end up with 300 images.</p>
<p>What equipment needed for time-lapse video?</p>
<p>Time-lapse photography requires only a few special pieces of equipment.</p>
<p><strong>1. Camera &#x2F; Smartphones</strong></p>
<p>Technically any point and shoot camera or smartphone can be used for time-lapse video, the easiest ones to work are DSLR or mirrorless cameras, some even have an in camera intervalometer (often called a time-lapse feature or time-lapse mode), which means you’ll need less equipment to take great time-lapse video.</p>
<p><strong>2. High-capacity Memory Card</strong></p>
<p>For the best results, shoot in RAW format which takes image in the highest resolution with actual image dimensions. You’ll need to prepare for very large RAW file sizes, so bring multiple high capacity memory cards.</p>
<p><strong>3.Tripod</strong></p>
<p>A tripod is essential to time-lapse video or photography, because the camera needs to stay perfectly still in order to emphasize the steady movement of your subject and to avoid overlay blurry videos or photos.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Capture-Times-lapse-Video"><a href="#How-to-Capture-Times-lapse-Video" class="headerlink" title="How to Capture Times-lapse Video"></a>How to Capture Times-lapse Video</h2><p>A technique that was once found only in video editing software is now on nearly every mobile device. So what’s the best way to make an amazing time-lapse video that stands apart from the rest? That depends on how you plan to capture the footage.</p>
<p><strong>Smartphones:</strong></p>
<p>Most phones have a time-lapse feature in their camera app. Be advised: you will need to record for an extended period, as 30 minutes equates to about 10 seconds of footage. Like a video camera, you will need a tripod to steady your shots. On an iPhone, you can either film a time-lapse or stitch one together from your photo collection, all without a video editor.</p>
<p><strong>DSLR Camera</strong></p>
<p>For DSLR camera you’ll need a tripod and a device called intervalometer. The first is essential to make sure your camera is stationary and is taking photos if the exact same location without moving anywhere.</p>
<p>An intervalometer, or a remote control, is a device that allows you to set your camera to hit the shutter button at an interval of your choice. In other words, an intervalometer is there to let you rest aside without having a manually click the shutter button yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Here are some video ideas for your time-lapse</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ice melting</li>
<li>Flower and plants</li>
<li>Clouds moving</li>
<li>Sunrise&#x2F;sunset</li>
<li>Star movement</li>
<li>Traffic movement</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ice melting</strong></p>
<p>Time-lapse is an ideal way to capture the mesmerizing transition between water and ice. Even something as simple as watching ice melt can be appealing.</p>
<p><strong>Flower and plants</strong></p>
<p>Flowers and plants can be beautiful to behold, but their transformation from seed to adult plant is often absolutely breathtaking. If you have an indoor plant that you are about to start growing you can set up a camera on a mount of a tripod at the angle with which you want to capture. As you water, groom or fertilize on a regular schedule, you can incorporate taking a photograph at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>Clouds moving</strong></p>
<p>The clouds can provide a whole host of phenomena that will both enlighten the observer to the complexities of the atmosphere or cosmos but will also provide a beautiful spectacle in the daytime, the movement of clouds can be quite spell binding and the rolling in of rain or a thunderstorm can be particularly interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Sunrise&#x2F;Sunset</strong></p>
<p>Shooting a sunset is more difficult. The light changes during the selected time period.</p>
<p>To overcome this, use remote control camera software. This can be compensated by increasing the ISO or decreasing the shutter speed as the light dims.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Star movement</strong></p>
<p>At night, if the sky is clear and you are in an area dark enough, the stars in the sky can provide a beautiful time-lapse as the stars move in relation to the observer due to earths rotations.</p>
<p><strong>Traffic movement</strong></p>
<p>The interconnectedness of vehicles moving along busy roads, trailing light patterns, and the general hustle and bustle of city life can be brought to you in a dynamic way via time-lapse videos.</p>
<p>It is the smooth impression of motion which time-lapse is able to produce that can emphasize and help to invigorate something as ordinary and everyday as the coming and going of traffic.</p>

<h2 id="5-Tips-for-Faster-Editing-in-Filmora"><a href="#5-Tips-for-Faster-Editing-in-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="5 Tips for Faster Editing in Filmora"></a>5 Tips for Faster Editing in Filmora</h2><p>It’s an indisputable fact that editing is an essential aspect of video creation, and it’s what brings your initial idea to life. However, it can be very daunting and time-consuming, especially when working on a video project containing lots of footage.</p>
<p>In this post, we will walk you through the five best tips that can come in handy to operate fast and smoothly while editing videos of any size. All you just need is the Filmora video editor. You don’t even require technical knowledge.</p>
<h2 id="1-Organize-your-Media"><a href="#1-Organize-your-Media" class="headerlink" title="1. Organize your Media"></a>1. Organize your Media</h2><p>Since a video project usually has various elements, keeping track of them can take a lot of work. So, the first editing step should be to organize the files so that it is easy to follow them. To do that, you need to do the following;</p>
<p><strong>Create a Folder for Each Media File in your Project</strong></p>
<p>Creating folders involves sorting your video files into various categories, thus making it easy for you to look into specific files and find the missing ones quickly when you need them. For example, you can create a folder for A roll, B roll, Photos, Audio, Sound FX, Music, and Drone Footage. Follow the steps below to see how you can use <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to create a folder for each file in your video project;</p>
<p>Step1 Launch Filmora and click Create Project.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/organize-media-filmora-1.jpg"
                      alt="launch filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Navigate to the bottom left corner before the Timeline &gt; click the Folder icon from there, as shown in the image below;</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/organize-media-filmora-2.jpg"
                      alt="navigate to the bottom left corner"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 Click on the folder icon until you reach the total number of folders you need to categorize your video files.</p>
<p>Right-click on each folder and name it accordingly.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/organize-media-filmora-3.jpg"
                      alt="click on the folder icon"
                ></p>
<p>After you name each folder, use the Import button to upload each video files you need to edit your video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/organize-media-filmora-4.jpg"
                      alt="use the Import button to upload each video files"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> since the media files you import into your project get the name associated with the code given by the source, it becomes hard to capture a specific file while editing. You need to rename each of the elements you imported for easier access.</p>
<p>Step4 Rename all imported files. To rename your imported files, right-click on them to add a preferred name. Then, click Rename from the pop-up list to name the files.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/organize-media-filmora-5.jpg"
                      alt="rename all imported files"
                ></p>
<h2 id="2-The-Use-of-Proxies"><a href="#2-The-Use-of-Proxies" class="headerlink" title="2. The Use of Proxies"></a>2. The Use of Proxies</h2><p>Another tip that enhances a quick editing process is the use of proxies. Proxies can be described as low-resolution versions of your video files. So, if you’re working on video files that drag back playback speed, like 4K footage, you can create a proxy to enable your PC to handle the file seamlessly.</p>
<p>A tool like Filmora editor can help create proxies of your video file flawlessly. You just have to follow the steps below;</p>
<p>Step1 Locate the large video file you imported to Filmora and right-click it. Then, select Create Proxy File.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/use-proxies-filmora-1.jpg"
                      alt="locate the large video file to filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 You should see the proxy icon at the bottom right corner of your video once it completes. This takes only a few minutes.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/use-proxies-filmora-2.jpg"
                      alt="finish proxy"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 Drag-n-drop the video to the timeline and perform the necessary editing. Afterward, use the Export button to save the file to your PC.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/use-proxies-filmora-3.jpg"
                      alt="click on the export button"
                ></p>
<h2 id="3-Keep-Your-Videos-and-Audio-Tracks-Organized"><a href="#3-Keep-Your-Videos-and-Audio-Tracks-Organized" class="headerlink" title="3. Keep Your Videos and Audio Tracks Organized"></a>3. Keep Your Videos and Audio Tracks Organized</h2><p>This is similar to our first tip, and fortunately, the Filmora video editor facilitates this kind of operation quickly and easily. It involves organizing video and audio clips in the timeline while editing. For instance, use video track #1 for graphics or text, #2 for your B roll, and #1 for the main footage taken.</p>
<p>You will also do the same for Audio, for instance, Audio track #1 for music, Audio track #2 for dialogues, and many more. This will allow you to edit various clips simultaneously, making the editing process faster and easier. Here are the steps to use this tip;</p>
<p>Step1 Click on the Add icon at the left side of the Timeline and select Add Video Track or Add Audio Track to add more timelines for your clips.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/organize-audio-and-video-tracks-1.jpg"
                      alt="click on the add icon"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Drag-n-drop the video clips and audio clips to the relevant timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/organize-audio-and-video-tracks-2.jpg"
                      alt="drag-n-drop the video clips and audio clips"
                ></p>
<h2 id="4-Keyboard-Shortcuts"><a href="#4-Keyboard-Shortcuts" class="headerlink" title="4. Keyboard Shortcuts"></a>4. Keyboard Shortcuts</h2><p>These are commands on the keyboard of your pc that will enable you to edit your projects easily and quickly. Various options can be available by keying in specific orders rather than going through a long process using the mouse. This knowledge can be a real time-saver when handling projects. To get more enlightened on the setup in Filmora, follow the steps outlined below;</p>
<p>Step1 Open Filmora and click File from the top side.</p>
<p>Step2 Select Keyboard Shortcuts from the drop-down list.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/use-keyboard-shortcuts-filmora-1.jpg"
                      alt="select keyboard shortcuts"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 The new pop-up window on your PC screen will display all shortcuts you can employ while using Filmora, and the interesting part is that you can customize the shortcut keys to your preference. Moreover, you can freely switch keyboard shortcuts between Filmora, Adobe Premiere Pro, and Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/use-keyboard-shortcuts-filmora-2.jpg"
                      alt="customize the shortcut keys"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 For clicking CTRL+ALT+N will allow you to create a new folder for your file.</p>
<h2 id="5-Edit-in-Stages"><a href="#5-Edit-in-Stages" class="headerlink" title="5. Edit in Stages"></a>5. Edit in Stages</h2><p>Our final tip is to edit in stages. Yes, it is necessary to edit in stages when dealing with editing work. This helps to limit the time you spend on a project. In the beginning, you should do a rough cut. You can begin by editing the A roll at first and then move on to edit the B roll, moving on to the Sound FX, Music, Graphics, and Color Correction, and then reviewing the entire project before exporting it.</p>
<p>In case while editing the A roll, you find something that requires a quick fix in its audio, focus on it and, if possible, use a marker icon to describe it. This will help you not get confused once you get to the Audio stage. See the steps to use Filmora to do this below;</p>
<p>Step1 Firstly, focus on your video footage. Move them to the required timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/edit-in-stages-1.jpg"
                      alt="focus on your video footage"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Next, move your B-roll to the relevant timeline. Then, apply the required editing.</p>
<p>Step3 Afterward, move drag-n-drop the audio clips to the timeline and apply the needed edits.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/edit-in-stages-2.jpg"
                      alt="move drag-n-drop the audio clips to the timeline"
                ></p>
<p>Repeat the process for different operations in stages until you finish.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The editing process is about having a free mind where creativity is the primary focus. When you can do that, you will be able to complete your projects in a short time and work on various tasks simultaneously. The tips discussed in this article will go a long way in helping you handle your projects using Filmora.</p>
<p>You can use Filmora to edit videos and other media files downloaded from YouTube, Vimeo, and many more video-sharing sites. Follow these tips and make editing your video projects quite easy and fast.</p>

<p>Step4 Rename all imported files. To rename your imported files, right-click on them to add a preferred name. Then, click Rename from the pop-up list to name the files.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="rename all imported files"
                ></p>
<h2 id="2-The-Use-of-Proxies-1"><a href="#2-The-Use-of-Proxies-1" class="headerlink" title="2. The Use of Proxies"></a>2. The Use of Proxies</h2><p>Another tip that enhances a quick editing process is the use of proxies. Proxies can be described as low-resolution versions of your video files. So, if you’re working on video files that drag back playback speed, like 4K footage, you can create a proxy to enable your PC to handle the file seamlessly.</p>
<p>A tool like Filmora editor can help create proxies of your video file flawlessly. You just have to follow the steps below;</p>
<p>Step1 Locate the large video file you imported to Filmora and right-click it. Then, select Create Proxy File.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/use-proxies-filmora-1.jpg"
                      alt="locate the large video file to filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 You should see the proxy icon at the bottom right corner of your video once it completes. This takes only a few minutes.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/use-proxies-filmora-2.jpg"
                      alt="finish proxy"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 Drag-n-drop the video to the timeline and perform the necessary editing. Afterward, use the Export button to save the file to your PC.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/use-proxies-filmora-3.jpg"
                      alt="click on the export button"
                ></p>
<h2 id="3-Keep-Your-Videos-and-Audio-Tracks-Organized-1"><a href="#3-Keep-Your-Videos-and-Audio-Tracks-Organized-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Keep Your Videos and Audio Tracks Organized"></a>3. Keep Your Videos and Audio Tracks Organized</h2><p>This is similar to our first tip, and fortunately, the Filmora video editor facilitates this kind of operation quickly and easily. It involves organizing video and audio clips in the timeline while editing. For instance, use video track #1 for graphics or text, #2 for your B roll, and #1 for the main footage taken.</p>
<p>You will also do the same for Audio, for instance, Audio track #1 for music, Audio track #2 for dialogues, and many more. This will allow you to edit various clips simultaneously, making the editing process faster and easier. Here are the steps to use this tip;</p>
<p>Step1 Click on the Add icon at the left side of the Timeline and select Add Video Track or Add Audio Track to add more timelines for your clips.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/organize-audio-and-video-tracks-1.jpg"
                      alt="click on the add icon"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Drag-n-drop the video clips and audio clips to the relevant timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/organize-audio-and-video-tracks-2.jpg"
                      alt="drag-n-drop the video clips and audio clips"
                ></p>
<h2 id="4-Keyboard-Shortcuts-1"><a href="#4-Keyboard-Shortcuts-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Keyboard Shortcuts"></a>4. Keyboard Shortcuts</h2><p>These are commands on the keyboard of your pc that will enable you to edit your projects easily and quickly. Various options can be available by keying in specific orders rather than going through a long process using the mouse. This knowledge can be a real time-saver when handling projects. To get more enlightened on the setup in Filmora, follow the steps outlined below;</p>
<p>Step1 Open Filmora and click File from the top side.</p>
<p>Step2 Select Keyboard Shortcuts from the drop-down list.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/use-keyboard-shortcuts-filmora-1.jpg"
                      alt="select keyboard shortcuts"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 The new pop-up window on your PC screen will display all shortcuts you can employ while using Filmora, and the interesting part is that you can customize the shortcut keys to your preference. Moreover, you can freely switch keyboard shortcuts between Filmora, Adobe Premiere Pro, and Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/use-keyboard-shortcuts-filmora-2.jpg"
                      alt="customize the shortcut keys"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 For clicking CTRL+ALT+N will allow you to create a new folder for your file.</p>
<h2 id="5-Edit-in-Stages-1"><a href="#5-Edit-in-Stages-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Edit in Stages"></a>5. Edit in Stages</h2><p>Our final tip is to edit in stages. Yes, it is necessary to edit in stages when dealing with editing work. This helps to limit the time you spend on a project. In the beginning, you should do a rough cut. You can begin by editing the A roll at first and then move on to edit the B roll, moving on to the Sound FX, Music, Graphics, and Color Correction, and then reviewing the entire project before exporting it.</p>
<p>In case while editing the A roll, you find something that requires a quick fix in its audio, focus on it and, if possible, use a marker icon to describe it. This will help you not get confused once you get to the Audio stage. See the steps to use Filmora to do this below;</p>
<p>Step1 Firstly, focus on your video footage. Move them to the required timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/edit-in-stages-1.jpg"
                      alt="focus on your video footage"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Next, move your B-roll to the relevant timeline. Then, apply the required editing.</p>
<p>Step3 Afterward, move drag-n-drop the audio clips to the timeline and apply the needed edits.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/edit-in-stages-2.jpg"
                      alt="move drag-n-drop the audio clips to the timeline"
                ></p>
<p>Repeat the process for different operations in stages until you finish.</p>
