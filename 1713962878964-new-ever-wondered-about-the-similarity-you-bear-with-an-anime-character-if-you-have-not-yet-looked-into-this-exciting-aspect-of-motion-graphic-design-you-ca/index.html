<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-the-Canva-Color-Picker-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-the-Canva-Color-Picker-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is the Canva Color Picker?"></a>Part 1 What is the Canva Color Picker?</h2><p>Canva is one of the simplest and easiest ways of creating great and eye-catchy graphic designs. Color combinations help us to make these designs more attractive. But earlier, there were some limitations in Canva regarding the color picker tool; designers had to use browser extensions like ColorZilla to match the color combinations perfectly. They faced many problems while selecting the perfect color of their choice while designing their pins, social media content, logos, online invitations, etc. They had to find the perfect color code of their choice from an external source and paste it into the Canva, which was simply very time-consuming.</p>
<p>The most-awaited color picker tool was introduced in Canva at the end of November 202This new design tool makes the design very convenient while using Canva for graphic designing. With this tool, you don’t need to spend hours searching for the right color that matches the background. Color picker helps you to find a perfect color match according to the image, logo, or anything else uploaded on Canva.</p>

                      alt="eyedropper tool"
                ></p>
<p>But before using this new <strong>color match tool</strong>, you must ensure that:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You are using the updated version of the Canva desktop app.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You have the latest version of the browsers like Chrome, Mozilla, Internet Explorer, etc.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Why-Use-the-Color-Match-Tool-3"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Use-the-Color-Match-Tool-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Why Use the Color Match Tool?"></a>Part 2 Why Use the Color Match Tool?</h2><p><img

                      alt="custom colors"

It is a compassionate tool, so you should be very careful while choosing the color of your choice. You can press the ‘Esc’ button to exit the command without choosing any color.</p>
<p>This color match tool magically helps select the desired color in seconds without using any external color picker browser extension. This tool is readily available on the color pallet in the updated version of the Canva desktop app.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> After this, a color chart will appear under that button. You will see the color code written over there and an eyedropper tool will be available next to that color code (hex code).</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Click on this eyedropper tool and select the color of your choice either from the image or any other color available in Canva.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> After selecting the color tap on the particular part of the image whose color you want to change.</p>
