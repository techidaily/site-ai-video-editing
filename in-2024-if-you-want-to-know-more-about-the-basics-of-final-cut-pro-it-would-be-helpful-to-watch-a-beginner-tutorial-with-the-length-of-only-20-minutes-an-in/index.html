The software lets us to log and transfer videos onto a hard drive, where it can be edited, processed, and output to a wide variety of formats. Final Cut Pro is so advanced that it is used by hobbyist filmmakers and industry professionals in TV, Film, and media. Anyone can get a free trial of the software for their Macs, but, to purchase directly from the Mac App Store it costs $299.99. It’s evident that Final Cut Pro can’t be downloaded, installed, and thus used on Windows, which is unfortunate, but for Mac users, it’s a very powerful video editing software.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>What are the features this advanced computer program offers to Mac users? – itreads on the web-site of Final Cut Pro:</p>
<ul>
<li>Object Tracker and Cinematic mode;</li>
<li>Blazing pro performance;</li>
<li>Editing, audio, motion graphics, color grading, and delivery;</li>
<li>The best plug-ins, effects, and tools from leading developers.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the most impressive things about Final Cut Pro is that through it, you can create 2D and 3D titles right in the program, apply and modify filters, and use the built-in chroma key for high-quality green- and blue-screen effects. But, one should not be alarmed when it comes to experience and knowledge in editing – even though Final Cut Pro seems so advanced with its powerful tools and the possibilities it contains, it is designed for easy use and can be used by amateurs as well as professionals.</p>
<p>The interface, which, when it comes to editing, is one of the most important aspects (if not the main one!), seems quite standard - an ordinary window configuration, sidebar with libraries, events, projects, collections… If you want to know more about the basics of Final Cut Pro, it would be helpful to watch a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygBlgaT78mM" >beginner tutorial <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, with the length of only 20 minutes, an introduction of the whole program.</p>

<p>Anyway, the main topic of this article is about cropping – how to crop a video in Final Cut Pro? If you are a Mac user and have this program installed on your computer, and you as well have a footage where you want to remove some portions of the video and adjust the size of the cropped clip within a certain area, this article is for you. Even though cropping is especially used when it comes to the images, it is extremely helpful in certain situations about the video clips, as well. So, let’s dive into each step of cropping in Final Cut Pro!</p>
<h2 id="Steps-to-crop-a-video-in-Final-Cut-Pro"><a href="#Steps-to-crop-a-video-in-Final-Cut-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Steps to crop a video in Final Cut Pro"></a>Steps to crop a video in Final Cut Pro</h2><p>After getting Final Cut Pro ready to work in and opening it, you need to start as always, as in any other software: Of course, choose Import Media.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-3.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>The software will ask your permission to access files in your computer, so, in order to import some, guess you have to click on OK.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-4.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Then, it will let you choose your file – but not by opening the new window (as in most cases), rather, you can choose file within the software.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-5.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Once you have your file(s) chosen, you need to find Import Selected button on the down and right.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-6.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>This will lead you towards the editor again, but if you try to drag and drop your file into the sequence, the program will not follow this simple order…</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-7.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>This is because what the window below reads and looks like – it offers you create a New Project first. So, you need to hit it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-8.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>This will create the sequence where you can add the video you have already selected and imported from your media.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-9.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Now, it’s time to find where the cropping option is. It’s quite simple – look at the icon below and a little left of the screen where your video clip shows, click on it and you will see three options: Transform, Crop, and Distort. Needless to say, you will choose crop in this case, even if other options sound quite interesting, too!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-10.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Choosing Crop also gives you three options: Trim, Crop, and Ken Burns. Stick with the Crop again!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-11.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>You will notice the kind of rulers on the angles of the video clip – they are there so you can crop your footage manually, by holding and moving them with your cursor to your liking.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-12.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Of course, if you direct your cursor in the middle of the cropped video, you can move the whole cropping window around it, so you can find the area where you intend to crop better.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-13.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>And when the selected area is ready, you need to click on Done button on the right top side of the screen. If you are not satisfied with the result, you can take the step back, by clicking on Reset button right next to Done and modify the area again.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-14.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>On the right side of the screen, you notice a window where Crop is also written. Alongside it, if you hover over the option with your mouse, you will see the word: Show. Clicking on it will let you crop the video from each side from there, too.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-15.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>There, you can “play around” with Left, Right, Top, and Bottom sides.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-16.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>In the process, if you are unsure or you want to compare the original video to the cropped version of it, keep in mind that you can uncheck the Crop button.</p>

                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Finally, when you feel the result is what you have imagined, you can proceed to saving your work. For it to be done, you need to now find an Export button top right of the whole editor, and then, choose Export File (or else, if that’s what you are willing to do).</p>

                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>The next step would be Export Settings. You will see a new window which has three sections: Info, Settings, and Roles. The most important one here would be considered Settings, where you choose your preferred Format, Video Codec, Resolution, Color Space, Audio Format, and Action.</p>

                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p> When you click on Next, you then choose the Name of your project and the location where you want to save it exactly.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Then you click on Save, and in a short amount of time, you have your new cropped video where you chose to save it! So, that’s it with cropping in the Final Cut Pro!</p>

                ></p>
<p>So, shall we imagine we use Wondershare Filmora X to crop our video, what would be the steps to do it?..</p>
<p>Needless to say, downloading and installing the software is the first step. To add files, you need to click on Import Media Files Here.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-26.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Choose your clip(s) you would like to crop and then drag and drop it in the sequence.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-27.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Above your video in the sequence, you will see little icons and find a Crop one.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-28.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Click on it and a new window will open – it’s for Crop and Zoom, where you can choose a needed ratio or do it manually (for it, you have to select Custom first).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-29.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>After clicking OK, your video will be cropped as you like. Then, you can proceed with Exporting it – click on Export, choose your preferred settings, and save the video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p>So, in this article, we got to know to software Final Cut Pro better and learned about how to crop our footage using this program; we also discussed how to do the same in Wondershare Filmora X, shall we need a different software.</p>
<p>And now, you can choose your preferred one and follow these step, or, why not try both?..</p>
<p>What are the features this advanced computer program offers to Mac users? – itreads on the web-site of Final Cut Pro:</p>
<ul>
<li>Object Tracker and Cinematic mode;</li>
<li>Blazing pro performance;</li>
<li>Editing, audio, motion graphics, color grading, and delivery;</li>
<li>The best plug-ins, effects, and tools from leading developers.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the most impressive things about Final Cut Pro is that through it, you can create 2D and 3D titles right in the program, apply and modify filters, and use the built-in chroma key for high-quality green- and blue-screen effects. But, one should not be alarmed when it comes to experience and knowledge in editing – even though Final Cut Pro seems so advanced with its powerful tools and the possibilities it contains, it is designed for easy use and can be used by amateurs as well as professionals.</p>
<p>The interface, which, when it comes to editing, is one of the most important aspects (if not the main one!), seems quite standard - an ordinary window configuration, sidebar with libraries, events, projects, collections… If you want to know more about the basics of Final Cut Pro, it would be helpful to watch a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygBlgaT78mM" >beginner tutorial <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, with the length of only 20 minutes, an introduction of the whole program.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Anyway, the main topic of this article is about cropping – how to crop a video in Final Cut Pro? If you are a Mac user and have this program installed on your computer, and you as well have a footage where you want to remove some portions of the video and adjust the size of the cropped clip within a certain area, this article is for you. Even though cropping is especially used when it comes to the images, it is extremely helpful in certain situations about the video clips, as well. So, let’s dive into each step of cropping in Final Cut Pro!</p>
<h2 id="Steps-to-crop-a-video-in-Final-Cut-Pro-1"><a href="#Steps-to-crop-a-video-in-Final-Cut-Pro-1" class="headerlink" title="Steps to crop a video in Final Cut Pro"></a>Steps to crop a video in Final Cut Pro</h2><p>After getting Final Cut Pro ready to work in and opening it, you need to start as always, as in any other software: Of course, choose Import Media.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-3.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>The software will ask your permission to access files in your computer, so, in order to import some, guess you have to click on OK.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-4.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Then, it will let you choose your file – but not by opening the new window (as in most cases), rather, you can choose file within the software.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-5.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Once you have your file(s) chosen, you need to find Import Selected button on the down and right.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-6.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>This will lead you towards the editor again, but if you try to drag and drop your file into the sequence, the program will not follow this simple order…</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-7.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>This is because what the window below reads and looks like – it offers you create a New Project first. So, you need to hit it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-8.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>This will create the sequence where you can add the video you have already selected and imported from your media.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-9.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Now, it’s time to find where the cropping option is. It’s quite simple – look at the icon below and a little left of the screen where your video clip shows, click on it and you will see three options: Transform, Crop, and Distort. Needless to say, you will choose crop in this case, even if other options sound quite interesting, too!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-10.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Choosing Crop also gives you three options: Trim, Crop, and Ken Burns. Stick with the Crop again!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-11.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>You will notice the kind of rulers on the angles of the video clip – they are there so you can crop your footage manually, by holding and moving them with your cursor to your liking.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-12.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Of course, if you direct your cursor in the middle of the cropped video, you can move the whole cropping window around it, so you can find the area where you intend to crop better.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-13.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>And when the selected area is ready, you need to click on Done button on the right top side of the screen. If you are not satisfied with the result, you can take the step back, by clicking on Reset button right next to Done and modify the area again.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-14.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>On the right side of the screen, you notice a window where Crop is also written. Alongside it, if you hover over the option with your mouse, you will see the word: Show. Clicking on it will let you crop the video from each side from there, too.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-15.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>There, you can “play around” with Left, Right, Top, and Bottom sides.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-16.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>In the process, if you are unsure or you want to compare the original video to the cropped version of it, keep in mind that you can uncheck the Crop button.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-17.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Finally, when you feel the result is what you have imagined, you can proceed to saving your work. For it to be done, you need to now find an Export button top right of the whole editor, and then, choose Export File (or else, if that’s what you are willing to do).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-18.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-19.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>The next step would be Export Settings. You will see a new window which has three sections: Info, Settings, and Roles. The most important one here would be considered Settings, where you choose your preferred Format, Video Codec, Resolution, Color Space, Audio Format, and Action.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>So, shall we imagine we use Wondershare Filmora X to crop our video, what would be the steps to do it?..</p>
<p>Needless to say, downloading and installing the software is the first step. To add files, you need to click on Import Media Files Here.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-26.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Choose your clip(s) you would like to crop and then drag and drop it in the sequence.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-27.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Above your video in the sequence, you will see little icons and find a Crop one.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-28.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Click on it and a new window will open – it’s for Crop and Zoom, where you can choose a needed ratio or do it manually (for it, you have to select Custom first).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>After clicking OK, your video will be cropped as you like. Then, you can proceed with Exporting it – click on Export, choose your preferred settings, and save the video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p>So, in this article, we got to know to software Final Cut Pro better and learned about how to crop our footage using this program; we also discussed how to do the same in Wondershare Filmora X, shall we need a different software.</p>
<p>And now, you can choose your preferred one and follow these step, or, why not try both?..</p>
<p>What are the features this advanced computer program offers to Mac users? – itreads on the web-site of Final Cut Pro:</p>
<ul>
<li>Object Tracker and Cinematic mode;</li>
<li>Blazing pro performance;</li>
<li>Editing, audio, motion graphics, color grading, and delivery;</li>
<li>The best plug-ins, effects, and tools from leading developers.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the most impressive things about Final Cut Pro is that through it, you can create 2D and 3D titles right in the program, apply and modify filters, and use the built-in chroma key for high-quality green- and blue-screen effects. But, one should not be alarmed when it comes to experience and knowledge in editing – even though Final Cut Pro seems so advanced with its powerful tools and the possibilities it contains, it is designed for easy use and can be used by amateurs as well as professionals.</p>
<p>The interface, which, when it comes to editing, is one of the most important aspects (if not the main one!), seems quite standard - an ordinary window configuration, sidebar with libraries, events, projects, collections… If you want to know more about the basics of Final Cut Pro, it would be helpful to watch a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygBlgaT78mM" >beginner tutorial <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, with the length of only 20 minutes, an introduction of the whole program.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Anyway, the main topic of this article is about cropping – how to crop a video in Final Cut Pro? If you are a Mac user and have this program installed on your computer, and you as well have a footage where you want to remove some portions of the video and adjust the size of the cropped clip within a certain area, this article is for you. Even though cropping is especially used when it comes to the images, it is extremely helpful in certain situations about the video clips, as well. So, let’s dive into each step of cropping in Final Cut Pro!</p>
<h2 id="Steps-to-crop-a-video-in-Final-Cut-Pro-2"><a href="#Steps-to-crop-a-video-in-Final-Cut-Pro-2" class="headerlink" title="Steps to crop a video in Final Cut Pro"></a>Steps to crop a video in Final Cut Pro</h2><p>After getting Final Cut Pro ready to work in and opening it, you need to start as always, as in any other software: Of course, choose Import Media.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-3.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>The software will ask your permission to access files in your computer, so, in order to import some, guess you have to click on OK.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-4.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Then, it will let you choose your file – but not by opening the new window (as in most cases), rather, you can choose file within the software.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-5.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Once you have your file(s) chosen, you need to find Import Selected button on the down and right.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-6.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>This will lead you towards the editor again, but if you try to drag and drop your file into the sequence, the program will not follow this simple order…</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-7.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>This is because what the window below reads and looks like – it offers you create a New Project first. So, you need to hit it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-8.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>This will create the sequence where you can add the video you have already selected and imported from your media.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-9.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Now, it’s time to find where the cropping option is. It’s quite simple – look at the icon below and a little left of the screen where your video clip shows, click on it and you will see three options: Transform, Crop, and Distort. Needless to say, you will choose crop in this case, even if other options sound quite interesting, too!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-10.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Choosing Crop also gives you three options: Trim, Crop, and Ken Burns. Stick with the Crop again!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-11.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>You will notice the kind of rulers on the angles of the video clip – they are there so you can crop your footage manually, by holding and moving them with your cursor to your liking.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-12.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Of course, if you direct your cursor in the middle of the cropped video, you can move the whole cropping window around it, so you can find the area where you intend to crop better.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-13.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>And when the selected area is ready, you need to click on Done button on the right top side of the screen. If you are not satisfied with the result, you can take the step back, by clicking on Reset button right next to Done and modify the area again.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-14.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>On the right side of the screen, you notice a window where Crop is also written. Alongside it, if you hover over the option with your mouse, you will see the word: Show. Clicking on it will let you crop the video from each side from there, too.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-15.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>There, you can “play around” with Left, Right, Top, and Bottom sides.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-16.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>In the process, if you are unsure or you want to compare the original video to the cropped version of it, keep in mind that you can uncheck the Crop button.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-17.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Finally, when you feel the result is what you have imagined, you can proceed to saving your work. For it to be done, you need to now find an Export button top right of the whole editor, and then, choose Export File (or else, if that’s what you are willing to do).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-18.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-19.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>The next step would be Export Settings. You will see a new window which has three sections: Info, Settings, and Roles. The most important one here would be considered Settings, where you choose your preferred Format, Video Codec, Resolution, Color Space, Audio Format, and Action.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p><img

                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p> When you click on Next, you then choose the Name of your project and the location where you want to save it exactly.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-22.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Then you click on Save, and in a short amount of time, you have your new cropped video where you chose to save it! So, that’s it with cropping in the Final Cut Pro!</p>

                ></p>
<p>So, shall we imagine we use Wondershare Filmora X to crop our video, what would be the steps to do it?..</p>
<p>Needless to say, downloading and installing the software is the first step. To add files, you need to click on Import Media Files Here.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-26.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Choose your clip(s) you would like to crop and then drag and drop it in the sequence.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-27.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Above your video in the sequence, you will see little icons and find a Crop one.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-28.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Click on it and a new window will open – it’s for Crop and Zoom, where you can choose a needed ratio or do it manually (for it, you have to select Custom first).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>After clicking OK, your video will be cropped as you like. Then, you can proceed with Exporting it – click on Export, choose your preferred settings, and save the video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p>So, in this article, we got to know to software Final Cut Pro better and learned about how to crop our footage using this program; we also discussed how to do the same in Wondershare Filmora X, shall we need a different software.</p>
<p>And now, you can choose your preferred one and follow these step, or, why not try both?..</p>
<p>What are the features this advanced computer program offers to Mac users? – itreads on the web-site of Final Cut Pro:</p>
<ul>
<li>Object Tracker and Cinematic mode;</li>
<li>Blazing pro performance;</li>
<li>Editing, audio, motion graphics, color grading, and delivery;</li>
<li>The best plug-ins, effects, and tools from leading developers.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the most impressive things about Final Cut Pro is that through it, you can create 2D and 3D titles right in the program, apply and modify filters, and use the built-in chroma key for high-quality green- and blue-screen effects. But, one should not be alarmed when it comes to experience and knowledge in editing – even though Final Cut Pro seems so advanced with its powerful tools and the possibilities it contains, it is designed for easy use and can be used by amateurs as well as professionals.</p>
<p>The interface, which, when it comes to editing, is one of the most important aspects (if not the main one!), seems quite standard - an ordinary window configuration, sidebar with libraries, events, projects, collections… If you want to know more about the basics of Final Cut Pro, it would be helpful to watch a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygBlgaT78mM" >beginner tutorial <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, with the length of only 20 minutes, an introduction of the whole program.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Anyway, the main topic of this article is about cropping – how to crop a video in Final Cut Pro? If you are a Mac user and have this program installed on your computer, and you as well have a footage where you want to remove some portions of the video and adjust the size of the cropped clip within a certain area, this article is for you. Even though cropping is especially used when it comes to the images, it is extremely helpful in certain situations about the video clips, as well. So, let’s dive into each step of cropping in Final Cut Pro!</p>
<h2 id="Steps-to-crop-a-video-in-Final-Cut-Pro-3"><a href="#Steps-to-crop-a-video-in-Final-Cut-Pro-3" class="headerlink" title="Steps to crop a video in Final Cut Pro"></a>Steps to crop a video in Final Cut Pro</h2><p>After getting Final Cut Pro ready to work in and opening it, you need to start as always, as in any other software: Of course, choose Import Media.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-3.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>The software will ask your permission to access files in your computer, so, in order to import some, guess you have to click on OK.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-4.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Then, it will let you choose your file – but not by opening the new window (as in most cases), rather, you can choose file within the software.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-5.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Once you have your file(s) chosen, you need to find Import Selected button on the down and right.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-6.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>This will lead you towards the editor again, but if you try to drag and drop your file into the sequence, the program will not follow this simple order…</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-7.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>This is because what the window below reads and looks like – it offers you create a New Project first. So, you need to hit it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-8.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>This will create the sequence where you can add the video you have already selected and imported from your media.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-9.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Now, it’s time to find where the cropping option is. It’s quite simple – look at the icon below and a little left of the screen where your video clip shows, click on it and you will see three options: Transform, Crop, and Distort. Needless to say, you will choose crop in this case, even if other options sound quite interesting, too!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-10.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Choosing Crop also gives you three options: Trim, Crop, and Ken Burns. Stick with the Crop again!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-11.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>You will notice the kind of rulers on the angles of the video clip – they are there so you can crop your footage manually, by holding and moving them with your cursor to your liking.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-12.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Of course, if you direct your cursor in the middle of the cropped video, you can move the whole cropping window around it, so you can find the area where you intend to crop better.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-13.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>And when the selected area is ready, you need to click on Done button on the right top side of the screen. If you are not satisfied with the result, you can take the step back, by clicking on Reset button right next to Done and modify the area again.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-14.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>On the right side of the screen, you notice a window where Crop is also written. Alongside it, if you hover over the option with your mouse, you will see the word: Show. Clicking on it will let you crop the video from each side from there, too.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-15.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>There, you can “play around” with Left, Right, Top, and Bottom sides.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-16.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>In the process, if you are unsure or you want to compare the original video to the cropped version of it, keep in mind that you can uncheck the Crop button.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-17.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Finally, when you feel the result is what you have imagined, you can proceed to saving your work. For it to be done, you need to now find an Export button top right of the whole editor, and then, choose Export File (or else, if that’s what you are willing to do).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-18.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-19.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>The next step would be Export Settings. You will see a new window which has three sections: Info, Settings, and Roles. The most important one here would be considered Settings, where you choose your preferred Format, Video Codec, Resolution, Color Space, Audio Format, and Action.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-20.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-21.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p> When you click on Next, you then choose the Name of your project and the location where you want to save it exactly.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-22.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Then you click on Save, and in a short amount of time, you have your new cropped video where you chose to save it! So, that’s it with cropping in the Final Cut Pro!</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Before you start editing your project, make sure that you have a backup. You can copy the project to an external USB or hard drive for a backup.</p>
<h2 id="Adjust-the-aspect-ratio"><a href="#Adjust-the-aspect-ratio" class="headerlink" title="Adjust the aspect ratio"></a>Adjust the aspect ratio</h2><p>The aspect ratio is known as the size of the video frame. For example, the most common aspect ratios are 16:9 and 4:3. The first number represents the width, and the second represents the height.</p>
<p>You should always ask your cinematographer about the aspect ratio. There are chances when cameras won’t shoot at the intended aspect ratio they were framed for. In that case, you’ll need to crop or letterbox them when editing.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h3 id="How-to-find-the-width-height-of-the-frame"><a href="#How-to-find-the-width-height-of-the-frame" class="headerlink" title="How to find the width&#x2F;height of the frame?"></a>How to find the width&#x2F;height of the frame?</h3><p>Most of the frames that are being shot on the camera are 3424 pixels wide, which is a little under 4k. If you have a measurement of one side of the frame, you can find the other by using some math. Let’s suppose your frame is 3424 pixels wide. You can use this formula to find the height.</p>
<p><strong>Formula:</strong> 3424 pixels wide <strong>x</strong> 1 high &#x2F; 2.35 wide (or whatever your aspect ratio)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/1st-step-of-the-formula.jpg"
                      alt="1st step of the formula"
                ></p>
<p>Now you can cancel out the width from the multiplier and the denominator.</p>
<p>= 3424 pixels wide <strong>x</strong> 1 high &#x2F; 2.35 wide</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="2nd step of the formula"
                ></p>
<p>Now you are left with the equation:</p>
<p>= 3424 pixels high &#x2F; 2.35</p>
<p>After solving this equation, you will get the answer which is: 1457 pixels high. Let’s adjust it on the music video as well, follow the steps given below:</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Before you start editing your project, make sure that you have a backup. You can copy the project to an external USB or hard drive for a backup.</p>
<h2 id="Adjust-the-aspect-ratio-1"><a href="#Adjust-the-aspect-ratio-1" class="headerlink" title="Adjust the aspect ratio"></a>Adjust the aspect ratio</h2><p>The aspect ratio is known as the size of the video frame. For example, the most common aspect ratios are 16:9 and 4:3. The first number represents the width, and the second represents the height.</p>
<p>You should always ask your cinematographer about the aspect ratio. There are chances when cameras won’t shoot at the intended aspect ratio they were framed for. In that case, you’ll need to crop or letterbox them when editing.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h3 id="How-to-find-the-width-height-of-the-frame-1"><a href="#How-to-find-the-width-height-of-the-frame-1" class="headerlink" title="How to find the width&#x2F;height of the frame?"></a>How to find the width&#x2F;height of the frame?</h3><p>Most of the frames that are being shot on the camera are 3424 pixels wide, which is a little under 4k. If you have a measurement of one side of the frame, you can find the other by using some math. Let’s suppose your frame is 3424 pixels wide. You can use this formula to find the height.</p>
<p><strong>Formula:</strong> 3424 pixels wide <strong>x</strong> 1 high &#x2F; 2.35 wide (or whatever your aspect ratio)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/1st-step-of-the-formula.jpg"
                      alt="1st step of the formula"
                ></p>
<p>Now you can cancel out the width from the multiplier and the denominator.</p>
<p>= 3424 pixels wide <strong>x</strong> 1 high &#x2F; 2.35 wide</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="2nd step of the formula"
                ></p>
<p>Now you are left with the equation:</p>
<p>= 3424 pixels high &#x2F; 2.35</p>
<p>After solving this equation, you will get the answer which is: 1457 pixels high. Let’s adjust it on the music video as well, follow the steps given below:</p>

Before editing, you can also get some guidance from your art director.</p>
<p>If your music video has shots of the band performing, drop them off first and sync them with the audio. On the contrary, if you are doing a narrative style, you can arrange the shots according to the story you want to portray.</p>
