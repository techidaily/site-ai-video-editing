Whether you’re a YouTuber, a marketer, or just someone who wants to share videos with friends and family, being able to edit and manipulate your videos is key. One of the most basic video editing tasks is concatenating videos, which combines multiple files to create one cohesive video.</p>
<p>FFmpeg is a powerful tool that allows you to do just that, and in this guide, we’ll walk you through the process of FFmpeg concatenate videos. Whether a beginner or an experienced video editor, this guide will provide you with all the information you need to seamlessly merge your videos. From installation to execution, we’ll cover it all so you can streamline your video editing process.</p>

<h2 id="Overview-and-Installation-of-FFmpeg"><a href="#Overview-and-Installation-of-FFmpeg" class="headerlink" title="Overview and Installation of FFmpeg"></a>Overview and Installation of FFmpeg</h2><p>FFmpeg is free, open-source project that allows you to record, convert, and stream digital audio and video. It is a command-line tool widely used in video editing and transcoding. FFmpeg can be used to concatenate videos and other tasks, such as adding subtitles, changing video resolution, and more. It is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux, making it a versatile and accessible tool for anyone to use.</p>
<p>Here’s how to install FFmpeg:</p>
<p>Step1 <strong>Log in</strong> to your Ubuntu server via SSH and <strong>update</strong> the package index.</p>
<p><em>$ sudo apt update</em></p>
<p>Step2 <strong>Install</strong> FFmpeg and all the required dependencies</p>
<p><em>$ sudo apt install ffmpeg</em></p>
<p>Step3 <strong>Verify</strong> the version of FFmpeg that you’ve installed.</p>
<p><em>$ ffmpeg -version</em></p>
<h2 id="Prerequisite"><a href="#Prerequisite" class="headerlink" title="Prerequisite"></a>Prerequisite</h2><p>Before we merge videos using FFmpeg, we must understand the various methods available to us. FFmpeg offers three ways to concatenate videos: a demuxer, a filter, or a protocol. However, each method has its own set of considerations, and the best method for you will depend on the properties of the videos you’re working with.</p>
<p>It’s crucial to ensure that all encoding-related properties align with your chosen method. This includes the timebase, height and width, codecs, and pixel format. Some methods require the videos you’re merging to have the same encoding, while others allow for different encodings. It’s essential to keep this in mind to ensure that the final video is seamless without any breaks. Remember that these prerequisites will help you have a smooth process.</p>
<h3 id="Concatenate-Videos-With-Same-Codecs-Using-FFmpeg"><a href="#Concatenate-Videos-With-Same-Codecs-Using-FFmpeg" class="headerlink" title="Concatenate Videos With Same Codecs Using FFmpeg"></a>Concatenate Videos With Same Codecs Using FFmpeg</h3><p>If the videos you want to concatenate have the same codec, you can use the FFmpeg “concat” demuxer or protocol to join them together. This simple and efficient method doesn’t require re-encoding the videos, saving time and preserving the original quality. This section will review the steps to concatenate videos using the “concat” demuxer and “concat” protocols in FFmpeg.</p>
<p><strong>Merge Videos With the “Concat” Demuxer</strong></p>
<p>The concat demuxer in FFmpeg allows you to join together multiple video files with the same codecs by reading a list of file paths from a text file and demuxing them in sequence. Each video starts where the previous one finishes without needing to re-encode the videos. Here’s how to do it:</p>
<p>Step1 <strong>Create</strong> a <strong>.txt file and list</strong> the paths of the video files you want to merge.</p>
<p><em>Join_video.txt</em></p>
<p><em>file &#x2F;Users&#x2F;Video&#x2F;input1.mp4</em></p>
<p><em>file &#x2F;Users&#x2F;Video&#x2F;input2.mp4</em></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can add more than two video files.</p>
<p>Step2 <strong>Run</strong> the FFmpeg command:</p>
<p><em>ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i join_video.txt -c copy output_demuxer.mp4</em></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note: <em>-safe 0</em></strong> is added to accept any file name.</p>
<p><strong><em>-c copy</em></strong> will copy all the streams.</p>
<p>As this method allows you to “stream copy” the files instead of re-encoding them, the concatenation is very fast. This can be a good option if you have videos with the same codecs and want to join them quickly without losing quality.</p>
<p><strong>Join Videos With the “Concat” Protocol</strong></p>
<p>The concat protocol in FFmpeg allows you to join together multiple video files in a specific format that supports file-level concatenation, such as MPEG-2 TS. However, it cannot be used for other video formats like MP4 and WEBM.</p>
<p>Here’s how to use the “concat protocol:</p>
<p>Step1 <strong>Run</strong> the FFmpeg command:</p>
<p><em>ffmpeg -i “concat:input1.ts|input2.ts” -c copy output_protocol.ts</em></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The concat protocol allows you to “stream copy” the files by adding the option <strong><em>-c copy</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Step2 <strong>Input</strong> the file name of the video using this code:</p>
<p><em>ffmpeg -i “concat:input1.mp4|input2.mp4” -c copy output_protocol.mp4</em></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you try to use this method on video formats that are not supported, only the first input video will be saved in the output video. And the video ends after the first video.</p>
<p>Although this method is limited in terms of supported video formats, it’s very easy to use if you merge videos in the supported formats. It’s a single command in the terminal without needing a text file. Additionally, using the -c copy option makes it efficient as it doesn’t require re-encoding, saving time.</p>
<h3 id="Concatenate-MP4-Video-Files-of-Different-Codecs-Resolutions-Using-FFmpeg"><a href="#Concatenate-MP4-Video-Files-of-Different-Codecs-Resolutions-Using-FFmpeg" class="headerlink" title="Concatenate MP4 Video Files of Different Codecs &amp; Resolutions Using FFmpeg"></a>Concatenate MP4 Video Files of Different Codecs &amp; Resolutions Using FFmpeg</h3><p>If the videos you want to concatenate have different codecs or resolutions, you can still use FFmpeg to join them together. However, this method requires re-encoding the videos, which can take longer and may result in a loss of quality. This section will cover the steps to concatenate videos with different codecs or resolutions using FFmpeg.</p>
<p>Here’s how to do it:</p>
<p>Step1 <strong>Provide</strong> the names of the input files to FFmpeg.</p>
<p><em>ffmpeg -i file1.mp4 -i file2.mp4 -i file3.mp4 \</em></p>
<p>Step2 <strong>Use</strong> the <strong>filter_complex</strong> filtergraph parameter to instruct FFmpeg from where to take the audio and video.</p>
<p><em>-filter_complex “[0:v] [0:a] [1:v] [1:a] [2:v] [2:a]</em></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note: [0:v][0:a]</strong> means FFmpeg needs to take the video and audio from the 0th video (file1.mp4).</p>
<p>Step3 Tell FFmpeg to concatenate three files (n&#x3D;3).</p>
<p><em>concat&#x3D;n&#x3D;3:v&#x3D;1:a&#x3D;1 [vv] [aa]“ \</em></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The <strong>v&#x3D;1:a&#x3D;1</strong> implies one stream for the audio and one stream for the video.</p>
<p>Step4 <strong>Map</strong> these audio and video outputs to the final video container. This is done as follows:</p>
<p><em>-map “[vv]“ -map “[aa]“ mergedVideo.mp4</em></p>
<p>It is important to note that this method requires re-encoding the videos, which can take more time and may result in a loss of quality. However, it offers the flexibility of filtering the videos before concatenating them. The filter_complex method in FFmpeg allows you to concatenate videos of different codecs and resolutions. The final step is to map the audio and video outputs to the final video container. This can be done using the -map command.</p>
<h3 id="Concatenate-Videos-With-Multiple-Audio-Streams-Using-FFmpeg"><a href="#Concatenate-Videos-With-Multiple-Audio-Streams-Using-FFmpeg" class="headerlink" title="Concatenate Videos With Multiple Audio Streams Using FFmpeg"></a>Concatenate Videos With Multiple Audio Streams Using FFmpeg</h3><p>Concatenating videos with multiple audio streams can be more complex than concatenating videos with a single audio stream. This section will cover the steps to concatenate videos with multiple audio streams using FFmpeg. We’ll be using the filter_complex method in FFmpeg, which allows you to manipulate and concatenate multiple audio and video streams in a single command. This method is more advanced but allows you to join videos with different audio streams and create a final video with multiple audio tracks.</p>
<p>Step1 <strong>Specify</strong> the input files and opening.mkv, episode.mkv, and ending.mkv:</p>
<p><em>$ ffmpeg -i opening.mkv -i episode.mkv -i ending.mkv -filter_complex</em></p>
<p>Step2 <strong>Use</strong> the <strong>filter_complex</strong> parameter in FFmpeg to specify the input streams for the video and audio.</p>
<p><em>[0:0] [0:1] [0:2] [1:0] [1:1] [1:2] [2:0] [2:1] [2:2]</em></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note: Single video stream</strong> ([0:0], [1:0], [2:0])</p>
<p><strong>Dual audio streams</strong> ([0:1][0:2], [1:1][1:2], [2:1][2:2])</p>
<p>Step3 <strong>Use</strong> the <strong>concat</strong> filter to specify that you want to concatenate 3 files (n&#x3D;3) with 1 video stream (v&#x3D;1) and 2 audio streams (a&#x3D;2). Specify the output streams as [v], [a1], [a2]:</p>
<p><em>concat&#x3D;n&#x3D;3:v&#x3D;1:a&#x3D;2 [v] [a1] [a2]</em></p>
<p>Step4 <strong>Use</strong> the <strong>-map</strong> option to map the output streams to the final video container:</p>
<p><em>-map ‘[v]‘ -map ‘[a1]‘ -map ‘[a2]‘ output.mkv</em></p>

<h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>FFmpeg is a powerful tool that allows you to concatenate videos in various ways. Whether you’re working with videos of the same codecs and resolutions or videos with multiple audio streams, FFmpeg can handle it. However, for users new to video editing or needing experience with command-line tools, using Filmora can be a more user-friendly option. It offers a simple drag-and-drop interface and a variety of features and effects to enhance the overall look of your video.</p>
<p>Step2 <strong>Run</strong> the FFmpeg command:</p>
<p><em>ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i join_video.txt -c copy output_demuxer.mp4</em></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note: <em>-safe 0</em></strong> is added to accept any file name.</p>
<p><strong><em>-c copy</em></strong> will copy all the streams.</p>
<p>As this method allows you to “stream copy” the files instead of re-encoding them, the concatenation is very fast. This can be a good option if you have videos with the same codecs and want to join them quickly without losing quality.</p>
<p><strong>Join Videos With the “Concat” Protocol</strong></p>
<p>The concat protocol in FFmpeg allows you to join together multiple video files in a specific format that supports file-level concatenation, such as MPEG-2 TS. However, it cannot be used for other video formats like MP4 and WEBM.</p>
<p>Here’s how to use the “concat protocol:</p>
<p>Step1 <strong>Run</strong> the FFmpeg command:</p>
<p><em>ffmpeg -i “concat:input1.ts|input2.ts” -c copy output_protocol.ts</em></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The concat protocol allows you to “stream copy” the files by adding the option <strong><em>-c copy</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Step2 <strong>Input</strong> the file name of the video using this code:</p>
<p><em>ffmpeg -i “concat:input1.mp4|input2.mp4” -c copy output_protocol.mp4</em></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you try to use this method on video formats that are not supported, only the first input video will be saved in the output video. And the video ends after the first video.</p>
<p>Although this method is limited in terms of supported video formats, it’s very easy to use if you merge videos in the supported formats. It’s a single command in the terminal without needing a text file. Additionally, using the -c copy option makes it efficient as it doesn’t require re-encoding, saving time.</p>
<h3 id="Concatenate-MP4-Video-Files-of-Different-Codecs-Resolutions-Using-FFmpeg-1"><a href="#Concatenate-MP4-Video-Files-of-Different-Codecs-Resolutions-Using-FFmpeg-1" class="headerlink" title="Concatenate MP4 Video Files of Different Codecs &amp; Resolutions Using FFmpeg"></a>Concatenate MP4 Video Files of Different Codecs &amp; Resolutions Using FFmpeg</h3><p>If the videos you want to concatenate have different codecs or resolutions, you can still use FFmpeg to join them together. However, this method requires re-encoding the videos, which can take longer and may result in a loss of quality. This section will cover the steps to concatenate videos with different codecs or resolutions using FFmpeg.</p>
<p>Here’s how to do it:</p>
<p>Step1 <strong>Provide</strong> the names of the input files to FFmpeg.</p>
<p><em>ffmpeg -i file1.mp4 -i file2.mp4 -i file3.mp4 \</em></p>
<p>Step2 <strong>Use</strong> the <strong>filter_complex</strong> filtergraph parameter to instruct FFmpeg from where to take the audio and video.</p>
<p><em>-filter_complex “[0:v] [0:a] [1:v] [1:a] [2:v] [2:a]</em></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note: [0:v][0:a]</strong> means FFmpeg needs to take the video and audio from the 0th video (file1.mp4).</p>
<p>Step3 Tell FFmpeg to concatenate three files (n&#x3D;3).</p>
<p><em>concat&#x3D;n&#x3D;3:v&#x3D;1:a&#x3D;1 [vv] [aa]“ \</em></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The <strong>v&#x3D;1:a&#x3D;1</strong> implies one stream for the audio and one stream for the video.</p>
<p>Step4 <strong>Map</strong> these audio and video outputs to the final video container. This is done as follows:</p>
<p><em>-map “[vv]“ -map “[aa]“ mergedVideo.mp4</em></p>
<p>It is important to note that this method requires re-encoding the videos, which can take more time and may result in a loss of quality. However, it offers the flexibility of filtering the videos before concatenating them. The filter_complex method in FFmpeg allows you to concatenate videos of different codecs and resolutions. The final step is to map the audio and video outputs to the final video container. This can be done using the -map command.</p>
<h3 id="Concatenate-Videos-With-Multiple-Audio-Streams-Using-FFmpeg-1"><a href="#Concatenate-Videos-With-Multiple-Audio-Streams-Using-FFmpeg-1" class="headerlink" title="Concatenate Videos With Multiple Audio Streams Using FFmpeg"></a>Concatenate Videos With Multiple Audio Streams Using FFmpeg</h3><p>Concatenating videos with multiple audio streams can be more complex than concatenating videos with a single audio stream. This section will cover the steps to concatenate videos with multiple audio streams using FFmpeg. We’ll be using the filter_complex method in FFmpeg, which allows you to manipulate and concatenate multiple audio and video streams in a single command. This method is more advanced but allows you to join videos with different audio streams and create a final video with multiple audio tracks.</p>
<p>Step1 <strong>Specify</strong> the input files and opening.mkv, episode.mkv, and ending.mkv:</p>
<p><em>$ ffmpeg -i opening.mkv -i episode.mkv -i ending.mkv -filter_complex</em></p>
<p>Step2 <strong>Use</strong> the <strong>filter_complex</strong> parameter in FFmpeg to specify the input streams for the video and audio.</p>
<p><em>[0:0] [0:1] [0:2] [1:0] [1:1] [1:2] [2:0] [2:1] [2:2]</em></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note: Single video stream</strong> ([0:0], [1:0], [2:0])</p>
<p><strong>Dual audio streams</strong> ([0:1][0:2], [1:1][1:2], [2:1][2:2])</p>
<p>Step3 <strong>Use</strong> the <strong>concat</strong> filter to specify that you want to concatenate 3 files (n&#x3D;3) with 1 video stream (v&#x3D;1) and 2 audio streams (a&#x3D;2). Specify the output streams as [v], [a1], [a2]:</p>
<p><em>concat&#x3D;n&#x3D;3:v&#x3D;1:a&#x3D;2 [v] [a1] [a2]</em></p>
<p>Step4 <strong>Use</strong> the <strong>-map</strong> option to map the output streams to the final video container:</p>
<p><em>-map ‘[v]‘ -map ‘[a1]‘ -map ‘[a2]‘ output.mkv</em></p>

From sparking up personal images with an extra element of fun and entertainment, to supplementing professional edits for effective business promotion strategies, emojis can adhere to just any graphic design concern you can possibly think of.</p>
<p>Diving further into the usage expanse, let us proceed to discuss about some of the most prominent advantages of working with emojis to uplift a graphic artwork in the following section:</p>
<h3 id="01Improved-Message-Clarity"><a href="#01Improved-Message-Clarity" class="headerlink" title="01Improved Message Clarity"></a>01Improved Message Clarity</h3><p>Regardless of the domain of application, emojis are known to amplify the appearance and clarity of your content with a simple graphic add-on. Circulating you information through a text message may often sound uninteresting and under the line. On the other hand, including a suitable emoji caters to define a relation between the text message and the information it intends to convey.</p>
<p>Effective information delivery becomes additionally important when your content is aimed at addressing professional constraints. While the general class of viewers finds it difficult to exactly interpret audio-visual elements, images go well with the diverse audience categories.</p>
<p>People who choose to complement a text-based interaction with emojis to address their audience, easily succeed in establishing a strong emotional connect among their viewers and the message being conveyed. This works to a positively accelerated response from their audience.</p>
<h3 id="02Emojis-Boast-of-a-Universal-Credibility"><a href="#02Emojis-Boast-of-a-Universal-Credibility" class="headerlink" title="02Emojis Boast of a Universal Credibility"></a>02Emojis Boast of a Universal Credibility</h3><p>The era of technological revolutions have made the globe a small place to contact and . Thanks to the advent of digital communication platforms, you can reach out to a diversified range of audience to deliver your content. Such flexibilities may often render your text based information inaccessible to specific classes of viewers on account of demographic and language constraints.</p>
<p>Emojis on the other hand, are free from the aforesaid limitations and have a universal impact on every viewer group, irrespective of geographical and native communication boundaries. True that the recent updates in platform interfaces have worked towards including language translators, the service is often partially or completely inaccurate. In the light of these circumstances, using emojis is of great help with globally accepted and understood symbols.</p>
<h3 id="03Emojis-Add-Life-to-Your-Content"><a href="#03Emojis-Add-Life-to-Your-Content" class="headerlink" title="03Emojis Add Life to Your Content"></a>03Emojis Add Life to Your Content</h3><p>Using plain text to convey your message is an outdated strategy in today’s times, owing to the obvious disadvantage of bland interaction. Text centered information often fails to establish a cohesive connect with its audience, often resulting the information getting unnoticed or wrongly interpreted. On the contrary, emojis work to add the missing emotional connection between the audience and the message being delivered.</p>
<p>These graphic elements help to add the humanistic feel to your information, as the viewers of today take emojis as an integral part of personal and professional interactions across digital communication platforms. If you are aiming at an increased audience viewership of your information, message or brand, try hands at making them expressive with the use of these eye catching graphic elements.</p>
<h3 id="04Ensure-Audience-Engagement"><a href="#04Ensure-Audience-Engagement" class="headerlink" title="04Ensure Audience Engagement"></a>04Ensure Audience Engagement</h3><p>Emojis are an effective means to draw the attention of your potential audience towards the content you are aiming to deliver. While a boring, plain text may go unnoticed; emojis cater to attract the viewers for sparing a look at what you have to say. This can explicitly offer great help in case you want to converse with people on digital and social media platforms to address a call-to-action strategy in future.</p>
<p>Talking in the light of viewer responses, a member within your audience would ideally prefer using an emoji to express a point in the comment section, instead of typing an entire string of words. Emojis have managed to become a habituated communication tool on digital and social media platforms, with people having developed a tendency to use the light action emojis instead of recursive typing to express their views.</p>
<h3 id="05Make-Your-Content-Stand-Ahead-of-the-Line"><a href="#05Make-Your-Content-Stand-Ahead-of-the-Line" class="headerlink" title="05Make Your Content Stand Ahead of the Line"></a>05Make Your Content Stand Ahead of the Line</h3><p>This particular merit of using emojis comes handy when you need to address an accelerated competition to make sure that your brand stands stable in the dynamic marketing environment. While the latter is flooded with product choices competitive to your brand, you will obviously need to put in some extra effort to get noticed.</p>
<p>Working towards the same, you can experiment with adding cohesive and relatable emojis aside of your product logo to signify the activity or the message that the latter is aimed at conveying. If you are still confused what to add, try seeking help from the emoji centered product campaigns of leading market brands.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Eight-Best-Websites-to-Add-Emoji-to-Photo-Online"><a href="#Part-2-Eight-Best-Websites-to-Add-Emoji-to-Photo-Online" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Eight Best Websites to Add Emoji to Photo Online"></a>Part 2 Eight Best Websites to Add Emoji to Photo Online</h2><p>As already stated, emojis have become an integral part of modern day communications, particularly on social media platforms and chat service utilities ever since their advent. While these graphic elements work to uplift your ordinary conversations on a personal level, their professional significance has earned an equal recognition.</p>
<p>Having talked enough about the benefits of including emojis in text based communication, let us divert our attention to discuss about the credibility of these elements towards image editing applications.
