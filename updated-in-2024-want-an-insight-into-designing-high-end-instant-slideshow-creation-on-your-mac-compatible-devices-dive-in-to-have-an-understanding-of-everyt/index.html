<p>Make your Xbox console reflect your personal style by changing its look and feel. Choose a favourite colour, update your background with game art or a customised image, or select a different theme.</p>

<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>You probably already have an idea of how to use a green screen, at least in principle. You film something or someone in front of a colored background — the green screen — then you replace everything that’s in the color of the screen with other footage, images, charts, presentations, or whatever visuals you want. However, Chroma keying a live stream works almost the same way. The main difference is that you have to replace the green screen as you’re filming, rather than during editing.</p>
<p><strong>Pro tip</strong>:</p>
<p>You can follow the instructions above and live stream to multiple platforms at once with Restream. Multistreaming to platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Twitch, and LinkedIn allows you to drastically increase the audience reach and grow your followers.</p>

In this article, we will take a look at the software Lightworks and learn how to cut videos using it.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we will cover the cutting of videos in Lightworks. We will talk about what Lightworks is and how to download it. We’ll also cover the general interface so you know which buttons do what. Finally, we’ll talk about exporting a finished video and getting started with your next project in Lightworks!</p>
<h2 id="What-is-Lightworks"><a href="#What-is-Lightworks" class="headerlink" title="What is Lightworks?"></a>What is Lightworks?</h2><p>Lightworks is an editing software created by a company called Lightworks. It’s a free video editor that is incredibly powerful and has been used to edit some of the most popular films of recent years.</p>
<p>The software was originally designed for professional filmmakers, but it’s now available for anyone to use for any type of project. You can download Lightworks from the website here - <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.lightworks.com/" >https://www.lightworks.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<h2 id="Downloading-the-Software"><a href="#Downloading-the-Software" class="headerlink" title="Downloading the Software"></a>Downloading the Software</h2><p>First, download the Lightworks software from the website. You can do this by clicking on the big green button that says “Download the Latest Version”. When you click on it, you’ll be prompted to select your operating system and download the appropriate package.</p>
<p>Click “Next” and you’ll see a license agreement and a prompt for installation details. Fill in your information and click “Next” again to start your installation.</p>
<p>When installation is complete, launch Lightworks by double-clicking on the Lightworks icon in your files section.</p>
<p>The first time you open Lightworks, you’ll need to go through a few steps of initializing before using it for editing videos. This includes setting up your project settings and choosing whether or not to keep a backup of your previous work.</p>
<p>We will cover these initial steps separately in future blog posts, so don’t worry if it’s all unclear right now!</p>
<h2 id="The-Interface"><a href="#The-Interface" class="headerlink" title="The Interface"></a>The Interface</h2><p>New users to the software will notice that there are four different windows. The first window is the Project window. This window shows you all of the footage you have loaded into your project, as well as any clips you’ve added to your project (see below) and edits you’ve made. You may also notice a timeline in this window; this is where you’ll be placing your clips to create your video.</p>

                      alt="cut-video-in-lightworks"
                ></p>
<p>The Toolbar is located at the top of all four windows and gives quick access to commonly used features like adding clips, cropping, cutting clips, and more.</p>
