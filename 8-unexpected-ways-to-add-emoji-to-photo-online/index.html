It is a very great cloud storage service and most people use it. Google Photos has introduced an artificial intelligence technology into the app. That’s why it can automatically organize and rotate.</p>

You can easily fix the rotation and aspect ratio of your videos. But it’s a little tricky.</p>
<p>I’m going to show you how to flip your videos from portrait mode to landscape mode or from landscape mode to portrait mode.</p>
<p>You need to open up your google photos app and choose the video you want to flip, then you’re going to pick the button in the bottom middle with the levers on it and in the bottom right hand corner.</p>

<p>Here’s How to do it…</p>

                      alt="rotate-video-google-photos"
                ></p>
<p>You will notice that I have changed the rotation of my video from its original position to the rotated angle.</p>
<p>You can rotate upside down, rotate left, rotate right or 90 degrees clockwise, 180 degrees, 270 degrees, 360 degrees rotate, and back to the original. Check the video result in the preview window. Once you get satisfied with the rotation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hit the <strong>ok</strong></li>
<li>Select the <strong>save</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p>Now you can see that the image has flipped without making a big effort you can also do it. I have done it for you, you are smarter.</p>
<p>Just go ahead and start…</p>
<p> Scale is also used to remove the unwanted and rubbish scenes from the selected video. Like if you don’t want to show something behind the scene, you can use the scale function to cut that scene from your video.</p>

Next, place the camera on a tripod, and tilt down to show the table from the top.</p>

<p>Step2 After that, put the arm on the tableand keep it still while filming. Meanwhile, have another hand perform on the other side of the frame and pretend to use magic to remove the tattoo.</p>

<p>Step3 Next, you need a picture of a tattoo. Indeed, it would be better to have the tattoo in the same position on the arm so it can match the video clip we just filmed.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Object-Tracking"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Object-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Object Tracking"></a>Part 1. What Is Object Tracking</h2><p>Object Tracking is an application of computer vision that involves tracking the movement of objects in real-time. It is a useful tool for many different purposes, such as video surveillance, human-computer interaction, and automotive safety.</p>
<p>The Object Tracking algorithm is a deep-learning-based program that works by developing a model for each individual object and creating a set of trajectories to represent their movement. This is done through an indication, such as a square that follows the object and tells the users about its location on the screen in real-time.</p>
<p>Its algorithms are designed to work with various types of inputs, including everything from images and videos to real-time footage. The input you expect to use will impact the category, use cases, and object tracking applications.</p>

<h2 id="Part-2-Types-Of-Object-Tracking"><a href="#Part-2-Types-Of-Object-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Types Of Object Tracking"></a>Part 2. Types Of Object Tracking</h2><p>There are two main types or levels of Object Tracking: SOT and MOT</p>
<h3 id="SOT"><a href="#SOT" class="headerlink" title="SOT"></a>SOT</h3><p>Single Object Tracking or Visual Object Tracking is a process in which the bounding box of the target object is assigned to the tracker in the first frame. The tracker then detects the same object in all the other frames.</p>
<p>SOT only detects and tracks a single object and comes under the category of detection-free tracking, which implies that it is manually initialized with a fixed number of objects, even though other objects are present in the frames.</p>
<p>Let’s understand it with an example: A police department is resolving a murder case that involves a car on the highway. They received surveillance camera footage and wanted to track the vehicle to resolve the mystery. However, it might take time to do it manually. Therefore, they will use the Single Object Tracking process and will assign the tracker a bounding box for the target car to check what happens to it.</p>

<h3 id="MOT"><a href="#MOT" class="headerlink" title="MOT"></a>MOT</h3><p>Multiple Object Tracking involves tracking multiple objects in a frame. Since its development in 1988 by Zenon Pylyshyn, several experiments have been conducted to see how human and computer vision systems can detect and track multiple objects in a frame.</p>
<p>As an output, multiple tracking creates several bounding boxes and are identified using certain parameters such as coordinates, width, height, etc. MOT program is not pre-trained regarding the appearance or amount of objects to be tracked.</p>
<p>Moreover, the algorithm assigns a detection ID to each box which helps the model in identifying the objects within a class. For instance, if multiple cars are in a frame, the MOT algorithm will identify each car as a separate object and assign them a unique ID.</p>

What Multi Object Tracking Needs?</h2><p>Above is the explaination of MOT. In this part, we will focus on its mechanism. Following are some of the most important requirements of Multi Object Tracking:</p>
<h3 id="1-Detection"><a href="#1-Detection" class="headerlink" title="1. Detection"></a>1. Detection</h3><p>The best approach to detect objects of your interest depends on what you’re trying to track and if the camera is stationary or moving.</p>
<p><strong>MOT Using Stationary Camera</strong></p>
<p>The <em>vision.ForegroundDetector</em> System object can be used to detect objects in motion against a stationary background by performing background subtraction. This approach is efficient but requires that the camera be stationary.</p>
<p><strong>MOT Using Moving Camera</strong></p>
<p>A sliding-window detection approach is often used with a moving camera to detect objects in motion. However, this approach is slower than the background subtraction method.</p>
<p>Use the following approaches for tracing the given categories of objects.</p>

<h3 id="2-Prediction"><a href="#2-Prediction" class="headerlink" title="2. Prediction"></a>2. Prediction</h3><p>The second requirement for Multi Object Tracking is “Prediction.” In this, you have to predict the position of the tracking object in the next frame. To do this, you can design the model to use the Kalman filter (<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/vision/ref/vision.kalmanfilter.html" >vision.KalmanFilter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>).</p>
<p>This will help predict the next location of the object in the frames. For this, it will take into account the object’s constant velocity, constant acceleration measurement noise, and process noise. Measurement noise is the detection of an error, while process noise is the variation in the object’s actual motion from that of the motion model.</p>
<h3 id="3-Data-Association"><a href="#3-Data-Association" class="headerlink" title="3. Data Association"></a>3. Data Association</h3><p>Data association is a critical step in Multiple Object Tracking and involves linking the data points together that represent the same thing across different frames.</p>
