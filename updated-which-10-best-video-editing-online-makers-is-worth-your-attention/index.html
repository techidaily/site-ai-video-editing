<h3 id="02InVideo"><a href="#02InVideo" class="headerlink" title="02InVideo"></a>02InVideo</h3><p><strong>Adaptable Systems:</strong> All popular operating systems</p>
<p>The InVideo online editing tool is probably the best alternative you can get for a quick customization of your video footage. The utility houses a series of tools and features to create classic masterpieces of clip edits. The program’s library allows you to expand your graphic design creativity with its extensive variety of in built editing templates. The add-on elements are no less with an appealing range of masks, stickers and vector shapes to spark up your creations.</p>
<p>The tool has a paid collection of more than 3 million preset templates, which get reduced to a count of 1 million for free version users. This is however, a cumulative figure with an addition of premium features. The free template options, though limited, are appealing to work with. As far as the customization options are concerned, the utility recommends you to create your brand prior to beginning with the editing process.</p>
<p>You can set a brand by adding the name and logo of your company, along with specific colors to a preferred default template. This causes your brand elements to stay in the tool’s editing dashboard for an instant access in times of need. The tool allows you to create video edits in the vertical, square and wide aspect ratios, which you can switch between, while customizing the preset video template.</p>
<p>When it comes to exporting your creation, the free version of the tool limits you to a local save of the edits in your device’s media gallery in a 720 pixel resolution, along with a direct sharing facility for Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. The utility additionally leaves its watermark on the output video. The aforesaid limitations can however be overcome by availing a paid subscription of the online editing program.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> You are granted a complete control on the video customization process to add the elements of your choice.</p>

<h2 id="Light-a-subject"><a href="#Light-a-subject" class="headerlink" title="Light a subject"></a>Light a subject</h2><p>Although you may assume that cinematography is just concerned with the usage of the camera, lighting plays an equally important role. While planning your photographs, you should think about how the scene is lit and how your subject is illuminated.</p>

<h3 id="Hard-light-and-soft-light"><a href="#Hard-light-and-soft-light" class="headerlink" title="Hard light and soft light"></a>Hard light and soft light</h3><p>The cinematographers mainly focus on the hard and soft lights during filmmaking. The <strong>hard lights</strong> give a softer look to the subject. They are pointing to the light sources which are closer to the subject in the video. It makes the photographs and shots harsher and more dramatic.</p>

<h3 id="Examples"><a href="#Examples" class="headerlink" title="Examples"></a>Examples</h3><p>In this music video of the 3lau’s, the main prop used is a bus, which is presented in the middle of the set and lit very well. The bus is rounded by many tungsten lights, which give a resemblance to those street lights. They are set up automatically in such a way that this stimulates the real movement of the bus on the road.</p>

<p>The three projectors are set to give the street footage at the back scene to add more realism.</p>
<p>The three lights are set in the queue by the production team to get the memory of the protagonist. In the setup, soft lights are also added on top of all the upper windows of the bus to give blue interior light to the bus.</p>

<h3 id="Prime-lenses"><a href="#Prime-lenses" class="headerlink" title="Prime lenses"></a>Prime lenses</h3><p>The foremost and most helpful lenses in filming are called prime lenses, which have fixed focal lengths. There is no Johns to zoom out and zoom-in in prime lenses.</p>
<p>For filming, we need to choose the right level of zoom, which the DP does by picking the right lens for the footage.</p>

<p>In the close-up scenes, there is a requirement for a wider field of view which also depends on the aspect ratio of shooting.</p>
<h2 id="Aspect-Ratio"><a href="#Aspect-Ratio" class="headerlink" title="Aspect Ratio"></a>Aspect Ratio</h2><p>In filmy view, the most appropriate aspect ratio is 2.35, which is also a cinematic ratio. There is also another ratio of 16:9, which is a wider ratio. While 2.35 gives a more narrow perspective as compared to the prior one.</p>

<p>Whenever we use a microscope, we are dealing with the aspect ratio and narrowing down to the required point where we want to look, and this is all about framing, which is discussed as shown below!</p>
<h2 id="Framing"><a href="#Framing" class="headerlink" title="Framing"></a>Framing</h2><p>Framing is a way used to illustrate the concepts such as the rule of thirds and leading lines. To give customized headroom to the subject, the framing is used from the top of the head and the top of the frame.</p>
<h2 id="Camera-Movement"><a href="#Camera-Movement" class="headerlink" title="Camera Movement"></a>Camera Movement</h2><p>The camera movement actually shows the real story presented in the music video. The camera movements used for filming are mainly the pedestal, truck, pan, tilt, and roll.</p>

<p>Whenever the protagonist looks out the bus’s window, the camera operator will use the “Dolly” and “Trucking” movements.</p>
<h3 id="Trucking-Movement"><a href="#Trucking-Movement" class="headerlink" title="Trucking Movement"></a>Trucking Movement</h3><p>The trucking movement of the camera is done in left-to-right motion in the filming.

<h3 id="Dolly-Movement"><a href="#Dolly-Movement" class="headerlink" title="Dolly Movement"></a>Dolly Movement</h3><p>The dolly movement of the camera is done by moving towards or away from the subject. This often gives a sense of importance to the character.</p>

<h2 id="Light-a-Set-1"><a href="#Light-a-Set-1" class="headerlink" title="Light a Set"></a>Light a Set</h2><p>To give proper lights in the set is illustrated with the help of an example as shown below!</p>
<h3 id="Examples-1"><a href="#Examples-1" class="headerlink" title="Examples"></a>Examples</h3><p>In this music video of the 3lau’s, the main prop used is a bus, which is presented in the middle of the set and lit very well. The bus is rounded by many tungsten lights, which give a resemblance to those street lights. They are set up automatically in such a way that this stimulates the real movement of the bus on the road.</p>

                ></p>
<p>The three projectors are set to give the street footage at the back scene to add more realism.</p>
<p>The three lights are set in the queue by the production team to get the memory of the protagonist. In the setup, soft lights are also added on top of all the upper windows of the bus to give blue interior light to the bus.</p>
<h2 id="Camera-Techniques-1"><a href="#Camera-Techniques-1" class="headerlink" title="Camera Techniques"></a>Camera Techniques</h2><p>The cameras used during filming play a major role in giving the cinematographic shots. All the techniques shown below are applied to the DSLRs and even the smartphones you use for filming.</p>
<h3 id="Prime-lenses-1"><a href="#Prime-lenses-1" class="headerlink" title="Prime lenses"></a>Prime lenses</h3><p>The foremost and most helpful lenses in filming are called prime lenses, which have fixed focal lengths. There is no Johns to zoom out and zoom-in in prime lenses.</p>
<p>For filming, we need to choose the right level of zoom, which the DP does by picking the right lens for the footage.</p>

                ></p>
<p>In the close-up scenes, there is a requirement for a wider field of view which also depends on the aspect ratio of shooting.</p>
<h2 id="Aspect-Ratio-1"><a href="#Aspect-Ratio-1" class="headerlink" title="Aspect Ratio"></a>Aspect Ratio</h2><p>In filmy view, the most appropriate aspect ratio is 2.35, which is also a cinematic ratio. There is also another ratio of 16:9, which is a wider ratio. While 2.35 gives a more narrow perspective as compared to the prior one.</p>

                      alt="note"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The narrow ratio is helpful in showing the relationships between the subjects.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Whenever we use a microscope, we are dealing with the aspect ratio and narrowing down to the required point where we want to look, and this is all about framing, which is discussed as shown below!</p>
<h2 id="Framing-1"><a href="#Framing-1" class="headerlink" title="Framing"></a>Framing</h2><p>Framing is a way used to illustrate the concepts such as the rule of thirds and leading lines. To give customized headroom to the subject, the framing is used from the top of the head and the top of the frame.</p>
<h2 id="Camera-Movement-1"><a href="#Camera-Movement-1" class="headerlink" title="Camera Movement"></a>Camera Movement</h2><p>The camera movement actually shows the real story presented in the music video. The camera movements used for filming are mainly the pedestal, truck, pan, tilt, and roll.</p>

<p>Whenever the protagonist looks out the bus’s window, the camera operator will use the “Dolly” and “Trucking” movements.</p>
<h3 id="Trucking-Movement-1"><a href="#Trucking-Movement-1" class="headerlink" title="Trucking Movement"></a>Trucking Movement</h3><p>The trucking movement of the camera is done in left-to-right motion in the filming. This is used for emotional purposes and whenever the subject is in a pull-out shot.</p>
<h3 id="Dolly-Movement-1"><a href="#Dolly-Movement-1" class="headerlink" title="Dolly Movement"></a>Dolly Movement</h3><p>The dolly movement of the camera is done by moving towards or away from the subject. This often gives a sense of importance to the character.</p>

<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/How-to-create-photoshop-gif-the-100%25-easy-way-1.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop- Image Selection"
                ></p>
<p>Reach the ‘File’ tab at the top and load your image files into the Photoshop stack using the following path:</p>
<p><strong>File -&gt; Scripts -&gt; Load Files into Stack</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/How-to-create-photoshop-gif-the-100%25-easy-way-2.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop- File Stack Loading"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2: Image Selection</strong></p>
<p>In the next pop-up window, click ‘Browse’ and choose the image file you wish to load into the Photoshop stack. In case the selected images seem tom lack proper alignment, click on the ‘Attempt to Automatically Align Source Images’ checkbox to set this straight and make your GIF frame stable.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Photoshop- Confirm Selection Window"
                ></p>
<p>At this instant, Photoshop starts creating layers for the uploaded images, which you can see in the ‘Layers’ panel at the bottom-right. You are allowed to rearrange the image layers by selecting and dragging them or click on layer names to rename them.</p>
<p><img

<p><strong>●</strong> Tap the ‘Crop’ symbol.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Adjust the crop frame to select the desired portion.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Click on ‘Enter’ to confirm the action.</p>

                      alt="Photoshop- Time Frame Selection"
                ></p>

                      alt="Photoshop- Top Layer Hiding"
                ></p>
<p>Continue to hide previous layers in successive frames so that each layer appears in its respective frame at the end of the process.</p>
