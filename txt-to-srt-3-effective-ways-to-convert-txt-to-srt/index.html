That’s when knowing “how to edit TXT file and save it as SRT file” would come in handy.</p>
<p>Here’s how you can edit the TXT file without using any external software and online tools:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you’re using a Windows computer, then you can open your TXT document in Microsoft Notepad. For a Mac computer, you can use TextEdit. On the very first line of the document, type a number to identify the subtitle’s section. Each section indicates an individual subtitle, which could be a sound or one sentence from a dialogue.</li>
<li>The next line would be the timestamp of the subtitle. <em>Timestamp</em> follows this formatting: <em>hours: minutes: seconds, milliseconds.</em></li>
<li>In the next line, write your caption.</li>
<li>Now add double space between the next section and write it as you did for the previous section.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that you’ve formatted the TXT file to use it as a subtitle file, let’s save it .SRT format. Here’s how to save your file as .SRT:</p>
<p>1. Go to the File tab and select Save as.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="save as srt file with notepad"
                ></p>
<p>2. Now, save the document with a .**SRT** extension.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/convert-txt-to-srt-15.jpg"
                      alt="edit the save as type option to save txt to srt file"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

Secondly, quality is the thing that matters the most and you should be sure of a high resolution audio-visual inclusion to avoid viewer distraction.</p>
