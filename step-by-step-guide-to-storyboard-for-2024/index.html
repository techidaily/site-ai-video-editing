The slideshow can be created for your friends, family, relatives, or YouTube or social media platform viewers. Depending on the target audience, the content and other slideshow elements will vary.</p>
<h3 id="02Choose-a-travel-story-3"><a href="#02Choose-a-travel-story-3" class="headerlink" title="02Choose a travel story"></a>02Choose a travel story</h3><p>Next, you need to decide upon the story of your travel slideshow. Depending on the story, you can pick up the content to be included. The story can be based on the places you visited, food, local shopping, and others.

<p>Nothing is more satisfying than seeing the final cut of a video and realizing that everything we filmed is crystal clear, with vibrant colors and balanced light. Unfortunately, whether you are editing on your own or collaborating with a team, this can be difficult to achieve because color problems often occur. Unlike photo editors, where one photo can easily be fixed without affecting the rest of an album, video editing requires adjusting to fix one problem. We’ll look at three different methods to correct color distortion in videos.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-8"><a href="#In-this-article-8" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What Is Color Distortion</a></p>

<h2 id="What-Is-Color-Distortion"><a href="#What-Is-Color-Distortion" class="headerlink" title="What Is Color Distortion"></a>What Is Color Distortion</h2><p>Color distortion, also called chromatic aberration (CA), happens when the camera’s lens cannot resolve the wavelengths of light that it is recording. It occurs due to dispersion, which is when the lens elements’ refractive index varies with the light wavelength.</p>
<p>The refractive index of transparent materials often reduces with increasing wavelength. Because a lens’ focal length depends on the index of refraction, this variation in refraction index affects focusing.</p>
<p>There are two types of CA: transverse (lateral) and axial (longitudinal). Axial aberration happens when different wavelengths of light focus at different distances from a lens (focus shift). Essentially, longitudinal aberration is often at long focal lengths.</p>
<p>On the other hand, transverse aberration happens when different wavelengths focus at different places in the focal plane due to the magnification or distortion of the lens varying with wavelength. Ideally, transverse aberration is often at short focal lengths.</p>
<p>The two types of CA have different characteristics, and they may occur together. Axial chromatic aberration occurs throughout an image, and you can reduce it by stopping down, hence increasing the depth of the field so that although the different wavelengths are focusing at different distances, they’re still in acceptable focus.</p>
<p>When it comes to transverse chromatic aberration, it doesn’t occur in the middle of the image, and it increases towards the edge. What’s more? Stopping down does not affect it.</p>
<h2 id="How-will-Color-Distortion-Affect-Your-Videos"><a href="#How-will-Color-Distortion-Affect-Your-Videos" class="headerlink" title="How will Color Distortion Affect Your Videos?"></a>How will Color Distortion Affect Your Videos?</h2><p>Colour distortion displays itself as “fringes” of color on the boundaries separating bright and dark parts of the image in a video. Color distortion can also occur when adding effects to a video, such as the use of a green screen. By using the green screen to replace the real thing, the colors in the video can appear a little off.</p>

<ul>
<li>Contrast allows you to control the difference in brightness and color in different areas of your video image. The Brightness setting lets you customize the overall darkness or lightness of the video image.</li>
<li>With the Saturation setting, you can make the colors in your video image appear more inconspicuous or saturated.</li>
<li>If the color in your video image is set too high, it will look oversaturated. The colors will be washed out and muted if it’s set to low. The Tint control in Filmora allows you to adjust the balance between these two chroma channels.</li>
<li>Additionally, you can employ Hollywood film-looking color sets for videos from Sparta 300, Walking Dead, Game of Thrones, Star Wars, and much more.</li>

<p>Nothing is more satisfying than seeing the final cut of a video and realizing that everything we filmed is crystal clear, with vibrant colors and balanced light. Unfortunately, whether you are editing on your own or collaborating with a team, this can be difficult to achieve because color problems often occur. Unlike photo editors, where one photo can easily be fixed without affecting the rest of an album, video editing requires adjusting to fix one problem. We’ll look at three different methods to correct color distortion in videos.</p>

<h2 id="What-Is-Color-Distortion-1"><a href="#What-Is-Color-Distortion-1" class="headerlink" title="What Is Color Distortion"></a>What Is Color Distortion</h2><p>Color distortion, also called chromatic aberration (CA), happens when the camera’s lens cannot resolve the wavelengths of light that it is recording. It occurs due to dispersion, which is when the lens elements’ refractive index varies with the light wavelength.</p>
<p>The refractive index of transparent materials often reduces with increasing wavelength. Because a lens’ focal length depends on the index of refraction, this variation in refraction index affects focusing.</p>
<p>There are two types of CA: transverse (lateral) and axial (longitudinal). Axial aberration happens when different wavelengths of light focus at different distances from a lens (focus shift). Essentially, longitudinal aberration is often at long focal lengths.</p>
<p>On the other hand, transverse aberration happens when different wavelengths focus at different places in the focal plane due to the magnification or distortion of the lens varying with wavelength. Ideally, transverse aberration is often at short focal lengths.</p>
<p>The two types of CA have different characteristics, and they may occur together. Axial chromatic aberration occurs throughout an image, and you can reduce it by stopping down, hence increasing the depth of the field so that although the different wavelengths are focusing at different distances, they’re still in acceptable focus.</p>
<p>When it comes to transverse chromatic aberration, it doesn’t occur in the middle of the image, and it increases towards the edge. What’s more? Stopping down does not affect it.</p>

Color distortion can also occur when adding effects to a video, such as the use of a green screen. By using the green screen to replace the real thing, the colors in the video can appear a little off.</p>

<p>Nothing is more satisfying than seeing the final cut of a video and realizing that everything we filmed is crystal clear, with vibrant colors and balanced light. Unfortunately, whether you are editing on your own or collaborating with a team, this can be difficult to achieve because color problems often occur. Unlike photo editors, where one photo can easily be fixed without affecting the rest of an album, video editing requires adjusting to fix one problem. We’ll look at three different methods to correct color distortion in videos.</p>

<h2 id="What-Is-Color-Distortion-3"><a href="#What-Is-Color-Distortion-3" class="headerlink" title="What Is Color Distortion"></a>What Is Color Distortion</h2><p>Color distortion, also called chromatic aberration (CA), happens when the camera’s lens cannot resolve the wavelengths of light that it is recording. It occurs due to dispersion, which is when the lens elements’ refractive index varies with the light wavelength.</p>
<p>The refractive index of transparent materials often reduces with increasing wavelength. Because a lens’ focal length depends on the index of refraction, this variation in refraction index affects focusing.</p>
<p>There are two types of CA: transverse (lateral) and axial (longitudinal). Axial aberration happens when different wavelengths of light focus at different distances from a lens (focus shift). Essentially, longitudinal aberration is often at long focal lengths.</p>
<p>On the other hand, transverse aberration happens when different wavelengths focus at different places in the focal plane due to the magnification or distortion of the lens varying with wavelength. Ideally, transverse aberration is often at short focal lengths.</p>
<p>The two types of CA have different characteristics, and they may occur together. Axial chromatic aberration occurs throughout an image, and you can reduce it by stopping down, hence increasing the depth of the field so that although the different wavelengths are focusing at different distances, they’re still in acceptable focus.</p>
<p>When it comes to transverse chromatic aberration, it doesn’t occur in the middle of the image, and it increases towards the edge. What’s more? Stopping down does not affect it.</p>
<h2 id="How-will-Color-Distortion-Affect-Your-Videos-3"><a href="#How-will-Color-Distortion-Affect-Your-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="How will Color Distortion Affect Your Videos?"></a>How will Color Distortion Affect Your Videos?</h2><p>Colour distortion displays itself as “fringes” of color on the boundaries separating bright and dark parts of the image in a video. Color distortion can also occur when adding effects to a video, such as the use of a green screen. By using the green screen to replace the real thing, the colors in the video can appear a little off.</p>
