<p>Listening has always been more enjoyable, easier, and faster than reading. We understand better when we are listening. So it is good news for us that our life has been made even easier with the development of <strong>TTS</strong> technology or <strong>Text-to-Speech technology</strong>.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, <strong>TTS</strong> or <strong>Text-to-Speech</strong> is a technology that can convert texts to speech or voices. In other words, it is a technology that reads aloud any type of digital text so one can just listen to it without having to manually read those texts himself&#x2F;herself. Text-to-Speech is also known as <strong>speech synthesis</strong>, which means artificial human speech production.</p>
<p>Though Text-to-Speech might sound like a new technology to most people, it has been here for a long time now. It’s just that only the big companies and some authorities had access to it in the past. But now, we can easily find this technology around us. Some of the popular examples would be audiobooks, read-aloud functions on websites, voice assistants like Alexa, Siri, etc.</p>
<p>While text-to-speech service is widely used for convenience and ease of life, its importance is not just limited to that. This technology has been extremely helpful for those with visible imparities and those who cannot read or write. Not only that, but it also has a great contribution to the field of education, business, and technology itself.</p>
<p>So now that we’re a little familiar with this Text to Speech system, it’s about time we have a look at some of the best Text to Speech software or say, Text to Speech converters. In this article, we’ll be covering the <strong>Top 20 Best Text to Speech Software</strong> with their price, features, and cons along with the platforms they are available for like Windows, Mac, Android, iPhone, and Online:</p>

<p>Listening has always been more enjoyable, easier, and faster than reading. We understand better when we are listening. So it is good news for us that our life has been made even easier with the development of <strong>TTS</strong> technology or <strong>Text-to-Speech technology</strong>.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, <strong>TTS</strong> or <strong>Text-to-Speech</strong> is a technology that can convert texts to speech or voices. In other words, it is a technology that reads aloud any type of digital text so one can just listen to it without having to manually read those texts himself&#x2F;herself. Text-to-Speech is also known as <strong>speech synthesis</strong>, which means artificial human speech production.</p>
<p>Though Text-to-Speech might sound like a new technology to most people, it has been here for a long time now. It’s just that only the big companies and some authorities had access to it in the past. But now, we can easily find this technology around us. Some of the popular examples would be audiobooks, read-aloud functions on websites, voice assistants like Alexa, Siri, etc.</p>
<p>While text-to-speech service is widely used for convenience and ease of life, its importance is not just limited to that. This technology has been extremely helpful for those with visible imparities and those who cannot read or write. Not only that, but it also has a great contribution to the field of education, business, and technology itself.</p>
<p>So now that we’re a little familiar with this Text to Speech system, it’s about time we have a look at some of the best Text to Speech software or say, Text to Speech converters.

<p>Listening has always been more enjoyable, easier, and faster than reading. We understand better when we are listening. So it is good news for us that our life has been made even easier with the development of <strong>TTS</strong> technology or <strong>Text-to-Speech technology</strong>.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, <strong>TTS</strong> or <strong>Text-to-Speech</strong> is a technology that can convert texts to speech or voices. In other words, it is a technology that reads aloud any type of digital text so one can just listen to it without having to manually read those texts himself&#x2F;herself. Text-to-Speech is also known as <strong>speech synthesis</strong>, which means artificial human speech production.</p>
<p>Though Text-to-Speech might sound like a new technology to most people, it has been here for a long time now. It’s just that only the big companies and some authorities had access to it in the past. But now, we can easily find this technology around us. Some of the popular examples would be audiobooks, read-aloud functions on websites, voice assistants like Alexa, Siri, etc.</p>
<p>While text-to-speech service is widely used for convenience and ease of life, its importance is not just limited to that. This technology has been extremely helpful for those with visible imparities and those who cannot read or write. Not only that, but it also has a great contribution to the field of education, business, and technology itself.</p>

<p>Listening has always been more enjoyable, easier, and faster than reading. We understand better when we are listening. So it is good news for us that our life has been made even easier with the development of <strong>TTS</strong> technology or <strong>Text-to-Speech technology</strong>.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, <strong>TTS</strong> or <strong>Text-to-Speech</strong> is a technology that can convert texts to speech or voices. In other words, it is a technology that reads aloud any type of digital text so one can just listen to it without having to manually read those texts himself&#x2F;herself. Text-to-Speech is also known as <strong>speech synthesis</strong>, which means artificial human speech production.</p>
<p>Though Text-to-Speech might sound like a new technology to most people, it has been here for a long time now. It’s just that only the big companies and some authorities had access to it in the past. But now, we can easily find this technology around us. Some of the popular examples would be audiobooks, read-aloud functions on websites, voice assistants like Alexa, Siri, etc.</p>
<p>While text-to-speech service is widely used for convenience and ease of life, its importance is not just limited to that. This technology has been extremely helpful for those with visible imparities and those who cannot read or write. Not only that, but it also has a great contribution to the field of education, business, and technology itself.</p>
