<p>A programmer named “Gabest’’ created and designed this platform as a closed-source application. Things changed, and he later relicensed the media player as free under the terms of the GLP-2.0 license. He released the final version, MPC 6.4.9.0, on 20th March 2006.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, development stalled in 2006, much to the disappointment of many users who had grown to love it. Gabest made a public statement in 2007 saying that Media Player Classic was not dead, just that he couldn’t work on it anymore.</p>

                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/media-player-classic-options.jpg"
                      alt="options in media player classic"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Navigate to the left pane to the Player Group and click on “Keys.” If the Player Group is not expanded by the time, you launch the platform, double-click it and wait a few seconds. You can then navigate to the “PnS Rotate” command on the Keys list.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/media-player-classic-keys.jpg"
                      alt="keys in media player classic"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 Go to the “PnS Rotate+” command and double-click the “Key” field. You can then click on any key to rotate your video around the x-axis. Once you are satisfied with the results, click “…” to apply the changes you have made.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/media-player-classic-pns-rotate.jpg"
                      alt="pns rotate in media player classic"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 You can now assign shortcuts to “PnS Rotate” commands. For instance, you could assign PnS Rotate Y for rotation along the Y axis and PnS Z for rotation along the Z axis. After each axis has a shortcut, select “Apply” then “OK” to save your changes and close the Options window respectively.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/media-player-classic-apply.jpg"
                      alt="apply rotate in media player classic"
                ></p>
<p>Step5 Select “Output” on the Options window and navigate to the DirectShow Video section to confirm whether the Media Classic Player supports rotation for the rendered video. Ascertain the Rotation feature has a green check mark, which indicates that the platform promotes rotation for the video. If the video has a red X, select “Apply” and click “OK.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="output rotation in media player classic"
                ></p>
<p>Step6 Use the shortcuts you assigned to the keys in Step 4 to rotate your video as you see fit. Since the rotation occurs gradually, you might need to press the keys numerous times or press and hold to see a visible change.</p>
<p>For instance, you can rotate your video from landscape to portrait by clicking “Alt-Num 1” and “Alt-Num 3,” respectively. To revert your video to its original state, press “Alt-Num 5.”</p>

<p>As you have seen, Media player Classic doesn’t have the Rotate feature per se. However, you can assign shortcuts to the keys to rotate a video along three axes as you see fit. You can also use a combination of keys like Alt and Num to change how your video sits so you can enjoy it as you like.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Wondershare Filmora has a more comprehensive Rotate feature that allows you to drag your pointer along a bar till the video sits at the correct number of degrees.</p>
<p>This platform also provides additional features, like allowing you to scale the video to fit the screen and adjusting project settings like the resolution and frame rate. If you don’t want to use the sliding bar, you can use your pointer to manually adjust the rotation by clicking on the pivot with your pointer.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, Windows Media Player is the ideal choice if you want to rotate your video and leave it at that. However, if you are looking for more advanced features, you are better off choosing Wondershare Filmora. The latter option also makes your videos look more polished like they were edited by a professional.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Videos might be trickier to edit than photos, especially when you want to rotate them.
