<h2 id="Best-Jump-Cut-Editing-Tricks"><a href="#Best-Jump-Cut-Editing-Tricks" class="headerlink" title="Best Jump Cut Editing Tricks"></a>Best Jump Cut Editing Tricks</h2><p>The jump cut is more common than ever, from YouTube to movie montages. A jump cut is a method for transitioning from one shot to another without including any interstitial video. A jump cut is a cinematic technique when the editor abruptly cuts from one shot to another without any discernible transition.</p>
<p>When filmmakers wish to display someone’s views or ideas without having to invest time and money in recording them, for example, this may be utilized for creative effects. Learn all there is to know about jump cuts in the next paragraphs, including their history, how to create one, how to edit one, and how to utilize one in your next social media video.</p>

Certain cuts have the power to startle a viewer out of this experience and remind them that they are watching a movie. The term “jump cut” refers to one of these cuts. Jump cuts are often discouraged in cinema, yet there are efficient methods to use them to provide the greatest narrative possible.</p>
<p>In video editing, a jump cut is the transition between two images of the same topic taken from the same or comparable angles and at two distinct times. This gives the impression that the action is ‘jumping’ ahead in time.</p>
<p>Most of the time, you want your videos’ cuts to flow seamlessly. This offers continuity and a nice watching experience for your viewers. Although it’s one of the most fundamental editing procedures, doing it correctly requires a bit more experience and ability. Let’s thus try to make your jump cut technique even better.</p>

City of God"></a>1. City of God</h3><p>With the combination of jump cuts, repetitive action, frantic montage, and a final bullet time graphic match wipe, the opening sequence of City of God drives the viewer into the pulse of the music and the violence in Rio. This seems like a prescription for catastrophe, yet it works in City of God. The screen is made electrified.</p>
<p>The chicken forces the characters to cross paths, which causes the two scenes to collide. Rezende now captures Rocket and Liz’s expressions in slow motion, resulting in a dramatic scene. After a circular pan-centering Rocket, which melts into a different moment of ten years ago, the shot comes to a close.</p>

<h4 id="2-The-Ring"><a href="#2-The-Ring" class="headerlink" title="2. The Ring"></a>2. The Ring</h4><p>In the pivotal scenes of “The Ring,” director Gore Verbinski used a jump cut to give the impression that Samara Morgan, the ghost, moves quickly around the room. By deleting or including anything in the frame, which is unsettling for both characters and viewers, this is a tried-and-true method of increasing the number of scares.</p>
<p>Jump cuts may also be distracting if done improperly or inappropriately, even though they are often intended to confuse or surprise the audience. There is a time and place for the method, even if a jump cut is far from the sole tool in the video editor’s toolbox.</p>

<h4 id="3-Juno"><a href="#3-Juno" class="headerlink" title="3. Juno"></a>3. Juno</h4><p>In the movie Juno, director Jason Reitman portrays the tale of a young adolescent who becomes pregnant and ultimately gives her kid up. Each leap represents a new stage in the character’s development as a result of this life-changing experience. Jump cuts in Jason Reitman’s comedy-drama Juno depict the youthful heroine’s journey both physically and mentally.</p>
<p>Jump cuts are a technique used by Reitman to convey both the passage of time and the changes in Juno’s life. like visiting the adoptive parents or getting regular checks at the doctor. You might think of each jump cut as one of the five phases of grieving. In the last chapter, “summer,” Juno has a better understanding of what she is giving up and how it will impact both her life and everyone else’s.</p>

<h4 id="4-Samara-Kills-Noah-the-Ring"><a href="#4-Samara-Kills-Noah-the-Ring" class="headerlink" title="4. Samara Kills Noah the Ring"></a>4. Samara Kills Noah the Ring</h4><p>It’s a tremendously imaginative and horrifying conclusion after a whole film’s worth of very subtle build-up that couldn’t be farther from the really low expectations U.S. horror remakes often attract. Gerbinski cleverly arranges for Samara to “jump cut” in front of Noah while still flashing with TV static, shocking him and causing him to trip and fall.</p>
<p>It’s fair to say that American horror films tend to rely on lazy jump scares, created by quick-cut images and loud sound effects, and that typically goes double for cynical state-side remakes of foreign language horror hits. However, Gore Verbinski’s surprisingly stylish and moody 2002 remake of The Ring makes clever use of jump cuts during a crucial climactic scene to fully hammer home the terror of the film’s spectral, black-haired antagonist Sam</p>

Dan’s Corpse – The Birds</h4><p>Instead of using a single cut or even zooming on Dan’s disfigured face, Hitch chooses to use two jump cuts that each bring us a little bit closer to Fawcett’s face.</p>
<p>When seen now, it is a straightforward yet shocking effect, but in 1963, it was unquestionably genuinely horrifying. It was just one more of his many deliberate choices to depart from established cinematic norms. Although the jump cut is a simple editing method by today’s standards, it was far less popular in earlier times, as seen by its skillful and startling use in Alfred Hitchcock’s great 1963 horror film The Birds.</p>

Taking A Ride – Breathless</h4><p>According to the Director Pierre Rissient, the jump cut technique was unplanned and developed out of a pressing necessity to trim Breathless from two and a half hours down to ninety minutes. The best example of this is when Patricia and Michel are driving about in their automobile, and Godard cuts between identical pictures of Patricia to show time passing while also heightening the urgency of the story of the couple on the run in the movie.</p>
<p>The significance of this sequence is that it dismantled rules for how a scene might be put together, despite the fact that it seemed absolutely primitive in retrospect. Not every movie that uses a jump cut in a dramatic or unexpected way must be in the horror category.</p>

Charlie’s Head Hereditary</h4><p>It’s one of the strangest and really unsettling jump cuts we’ve seen in recent memory, and it definitely deserves the surprisingly intricate gore display that it has. One of the most eerie and masterfully orchestrated horror movies of the decade, if not the whole 21st century, is Ari Aster’s Hereditary. Aster turns his attention to Peter, who is gazing out into the horizon, just as Annie can be heard screaming in agony, having found Charlie’s corpse in the garage.</p>

The jump cut is now often used in music videos, vlogs, and YouTuber material, making it a preferred option for creators of online content.</p>
<p>Today’s movies often use “jump cuts,” particularly as the number of horror movies produced has increased. The use of jump cuts makes the picture highly unsettling. One editing method, the jump cut, is still as effective now as it was back when pictures were stitched together and celluloid was cut with a razor blade. It is a well-liked method of video editing that is often used to indicate the passage of time, highlight an emotion, or heighten tension.</p>
<p>The shots did not quite run in a fluid session in the early phases of filming to provide the audience with a steady view of the screen. Instead, there were “jumps” in the movie, and the forward return was partially omitted. This “jump shot” idea may be compared to the expression. Today, however, despite all of the technological advancements we have at our disposal, movie makers and producers are attempting to recreate the look.</p>

<p>Nothing is more satisfying than seeing the final cut of a video and realizing that everything we filmed is crystal clear, with vibrant colors and balanced light. Unfortunately, whether you are editing on your own or collaborating with a team, this can be difficult to achieve because color problems often occur. Unlike photo editors, where one photo can easily be fixed without affecting the rest of an album, video editing requires adjusting to fix one problem. We’ll look at three different methods to correct color distortion in videos.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What Is Color Distortion</a></p>

<h2 id="What-Is-Color-Distortion"><a href="#What-Is-Color-Distortion" class="headerlink" title="What Is Color Distortion"></a>What Is Color Distortion</h2><p>Color distortion, also called chromatic aberration (CA), happens when the camera’s lens cannot resolve the wavelengths of light that it is recording. It occurs due to dispersion, which is when the lens elements’ refractive index varies with the light wavelength.</p>
<p>The refractive index of transparent materials often reduces with increasing wavelength. Because a lens’ focal length depends on the index of refraction, this variation in refraction index affects focusing.</p>
<p>There are two types of CA: transverse (lateral) and axial (longitudinal). Axial aberration happens when different wavelengths of light focus at different distances from a lens (focus shift). Essentially, longitudinal aberration is often at long focal lengths.</p>
<p>On the other hand, transverse aberration happens when different wavelengths focus at different places in the focal plane due to the magnification or distortion of the lens varying with wavelength. Ideally, transverse aberration is often at short focal lengths.</p>
<p>The two types of CA have different characteristics, and they may occur together. Axial chromatic aberration occurs throughout an image, and you can reduce it by stopping down, hence increasing the depth of the field so that although the different wavelengths are focusing at different distances, they’re still in acceptable focus.</p>
<p>When it comes to transverse chromatic aberration, it doesn’t occur in the middle of the image, and it increases towards the edge. What’s more? Stopping down does not affect it.</p>
<h2 id="How-will-Color-Distortion-Affect-Your-Videos"><a href="#How-will-Color-Distortion-Affect-Your-Videos" class="headerlink" title="How will Color Distortion Affect Your Videos?"></a>How will Color Distortion Affect Your Videos?</h2><p>Colour distortion displays itself as “fringes” of color on the boundaries separating bright and dark parts of the image in a video. Color distortion can also occur when adding effects to a video, such as the use of a green screen. By using the green screen to replace the real thing, the colors in the video can appear a little off.</p>

<p>Nothing is more satisfying than seeing the final cut of a video and realizing that everything we filmed is crystal clear, with vibrant colors and balanced light. Unfortunately, whether you are editing on your own or collaborating with a team, this can be difficult to achieve because color problems often occur. Unlike photo editors, where one photo can easily be fixed without affecting the rest of an album, video editing requires adjusting to fix one problem. We’ll look at three different methods to correct color distortion in videos.</p>

<h2 id="What-Is-Color-Distortion-1"><a href="#What-Is-Color-Distortion-1" class="headerlink" title="What Is Color Distortion"></a>What Is Color Distortion</h2><p>Color distortion, also called chromatic aberration (CA), happens when the camera’s lens cannot resolve the wavelengths of light that it is recording. It occurs due to dispersion, which is when the lens elements’ refractive index varies with the light wavelength.</p>
<p>The refractive index of transparent materials often reduces with increasing wavelength. Because a lens’ focal length depends on the index of refraction, this variation in refraction index affects focusing.</p>
<p>There are two types of CA: transverse (lateral) and axial (longitudinal). Axial aberration happens when different wavelengths of light focus at different distances from a lens (focus shift). Essentially, longitudinal aberration is often at long focal lengths.</p>
<p>On the other hand, transverse aberration happens when different wavelengths focus at different places in the focal plane due to the magnification or distortion of the lens varying with wavelength. Ideally, transverse aberration is often at short focal lengths.</p>
<p>The two types of CA have different characteristics, and they may occur together. Axial chromatic aberration occurs throughout an image, and you can reduce it by stopping down, hence increasing the depth of the field so that although the different wavelengths are focusing at different distances, they’re still in acceptable focus.</p>
<p>When it comes to transverse chromatic aberration, it doesn’t occur in the middle of the image, and it increases towards the edge. What’s more? Stopping down does not affect it.</p>
<h2 id="How-will-Color-Distortion-Affect-Your-Videos-1"><a href="#How-will-Color-Distortion-Affect-Your-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="How will Color Distortion Affect Your Videos?"></a>How will Color Distortion Affect Your Videos?</h2><p>Colour distortion displays itself as “fringes” of color on the boundaries separating bright and dark parts of the image in a video. Color distortion can also occur when adding effects to a video, such as the use of a green screen. By using the green screen to replace the real thing, the colors in the video can appear a little off.</p>

<p>Nothing is more satisfying than seeing the final cut of a video and realizing that everything we filmed is crystal clear, with vibrant colors and balanced light. Unfortunately, whether you are editing on your own or collaborating with a team, this can be difficult to achieve because color problems often occur. Unlike photo editors, where one photo can easily be fixed without affecting the rest of an album, video editing requires adjusting to fix one problem. We’ll look at three different methods to correct color distortion in videos.</p>

<h2 id="What-Is-Color-Distortion-2"><a href="#What-Is-Color-Distortion-2" class="headerlink" title="What Is Color Distortion"></a>What Is Color Distortion</h2><p>Color distortion, also called chromatic aberration (CA), happens when the camera’s lens cannot resolve the wavelengths of light that it is recording. It occurs due to dispersion, which is when the lens elements’ refractive index varies with the light wavelength.</p>
<p>The refractive index of transparent materials often reduces with increasing wavelength. Because a lens’ focal length depends on the index of refraction, this variation in refraction index affects focusing.</p>
<p>There are two types of CA: transverse (lateral) and axial (longitudinal). Axial aberration happens when different wavelengths of light focus at different distances from a lens (focus shift). Essentially, longitudinal aberration is often at long focal lengths.</p>
<p>On the other hand, transverse aberration happens when different wavelengths focus at different places in the focal plane due to the magnification or distortion of the lens varying with wavelength. Ideally, transverse aberration is often at short focal lengths.</p>
<p>The two types of CA have different characteristics, and they may occur together. Axial chromatic aberration occurs throughout an image, and you can reduce it by stopping down, hence increasing the depth of the field so that although the different wavelengths are focusing at different distances, they’re still in acceptable focus.</p>
<p>When it comes to transverse chromatic aberration, it doesn’t occur in the middle of the image, and it increases towards the edge. What’s more? Stopping down does not affect it.</p>

Color distortion can also occur when adding effects to a video, such as the use of a green screen. By using the green screen to replace the real thing, the colors in the video can appear a little off.</p>

You can also select your video and drag and drop the effect you want to the Video Effects selection under the Effects Control Panel. Here are some of the color correction effects you can apply:</p>
<p>Brightness and Contrast Effect: With this effect, you can adjust the contrast and brightness of your video. Using this effect allows you to make adjustments to all pixel values in your video image at once — mid-tones, shadows, and highlights.</p>
<p>Color Balance Effect: This effect changes the amount of blue, green, and red in the shadow, highlights of an image, and mid-tones. Preserve Luminosity preserves the average brightness of your video image and changes the color. It maintains the tonal balance in your video image.</p>

<p>After your frame is set up, you’ll want to record a clip by pressing the red circle button. After 30-seconds (or less if you stop the recording sooner) the raw footage will be saved on the bottom of your GIPHY Capture window. This footage will be saved indefinitely, so if you close the app and reopen it at a later date you can pick up where you left off. However, if you delete the GIPHY Capture app from your computer, your videos will be deleted too.</p>
<p>You can take this 30-second clip and edit the length. It’s best to keep the GIF between 2-6 seconds if the intention is for the GIF to be shared in messaging apps and on the web. If you are making a “how-to” or tutorial GIF for an app or workflow you may need to make the length longer than 6 seconds.</p>
<p>You can choose to edit the loop type, pixel size, and frame rate. Changing these can affect the quality and file size of your GIF. In most cases leaving the standard preset options works best.</p>

<li><p>Under the Captions tab, you can easily add captions to your GIFs. Your captions can either have the regular or italicized text and come with a few preset options for changing the text color. You can edit the animation of the caption, just in case you want it to fade or drop into the frame. You can even edit the duration of the caption in your GIF. If you have a 6-second GIF but only want the caption to be in the frame for the final 2 seconds you can do so by editing the start and end time of the caption.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Now that you’ve created your GIF you can upload it directly to your GIPHY account and allow people to share it, provided you have a branded GIPHY channel.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you don’t want to upload your new creation directly to GIPHY, you can download it as a .gif or .mp4 file locally to your computer.</p>

<h3 id="GIFROCKET"><a href="#GIFROCKET" class="headerlink" title="GIFROCKET"></a><strong>GIFROCKET</strong></h3><p><strong>Supported OS:</strong> Mac</p>
<p>GifRocket is the only downloadable record converter for developing GIFs. The only disadvantage is that it is only available to Mac users. This program is used to convert a video file to GIF format. That means you must already have the video file created. You can use a small clip from a previous video that you made or a clip that you downloaded. After you’ve downloaded and installed GifRocket on your computer, simply drag and drop your video file over the GifRocket tool window. The converter will begin working, and you will have a perfect GIF in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>The production value must be the same as a full-length marketing video but the file size must be smaller, this tool is ideal for creating banner videos for site pages.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Intuitive interface</li>
<li>Change quality and file size of the outputted file</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of features like crop and frame rate, only available for Mac.</li>

<p><strong>Steps On How To Make Gif In GIF Rocket</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>After you download the app, open it, and there you will see a blank canvas. You’re supposed to drag the file here to start the conversion to GIF. But not so fast. First, click the <em>Settings</em> button. Here you’ll get three fields.</li>
</ol>

                ></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Enter the start and endpoint. Remember this is in the <em>Hours</em>: <em>Minutes</em>: <em>Seconds</em> layout so if your video is short, don’t forget to add zeros for the hours or minutes mark, or else the GIF won’t work.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Second, select the width of the GIF you want to create. The default is 320px. You can take it up to 500 or 600 if you’re dealing with a widescreen video but if you make the GIF too wide the size of the resulting file is also going to go up.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The last setting is quality. There is a slider and frankly, it’s not that helpful. There are only three points on it. I found the middle point, 50% to work the best. Once you’ve got the settings the way you want, click <em>X</em>, drag in the file and wait for Gifrocket to do its thing.</p>
</li>

<p>PicGIF is yet another app for Mac users to express their contemporary entertainment in the form of a GIF. When it comes to gif creation, the app is quite versatile, and the quality of a created gif is truly astounding. PicGIF generates exceptionally eye-catching gifs with advanced high-satisfaction and stability, as opposed to other apps’ commonly crappy and blurry gifs.</p>
<p>You can make GIFs from movies or from a collection of photographs. All you have to do is select all of the photographs, adjust the fullness, and then select the rate at which the frames will flip. It’s a simple, easy-to-use, and brief app, but the lack of right cropping functionality can be a deterrent for users looking for it.</p>

<li>Support a vast number of file formats</li>
<li>Support hundreds of image formats like JPEG, TIFF, BMP, PNG, TGA, RAW, PIC, etc., and any image size.</li>

<li>Support combining multiple formats – images, GIFs, and videos into a new single GIF.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The PicGIF software is safe to use</li>

<p><strong>Steps On How To Make Gif In Pic GIF</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Importing</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The picGIF app accepts many different image formats and all common video formats. The app says you can drag and drop onto the pop-up screen on opening the app, but it wouldn’t allow me to do this. However, I was able to work around it by just choosing “Add Photo” or “Add Video” in the File menu, or by doing “Command + O” or “Command + D”, respectively. Even though it says “Add Photo,” you can add multiple files at once.</p>

<h2 id="2-Customization-of-Pictures"><a href="#2-Customization-of-Pictures" class="headerlink" title="2. Customization of Pictures"></a><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Customization of Pictures</strong></h2><p>Once you have added the photos, you have several options to customize the gif. Under the “Properties” menu in PicGIF, you can change the size of the output or keep with the default of 360 x 240 pixels and can also choose whether they will be presented as portrait or landscape. At the bottom, you can also choose whether you want it auto optimized for quality or whether you want better quality, which will of course take longer.</p>
<p>Next is deciding how it will handle the photos if they don’t match the exact size of the output, whether you want them sized to fit, stretched, etc., and to choose a background color for when they don’t fit. Speed is the next option to be determined, either leave it on Auto or set the speed yourself. The photos will either be in the sequence you added them in or you can choose to have it go in reverse.</p>

<li><strong>Customization of Videos</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>There aren’t that many options for creating video GIFs. There are, but you need to buy the full version app for $4.99. For this price, you will be able to trim the video as you wish, add text, and add stickers. By sticking with the free version you are limited to either having it autoplay or changing the frames per second. You can also import existing GIFs and edit them. Saving this gif took longer than with the photos, but I was using a longer video.</p>

<h3 id="1-Record-Your-Screen"><a href="#1-Record-Your-Screen" class="headerlink" title="1. Record Your Screen"></a>1. <strong>Record Your Screen</strong></h3><p>After clicking the fox icon in the menu bar, you can find the buttons to record the screen on the left side of the interface.</p>

                      alt="gif-maker"
                ></p>
<p>Gifox provides two modes for recording the screen – area and window. This means you can record part of the window or choose to record the full window.</p>
<p>For an area recording, Gifox allows you the freedom to select the area. You can select any area by dragging your mouse from corner to corner.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="gif-maker"
                ></p>
<p>When using the window recording mode, one great feature is that it doesn’t matter if several windows are overlapping. You can just select the one you want to record, and Gifox will ignore the other window.</p>
<p>Gifox also offers shortcuts so that you don’t have to always open the icon from the menu bar. This makes it even easier to use as a daily utility.</p>

<h3 id="3-Compress"><a href="#3-Compress" class="headerlink" title="3. Compress"></a>3. <strong>Compress</strong></h3><p>If you’re sharing a GIF on the internet, you’re going to like it to be of good quality but with the smallest file size possible. Gifox makes this possible. Available in preferences, the compress settings allow you to have full control over the quality of the GIF. You can change the color count, the palette, the dither, and the bayer scale. This eliminates the need to install a second program just for compressing your file.</p>

                ></p>
<p>After your frame is set up, you’ll want to record a clip by pressing the red circle button. After 30-seconds (or less if you stop the recording sooner) the raw footage will be saved on the bottom of your GIPHY Capture window. This footage will be saved indefinitely, so if you close the app and reopen it at a later date you can pick up where you left off. However, if you delete the GIPHY Capture app from your computer, your videos will be deleted too.</p>
<p>You can take this 30-second clip and edit the length. It’s best to keep the GIF between 2-6 seconds if the intention is for the GIF to be shared in messaging apps and on the web. If you are making a “how-to” or tutorial GIF for an app or workflow you may need to make the length longer than 6 seconds.</p>
<p>You can choose to edit the loop type, pixel size, and frame rate. Changing these can affect the quality and file size of your GIF. In most cases leaving the standard preset options works best.</p>

                ></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Under the Captions tab, you can easily add captions to your GIFs. Your captions can either have the regular or italicized text and come with a few preset options for changing the text color. You can edit the animation of the caption, just in case you want it to fade or drop into the frame. You can even edit the duration of the caption in your GIF. If you have a 6-second GIF but only want the caption to be in the frame for the final 2 seconds you can do so by editing the start and end time of the caption.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Now that you’ve created your GIF you can upload it directly to your GIPHY account and allow people to share it, provided you have a branded GIPHY channel.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you don’t want to upload your new creation directly to GIPHY, you can download it as a .gif or .mp4 file locally to your computer.</p>

<h3 id="GIFROCKET-1"><a href="#GIFROCKET-1" class="headerlink" title="GIFROCKET"></a><strong>GIFROCKET</strong></h3><p><strong>Supported OS:</strong> Mac</p>
<p>GifRocket is the only downloadable record converter for developing GIFs. The only disadvantage is that it is only available to Mac users. This program is used to convert a video file to GIF format. That means you must already have the video file created. You can use a small clip from a previous video that you made or a clip that you downloaded. After you’ve downloaded and installed GifRocket on your computer, simply drag and drop your video file over the GifRocket tool window. The converter will begin working, and you will have a perfect GIF in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>The production value must be the same as a full-length marketing video but the file size must be smaller, this tool is ideal for creating banner videos for site pages.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Intuitive interface</li>
<li>Change quality and file size of the outputted file</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of features like crop and frame rate, only available for Mac.</li>

<p><strong>Steps On How To Make Gif In GIF Rocket</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>After you download the app, open it, and there you will see a blank canvas. You’re supposed to drag the file here to start the conversion to GIF. But not so fast. First, click the <em>Settings</em> button. Here you’ll get three fields.</li>
</ol>
<p><img

                ></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Enter the start and endpoint. Remember this is in the <em>Hours</em>: <em>Minutes</em>: <em>Seconds</em> layout so if your video is short, don’t forget to add zeros for the hours or minutes mark, or else the GIF won’t work.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Second, select the width of the GIF you want to create. The default is 320px. You can take it up to 500 or 600 if you’re dealing with a widescreen video but if you make the GIF too wide the size of the resulting file is also going to go up.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The last setting is quality. There is a slider and frankly, it’s not that helpful. There are only three points on it. I found the middle point, 50% to work the best. Once you’ve got the settings the way you want, click <em>X</em>, drag in the file and wait for Gifrocket to do its thing.</p>

<p>PicGIF is yet another app for Mac users to express their contemporary entertainment in the form of a GIF. When it comes to gif creation, the app is quite versatile, and the quality of a created gif is truly astounding. PicGIF generates exceptionally eye-catching gifs with advanced high-satisfaction and stability, as opposed to other apps’ commonly crappy and blurry gifs.</p>
<p>You can make GIFs from movies or from a collection of photographs. All you have to do is select all of the photographs, adjust the fullness, and then select the rate at which the frames will flip. It’s a simple, easy-to-use, and brief app, but the lack of right cropping functionality can be a deterrent for users looking for it.</p>

<li>Support almost all common video formats: MOV, MPEG, MP4, M4V, 3GP, AVI, and more.</li>
<li>Support combining multiple formats – images, GIFs, and videos into a new single GIF.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Steps On How To Make Gif In Pic GIF</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Importing</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The picGIF app accepts many different image formats and all common video formats. The app says you can drag and drop onto the pop-up screen on opening the app, but it wouldn’t allow me to do this. However, I was able to work around it by just choosing “Add Photo” or “Add Video” in the File menu, or by doing “Command + O” or “Command + D”, respectively. Even though it says “Add Photo,” you can add multiple files at once.</p>

Customization of Pictures"></a><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Customization of Pictures</strong></h2><p>Once you have added the photos, you have several options to customize the gif. Under the “Properties” menu in PicGIF, you can change the size of the output or keep with the default of 360 x 240 pixels and can also choose whether they will be presented as portrait or landscape. At the bottom, you can also choose whether you want it auto optimized for quality or whether you want better quality, which will of course take longer.</p>
<p>Next is deciding how it will handle the photos if they don’t match the exact size of the output, whether you want them sized to fit, stretched, etc., and to choose a background color for when they don’t fit. Speed is the next option to be determined, either leave it on Auto or set the speed yourself. The photos will either be in the sequence you added them in or you can choose to have it go in reverse.</p>

<li><strong>Customization of Videos</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>There aren’t that many options for creating video GIFs. There are, but you need to buy the full version app for $4.99. For this price, you will be able to trim the video as you wish, add text, and add stickers. By sticking with the free version you are limited to either having it autoplay or changing the frames per second. You can also import existing GIFs and edit them. Saving this gif took longer than with the photos, but I was using a longer video.</p>

<h3 id="1-Record-Your-Screen-1"><a href="#1-Record-Your-Screen-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Record Your Screen"></a>1. <strong>Record Your Screen</strong></h3><p>After clicking the fox icon in the menu bar, you can find the buttons to record the screen on the left side of the interface.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="gif-maker"
                ></p>
<p>Gifox provides two modes for recording the screen – area and window. This means you can record part of the window or choose to record the full window.</p>
<p>For an area recording, Gifox allows you the freedom to select the area. You can select any area by dragging your mouse from corner to corner.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p>Gifox also offers shortcuts so that you don’t have to always open the icon from the menu bar. This makes it even easier to use as a daily utility.</p>

<p>After your frame is set up, you’ll want to record a clip by pressing the red circle button. After 30-seconds (or less if you stop the recording sooner) the raw footage will be saved on the bottom of your GIPHY Capture window. This footage will be saved indefinitely, so if you close the app and reopen it at a later date you can pick up where you left off. However, if you delete the GIPHY Capture app from your computer, your videos will be deleted too.</p>
<p>You can take this 30-second clip and edit the length. It’s best to keep the GIF between 2-6 seconds if the intention is for the GIF to be shared in messaging apps and on the web. If you are making a “how-to” or tutorial GIF for an app or workflow you may need to make the length longer than 6 seconds.</p>
<p>You can choose to edit the loop type, pixel size, and frame rate. Changing these can affect the quality and file size of your GIF. In most cases leaving the standard preset options works best.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Under the Captions tab, you can easily add captions to your GIFs. Your captions can either have the regular or italicized text and come with a few preset options for changing the text color. You can edit the animation of the caption, just in case you want it to fade or drop into the frame. You can even edit the duration of the caption in your GIF. If you have a 6-second GIF but only want the caption to be in the frame for the final 2 seconds you can do so by editing the start and end time of the caption.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Now that you’ve created your GIF you can upload it directly to your GIPHY account and allow people to share it, provided you have a branded GIPHY channel.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you don’t want to upload your new creation directly to GIPHY, you can download it as a .gif or .mp4 file locally to your computer.</p>

<p><strong>Steps On How To Make Gif In GIF Rocket</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>After you download the app, open it, and there you will see a blank canvas. You’re supposed to drag the file here to start the conversion to GIF. But not so fast. First, click the <em>Settings</em> button. Here you’ll get three fields.</li>
</ol>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="gif-maker"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Enter the start and endpoint. Remember this is in the <em>Hours</em>: <em>Minutes</em>: <em>Seconds</em> layout so if your video is short, don’t forget to add zeros for the hours or minutes mark, or else the GIF won’t work.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Second, select the width of the GIF you want to create. The default is 320px. You can take it up to 500 or 600 if you’re dealing with a widescreen video but if you make the GIF too wide the size of the resulting file is also going to go up.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The last setting is quality. There is a slider and frankly, it’s not that helpful. There are only three points on it. I found the middle point, 50% to work the best. Once you’ve got the settings the way you want, click <em>X</em>, drag in the file and wait for Gifrocket to do its thing.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>BEST PAID GIF MAKER ON MAC</strong></p>
<h3 id="PICGIF-2"><a href="#PICGIF-2" class="headerlink" title="PICGIF"></a><strong>PICGIF</strong></h3><p><strong>Supported OS:</strong> Mac</p>
<p>PicGIF is yet another app for Mac users to express their contemporary entertainment in the form of a GIF. When it comes to gif creation, the app is quite versatile, and the quality of a created gif is truly astounding. PicGIF generates exceptionally eye-catching gifs with advanced high-satisfaction and stability, as opposed to other apps’ commonly crappy and blurry gifs.</p>
<p>You can make GIFs from movies or from a collection of photographs. All you have to do is select all of the photographs, adjust the fullness, and then select the rate at which the frames will flip. It’s a simple, easy-to-use, and brief app, but the lack of right cropping functionality can be a deterrent for users looking for it.</p>
<h3 id="Features-2"><a href="#Features-2" class="headerlink" title="Features:"></a><strong>Features:</strong></h3><ul>
<li>Support a vast number of file formats</li>

<ul>
<li>The PicGIF software is safe to use</li>

<p><strong>Steps On How To Make Gif In Pic GIF</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Importing</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The picGIF app accepts many different image formats and all common video formats. The app says you can drag and drop onto the pop-up screen on opening the app, but it wouldn’t allow me to do this. However, I was able to work around it by just choosing “Add Photo” or “Add Video” in the File menu, or by doing “Command + O” or “Command + D”, respectively. Even though it says “Add Photo,” you can add multiple files at once.</p>

<h2 id="2-Customization-of-Pictures-2"><a href="#2-Customization-of-Pictures-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Customization of Pictures"></a><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Customization of Pictures</strong></h2><p>Once you have added the photos, you have several options to customize the gif. Under the “Properties” menu in PicGIF, you can change the size of the output or keep with the default of 360 x 240 pixels and can also choose whether they will be presented as portrait or landscape. At the bottom, you can also choose whether you want it auto optimized for quality or whether you want better quality, which will of course take longer.</p>
<p>Next is deciding how it will handle the photos if they don’t match the exact size of the output, whether you want them sized to fit, stretched, etc., and to choose a background color for when they don’t fit. Speed is the next option to be determined, either leave it on Auto or set the speed yourself. The photos will either be in the sequence you added them in or you can choose to have it go in reverse.</p>

It only took seconds to create my GIF, but I only had six pictures and left it at the default size.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Customization of Videos</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>There aren’t that many options for creating video GIFs. There are, but you need to buy the full version app for $4.99. For this price, you will be able to trim the video as you wish, add text, and add stickers. By sticking with the free version you are limited to either having it autoplay or changing the frames per second. You can also import existing GIFs and edit them. Saving this gif took longer than with the photos, but I was using a longer video.</p>

                      alt="gif-maker"
                ></p>
<p>Gifox provides two modes for recording the screen – area and window. This means you can record part of the window or choose to record the full window.</p>
<p>For an area recording, Gifox allows you the freedom to select the area. You can select any area by dragging your mouse from corner to corner.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>When using the window recording mode, one great feature is that it doesn’t matter if several windows are overlapping. You can just select the one you want to record, and Gifox will ignore the other window.</p>
<p>Gifox also offers shortcuts so that you don’t have to always open the icon from the menu bar. This makes it even easier to use as a daily utility.</p>

<h3 id="3-Compress-2"><a href="#3-Compress-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Compress"></a>3. <strong>Compress</strong></h3><p>If you’re sharing a GIF on the internet, you’re going to like it to be of good quality but with the smallest file size possible. Gifox makes this possible. Available in preferences, the compress settings allow you to have full control over the quality of the GIF.

<p><strong>FAQS ABOUT MAKING GIFS FROM VIDEO</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What tip can I have in editing GIFs?</strong></li>

<li><strong>Is it possible to export GIFs without watermarks?</strong></li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li><strong>Can I use Video Converter Ultimate offline to edit a GIF?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Absolutely, yes. Even without internet access, you can modify and quickly convert your GIF in no time.</p>

<p>After your frame is set up, you’ll want to record a clip by pressing the red circle button. After 30-seconds (or less if you stop the recording sooner) the raw footage will be saved on the bottom of your GIPHY Capture window. This footage will be saved indefinitely, so if you close the app and reopen it at a later date you can pick up where you left off. However, if you delete the GIPHY Capture app from your computer, your videos will be deleted too.</p>
<p>You can take this 30-second clip and edit the length. It’s best to keep the GIF between 2-6 seconds if the intention is for the GIF to be shared in messaging apps and on the web. If you are making a “how-to” or tutorial GIF for an app or workflow you may need to make the length longer than 6 seconds.</p>
<p>You can choose to edit the loop type, pixel size, and frame rate. Changing these can affect the quality and file size of your GIF. In most cases leaving the standard preset options works best.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Under the Captions tab, you can easily add captions to your GIFs. Your captions can either have the regular or italicized text and come with a few preset options for changing the text color. You can edit the animation of the caption, just in case you want it to fade or drop into the frame. You can even edit the duration of the caption in your GIF. If you have a 6-second GIF but only want the caption to be in the frame for the final 2 seconds you can do so by editing the start and end time of the caption.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Now that you’ve created your GIF you can upload it directly to your GIPHY account and allow people to share it, provided you have a branded GIPHY channel.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you don’t want to upload your new creation directly to GIPHY, you can download it as a .gif or .mp4 file locally to your computer.</p>

<h3 id="GIFROCKET-3"><a href="#GIFROCKET-3" class="headerlink" title="GIFROCKET"></a><strong>GIFROCKET</strong></h3><p><strong>Supported OS:</strong> Mac</p>
<p>GifRocket is the only downloadable record converter for developing GIFs. The only disadvantage is that it is only available to Mac users. This program is used to convert a video file to GIF format. That means you must already have the video file created. You can use a small clip from a previous video that you made or a clip that you downloaded. After you’ve downloaded and installed GifRocket on your computer, simply drag and drop your video file over the GifRocket tool window. The converter will begin working, and you will have a perfect GIF in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>The production value must be the same as a full-length marketing video but the file size must be smaller, this tool is ideal for creating banner videos for site pages.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Intuitive interface</li>
<li>Change quality and file size of the outputted file</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of features like crop and frame rate, only available for Mac.</li>

<p><strong>Steps On How To Make Gif In GIF Rocket</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>After you download the app, open it, and there you will see a blank canvas. You’re supposed to drag the file here to start the conversion to GIF. But not so fast. First, click the <em>Settings</em> button. Here you’ll get three fields.</li>
</ol>
<p><img

                ></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Enter the start and endpoint. Remember this is in the <em>Hours</em>: <em>Minutes</em>: <em>Seconds</em> layout so if your video is short, don’t forget to add zeros for the hours or minutes mark, or else the GIF won’t work.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Second, select the width of the GIF you want to create. The default is 320px. You can take it up to 500 or 600 if you’re dealing with a widescreen video but if you make the GIF too wide the size of the resulting file is also going to go up.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The last setting is quality. There is a slider and frankly, it’s not that helpful. There are only three points on it. I found the middle point, 50% to work the best. Once you’ve got the settings the way you want, click <em>X</em>, drag in the file and wait for Gifrocket to do its thing.</p>

<p>PicGIF is yet another app for Mac users to express their contemporary entertainment in the form of a GIF. When it comes to gif creation, the app is quite versatile, and the quality of a created gif is truly astounding. PicGIF generates exceptionally eye-catching gifs with advanced high-satisfaction and stability, as opposed to other apps’ commonly crappy and blurry gifs.</p>
<p>You can make GIFs from movies or from a collection of photographs. All you have to do is select all of the photographs, adjust the fullness, and then select the rate at which the frames will flip. It’s a simple, easy-to-use, and brief app, but the lack of right cropping functionality can be a deterrent for users looking for it.</p>

<p><strong>Steps On How To Make Gif In Pic GIF</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Importing</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The picGIF app accepts many different image formats and all common video formats. The app says you can drag and drop onto the pop-up screen on opening the app, but it wouldn’t allow me to do this. However, I was able to work around it by just choosing “Add Photo” or “Add Video” in the File menu, or by doing “Command + O” or “Command + D”, respectively. Even though it says “Add Photo,” you can add multiple files at once.</p>

Customization of Pictures"></a><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Customization of Pictures</strong></h2><p>Once you have added the photos, you have several options to customize the gif. Under the “Properties” menu in PicGIF, you can change the size of the output or keep with the default of 360 x 240 pixels and can also choose whether they will be presented as portrait or landscape. At the bottom, you can also choose whether you want it auto optimized for quality or whether you want better quality, which will of course take longer.</p>
<p>Next is deciding how it will handle the photos if they don’t match the exact size of the output, whether you want them sized to fit, stretched, etc., and to choose a background color for when they don’t fit. Speed is the next option to be determined, either leave it on Auto or set the speed yourself. The photos will either be in the sequence you added them in or you can choose to have it go in reverse.</p>

<li><strong>Customization of Videos</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>There aren’t that many options for creating video GIFs. There are, but you need to buy the full version app for $4.99. For this price, you will be able to trim the video as you wish, add text, and add stickers. By sticking with the free version you are limited to either having it autoplay or changing the frames per second. You can also import existing GIFs and edit them. Saving this gif took longer than with the photos, but I was using a longer video.</p>

<p><strong>Steps On How To Make Gif In Gifox</strong></p>
<h3 id="1-Record-Your-Screen-3"><a href="#1-Record-Your-Screen-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Record Your Screen"></a>1. <strong>Record Your Screen</strong></h3><p>After clicking the fox icon in the menu bar, you can find the buttons to record the screen on the left side of the interface.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gif-maker-20.jpg"
                      alt="gif-maker"
                ></p>
<p>Gifox provides two modes for recording the screen – area and window. This means you can record part of the window or choose to record the full window.</p>
<p>For an area recording, Gifox allows you the freedom to select the area. You can select any area by dragging your mouse from corner to corner.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gif-maker-21.jpg"
                      alt="gif-maker"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gif-maker-22.jpg"
                      alt="gif-maker"
                ></p>
<p>When using the window recording mode, one great feature is that it doesn’t matter if several windows are overlapping. You can just select the one you want to record, and Gifox will ignore the other window.</p>
<p>Gifox also offers shortcuts so that you don’t have to always open the icon from the menu bar. This makes it even easier to use as a daily utility.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gif-maker-23.jpg"
                      alt="gif-maker"
                ></p>
<h3 id="2-Flexible-Setting-3"><a href="#2-Flexible-Setting-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Flexible Setting"></a><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Flexible Setting</strong></h3><p>Gifox is not only easy to use but also a very flexible application. Here are just some of the options that you can customize:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mouse cursor appearance</li>
<li>Window shadow</li>
<li>Desktop background recording fps</li>
<li>Playback fps</li>
<li>Repeat count and pause</li>
<li>Max colors</li>
<li>Bayer scale</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these are available in the Gifox settings window.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gif-maker-24.jpg"
                      alt="gif-maker"
                ></p>
<h3 id="3-Compress-3"><a href="#3-Compress-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Compress"></a>3. <strong>Compress</strong></h3><p>If you’re sharing a GIF on the internet, you’re going to like it to be of good quality but with the smallest file size possible. Gifox makes this possible. Available in preferences, the compress settings allow you to have full control over the quality of the GIF. You can change the color count, the palette, the dither, and the bayer scale. This eliminates the need to install a second program just for compressing your file.</p>
<p><strong>WHICH SHOULD I CHOOSE: FREE OR PAID GIF MAKER ON MAC?</strong></p>
<p>If the main reason you want this powerful and advanced GIF software is to create GIFs from videos, you should invest in the advanced version. Since there is not much you can do with videos and the free version.</p>
<p>However, if you want to make GIFs from photos, this free or open-source version will suffice.</p>
<p><strong>FAQS ABOUT MAKING GIFS FROM VIDEO</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What tip can I have in editing GIFs?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You don’t need to make your GIF colorful. You need to use fewer colors. The fewer colors your GIF has, the more fun it is. Because if your GIF has a lot of colors, you will have a problem exporting it.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Is it possible to export GIFs without watermarks?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, some GIF editors have a feature to remove the watermarks using a free account. However, there are also GIF editors where you need to pay a flat amount first before exporting GIF without watermarks.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Can I use Video Converter Ultimate offline to edit a GIF?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Absolutely, yes. Even without internet access, you can modify and quickly convert your GIF in no time.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-11"><a href="#Conclusion-11" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion:"></a><strong>Conclusion:</strong></h2><p>If the proper GIF editor is used, animated GIFs can be edited with little effort. There are GIF software programs that are highly recommended by users due to their ease of use and simple interface. It’s time to give them a shot!</p>
