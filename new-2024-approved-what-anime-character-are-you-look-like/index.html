After Effects and Wondershare Filmora have a different process when it comes to cropping videos. I hope that you had a clearer understanding on which of these two would suit your video editing needs. The interface also could change your mind depending if you want simplicity or a challenge. Price is also a factor that can affect your willingness to use these applications. But, this guide clearly shows you that it is worth paying for.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on both of these tools? Did you find this information to be helpful?</p>
<p>Check if the video is already in the interface. Find the <strong>Magnifying</strong> tab and zoom out the video into 50%. After that, click the <strong>Grid</strong> icon and <strong>Proportional Grid</strong>.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Click the <strong>Square</strong> icon, it is located beside the <strong>Pencil</strong> icon at the top section. The shape’s purpose is to crop the video section that you want to remain. If you’re done cutting then you should unclick the <strong>Proportiona</strong>l grid, and the video’s magnification should be 100%. Afterwards, you can check the pixel aspect ratio correction in the After Effects. You need to go through the video before saving your project. This is to avoid unnecessary errors that will make the process troublesome.</p>

<p>Already satisfied with the cropped video? Then, select <strong>File,</strong> <strong>Export</strong> and finally <strong>Add to Render Queue.</strong> Check on the <strong>Render Settings</strong> (located bottom of the interface) to ensure high quality output. Following that, hit the <strong>Output To</strong> part and decide the destination and folder where you want it to be.</p>

<h2 id="Sync-Audio-With-Video-With-Filmora"><a href="#Sync-Audio-With-Video-With-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Sync Audio With Video With Filmora"></a>Sync Audio With Video With Filmora</h2><p>Syncing audio with video is an integral part of video editing for any video creator. But believe me; it’s not such a difficult task if you know what to do. The point is IF YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO.</p>
<p>That’s why in this brief guide, we’ll show you the simplest way to sync audio with video using a fantastic video editor easily. But wait a minute, some of you might be confused about why we even need to sync separate audio &amp; video when a single camera can record both. So let’s first answer this simple question.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Why-Do-We-Need-to-Sync-Separate-Audio-Video"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Do-We-Need-to-Sync-Separate-Audio-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Do We Need to Sync Separate Audio &amp; Video?"></a>Part 1: Why Do We Need to Sync Separate Audio &amp; Video?</h2><p>Creating great video needs extraordinary video graphics, content, and top-notch audio. And you can’t expect a single camera to achieve all these goals. That’s why all professional video creators use a specialized camera for recording with a separate audio recording device.</p>
<p>You might think it’s an exaggeration, but this small change can have massive effects on the quality of your video. Especially the background noise removal effect of separate external microphones.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/recording-audio-and-video-separately-for-higher-quality.jpg"
                      alt="recording audio and video separately for higher quality"
                ></p>
<p>But the downside of using this method is that after the recording is complete, you must sync these audio and video files. And if you don’t do it right, all the effort goes to the drain within a split second. Well, nobody wants to watch a video with an audio lag. Isn’t it?</p>
<p>Correctly synching an audio file with a video is easier than you think. You just need to prepare beforehand and use a suitable video editing tool. So considering these factors, let’s first see what preparations we need. After that, we’ll recommend a top-class video editing tool to achieve this goal in detailed steps. Why are we still waiting? Let’s begin our journey.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Preparation-for-Syncing-Audio-With-Video-During-Recording"><a href="#Part-2-Preparation-for-Syncing-Audio-With-Video-During-Recording" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Preparation for Syncing Audio With Video During Recording"></a>Part 2: Preparation for Syncing Audio With Video During Recording</h2><p>You must make some preparations to sync an audio file with a video properly. It’s to have a sound spike to match the footage properly with the separate audio file. And it might look disturbing, but even a simple Clap might do the job.</p>
<p>And if you want a professional way, just imagine the clapper board. You must have seen it in the film industry. This clapper board is used not only to mark the shot but also to create a sound spike when it claps. We use this audio spike as a reference to sync the audio files with the video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="a clapper board used to start a film scene"
                ></p>
<p>Every time you cut your shot, remember to clap on camera again the next time you roll. It’s best to clap before you say “Action” or speak so that it’s easy to find and sync when editing. But if you forget, you can also clap at the end of the shot before you cut. That is called a <strong>Tail Slate</strong>!!!</p>
<p>After you’ve recorded your video like this, the next step is pretty simple. The video editor we recommend is no other than the world’s leading tool in the market, Wondershare Filmora. Let’s move forward and see how to sync audio with video using <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>

<h5 id="Step3Prepare-your-files"><a href="#Step3Prepare-your-files" class="headerlink" title="Step3Prepare your files"></a>Step3Prepare your files</h5><p>Now, it’s time to prepare our files for synchronization. First, drag the video file down to the timeline from the “Import Media” section. After that, drag the audio file in the same way below the video on the panel.</p>

<p>As far as the audio synching is concerned, you can do it either manually or with auto synchronization. And we will explain both of these processes in a stepwise manner to give you complete mastery over your audio synching. Let’s start with the manual process first.</p>

<h2 id="How-to-Film-Better-in-Public-2024-Guide"><a href="#How-to-Film-Better-in-Public-2024-Guide" class="headerlink" title="How to Film Better in Public - 2024 Guide"></a>How to Film Better in Public - 2024 Guide</h2><p>Filming in public and different locations can add a new dimension to any video. The possibilities are limitless, from the hustle and bustle of a busy city street to the tranquil beauty of a remote beach.</p>
<p>Suppose you’re a new vlogger and want to capture the perfect scene in public. Then this blog is for you. It will explain various tips and tricks to help you create the best videos, regardless of location. So let’s start and learn more about how to film better in public!</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-Gear-Will-You-Need-to-Record-a-Better-Video-in-Public"><a href="#Part-1-What-Gear-Will-You-Need-to-Record-a-Better-Video-in-Public" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Gear Will You Need to Record a Better Video in Public?"></a>Part 1. What Gear Will You Need to Record a Better Video in Public?</h2><p>While recording in public, you want to avoid setting and holding unnecessary camera gear. That’s why you should keep your gear as low-key as possible. The essential shooting gears that you are going to need are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="A-Good-Camera"><a href="#A-Good-Camera" class="headerlink" title="A Good Camera"></a>A Good Camera</h3><p>A good camera is essential to record a video in public because it will provide quality footage. It will also allow you to capture more detail and create more engaging videos. But if you use a phone instead, make sure it is the latest iPhone or other with high pixels camera.</p>

                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/create-better-film-footage-1.jpg"
                      alt="a dslr camera"
                ></p>
<h3 id="A-Tripod"><a href="#A-Tripod" class="headerlink" title="A Tripod"></a>A Tripod</h3><p>A tripod is essential when recording video in public to ensure that your shots are stable and steady. Without a tripod, your camera can shake and create a distorted, blurry image that can ruin a shot. So having a secure tripod will help you capture professional-looking footage.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/create-better-film-footage-2.jpg"
                      alt="a tripod"
                ></p>
<h3 id="A-Microphone"><a href="#A-Microphone" class="headerlink" title="A Microphone"></a>A Microphone</h3><p>A microphone is essential for recording a video in public because it captures the sound in the environment, allowing the video to be recorded with better-quality audio. Without a microphone, the video would be recorded with distorted sound and would likely be challenging to understand.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="a vlogging microphone"
                ></p>
<p>Apart from the gear mentioned above, you can also bring an ND filter, extra batteries, and SD cards. Because If the battery runs out or the SD card becomes full, the video recording could be lost. The spare batteries and SD cards help to ensure that the video can be captured uninterrupted. Let’s see what we need further.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-Do-You-Need-to-Accomplish-With-Your-Video"><a href="#Part-2-What-Do-You-Need-to-Accomplish-With-Your-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. What Do You Need to Accomplish With Your Video?"></a>Part 2. What Do You Need to Accomplish With Your Video?</h2><p>While recording a video in a busy location, you need to accomplish three things with your video to record it better. Which are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="1-Clean-Shots"><a href="#1-Clean-Shots" class="headerlink" title="1. Clean Shots"></a>1. Clean Shots</h3><p>When recording in a busy location, it is essential to try and capture clean shots. It can be done by using a wide-angle lens to get the full shot or zooming in to focus on a particular element.</p>
<h3 id="2-Clean-Audio"><a href="#2-Clean-Audio" class="headerlink" title="2. Clean Audio"></a>2. Clean Audio</h3><p>Getting a clean and clear sound when recording audio in a busy location is essential. A good quality microphone, an audio recorder, or external noise reduction can help minimize background noise and capture the desired audio.</p>
<h3 id="3-Decent-Lighting"><a href="#3-Decent-Lighting" class="headerlink" title="3. Decent Lighting"></a>3. Decent Lighting</h3><p>In a busy location, decent lighting is as important as the other two factors. Look for natural light sources that can provide good light, even illumination. If these are unavailable, consider using portable lighting equipment or lamps to create a more flattering environment.</p>
<p>Now that we know what we need let’s see how to make a video.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Get-the-Best-Shot-While-Filming-Outdoor"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Get-the-Best-Shot-While-Filming-Outdoor" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How to Get the Best Shot While Filming Outdoor?"></a>Part 3. How to Get the Best Shot While Filming Outdoor?</h2><p>Whether you are a vlogger, a YouTuber, or a student filmmaker, shooting a video in a busy area is always a challenge. You must be able to plan and execute your production in a way that minimizes disruption and produces quality footage. By following these instructions, we hope you can make a difference in a shot you record:</p>
<h5 id="Step1-Scout-the-Location"><a href="#Step1-Scout-the-Location" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Scout the Location"></a>Step1 Scout the Location</h5><p>Before recording, visit the location in advance to plan your shots. Take note of potential distractions or noise sources and plan your angles accordingly.</p>

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step2-Choose-the-correct-shooting-time"><a href="#Step2-Choose-the-correct-shooting-time" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Choose the correct shooting time"></a>Step2 Choose the correct shooting time</h5><p>The best time to record a video in a busy location is when the area is less crowded, such as early in the morning or late at night. Avoiding peak times and holidays is also a good idea.</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Choose-the-right-angle"><a href="#Step3-Choose-the-right-angle" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Choose the right angle"></a>Step3 Choose the right angle</h5><p>Once you get to the location, you must find the right angle.</p>
<p><strong>Select Background</strong></p>
<p>Try to find a background that will best capture the atmosphere of the area and minimize any background noise.</p>

                      alt="select the background"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Set the frame</strong></p>
<p>If your frame is too broad, you will face potential distractions that could interfere with your video, such as people walking in and out of the frame.</p>

                     lazyload

                      alt="setting the frame"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Set your position</strong></p>
<p>Instead of getting closer to your talent, get further away and zoom in this way, you leave space for other people in the location, and you can still get your shot!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="zoom in the talent"
                ></p>
<p>Try to get your shot and then get out quickly so you don’t bother other people trying to get their photos.</p>

Best Way to Record Audio While Filming Outdoor"></a>Part 4. Best Way to Record Audio While Filming Outdoor</h2><p>Audio is essential to any video production, and recording audio while filming outdoor scenes can be challenging.</p>
<p>Outdoor environments come with more variables to consider, such as wind, traffic noise, and other background noise, that can make capturing clear audio more difficult. Even if you use a high-quality mic, you still have chances of interruption.</p>
<p>If you get any such variable in the video you recorded, you can re-record the audio with the help of <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</strong> Let’s see how you can do it:</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step5 Click record and try to re-record your line and match it up the best you can. To get the sound and sync right, you might need to attempt a few times, but in the end, it will improve the quality of your video.</p>
