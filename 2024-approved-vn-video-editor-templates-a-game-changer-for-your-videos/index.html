<h5 id="Step6-Create-Multiple-Outlines"><a href="#Step6-Create-Multiple-Outlines" class="headerlink" title="Step6 Create Multiple Outlines"></a>Step6 Create Multiple Outlines</h5><p>It would help if you created multiple outlines to achieve the Neon Dance effect.

<ul>
<li>When you have selected the color for your outline, export the video by clicking on the <strong>Export</strong> icon in the top right corner.</li>
</ul>

                ></p>
<ul>
<li>When you have exported the video, move back to the timeline to edit again.</li>
<li>As we had selected the <strong>Blue</strong> color for reference, now choose another color you wish.</li>
<li>After changing the video, export it again.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Export as many times as you want with the color of your choice. <strong>E.g., 5 colors &#x3D; 5 exports.</strong></p>
<h5 id="Step7-Import-the-exported-videos"><a href="#Step7-Import-the-exported-videos" class="headerlink" title="Step7 Import the exported videos"></a>Step7 Import the exported videos</h5><ul>
<li>Now you have to import the videos that you exported.</li>
<li>Before doing that, first, delete the video in track 2. (The video on which we applied the <strong>Difference</strong>)</li>
<li>Now select all the exports from your library and import them onto the import window.</li>
<li>Please select all of them and drag them on the timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You don’t want all the outlines to play simultaneously. Otherwise, the outlines will not appear to be separate.</p>
<ul>
<li>To do so, stack the videos on each other on different tracks.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> The trick here will be to offset the video by a few seconds so that each video plays a little later than the other.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="offset the videos by a few seconds"
                ></p>
<p>To efficiently blend the outlines with the green screen, you can change the blending mode of each of the exported videos to “<strong>Lighten</strong>.”</p>
<ul>
<li>Double-click on each video.</li>
<li>In the editing panel, choose compositing.</li>
<li>From there, select the “<strong>Lighten</strong>“ option.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="Step8-Add-the-Glow-effect"><a href="#Step8-Add-the-Glow-effect" class="headerlink" title="Step8 Add the Glow effect"></a>Step8 Add the Glow effect</h5><p>To make the outlines glow like Neon lights, we will need to add another effect from the effects library.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the effects tab and search for “<strong>Glow</strong>.”</li>
<li>Click and <strong>drag</strong> the glow effect to each of the exported videos.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add the glow effect"
                ></p>
<p>You can make it more fun by going one step further!</p>
<ul>
<li>Double-click on each of the glow effects that you added.</li>
<li>In effect, the <strong>editing panel</strong> goes to the video effects.</li>
<li>Here, you can change the <strong>radius</strong> of the Glow effect you added.</li>
<li>Similarly, you can do it in all the other videos.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="Step9-Apply-the-Green-screen-effect"><a href="#Step9-Apply-the-Green-screen-effect" class="headerlink" title="Step9 Apply the Green screen effect"></a>Step9 Apply the Green screen effect</h5><p>We will change our green screen for the final part. Follow the last steps, and then enjoy!</p>
<ul>
<li>Move the green screen footage below them all to the top track.</li>
<li>Double-click the video to enter the editing panel.</li>
<li>Go to the chroma key (Green Screen) in the editing panel**.**</li>
<li>Click on the arrow aside from the tab.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will immediately see changes to your video in the main play window. Play the video from the start and notice the changes.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Export as many times as you want with the color of your choice. <strong>E.g., 5 colors &#x3D; 5 exports.</strong></p>

<li>Now you have to import the videos that you exported.</li>
<li>Before doing that, first, delete the video in track 2. (The video on which we applied the <strong>Difference</strong>)</li>
<li>Now select all the exports from your library and import them onto the import window.</li>
<li>Please select all of them and drag them on the timeline.</li>
</ul>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You don’t want all the outlines to play simultaneously. Otherwise, the outlines will not appear to be separate.</p>
<ul>
<li>To do so, stack the videos on each other on different tracks.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> The trick here will be to offset the video by a few seconds so that each video plays a little later than the other.</p>

<ul>
<li>Go to the effects tab and search for “<strong>Glow</strong>.”</li>

<li>Double-click on each of the glow effects that you added.</li>
<li>In effect, the <strong>editing panel</strong> goes to the video effects.</li>
<li>Here, you can change the <strong>radius</strong> of the Glow effect you added.</li>

While that is an entirely unscientific assessment that you should not cite in a college paper, given the accessibility and sophistication of today’s green screen technology, it is probably not far off. Everyone has access to expert compositing technology, from Marvel movies to local news stations.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT ARE GREEN SCREEN AND CHROMA KEYING?</strong></p>
<p>The colored background you want to make transparent and remove from your shot is referred to as a green screen. This is typically a single-colored backdrop, which can be any color but is usually bright green because it is the color most dissimilar to human skin tones. (Blue screens were commonly used in the early days of film, and they may still be used in some cases.)</p>
<p>The chroma key is a time-honored and widely used visual effects technique. Simply stated, chroma key is the process of photographing a subject against a solid-color background and then removing that background in post-production and replacing it with transparency. The subject can then be positioned in front of any new background.</p>

<p>When you record a video against a green screen, you can make the background transparent and replace it with other video clips, graphics, or still images of your choice. It’s easy to overlay any footage with iMovie’s green screen effect. For example, you can transport yourself anywhere or appear in your favorite films.</p>
<p>The green Screen effect, also referred as the Chroma Key effect, is a simple way to combine two clips into one with impressive scenes. You can, for example, fly over a very high mountain. Green Screen is a background that is only one color, usually green. This could be another pure color, such as Blue or Pink. By dragging and dropping, you can apply a green screen video to another in iMovie. It’s incredibly simple to create stunning videos using the iMovie Green Screen effect.</p>

<p>Davinci Resolve has two versions including a full studio version which is available for $299. Because some professional tools, such as team collaboration and video noise reduction, cannot be used without a full license, the free program has a surprising number of features. The majority of the features included in the free version are adequate for professionals and hobbyists.</p>
<p>Although the Davinci Resolve program is regarded as a professional grade editor, it does include some advanced tools such as exporting, audio mastering, color correction, and more. The program is also useful for arranging audio and video clips, and it has a large selection of effects and filters. The additional color correction and adjustments available here can also aid in HDR support and produce more professional results when working with camera RAW data.</p>
<p>Davinci Resolve is also well-known for having one of the best color grading programs available. The outcome can be hugely potent when using the accessible chromakey tools. It doesn’t take much to figure out how to use this effect with the quick tutorial on board.</p>

<p><strong>Steps On How To Remove the Green Screen in DaVinci Resolve Inside the Color Tab</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1 – Add the Qualifier Tool &amp; select the color</strong></p>
<p>After you finish cutting the video, jump inside the “<strong>Color</strong>” tab and select the Qualifier Tool. Make sure you set the tool in “<strong>3D</strong>” mode to enable us to select a bigger range of the green spectrum.</p>
<p>Do this by simply selecting the fourth dot from the middle-upper area of the window or by selecting it from the drop-down mode selector situated in the window’s top-right corner.</p>
<p>After selecting the 3D mode for the Qualifier Tool, go ahead and select the range of green colors you want to remove by simply drawing lines on top of the screen, similar to the way I did in the image below.</p>

<h4 id="Step-2-–-Removing-the-color"><a href="#Step-2-–-Removing-the-color" class="headerlink" title="Step 2 – Removing the color"></a><strong>Step 2 – Removing the color</strong></h4><p>As you can see in the small rectangle, Resolve did the keying, but it doesn’t know what to do with it because we didn’t specify. Right-click underneath the node, select “Add Alpha Output” and then link the node.</p>
<p>Yes, I know it will key out the subject and not the green screen. There is no problem. Go ahead and select the Revert button situated in the “Selection Range” window. Everything should be OK now.</p>

<h4 id="Step-3-–-Clean-the-edges"><a href="#Step-3-–-Clean-the-edges" class="headerlink" title="Step 3 – Clean the edges"></a><strong>Step 3 – Clean the edges</strong></h4><p>As you can surely notice, there are still some issues we have to address. In the hair area and on the outline of the subject, there is a noticeable green color spill. We don’t want that! On top of this, there will be many situations where you will still notice some noisy green pixels in the transparent area, around the corners of the screen, or the subject.</p>
<p>To get rid of these problems, we have to jump into the Qualifier window. Here, there are many settings you can play with to tweak the output. Most of the time, you will solve these problems by checking “Despill”, further selecting more of the greens and adding them to the Selection Range, or modifying the shrink, ”Black Clip” and “White Clip”.</p>

<p><strong>Steps On How To Chroma Key In Lightworks</strong></p>
<h2 id="1-Record-your-video"><a href="#1-Record-your-video" class="headerlink" title="1. Record your video"></a><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Record your video</strong></h2><p>First, you need a green or blue background to shoot against. As we’ll explain later, it doesn’t have to be a very specific shade, but it needs to be substantially different from the subject you’re shooting. You might have seen occasions when a weather presenter’s tie has appeared transparent during a broadcast. This is because the material was too close in color to the backdrop, or the key wasn’t quite set accurately enough.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-37.jpg"
                      alt="green-screen-software"
                ></p>
<p>You can make your backdrop using a sheet, or a large sheet of paper or card. If you’re planning to make videos frequently, there are inexpensive chromakey backdrops available that include a frame to hang the cloth from. If space is limited, collapsible screens are also available starting at around US$40. These screens are also handy for photography.</p>
<p>Good lighting is essential. You need to make sure that the screen is evenly lit so the color is consistent. It’s also important to ensure your subject is far enough from the screen to avoid shadows and color spills (when the blue or green backdrop reflects off your subject).</p>
<h2 id="2-Import-and-trim"><a href="#2-Import-and-trim" class="headerlink" title="2. Import and trim"></a><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Import and trim</strong></h2><p>Once you’ve shot your video, download and install <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/lightworks" >Lightworks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It’s free for personal use, but you’ll need to register for a free account if you want to use it for longer than 30 days.</p>
<p>Click the button marked Create a New Project, give it a name, and select a frame rate (you can find this by right-clicking your recorded video and selecting the Details tab). Here we’re using a still image as a background, but you can also use another video. Import this the same way.</p>
<p>Click the Edit tab and drag your video from the Project Contents panel onto the V1 track of the timeline below. If there’s unwanted footage at the beginning or end of your clip, right-click it and select Trim In or Trim Out, then use the yellow handles to change where the clip starts and finishes.</p>
<p>Right-click the preview window marked Sequence #1 and select Tracks &gt; Add Video. Drag your video clip into the V1 track and your still image into V2. Click and drag the right-hand side of the image in the V2 track until it’s the same length as the video.</p>
<p><img

<h2 id="3-Set-the-key"><a href="#3-Set-the-key" class="headerlink" title="3. Set the key"></a><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Set the key</strong></h2><p>Now click the VFX tab, select the V1 track in the timeline and click the tab marked with a plus icon. Click the Favorites drop-down menu and select Key, followed by Green Screen. Click Add Effect and you’ll see a new panel of settings under the color correction wheels.</p>
<p>Use the eyedropper tool on the left to select the background you want to remove. This will typically do quite a good job by itself, but it will need a little fine-tuning. Try sliding the Saturation and Luminance sliders and adjusting their steepness using the handles that appear when you move your mouse over them. You’ll notice that each adjustment you make has a knock-on effect on the changes you’ve made with the other sliders; it’s a matter of balancing all three to achieve the best effect, preserving detail while minimizing spill.</p>
<p>To see how the filter is working, click the ‘Reveal’ box. The white areas are the parts of the video that will be removed, and the black areas are the parts that will remain.</p>
<p>The Remove Spill slider will add a purple tint to neutralize green tones in areas that need it.</p>

When you’re done, return to the Edit tab, right-click the preview window at the top right and select Export.</p>
<p>The only two export options you’ll see in the free version of Lightworks are Vimeo and YouTube, but this is a little misleading. These will save the video to your PC or Mac in an MP4 format, but they won’t do the uploading for you unless you check the appropriate box.</p>
<p>Select a destination folder and name for your video file and click ‘Start’. The processing will begin, and you’ll see a progress bar at the top right. This task will run in the background so you can continue working on your project, and you’ll be notified when it’s complete.</p>

<p><strong>WHICH SHOULD I CHOOSE: FREE OR PAID GREEN SCREEN SOFTWARE?</strong></p>
<p>If you want something quick, cheap, and easy, and having your footage seems to be fairly clean with few shadows or spills, there are several cheap or free apps into which you can import a clip, apply a chroma key, and export without much editing or advanced features.</p>
<p>If your footage calls for attention, extra equipment can be required. If your clip has inconsistent lighting fixtures or poor quality, you may require equipment that permits you to observe a couple of chroma keys to suit the numerous shades of green or color correction equipment to restore your pictures. For even advanced functions, you’ll want to spend a little time and money learning, however the end result will most possibly be worthwhile. More advanced chroma key equipment are normally used inside full-featured NLEs through integrated equipment or expert plug-ins that encompass extra beneficial functions including advanced color correction, noise reduction, HDR (High Dynamic Range) color support, movement and keyframing, extra file layout and high-resolution support, and multi-camera editing.</p>
<p><strong>FAQS ABOUT EDITING GREEN SCREEN</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What is the most important thing when using a green screen?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When lighting your green screen, ensure there is even, soft light on the entirety of the green screen. This is crucial for a proper key. Many filmmakers overlook this essential part and focus on lighting the subject. However, be sure to use whatever lights you have to expose the green screen background evenly.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Why do filmmakers use green screens?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A green screen basically lets you drop in whatever background images you want behind the actors and&#x2F;or foreground. It’s used in film production (and also in news and weather reports) to relatively simply place the desired background behind the subject&#x2F;actor&#x2F;presenter.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Why is a green screen not a different color?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The really short answer is that green screens are green because people are not green. For the effect to work, the background must use a color that isn’t used elsewhere in the shot – and green is nothing like human skin tone.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Green screen video production is not difficult. Anyone, with the right tools can create green screen effects like a pro. Simply follow the precautions listed above and choose the software that best suits your needs.</p>
<p>Whether you’re making a professional film or a simple family video, I’m confident you’ll find something suitable among the options listed above.</p>

<p>When you record a video against a green screen, you can make the background transparent and replace it with other video clips, graphics, or still images of your choice. It’s easy to overlay any footage with iMovie’s green screen effect. For example, you can transport yourself anywhere or appear in your favorite films.</p>
<p>The green Screen effect, also referred as the Chroma Key effect, is a simple way to combine two clips into one with impressive scenes. You can, for example, fly over a very high mountain. Green Screen is a background that is only one color, usually green. This could be another pure color, such as Blue or Pink. By dragging and dropping, you can apply a green screen video to another in iMovie. It’s incredibly simple to create stunning videos using the iMovie Green Screen effect.</p>

<p>Davinci Resolve has two versions including a full studio version which is available for $299. Because some professional tools, such as team collaboration and video noise reduction, cannot be used without a full license, the free program has a surprising number of features. The majority of the features included in the free version are adequate for professionals and hobbyists.</p>
<p>Although the Davinci Resolve program is regarded as a professional grade editor, it does include some advanced tools such as exporting, audio mastering, color correction, and more. The program is also useful for arranging audio and video clips, and it has a large selection of effects and filters. The additional color correction and adjustments available here can also aid in HDR support and produce more professional results when working with camera RAW data.</p>
<p>Davinci Resolve is also well-known for having one of the best color grading programs available. The outcome can be hugely potent when using the accessible chromakey tools. It doesn’t take much to figure out how to use this effect with the quick tutorial on board.</p>

<p><strong>Steps On How To Remove the Green Screen in DaVinci Resolve Inside the Color Tab</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1 – Add the Qualifier Tool &amp; select the color</strong></p>
<p>After you finish cutting the video, jump inside the “<strong>Color</strong>” tab and select the Qualifier Tool. Make sure you set the tool in “<strong>3D</strong>” mode to enable us to select a bigger range of the green spectrum.</p>
<p>Do this by simply selecting the fourth dot from the middle-upper area of the window or by selecting it from the drop-down mode selector situated in the window’s top-right corner.</p>
<p>After selecting the 3D mode for the Qualifier Tool, go ahead and select the range of green colors you want to remove by simply drawing lines on top of the screen, similar to the way I did in the image below.</p>

Right-click underneath the node, select “Add Alpha Output” and then link the node.</p>
<p>Yes, I know it will key out the subject and not the green screen. There is no problem. Go ahead and select the Revert button situated in the “Selection Range” window. Everything should be OK now.</p>

<h4 id="Step-3-–-Clean-the-edges-1"><a href="#Step-3-–-Clean-the-edges-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 3 – Clean the edges"></a><strong>Step 3 – Clean the edges</strong></h4><p>As you can surely notice, there are still some issues we have to address. In the hair area and on the outline of the subject, there is a noticeable green color spill. We don’t want that! On top of this, there will be many situations where you will still notice some noisy green pixels in the transparent area, around the corners of the screen, or the subject.</p>
<p>To get rid of these problems, we have to jump into the Qualifier window. Here, there are many settings you can play with to tweak the output. Most of the time, you will solve these problems by checking “Despill”, further selecting more of the greens and adding them to the Selection Range, or modifying the shrink, ”Black Clip” and “White Clip”.</p>

<p><strong>Steps On How To Chroma Key In Lightworks</strong></p>
<h2 id="1-Record-your-video-1"><a href="#1-Record-your-video-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Record your video"></a><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Record your video</strong></h2><p>First, you need a green or blue background to shoot against. As we’ll explain later, it doesn’t have to be a very specific shade, but it needs to be substantially different from the subject you’re shooting. You might have seen occasions when a weather presenter’s tie has appeared transparent during a broadcast. This is because the material was too close in color to the backdrop, or the key wasn’t quite set accurately enough.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="green-screen-software"
                ></p>
<p>You can make your backdrop using a sheet, or a large sheet of paper or card. If you’re planning to make videos frequently, there are inexpensive chromakey backdrops available that include a frame to hang the cloth from. If space is limited, collapsible screens are also available starting at around US$40. These screens are also handy for photography.</p>
<p>Good lighting is essential. You need to make sure that the screen is evenly lit so the color is consistent. It’s also important to ensure your subject is far enough from the screen to avoid shadows and color spills (when the blue or green backdrop reflects off your subject).</p>
<h2 id="2-Import-and-trim-1"><a href="#2-Import-and-trim-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Import and trim"></a><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Import and trim</strong></h2><p>Once you’ve shot your video, download and install <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/lightworks" >Lightworks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It’s free for personal use, but you’ll need to register for a free account if you want to use it for longer than 30 days.</p>
<p>Click the button marked Create a New Project, give it a name, and select a frame rate (you can find this by right-clicking your recorded video and selecting the Details tab). Here we’re using a still image as a background, but you can also use another video. Import this the same way.</p>
<p>Click the Edit tab and drag your video from the Project Contents panel onto the V1 track of the timeline below. If there’s unwanted footage at the beginning or end of your clip, right-click it and select Trim In or Trim Out, then use the yellow handles to change where the clip starts and finishes.</p>
<p>Right-click the preview window marked Sequence #1 and select Tracks &gt; Add Video. Drag your video clip into the V1 track and your still image into V2. Click and drag the right-hand side of the image in the V2 track until it’s the same length as the video.</p>

<h2 id="3-Set-the-key-1"><a href="#3-Set-the-key-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Set the key"></a><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Set the key</strong></h2><p>Now click the VFX tab, select the V1 track in the timeline and click the tab marked with a plus icon. Click the Favorites drop-down menu and select Key, followed by Green Screen. Click Add Effect and you’ll see a new panel of settings under the color correction wheels.</p>
<p>Use the eyedropper tool on the left to select the background you want to remove. This will typically do quite a good job by itself, but it will need a little fine-tuning. Try sliding the Saturation and Luminance sliders and adjusting their steepness using the handles that appear when you move your mouse over them. You’ll notice that each adjustment you make has a knock-on effect on the changes you’ve made with the other sliders; it’s a matter of balancing all three to achieve the best effect, preserving detail while minimizing spill.</p>
<p>To see how the filter is working, click the ‘Reveal’ box. The white areas are the parts of the video that will be removed, and the black areas are the parts that will remain.</p>
<p>The Remove Spill slider will add a purple tint to neutralize green tones in areas that need it.</p>

When you’re done, return to the Edit tab, right-click the preview window at the top right and select Export.</p>
<p>The only two export options you’ll see in the free version of Lightworks are Vimeo and YouTube, but this is a little misleading. These will save the video to your PC or Mac in an MP4 format, but they won’t do the uploading for you unless you check the appropriate box.</p>
<p>Select a destination folder and name for your video file and click ‘Start’. The processing will begin, and you’ll see a progress bar at the top right. This task will run in the background so you can continue working on your project, and you’ll be notified when it’s complete.</p>

<p><strong>WHICH SHOULD I CHOOSE: FREE OR PAID GREEN SCREEN SOFTWARE?</strong></p>
<p>If you want something quick, cheap, and easy, and having your footage seems to be fairly clean with few shadows or spills, there are several cheap or free apps into which you can import a clip, apply a chroma key, and export without much editing or advanced features.</p>
<p>If your footage calls for attention, extra equipment can be required. If your clip has inconsistent lighting fixtures or poor quality, you may require equipment that permits you to observe a couple of chroma keys to suit the numerous shades of green or color correction equipment to restore your pictures. For even advanced functions, you’ll want to spend a little time and money learning, however the end result will most possibly be worthwhile. More advanced chroma key equipment are normally used inside full-featured NLEs through integrated equipment or expert plug-ins that encompass extra beneficial functions including advanced color correction, noise reduction, HDR (High Dynamic Range) color support, movement and keyframing, extra file layout and high-resolution support, and multi-camera editing.</p>
<p><strong>FAQS ABOUT EDITING GREEN SCREEN</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What is the most important thing when using a green screen?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When lighting your green screen, ensure there is even, soft light on the entirety of the green screen. This is crucial for a proper key. Many filmmakers overlook this essential part and focus on lighting the subject. However, be sure to use whatever lights you have to expose the green screen background evenly.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Why do filmmakers use green screens?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A green screen basically lets you drop in whatever background images you want behind the actors and&#x2F;or foreground. It’s used in film production (and also in news and weather reports) to relatively simply place the desired background behind the subject&#x2F;actor&#x2F;presenter.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Why is a green screen not a different color?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The really short answer is that green screens are green because people are not green. For the effect to work, the background must use a color that isn’t used elsewhere in the shot – and green is nothing like human skin tone.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Green screen video production is not difficult. Anyone, with the right tools can create green screen effects like a pro. Simply follow the precautions listed above and choose the software that best suits your needs.</p>
<p>Whether you’re making a professional film or a simple family video, I’m confident you’ll find something suitable among the options listed above.</p>

<p>When you record a video against a green screen, you can make the background transparent and replace it with other video clips, graphics, or still images of your choice. It’s easy to overlay any footage with iMovie’s green screen effect. For example, you can transport yourself anywhere or appear in your favorite films.</p>
<p>The green Screen effect, also referred as the Chroma Key effect, is a simple way to combine two clips into one with impressive scenes. You can, for example, fly over a very high mountain. Green Screen is a background that is only one color, usually green. This could be another pure color, such as Blue or Pink. By dragging and dropping, you can apply a green screen video to another in iMovie. It’s incredibly simple to create stunning videos using the iMovie Green Screen effect.</p>

<p>Davinci Resolve has two versions including a full studio version which is available for $299. Because some professional tools, such as team collaboration and video noise reduction, cannot be used without a full license, the free program has a surprising number of features. The majority of the features included in the free version are adequate for professionals and hobbyists.</p>
<p>Although the Davinci Resolve program is regarded as a professional grade editor, it does include some advanced tools such as exporting, audio mastering, color correction, and more. The program is also useful for arranging audio and video clips, and it has a large selection of effects and filters. The additional color correction and adjustments available here can also aid in HDR support and produce more professional results when working with camera RAW data.</p>
<p>Davinci Resolve is also well-known for having one of the best color grading programs available. The outcome can be hugely potent when using the accessible chromakey tools. It doesn’t take much to figure out how to use this effect with the quick tutorial on board.</p>

<p><strong>Steps On How To Remove the Green Screen in DaVinci Resolve Inside the Color Tab</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1 – Add the Qualifier Tool &amp; select the color</strong></p>
<p>After you finish cutting the video, jump inside the “<strong>Color</strong>” tab and select the Qualifier Tool. Make sure you set the tool in “<strong>3D</strong>” mode to enable us to select a bigger range of the green spectrum.</p>
<p>Do this by simply selecting the fourth dot from the middle-upper area of the window or by selecting it from the drop-down mode selector situated in the window’s top-right corner.</p>
<p>After selecting the 3D mode for the Qualifier Tool, go ahead and select the range of green colors you want to remove by simply drawing lines on top of the screen, similar to the way I did in the image below.</p>

Right-click underneath the node, select “Add Alpha Output” and then link the node.</p>
<p>Yes, I know it will key out the subject and not the green screen. There is no problem. Go ahead and select the Revert button situated in the “Selection Range” window. Everything should be OK now.</p>

In the hair area and on the outline of the subject, there is a noticeable green color spill. We don’t want that! On top of this, there will be many situations where you will still notice some noisy green pixels in the transparent area, around the corners of the screen, or the subject.</p>
<p>To get rid of these problems, we have to jump into the Qualifier window. Here, there are many settings you can play with to tweak the output. Most of the time, you will solve these problems by checking “Despill”, further selecting more of the greens and adding them to the Selection Range, or modifying the shrink, ”Black Clip” and “White Clip”.</p>

<p><strong>Steps On How To Chroma Key In Lightworks</strong></p>
<h2 id="1-Record-your-video-2"><a href="#1-Record-your-video-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Record your video"></a><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Record your video</strong></h2><p>First, you need a green or blue background to shoot against. As we’ll explain later, it doesn’t have to be a very specific shade, but it needs to be substantially different from the subject you’re shooting. You might have seen occasions when a weather presenter’s tie has appeared transparent during a broadcast. This is because the material was too close in color to the backdrop, or the key wasn’t quite set accurately enough.</p>

<p>You can make your backdrop using a sheet, or a large sheet of paper or card. If you’re planning to make videos frequently, there are inexpensive chromakey backdrops available that include a frame to hang the cloth from. If space is limited, collapsible screens are also available starting at around US$40. These screens are also handy for photography.</p>
<p>Good lighting is essential. You need to make sure that the screen is evenly lit so the color is consistent. It’s also important to ensure your subject is far enough from the screen to avoid shadows and color spills (when the blue or green backdrop reflects off your subject).</p>
<h2 id="2-Import-and-trim-2"><a href="#2-Import-and-trim-2" class="headerlink" title="2.

It’s free for personal use, but you’ll need to register for a free account if you want to use it for longer than 30 days.</p>
<p>Click the button marked Create a New Project, give it a name, and select a frame rate (you can find this by right-clicking your recorded video and selecting the Details tab). Here we’re using a still image as a background, but you can also use another video. Import this the same way.</p>
<p>Click the Edit tab and drag your video from the Project Contents panel onto the V1 track of the timeline below. If there’s unwanted footage at the beginning or end of your clip, right-click it and select Trim In or Trim Out, then use the yellow handles to change where the clip starts and finishes.</p>
<p>Right-click the preview window marked Sequence #1 and select Tracks &gt; Add Video. Drag your video clip into the V1 track and your still image into V2. Click and drag the right-hand side of the image in the V2 track until it’s the same length as the video.</p>

Click the Favorites drop-down menu and select Key, followed by Green Screen. Click Add Effect and you’ll see a new panel of settings under the color correction wheels.</p>
<p>Use the eyedropper tool on the left to select the background you want to remove. This will typically do quite a good job by itself, but it will need a little fine-tuning. Try sliding the Saturation and Luminance sliders and adjusting their steepness using the handles that appear when you move your mouse over them. You’ll notice that each adjustment you make has a knock-on effect on the changes you’ve made with the other sliders; it’s a matter of balancing all three to achieve the best effect, preserving detail while minimizing spill.</p>
<p>To see how the filter is working, click the ‘Reveal’ box. The white areas are the parts of the video that will be removed, and the black areas are the parts that will remain.</p>
<p>The Remove Spill slider will add a purple tint to neutralize green tones in areas that need it.</p>

<p><strong>WHICH SHOULD I CHOOSE: FREE OR PAID GREEN SCREEN SOFTWARE?</strong></p>
<p>If you want something quick, cheap, and easy, and having your footage seems to be fairly clean with few shadows or spills, there are several cheap or free apps into which you can import a clip, apply a chroma key, and export without much editing or advanced features.</p>
<p>If your footage calls for attention, extra equipment can be required. If your clip has inconsistent lighting fixtures or poor quality, you may require equipment that permits you to observe a couple of chroma keys to suit the numerous shades of green or color correction equipment to restore your pictures. For even advanced functions, you’ll want to spend a little time and money learning, however the end result will most possibly be worthwhile. More advanced chroma key equipment are normally used inside full-featured NLEs through integrated equipment or expert plug-ins that encompass extra beneficial functions including advanced color correction, noise reduction, HDR (High Dynamic Range) color support, movement and keyframing, extra file layout and high-resolution support, and multi-camera editing.</p>
<p><strong>FAQS ABOUT EDITING GREEN SCREEN</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What is the most important thing when using a green screen?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When lighting your green screen, ensure there is even, soft light on the entirety of the green screen. This is crucial for a proper key. Many filmmakers overlook this essential part and focus on lighting the subject. However, be sure to use whatever lights you have to expose the green screen background evenly.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Why do filmmakers use green screens?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A green screen basically lets you drop in whatever background images you want behind the actors and&#x2F;or foreground. It’s used in film production (and also in news and weather reports) to relatively simply place the desired background behind the subject&#x2F;actor&#x2F;presenter.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Why is a green screen not a different color?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The really short answer is that green screens are green because people are not green. For the effect to work, the background must use a color that isn’t used elsewhere in the shot – and green is nothing like human skin tone.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Green screen video production is not difficult. Anyone, with the right tools can create green screen effects like a pro. Simply follow the precautions listed above and choose the software that best suits your needs.</p>
<p>Whether you’re making a professional film or a simple family video, I’m confident you’ll find something suitable among the options listed above.</p>

<p>Davinci Resolve has two versions including a full studio version which is available for $299. Because some professional tools, such as team collaboration and video noise reduction, cannot be used without a full license, the free program has a surprising number of features. The majority of the features included in the free version are adequate for professionals and hobbyists.</p>
<p>Although the Davinci Resolve program is regarded as a professional grade editor, it does include some advanced tools such as exporting, audio mastering, color correction, and more. The program is also useful for arranging audio and video clips, and it has a large selection of effects and filters. The additional color correction and adjustments available here can also aid in HDR support and produce more professional results when working with camera RAW data.</p>
<p>Davinci Resolve is also well-known for having one of the best color grading programs available. The outcome can be hugely potent when using the accessible chromakey tools. It doesn’t take much to figure out how to use this effect with the quick tutorial on board.</p>

<p><strong>Steps On How To Remove the Green Screen in DaVinci Resolve Inside the Color Tab</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1 – Add the Qualifier Tool &amp; select the color</strong></p>
<p>After you finish cutting the video, jump inside the “<strong>Color</strong>” tab and select the Qualifier Tool. Make sure you set the tool in “<strong>3D</strong>” mode to enable us to select a bigger range of the green spectrum.</p>
<p>Do this by simply selecting the fourth dot from the middle-upper area of the window or by selecting it from the drop-down mode selector situated in the window’s top-right corner.</p>
<p>After selecting the 3D mode for the Qualifier Tool, go ahead and select the range of green colors you want to remove by simply drawing lines on top of the screen, similar to the way I did in the image below.</p>

Right-click underneath the node, select “Add Alpha Output” and then link the node.</p>
<p>Yes, I know it will key out the subject and not the green screen. There is no problem. Go ahead and select the Revert button situated in the “Selection Range” window. Everything should be OK now.</p>

In the hair area and on the outline of the subject, there is a noticeable green color spill. We don’t want that! On top of this, there will be many situations where you will still notice some noisy green pixels in the transparent area, around the corners of the screen, or the subject.</p>
<p>To get rid of these problems, we have to jump into the Qualifier window. Here, there are many settings you can play with to tweak the output. Most of the time, you will solve these problems by checking “Despill”, further selecting more of the greens and adding them to the Selection Range, or modifying the shrink, ”Black Clip” and “White Clip”.</p>

<p><strong>Steps On How To Chroma Key In Lightworks</strong></p>
<h2 id="1-Record-your-video-3"><a href="#1-Record-your-video-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Record your video"></a><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Record your video</strong></h2><p>First, you need a green or blue background to shoot against. As we’ll explain later, it doesn’t have to be a very specific shade, but it needs to be substantially different from the subject you’re shooting. You might have seen occasions when a weather presenter’s tie has appeared transparent during a broadcast. This is because the material was too close in color to the backdrop, or the key wasn’t quite set accurately enough.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="green-screen-software"
                ></p>
<p>You can make your backdrop using a sheet, or a large sheet of paper or card. If you’re planning to make videos frequently, there are inexpensive chromakey backdrops available that include a frame to hang the cloth from. If space is limited, collapsible screens are also available starting at around US$40. These screens are also handy for photography.</p>
<p>Good lighting is essential. You need to make sure that the screen is evenly lit so the color is consistent. It’s also important to ensure your subject is far enough from the screen to avoid shadows and color spills (when the blue or green backdrop reflects off your subject).</p>
<h2 id="2-Import-and-trim-3"><a href="#2-Import-and-trim-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Import and trim"></a><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Import and trim</strong></h2><p>Once you’ve shot your video, download and install <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/lightworks" >Lightworks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It’s free for personal use, but you’ll need to register for a free account if you want to use it for longer than 30 days.</p>
<p>Click the button marked Create a New Project, give it a name, and select a frame rate (you can find this by right-clicking your recorded video and selecting the Details tab). Here we’re using a still image as a background, but you can also use another video. Import this the same way.</p>
<p>Click the Edit tab and drag your video from the Project Contents panel onto the V1 track of the timeline below. If there’s unwanted footage at the beginning or end of your clip, right-click it and select Trim In or Trim Out, then use the yellow handles to change where the clip starts and finishes.</p>
<p>Right-click the preview window marked Sequence #1 and select Tracks &gt; Add Video. Drag your video clip into the V1 track and your still image into V2. Click and drag the right-hand side of the image in the V2 track until it’s the same length as the video.</p>

Set the key"></a><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Set the key</strong></h2><p>Now click the VFX tab, select the V1 track in the timeline and click the tab marked with a plus icon. Click the Favorites drop-down menu and select Key, followed by Green Screen. Click Add Effect and you’ll see a new panel of settings under the color correction wheels.</p>
<p>Use the eyedropper tool on the left to select the background you want to remove. This will typically do quite a good job by itself, but it will need a little fine-tuning. Try sliding the Saturation and Luminance sliders and adjusting their steepness using the handles that appear when you move your mouse over them. You’ll notice that each adjustment you make has a knock-on effect on the changes you’ve made with the other sliders; it’s a matter of balancing all three to achieve the best effect, preserving detail while minimizing spill.</p>
<p>To see how the filter is working, click the ‘Reveal’ box. The white areas are the parts of the video that will be removed, and the black areas are the parts that will remain.</p>
<p>The Remove Spill slider will add a purple tint to neutralize green tones in areas that need it.</p>

<p><strong>WHICH SHOULD I CHOOSE: FREE OR PAID GREEN SCREEN SOFTWARE?</strong></p>
<p>If you want something quick, cheap, and easy, and having your footage seems to be fairly clean with few shadows or spills, there are several cheap or free apps into which you can import a clip, apply a chroma key, and export without much editing or advanced features.</p>
<p>If your footage calls for attention, extra equipment can be required. If your clip has inconsistent lighting fixtures or poor quality, you may require equipment that permits you to observe a couple of chroma keys to suit the numerous shades of green or color correction equipment to restore your pictures. For even advanced functions, you’ll want to spend a little time and money learning, however the end result will most possibly be worthwhile. More advanced chroma key equipment are normally used inside full-featured NLEs through integrated equipment or expert plug-ins that encompass extra beneficial functions including advanced color correction, noise reduction, HDR (High Dynamic Range) color support, movement and keyframing, extra file layout and high-resolution support, and multi-camera editing.</p>
<p><strong>FAQS ABOUT EDITING GREEN SCREEN</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What is the most important thing when using a green screen?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When lighting your green screen, ensure there is even, soft light on the entirety of the green screen. This is crucial for a proper key. Many filmmakers overlook this essential part and focus on lighting the subject. However, be sure to use whatever lights you have to expose the green screen background evenly.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Why do filmmakers use green screens?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A green screen basically lets you drop in whatever background images you want behind the actors and&#x2F;or foreground. It’s used in film production (and also in news and weather reports) to relatively simply place the desired background behind the subject&#x2F;actor&#x2F;presenter.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Why is a green screen not a different color?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The really short answer is that green screens are green because people are not green. For the effect to work, the background must use a color that isn’t used elsewhere in the shot – and green is nothing like human skin tone.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Green screen video production is not difficult. Anyone, with the right tools can create green screen effects like a pro. Simply follow the precautions listed above and choose the software that best suits your needs.</p>
<p>Whether you’re making a professional film or a simple family video, I’m confident you’ll find something suitable among the options listed above.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-AR-and-the-Technology-Used-for-Augmented-Reality-Development"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-AR-and-the-Technology-Used-for-Augmented-Reality-Development" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is AR and the Technology Used for Augmented Reality Development?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What is AR and the Technology Used for Augmented Reality Development?</strong></h2><p>Expanding the acronym, AR stands for Augmented Reality, a relatively newer concept in the world of graphic imaging and other computer based real-time applications. Talking of the exact explanation, augmented reality refers to a responsive synchronization of real world elements into digital platforms, while upgrading the same with high end perceptual information generated from specialized computer systems.</p>
<p>The entire concept of augmented reality rests on 3 major aspects, viz., a synchronized combination of the virtual and real world environments, a responsive interaction of associated elements in real-time, and a precise 3-dimensional registration of virtual and real elements. The aforesaid aspects of augmented reality are often guaranteed by a number of sensory modalities, like that of auditory, visual, somatosensory, olfactory and haptic ones.</p>
<p><strong>Technology Behind Augmented Reality</strong></p>
<p>As far as the technology behind the development of <strong>augmented reality video</strong> is concerned, the overall implementation is categorized into 3 different tasks. The process is initiated with generating concise, high resolution images of real world elements, followed by creating an overlay of computer generated 3D images on the previously generated real world images. This is further succeeded by facilitating an interactive user engagement and interaction within the simulated surroundings.</p>
<p>The process of technology implementation is seconded by a responsive display mechanism which can be done conveniently on any one among glasses, smartphones, screens, head-mounted displays and handheld devices. Concerning the factor of output credibility, head-mounted displays take the credit of generating a much more immersive augmented reality in comparison to the other display alternatives.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-Is-the-Difference-Between-Augmented-Reality-and-Virtual-Reality"><a href="#Part-2-What-Is-the-Difference-Between-Augmented-Reality-and-Virtual-Reality" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What Is the Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality?"></a>Part 2 <strong>What Is the Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality?</strong></h2><p>Advancements in technology has treated the world with a multitude of concepts to simulate real-time elements into digital environments. In addition to augmented reality, the techniques of virtual and alternate reality have come into focus in recent times to address the diversely specific needs of digital and real world integration.</p>
<p>Lack of proper awareness, however, leads to the treatment of these fundamentally different concepts as one and the same thing. Considering the credibility of such technologies towards addressing certain specific purposes, it becomes important to understand the difference among these apparently similar concepts. Having said that, let us make an attempt to realise the dissimilarity between augmented and virtual reality in the following section:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Underlying Concept</strong></p>
<p>Stressing on the parameter of conceptual utility, augmented reality refers to the integration of digital aspects into a real-time surrounding, most probably through a smartphone or camera, whereas, virtual reality on the other hand, is responsible for the replacement of a real-time setting with a simulated environment.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Existence Constraints</strong></p>
<p>Talking about augmented reality, the technique showcases the coexistence of the real and virtual surroundings, with the primary goal of supplying extra information about the real-time environment, which can be accessed without a content search. Conversely, virtual reality is predominantly concerned with bringing about a complete shift of the user’s actual ambiances to an entirely fabricated environment that undertakes an independent existence.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> User Control</p>
<p>Speaking on the extent of user control, augmented reality allows you to monitor your real world presence, mostly with a smartphone, while users of virtual reality are entirely controlled by the system, with strictly no self-access. Also, you would require a headset equipment to make use of virtual reality.</p>

While there are manifold varieties of augmented reality usage, the following section highlights the best examples of integrating AR into brand marketing:</p>
<h3 id="01Walmart-Inventory-Control"><a href="#01Walmart-Inventory-Control" class="headerlink" title="01Walmart- Inventory Control"></a>01Walmart- Inventory Control</h3><p>With the aim to examine the dual credibility of its brand stores as online fulfillment as well as physical shopping centers, Walmart in October 2020, announced the proposition of its 4 shopping units as ‘test centers’ of augmented reality, where the latter was supposed to aid in the management and tracking of company inventories.</p>
<p>The technology was implemented through a smartphone application to quicken the transportation process of item packages from the inventory to the sales area. The utility works when the employees hold a handheld device that highlights the dispatch ready boxes in an <strong>augmented reality stock video</strong>, instead of scanning each box individually.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-AR-and-the-Technology-Used-for-Augmented-Reality-Development-1"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-AR-and-the-Technology-Used-for-Augmented-Reality-Development-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is AR and the Technology Used for Augmented Reality Development?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What is AR and the Technology Used for Augmented Reality Development?</strong></h2><p>Expanding the acronym, AR stands for Augmented Reality, a relatively newer concept in the world of graphic imaging and other computer based real-time applications. Talking of the exact explanation, augmented reality refers to a responsive synchronization of real world elements into digital platforms, while upgrading the same with high end perceptual information generated from specialized computer systems.</p>
<p>The entire concept of augmented reality rests on 3 major aspects, viz., a synchronized combination of the virtual and real world environments, a responsive interaction of associated elements in real-time, and a precise 3-dimensional registration of virtual and real elements. The aforesaid aspects of augmented reality are often guaranteed by a number of sensory modalities, like that of auditory, visual, somatosensory, olfactory and haptic ones.</p>
<p><strong>Technology Behind Augmented Reality</strong></p>
<p>As far as the technology behind the development of <strong>augmented reality video</strong> is concerned, the overall implementation is categorized into 3 different tasks. The process is initiated with generating concise, high resolution images of real world elements, followed by creating an overlay of computer generated 3D images on the previously generated real world images. This is further succeeded by facilitating an interactive user engagement and interaction within the simulated surroundings.</p>
<p>The process of technology implementation is seconded by a responsive display mechanism which can be done conveniently on any one among glasses, smartphones, screens, head-mounted displays and handheld devices. Concerning the factor of output credibility, head-mounted displays take the credit of generating a much more immersive augmented reality in comparison to the other display alternatives.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-Is-the-Difference-Between-Augmented-Reality-and-Virtual-Reality-1"><a href="#Part-2-What-Is-the-Difference-Between-Augmented-Reality-and-Virtual-Reality-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What Is the Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality?"></a>Part 2 <strong>What Is the Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality?</strong></h2><p>Advancements in technology has treated the world with a multitude of concepts to simulate real-time elements into digital environments. In addition to augmented reality, the techniques of virtual and alternate reality have come into focus in recent times to address the diversely specific needs of digital and real world integration.</p>
<p>Lack of proper awareness, however, leads to the treatment of these fundamentally different concepts as one and the same thing. Considering the credibility of such technologies towards addressing certain specific purposes, it becomes important to understand the difference among these apparently similar concepts. Having said that, let us make an attempt to realise the dissimilarity between augmented and virtual reality in the following section:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Underlying Concept</strong></p>
<p>Stressing on the parameter of conceptual utility, augmented reality refers to the integration of digital aspects into a real-time surrounding, most probably through a smartphone or camera, whereas, virtual reality on the other hand, is responsible for the replacement of a real-time setting with a simulated environment.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Existence Constraints</strong></p>
<p>Talking about augmented reality, the technique showcases the coexistence of the real and virtual surroundings, with the primary goal of supplying extra information about the real-time environment, which can be accessed without a content search. Conversely, virtual reality is predominantly concerned with bringing about a complete shift of the user’s actual ambiances to an entirely fabricated environment that undertakes an independent existence.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> User Control</p>
<p>Speaking on the extent of user control, augmented reality allows you to monitor your real world presence, mostly with a smartphone, while users of virtual reality are entirely controlled by the system, with strictly no self-access. Also, you would require a headset equipment to make use of virtual reality.</p>

<p>The technology was implemented through a smartphone application to quicken the transportation process of item packages from the inventory to the sales area. The utility works when the employees hold a handheld device that highlights the dispatch ready boxes in an <strong>augmented reality stock video</strong>, instead of scanning each box individually.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-AR-and-the-Technology-Used-for-Augmented-Reality-Development-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-AR-and-the-Technology-Used-for-Augmented-Reality-Development-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is AR and the Technology Used for Augmented Reality Development?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What is AR and the Technology Used for Augmented Reality Development?</strong></h2><p>Expanding the acronym, AR stands for Augmented Reality, a relatively newer concept in the world of graphic imaging and other computer based real-time applications. Talking of the exact explanation, augmented reality refers to a responsive synchronization of real world elements into digital platforms, while upgrading the same with high end perceptual information generated from specialized computer systems.</p>
<p>The entire concept of augmented reality rests on 3 major aspects, viz., a synchronized combination of the virtual and real world environments, a responsive interaction of associated elements in real-time, and a precise 3-dimensional registration of virtual and real elements. The aforesaid aspects of augmented reality are often guaranteed by a number of sensory modalities, like that of auditory, visual, somatosensory, olfactory and haptic ones.</p>
<p><strong>Technology Behind Augmented Reality</strong></p>
<p>As far as the technology behind the development of <strong>augmented reality video</strong> is concerned, the overall implementation is categorized into 3 different tasks. The process is initiated with generating concise, high resolution images of real world elements, followed by creating an overlay of computer generated 3D images on the previously generated real world images. This is further succeeded by facilitating an interactive user engagement and interaction within the simulated surroundings.</p>
<p>The process of technology implementation is seconded by a responsive display mechanism which can be done conveniently on any one among glasses, smartphones, screens, head-mounted displays and handheld devices. Concerning the factor of output credibility, head-mounted displays take the credit of generating a much more immersive augmented reality in comparison to the other display alternatives.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-Is-the-Difference-Between-Augmented-Reality-and-Virtual-Reality-3"><a href="#Part-2-What-Is-the-Difference-Between-Augmented-Reality-and-Virtual-Reality-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What Is the Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality?"></a>Part 2 <strong>What Is the Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality?</strong></h2><p>Advancements in technology has treated the world with a multitude of concepts to simulate real-time elements into digital environments. In addition to augmented reality, the techniques of virtual and alternate reality have come into focus in recent times to address the diversely specific needs of digital and real world integration.</p>
<p>Lack of proper awareness, however, leads to the treatment of these fundamentally different concepts as one and the same thing. Considering the credibility of such technologies towards addressing certain specific purposes, it becomes important to understand the difference among these apparently similar concepts. Having said that, let us make an attempt to realise the dissimilarity between augmented and virtual reality in the following section:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Underlying Concept</strong></p>
<p>Stressing on the parameter of conceptual utility, augmented reality refers to the integration of digital aspects into a real-time surrounding, most probably through a smartphone or camera, whereas, virtual reality on the other hand, is responsible for the replacement of a real-time setting with a simulated environment.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Existence Constraints</strong></p>
<p>Talking about augmented reality, the technique showcases the coexistence of the real and virtual surroundings, with the primary goal of supplying extra information about the real-time environment, which can be accessed without a content search. Conversely, virtual reality is predominantly concerned with bringing about a complete shift of the user’s actual ambiances to an entirely fabricated environment that undertakes an independent existence.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> User Control</p>
<p>Speaking on the extent of user control, augmented reality allows you to monitor your real world presence, mostly with a smartphone, while users of virtual reality are entirely controlled by the system, with strictly no self-access. Also, you would require a headset equipment to make use of virtual reality.</p>

While there are manifold varieties of augmented reality usage, the following section highlights the best examples of integrating AR into brand marketing:</p>
<h3 id="01Walmart-Inventory-Control-3"><a href="#01Walmart-Inventory-Control-3" class="headerlink" title="01Walmart- Inventory Control"></a>01Walmart- Inventory Control</h3><p>With the aim to examine the dual credibility of its brand stores as online fulfillment as well as physical shopping centers, Walmart in October 2020, announced the proposition of its 4 shopping units as ‘test centers’ of augmented reality, where the latter was supposed to aid in the management and tracking of company inventories.</p>
<p>The technology was implemented through a smartphone application to quicken the transportation process of item packages from the inventory to the sales area. The utility works when the employees hold a handheld device that highlights the dispatch ready boxes in an <strong>augmented reality stock video</strong>, instead of scanning each box individually.</p>

Based in London, the Machine-A virtual store was conceptualized to allow the access of relevant audience to the works of new talent in the fashion field, when the Covid-19 pandemic caused a shutdown of the London Fashion Week.</p>
<p>The store was launched as a virtual boutique that could be visited by interested audience through a QR code, which could be scanned from billboards and posters around the London city, and allowed them to view the latest works of the associated fashion designers through an <strong>augmented reality concept video</strong>. The major success of the utility lies in the enhancement of the consumer-brand relationship, while focusing primarily on product awareness and customer engagement.</p>
