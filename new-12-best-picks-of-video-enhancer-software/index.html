<p>Filmmakers, YouTubers, and professional videographers use Sony Vegas, a professional video editing software.</p>
<p>Here is a guide on <strong>how to freeze-frame in Sony Vegas</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Download and Import File</strong></p>
<p>Install the app on your device after downloading it. To import your file, open the software, create a new project, then select the Import Media button towards the top left portion of the screen.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-make-sony-vegas-freeze-frame-1.jpg"
                      alt="Download and Import File"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Paste and Copy Video Parts</strong></p>
<p>Drag&#x2F;drop the imported file on the timeline, where you can stretch or zoom it. Now you can either play the video or move and stop the timeline marker where you wish to freeze the frame. After placing the marker, press S on the keyboard to split the video into two pieces. Then, copy and paste.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-make-sony-vegas-freeze-frame-2.jpg"
                      alt="Copy and Paste"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Reduce the Velocity to 0%.</strong></p>
<p>Right-click on the pasted video segment and choose Insert&#x2F;Remove Envelope&gt;Velocity from the context menu. It will draw a light green border around the pasted video segment. Set to 0 percent Velocity by right-clicking on that green box. It will freeze the extra part, making it look like a frozen frame.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Reduce Velocity"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Disconnect the audio</strong></p>
<p>You may also detach audio with Sony Vegas. Select the frozen frame and press U on the keyboard to cut the background audio of the frozen area. Remove the audio segment from the timeline by clicking on it and deleting it. You can pick Delete from the right-click drop-down menu or use the Delete key on your keyboard.</p>
<p>After that, attach the second part.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Disconnect Audio"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Make any necessary changes and save your work.</strong></p>
<p>Finally, choose the frozen frame and customize it with text, effects, and other options. You may also modify the time duration by dragging the edges of the frozen frame. Finally, save the final file to the specified location on your device.</p>
<p>Apart from using the <strong>Sony Vegas Freeze frame,</strong> you can also look at another fantastic video editor like Wondershare Filmora to get the job all done.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Paste and Copy Video Parts</strong></p>
<p>Drag&#x2F;drop the imported file on the timeline, where you can stretch or zoom it. Now you can either play the video or move and stop the timeline marker where you wish to freeze the frame. After placing the marker, press S on the keyboard to split the video into two pieces. Then, copy and paste.</p>
