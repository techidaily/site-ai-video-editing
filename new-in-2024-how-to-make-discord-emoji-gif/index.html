<p>It is a fact that Discord has taken off over the past few years as a go-to social platform available for communities of people with common interests. Whether you are into screenwriting, legal practice, bird-watching, or anime, you can get involved in a Discord server that serves your community and creates <strong>Discord Emoji Gif</strong>.</p>

<p>One of the ways by which Discord provides so much value for all types of communities is its intuitive and robust server customization options. Custom <strong>Discord Gif emojis</strong> are especially useful since communities can use inside jokes, prominent members, and favorite images or GIFs to share with the server as a whole.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Why-Discord-Is-Becoming-Popular-Recently"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Discord-Is-Becoming-Popular-Recently" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Why Discord Is Becoming Popular Recently?"></a>Part 1 Why Discord Is Becoming Popular Recently?</h2><p>Discord has become a viral chatting platform for gamers as many people use it to keep in touch with their family and friends. It made what was initially created for gamers to become something much more. It gives people a communication platform when social interaction through online mediums was not so popular.</p>
<p>First founded in 2015, Discord came intending to be a gamer’s platform to chat and build one another communities. More so, it has become a platform that is more than that and encompasses audiences or communities of different interests and not only gamers.</p>
<p>Discord is now a platform for messaging and allows users to communicate using different channels. This platform can be a less formal version of Slack. Users can write text and send video and voice messages and other forms of rich media such as photos and videos through the platform.</p>
<p>There are a lot of exceptional Discord servers that function as a place to speak about a lot of different things and interact using <strong>Gif discord emoji.</strong> This is like Reddit, where communities get built via forums that create a network experience through shared interests or hobbies. Due to this, it has become easy to discover a niche on Discord as there are a lot of distinct servers that accommodate an extensive range of interests.</p>
<p>Each server is composed of multiple channels, and every channel has its subjects, individual rule set, and interests. Thus, every channel can be valuable to talk about different things:</p>
<p>● You can talk about gaming</p>
<p>● The other can be useful to talk about sports activities, etc.</p>
<p>The possibilities are endless, and the most crucial part is that it is free to create these servers.</p>
<p>The most effective way to discover servers is by simply Googling them because the search feature on the platform only shows the most popular ones.</p>
<p>Discord is a somewhat flexible platform as it works on both desktop and mobile applications. You will connect your YouTube and Spotify accounts to add to your experience.</p>
<p>On top of its versatility, Discord is also very customizable based on a person’s interests and how someone desires to use the platform. Users can have servers that can be either private or public. There is also a position of an administrator, in which they can assign roles to each person, which comes with special privileges and name tags. These roles may benefit various large groups and provide a moderation sense in the server.</p>
<p>Not only does Discord offer group chats, but it also offers a non-public chatting feature which is also available. This allows users to talk one-on-one with other users and turn out to be friends with one another.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Help you get good engagement on your Discord chats:</strong> This is the most important thing to consider in brand growth. The prime goal for every brand is to attract the audience and hold their attention. All you need is to chat content that helps you gain your potential customer’s interest, and sometimes a plain boring text is not enough to do that. Therefore, utilizing emojis in your Discord chats is very beneficial in getting your audience’s attention. Emojis can convey ideas, emotions, and feelings more accurately, and they are also effortless on the eyes. They can also be helpful to add the much-needed buzz that cannot be through word or text.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Helps to save time and effort:</strong> These days, communication tends to be more at a breakneck pace and rapid. The most audience will most likely favor shorter Discord content over longer ones. Many people get tired of your chats o Discord drag on because if your Discord content takes so much effort and time to read or view, your audience might become bored and leave a negative review on your brand. Using emojis on your Discord chats is beneficial because, depending on the type of emoji, you can convey a lot of sense in a shorter time frame than when you are using written text. A perfect example is writing a chat about something very empowering. When you choose to correspond this type of content through text, it could take a little more effort and a bit of intricately used language to build up the reader and get the desired effect of empowering the reader. Emojis are very accurate in passing out the meaning and are shorter than words. That is the primary reason why all-in-all emojis can save effort and time to create your Discord chat.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>It can represent a meaning or idea accurately</strong>: Many emojis have a much better effect in a sense than text because a lot of abstract content can be easily understood using images than text.</p>

<h2 id="Part-2-Tips-for-a-Great-Slideshow-Video"><a href="#Part-2-Tips-for-a-Great-Slideshow-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Tips for a Great Slideshow Video"></a>Part 2 Tips for a Great Slideshow Video</h2><p>Videos are gaining much popularity these days. It is an easy way to connect with people and show emotions to them. In the same way, slideshow videos also are important in their place. Slides are the collection of traditional photos or negatives which are out of trend now. And slideshow videos are the perfect way to use those slides and relieve those faded memories with loved ones. Creating the slideshow video is also easy and can be done easily with the help of some tools. You don’t need to be professional, but the only need is to follow certain tips carefully. Here, we are sharing the essential tips to prepare a great slideshow video. Also, you will get to know about the best tool for video creation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Tell a story</strong></p>
<p>Prepare the slideshow video in the form of storytelling. Whatever is the theme of your slideshow, prepare the script of the video right from the start. Make a meaningful and impressive story. Select and collect the raw materials according to the requirement.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Keep it cohesive</strong></p>
<p>The cohesion of photos or images is very important in a video slideshow. It is advised not to mix and match still photos and videos in 1 slideshow. Also, choose the photos belonging to the same color family. Mixing different varieties of photos divert the attention of the viewer. Also, one warm photo, then one cool and so on are not the efficient choices for a slideshow. All the images should appear as part of one color family and are similar to one another. Always maintain the quality of photos throughout the slideshow. Gradual jumps between grainy portrait mode photos and some screenshots, meanwhile photos of other modes lead to distracting the viewer and blurring their experience.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Make it personal</strong></p>
<p>Video slideshows are a powerful tool to show your personality and your personal message. The videos should contain your feelings. So, customize them and make them as personal as you can. Give your uniqueness to your slideshows. For this, you can customize the color palette, text, etc and make them unique and personal. So that the people with whom you share the videos may also feel your touch.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Keep slideshow videos short</strong></p>
<p>There might be different aims for creating a slideshow video. You might want to share it with loved ones or any of your friends’ circle. Or you might be wanting it to post as an ad on social media platforms such as Instagram, or Facebook. Whatever the purpose of your making the video, keep them concise and short. Short video clips are best for grabbing the attention of the viewers. Everyone does not find it interesting to watch long-form videos. If you are aiming to make a longer-form video slideshow which contains both images and video clips, then keep each photo for 3 to 5 seconds and each video clip a maximum of 20 seconds. It is recommended to maintain the user’s interest throughout.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Create a storyboard to plan your slideshow video</strong></p>
<p>As we have already discussed in the above point, the video should depict your story. Also, it should be in sync to make it more compelling. Creating a storyboard or outline is the perfect way to predict the right flow as well as choose the right elements for the video.</p>
<p>The storyboard helps to prepare a plan and develop the logical sequence of the photos. Also, if you want to add photos, video clips, texts, etc in a single slideshow, the storyboard can help to outline the sequence. With this, you will be able to create a video that will be logically correct.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Add text to videos and images to convey your message clearly</strong></p>
<p>Text or captions are very crucial to be added to the slideshow especially if you are preparing them for social media. People these days do watch the videos by keeping the sound off on social media. So, they will not be able to get your message without captions. Keep all your key messages highlighted in the video. The first few seconds of the video play an important role. It is the deciding factor whether the viewer will watch the whole video or will just bounce back. So, give a captivating hook to the slideshow to capture the viewer’s attention and make them hit the unmute button.</p>

It is an easy way to connect with people and show emotions to them. In the same way, slideshow videos also are important in their place. Slides are the collection of traditional photos or negatives which are out of trend now. And slideshow videos are the perfect way to use those slides and relieve those faded memories with loved ones. Creating the slideshow video is also easy and can be done easily with the help of some tools. You don’t need to be professional, but the only need is to follow certain tips carefully. Here, we are sharing the essential tips to prepare a great slideshow video. Also, you will get to know about the best tool for video creation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Tell a story</strong></p>
<p>Prepare the slideshow video in the form of storytelling. Whatever is the theme of your slideshow, prepare the script of the video right from the start. Make a meaningful and impressive story. Select and collect the raw materials according to the requirement.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Keep it cohesive</strong></p>
<p>The cohesion of photos or images is very important in a video slideshow. It is advised not to mix and match still photos and videos in 1 slideshow. Also, choose the photos belonging to the same color family. Mixing different varieties of photos divert the attention of the viewer. Also, one warm photo, then one cool and so on are not the efficient choices for a slideshow. All the images should appear as part of one color family and are similar to one another. Always maintain the quality of photos throughout the slideshow. Gradual jumps between grainy portrait mode photos and some screenshots, meanwhile photos of other modes lead to distracting the viewer and blurring their experience.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Make it personal</strong></p>
<p>Video slideshows are a powerful tool to show your personality and your personal message. The videos should contain your feelings. So, customize them and make them as personal as you can. Give your uniqueness to your slideshows. For this, you can customize the color palette, text, etc and make them unique and personal. So that the people with whom you share the videos may also feel your touch.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Keep slideshow videos short</strong></p>
<p>There might be different aims for creating a slideshow video. You might want to share it with loved ones or any of your friends’ circle. Or you might be wanting it to post as an ad on social media platforms such as Instagram, or Facebook. Whatever the purpose of your making the video, keep them concise and short. Short video clips are best for grabbing the attention of the viewers. Everyone does not find it interesting to watch long-form videos. If you are aiming to make a longer-form video slideshow which contains both images and video clips, then keep each photo for 3 to 5 seconds and each video clip a maximum of 20 seconds. It is recommended to maintain the user’s interest throughout.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Create a storyboard to plan your slideshow video</strong></p>
<p>As we have already discussed in the above point, the video should depict your story. Also, it should be in sync to make it more compelling. Creating a storyboard or outline is the perfect way to predict the right flow as well as choose the right elements for the video.</p>
<p>The storyboard helps to prepare a plan and develop the logical sequence of the photos. Also, if you want to add photos, video clips, texts, etc in a single slideshow, the storyboard can help to outline the sequence. With this, you will be able to create a video that will be logically correct.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Add text to videos and images to convey your message clearly</strong></p>
<p>Text or captions are very crucial to be added to the slideshow especially if you are preparing them for social media. People these days do watch the videos by keeping the sound off on social media. So, they will not be able to get your message without captions. Keep all your key messages highlighted in the video. The first few seconds of the video play an important role. It is the deciding factor whether the viewer will watch the whole video or will just bounce back. So, give a captivating hook to the slideshow to capture the viewer’s attention and make them hit the unmute button.</p>

<h2 id="Part-2-Tips-for-a-Great-Slideshow-Video-3"><a href="#Part-2-Tips-for-a-Great-Slideshow-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Tips for a Great Slideshow Video"></a>Part 2 Tips for a Great Slideshow Video</h2><p>Videos are gaining much popularity these days. It is an easy way to connect with people and show emotions to them. In the same way, slideshow videos also are important in their place. Slides are the collection of traditional photos or negatives which are out of trend now. And slideshow videos are the perfect way to use those slides and relieve those faded memories with loved ones. Creating the slideshow video is also easy and can be done easily with the help of some tools. You don’t need to be professional, but the only need is to follow certain tips carefully. Here, we are sharing the essential tips to prepare a great slideshow video. Also, you will get to know about the best tool for video creation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Tell a story</strong></p>
<p>Prepare the slideshow video in the form of storytelling. Whatever is the theme of your slideshow, prepare the script of the video right from the start. Make a meaningful and impressive story. Select and collect the raw materials according to the requirement.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Keep it cohesive</strong></p>
<p>The cohesion of photos or images is very important in a video slideshow. It is advised not to mix and match still photos and videos in 1 slideshow. Also, choose the photos belonging to the same color family. Mixing different varieties of photos divert the attention of the viewer. Also, one warm photo, then one cool and so on are not the efficient choices for a slideshow. All the images should appear as part of one color family and are similar to one another. Always maintain the quality of photos throughout the slideshow. Gradual jumps between grainy portrait mode photos and some screenshots, meanwhile photos of other modes lead to distracting the viewer and blurring their experience.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Make it personal</strong></p>
<p>Video slideshows are a powerful tool to show your personality and your personal message. The videos should contain your feelings. So, customize them and make them as personal as you can. Give your uniqueness to your slideshows. For this, you can customize the color palette, text, etc and make them unique and personal. So that the people with whom you share the videos may also feel your touch.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Keep slideshow videos short</strong></p>
<p>There might be different aims for creating a slideshow video. You might want to share it with loved ones or any of your friends’ circle. Or you might be wanting it to post as an ad on social media platforms such as Instagram, or Facebook. Whatever the purpose of your making the video, keep them concise and short. Short video clips are best for grabbing the attention of the viewers. Everyone does not find it interesting to watch long-form videos. If you are aiming to make a longer-form video slideshow which contains both images and video clips, then keep each photo for 3 to 5 seconds and each video clip a maximum of 20 seconds. It is recommended to maintain the user’s interest throughout.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Create a storyboard to plan your slideshow video</strong></p>
<p>As we have already discussed in the above point, the video should depict your story. Also, it should be in sync to make it more compelling. Creating a storyboard or outline is the perfect way to predict the right flow as well as choose the right elements for the video.</p>
<p>The storyboard helps to prepare a plan and develop the logical sequence of the photos. Also, if you want to add photos, video clips, texts, etc in a single slideshow, the storyboard can help to outline the sequence. With this, you will be able to create a video that will be logically correct.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Add text to videos and images to convey your message clearly</strong></p>
<p>Text or captions are very crucial to be added to the slideshow especially if you are preparing them for social media. People these days do watch the videos by keeping the sound off on social media. So, they will not be able to get your message without captions. Keep all your key messages highlighted in the video. The first few seconds of the video play an important role. It is the deciding factor whether the viewer will watch the whole video or will just bounce back. So, give a captivating hook to the slideshow to capture the viewer’s attention and make them hit the unmute button.</p>
