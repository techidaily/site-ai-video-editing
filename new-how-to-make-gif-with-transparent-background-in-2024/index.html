When it is about editing GIFs, you are free to experiment with limitless creativity. While making GIFs from videos is quite a common edit, something that gains attraction is, turning dull videos into classic, <strong>transparent GIFs</strong>.</p>
<p>Still wondering on this to be a possibility? Rest assured, because it is certainly a ‘Yes’. You can very conveniently create a <strong>transparent GIF</strong> from your videos without a hustle. All you need to do is just a background shuffle. While you can do this with almost any GIF editing software available across the web, here’s how you can take up the process using the Egif video converter tool:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Convert a Video to GIF</strong></p>
<p>Using Egif, first of all convert a desired video into GIF. Take caution to manually remove backgrounds from all video frames and save the GIF using .gif or .png file extensions. Don’t use .jpg extension; else you will end up losing background transparency.</p>
<p>In case of a solid color GIF background, navigate to Egif’s ‘Effects Tool’ and click on ‘Replace Color with Transparency’.</p>

                      alt="Original GIF with White Background"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Color Selection</strong></p>
<p>Make a desired color selection that you wish to replace with transparent pixels. Select ‘White’ for a black and white GIF background. In case of color backgrounds, open any suitable picture editor (GIMP, MS Paint, etc.) and choose the hex color code using the ‘Color Picker’ tool.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/How-to-make-a-GIF-with-transparent-background-2.JPG"
                      alt="Background Options"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/How-to-make-a-GIF-with-transparent-background-3.JPG"
                      alt="Processed GIF with Transparent Background"
                ></p>
<p>This tool however, has compatibility limitations and can replace only a restricted number of color backgrounds, which too should not match the color scheme of foreground objects that you wish to restore in your GIF. If you require partially transparent backgrounds within specific portions of complex animated creations, you can use the ‘GIF Maker’ tool to selectively split and edit every clip frame, apply the transparency effect and finally merge all such clips together.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Can-Parts-of-GIF-Be-Made-Semi-Transparent"><a href="#Part-2-Can-Parts-of-GIF-Be-Made-Semi-Transparent" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Can Parts of GIF Be Made Semi-Transparent?"></a>Part 2 Can Parts of GIF Be Made Semi-Transparent?</h2><p>No matter how much disappointing it appears, you can never introduce semi-transparent backgrounds in your GIFs. This is due to the fact that the GIF format has a limitation on pixel appearances. This basically means that you can only have completely opaque or completely transparent GIF backgrounds, strictly permitting nothing in between. Hence, it is a regret to conclude that you can literally never add anti-aliasing effects to your GIF backgrounds.</p>
<p>This may be a little disapproving though, but thanks to revolutions in technology, you can live up to the hope that creating semi-transparent GIFs would not be a forever tussle. You never know when the trick strikes IT engineers, and you may possibly be reading an article on interesting ways of creating semi-transparent GIFs in future!</p>

When it is about editing GIFs, you are free to experiment with limitless creativity. While making GIFs from videos is quite a common edit, something that gains attraction is, turning dull videos into classic, <strong>transparent GIFs</strong>.</p>
<p>Still wondering on this to be a possibility? Rest assured, because it is certainly a ‘Yes’. You can very conveniently create a <strong>transparent GIF</strong> from your videos without a hustle. All you need to do is just a background shuffle. While you can do this with almost any GIF editing software available across the web, here’s how you can take up the process using the Egif video converter tool:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Convert a Video to GIF</strong></p>
<p>Using Egif, first of all convert a desired video into GIF. Take caution to manually remove backgrounds from all video frames and save the GIF using .gif or .png file extensions. Don’t use .jpg extension; else you will end up losing background transparency.</p>
<p>In case of a solid color GIF background, navigate to Egif’s ‘Effects Tool’ and click on ‘Replace Color with Transparency’.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Original GIF with White Background"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Color Selection</strong></p>
<p>Make a desired color selection that you wish to replace with transparent pixels. Select ‘White’ for a black and white GIF background. In case of color backgrounds, open any suitable picture editor (GIMP, MS Paint, etc.) and choose the hex color code using the ‘Color Picker’ tool.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/How-to-make-a-GIF-with-transparent-background-2.JPG"
                      alt="Background Options"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/How-to-make-a-GIF-with-transparent-background-3.JPG"
                      alt="Processed GIF with Transparent Background"
                ></p>
<p>This tool however, has compatibility limitations and can replace only a restricted number of color backgrounds, which too should not match the color scheme of foreground objects that you wish to restore in your GIF. If you require partially transparent backgrounds within specific portions of complex animated creations, you can use the ‘GIF Maker’ tool to selectively split and edit every clip frame, apply the transparency effect and finally merge all such clips together.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Can-Parts-of-GIF-Be-Made-Semi-Transparent-1"><a href="#Part-2-Can-Parts-of-GIF-Be-Made-Semi-Transparent-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Can Parts of GIF Be Made Semi-Transparent?"></a>Part 2 Can Parts of GIF Be Made Semi-Transparent?</h2><p>No matter how much disappointing it appears, you can never introduce semi-transparent backgrounds in your GIFs. This is due to the fact that the GIF format has a limitation on pixel appearances. This basically means that you can only have completely opaque or completely transparent GIF backgrounds, strictly permitting nothing in between. Hence, it is a regret to conclude that you can literally never add anti-aliasing effects to your GIF backgrounds.</p>
<p>This may be a little disapproving though, but thanks to revolutions in technology, you can live up to the hope that creating semi-transparent GIFs would not be a forever tussle. You never know when the trick strikes IT engineers, and you may possibly be reading an article on interesting ways of creating semi-transparent GIFs in future!</p>

<h2 id="Part1-Basic-Knowledge-About-Different-Framing"><a href="#Part1-Basic-Knowledge-About-Different-Framing" class="headerlink" title="Part1 Basic Knowledge About Different Framing"></a>Part1 Basic Knowledge About Different Framing</h2><p>Because framing is related to capturing or focusing an object by the camera lens, it can vary depending on your desired shot. Let’s start with the full-shot first and understand how it works.</p>
<h3 id="01-Full-Shot-FS"><a href="#01-Full-Shot-FS" class="headerlink" title="01 Full Shot (FS)"></a>01 Full Shot (FS)</h3><p>Remember the shot of Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy, where all the players are focused in one wide frame? This excerpt is a practical example of what a full shot looks like. Full-shot video framing is particularly common in action or thriller movies where the creator wants to generate suspense in the audience.</p>
<p>As the name indicates, a full shot often emphasizes the scenery as your subject fills the frame. Like the background isn’t ignored or blurred out; instead, it isn’t overly stressed as well. In most cases, the camera starts with a wide-angle shot and then eventually ends with focusing on the subject.</p>
<p>A full-camera shot greatly emphasizes the physical presence of the character. It tracks the subject’s movements, gestures, or body language, making it the focal point. As a result, the shot obtained delivers a better understanding of actions and interactions among the character and its surroundings.</p>
<h3 id="02-Medium-Shot-MS"><a href="#02-Medium-Shot-MS" class="headerlink" title="02 Medium Shot (MS)"></a>02 Medium Shot (MS)</h3><p>We often see friends in movies, going to a casino, or playing cards at a bar. What do we observe in that shot? Hand movements, facial expressions, body language, and a little context of what is happening in the background. This shot is known as the medium shot and is often called the ¾ shot.</p>
<p>Using the medium shot video framing technique, the camera lens allows the viewers to see the background while still focusing on the main character. It’s like you will know what is happening at the back but still remain close to the character’s emotions and gestures.</p>
<p>A medium shot usually begins by showing the subject from the knees to his face. In other cases, the shot can also start from the character’s waist to the top of their head. Compared to long shots, a medium shot takes you closer to the subject’s emotions.</p>
<p>For example, in The Princess Diary, you can see how medium-shot video framing has been useful in portraying comedic scenes. You can see Mia reaching out for plates and glasses around the tables and her eyes squinting to concentrate on the process. The medium shot captures even the smallest emotions while focusing on the background.</p>
<h3 id="03-Close-Up-CU"><a href="#03-Close-Up-CU" class="headerlink" title="03 Close-Up (CU)"></a>03 Close-Up (CU)</h3><p>When the subject’s head and face take up most of the frame, framing videos is known as a close-up shot. And a particular example of this shot can be spotted in the airport scene in “Casablanca.” This scene shows how the camera lens takes various shots before ending up on the actor’s face, showcasing a number of emotions and intimacy.</p>
<p>A close-up shot is an eye-level shot, and as a result, it takes the subject to the forefront. As a result, this shot establishes a distinct sense of connection between the audience and the character. Additionally, the environmental distraction is kept minimal throughout this shot. This setup helps maintain the emotional impact that the shot will portray.</p>
<p>Some of the common emotions that would be captured using close-up video framing techniques include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tear-filled gaze</li>
<li>Furrowed brow</li>
<li>Subtle smile</li>
</ul>
<p>Cinematographers often use such shots to intensify climaxes. These shots can be viewed as a window to the characters’ souls, allowing viewers to adapt the emotions on another level.</p>
<h3 id="04-Extreme-Close-Up-XCU"><a href="#04-Extreme-Close-Up-XCU" class="headerlink" title="04 Extreme Close-Up (XCU)"></a>04 Extreme Close-Up (XCU)</h3><p>To understand the extreme close-up video framing technique, let us illustrate the movie that remained our favorite action thriller while growing up: Minority Report (2002). In this movie, the shots briefly focus on the character’s eyes before hopping into the future view. This extreme close shot serves as a crucial plot to develop thematic elements in the audience.</p>
<p>So, an extremely close shot focuses on specific details of a character. This can be either the subject’s eyes, ears, or mouth. However, the shot is not often employed casually. Instead, it is used in a stance where it is appropriate and when there is a need to develop heightened emotion among the viewers.</p>
<p>You can see this shot as a magnifying glass that draws attention to even the smallest emotion that would have gone unnoticed otherwise.</p>
<h2 id="Part2-Master-framing-types"><a href="#Part2-Master-framing-types" class="headerlink" title="Part2 Master framing types"></a>Part2 Master framing types</h2><p>Don’t know how to master framing types? No worries, we have a comprehensive guide on that! First of all, let’s start with the most basic way to frame a video:</p>
<h3 id="01-Establishing-Shots"><a href="#01-Establishing-Shots" class="headerlink" title="01 Establishing Shots"></a>01 Establishing Shots</h3><p>An establishing shot is usually used to develop a context for the next upcoming scene. It is often a movie’s first scene and portrays an extremely wide shot of the context. This frame on the video indicates the location and time of the scene to the audience to engage with them on a deeper level.</p>
<p>One of the least-known things about an establishing shot is that it doesn’t require a narrative to explain what is happening. Instead, it is shot alone, and the context is shot so that the audience gets to know everything as soon as they see the excerpt.</p>
<p>An amazing example of establishing a shot can be seen in Stanely Kubrick’s horror film, The Shining. In the movie’s opening scene, the camera goes through the forest and mountains before getting onto the mountaintop hotel where the action occurs.</p>
<h3 id="02-Single-Shot"><a href="#02-Single-Shot" class="headerlink" title="02 Single Shot"></a>02 Single Shot</h3><p>A single shot frames a video that includes a single subject or character. It occurs when a character is talking or reacting to a scenario. Here, remember that if the lens shifts focus from a subject, it is not a single shot.</p>
<p>In the movie Extraction 2020, you can see a single shot being utilized when the character goes on to rescue his son from the kidnappers. The shot extends a long way, including through a car crash, weapon chasing, and that iconic Hemsworth sliding off a building into a brutal fight. And the incredible part was that all of this was captured in a single shot.</p>
<h3 id="03-Two-Shot-Group-Shot"><a href="#03-Two-Shot-Group-Shot" class="headerlink" title="03 Two Shot&#x2F;Group Shot"></a>03 Two Shot&#x2F;Group Shot</h3><p>As the name indicates, a two-shot or a group shot is used to frame a video that involves more than one character. It could be two people conversing or friends sitting at a cafe gossiping. This shot is particularly helpful in portraying the relationship between the characters in the frame.</p>
<p>A good example of two-shot video framing can be seen in the movie Silverado. During the final shooting scene, you can see two cowboys standing far apart while facing each other. Here, the two-shot technique emphasizes tension before the cowboys draw their guns.</p>
<h3 id="04-Over-the-shoulder-OTS"><a href="#04-Over-the-shoulder-OTS" class="headerlink" title="04 Over-the-shoulder (OTS)"></a>04 Over-the-shoulder (OTS)</h3><p>OTS, or Over-the-shoulder, is the most used shot in framing videos for making movies. To understand how this shot works, let us take an example of two subjects, one named A and the other named B. Now, A is sitting right in front of subject B. Here; the shot is executed by focusing on subject A from the shoulder of subject B. The basic purpose of the shot is to fill the conversation or the meeting between the subjects.</p>
<p>To understand this situation better, let’s take an example from the movie How to Train Your Dragon. In the scene, Hiccup is seen having a conversation with his father. Here, when Hiccup is talking, the camera is focused on him over his father’s shoulder. And when his father talks, the shot is taken over the shoulder of Hiccup.</p>
<h3 id="05-Insert-Shot"><a href="#05-Insert-Shot" class="headerlink" title="05 Insert Shot"></a>05 Insert Shot</h3><p>Insert short framing technique uses selective focus to draw the audience’s attention to the subject. Whether it be an object or merely a piece of information, insert shot has always been effective in emphasizing details.</p>
<p>For example, in The X-Files, an insert shot is used to provide the audience with a look at the file of Scully. This insert shot reveals the most shocking revelations in the file, including a tissue sample. Additionally, the file insert shot also shows how shady Mulder is.</p>
<h3 id="06-POV-Shot"><a href="#06-POV-Shot" class="headerlink" title="06 POV Shot"></a>06 POV Shot</h3><p>A POV shot is used to frame a video in a way that shows what a character is doing. You can take this as a shot showing the world from the character’s perspective. Our modern-day games, including Call of Duty Black Ops, are a common example of such POV shots.</p>
<p>The movie Friday the 13th is an iconic example of a POV shot frame on video. If you remember, the movie revolved around a killer who wasn’t identified until the end. So, the audience watched the film from the killer’s perspective until he was recognized.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>To sum it up, mastering the art of video framing, from full shots to POV shots, is an exciting journey that helps you to weave exciting stories. Understanding these techniques will empower you to craft a compelling narrative to captivate your audience, whether you are a beginner or a professional.</p>
<p>So, begin with framing videos now and let your work speak volumes!</p>

<h3 id="03-Close-Up-CU-1"><a href="#03-Close-Up-CU-1" class="headerlink" title="03 Close-Up (CU)"></a>03 Close-Up (CU)</h3><p>When the subject’s head and face take up most of the frame, framing videos is known as a close-up shot. And a particular example of this shot can be spotted in the airport scene in “Casablanca.” This scene shows how the camera lens takes various shots before ending up on the actor’s face, showcasing a number of emotions and intimacy.</p>
<p>A close-up shot is an eye-level shot, and as a result, it takes the subject to the forefront. As a result, this shot establishes a distinct sense of connection between the audience and the character. Additionally, the environmental distraction is kept minimal throughout this shot. This setup helps maintain the emotional impact that the shot will portray.</p>
<p>Some of the common emotions that would be captured using close-up video framing techniques include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tear-filled gaze</li>
<li>Furrowed brow</li>
<li>Subtle smile</li>
</ul>
<p>Cinematographers often use such shots to intensify climaxes. These shots can be viewed as a window to the characters’ souls, allowing viewers to adapt the emotions on another level.</p>
<h3 id="04-Extreme-Close-Up-XCU-1"><a href="#04-Extreme-Close-Up-XCU-1" class="headerlink" title="04 Extreme Close-Up (XCU)"></a>04 Extreme Close-Up (XCU)</h3><p>To understand the extreme close-up video framing technique, let us illustrate the movie that remained our favorite action thriller while growing up: Minority Report (2002). In this movie, the shots briefly focus on the character’s eyes before hopping into the future view. This extreme close shot serves as a crucial plot to develop thematic elements in the audience.</p>
<p>So, an extremely close shot focuses on specific details of a character. This can be either the subject’s eyes, ears, or mouth. However, the shot is not often employed casually. Instead, it is used in a stance where it is appropriate and when there is a need to develop heightened emotion among the viewers.</p>
<p>You can see this shot as a magnifying glass that draws attention to even the smallest emotion that would have gone unnoticed otherwise.</p>
<h2 id="Part2-Master-framing-types-1"><a href="#Part2-Master-framing-types-1" class="headerlink" title="Part2 Master framing types"></a>Part2 Master framing types</h2><p>Don’t know how to master framing types? No worries, we have a comprehensive guide on that! First of all, let’s start with the most basic way to frame a video:</p>
<h3 id="01-Establishing-Shots-1"><a href="#01-Establishing-Shots-1" class="headerlink" title="01 Establishing Shots"></a>01 Establishing Shots</h3><p>An establishing shot is usually used to develop a context for the next upcoming scene. It is often a movie’s first scene and portrays an extremely wide shot of the context. This frame on the video indicates the location and time of the scene to the audience to engage with them on a deeper level.</p>
<p>One of the least-known things about an establishing shot is that it doesn’t require a narrative to explain what is happening. Instead, it is shot alone, and the context is shot so that the audience gets to know everything as soon as they see the excerpt.</p>
<p>An amazing example of establishing a shot can be seen in Stanely Kubrick’s horror film, The Shining. In the movie’s opening scene, the camera goes through the forest and mountains before getting onto the mountaintop hotel where the action occurs.</p>
<h3 id="02-Single-Shot-1"><a href="#02-Single-Shot-1" class="headerlink" title="02 Single Shot"></a>02 Single Shot</h3><p>A single shot frames a video that includes a single subject or character. It occurs when a character is talking or reacting to a scenario. Here, remember that if the lens shifts focus from a subject, it is not a single shot.</p>
<p>In the movie Extraction 2020, you can see a single shot being utilized when the character goes on to rescue his son from the kidnappers. The shot extends a long way, including through a car crash, weapon chasing, and that iconic Hemsworth sliding off a building into a brutal fight. And the incredible part was that all of this was captured in a single shot.</p>
<h3 id="03-Two-Shot-Group-Shot-1"><a href="#03-Two-Shot-Group-Shot-1" class="headerlink" title="03 Two Shot&#x2F;Group Shot"></a>03 Two Shot&#x2F;Group Shot</h3><p>As the name indicates, a two-shot or a group shot is used to frame a video that involves more than one character. It could be two people conversing or friends sitting at a cafe gossiping. This shot is particularly helpful in portraying the relationship between the characters in the frame.</p>
<p>A good example of two-shot video framing can be seen in the movie Silverado. During the final shooting scene, you can see two cowboys standing far apart while facing each other. Here, the two-shot technique emphasizes tension before the cowboys draw their guns.</p>
<h3 id="04-Over-the-shoulder-OTS-1"><a href="#04-Over-the-shoulder-OTS-1" class="headerlink" title="04 Over-the-shoulder (OTS)"></a>04 Over-the-shoulder (OTS)</h3><p>OTS, or Over-the-shoulder, is the most used shot in framing videos for making movies. To understand how this shot works, let us take an example of two subjects, one named A and the other named B. Now, A is sitting right in front of subject B. Here; the shot is executed by focusing on subject A from the shoulder of subject B. The basic purpose of the shot is to fill the conversation or the meeting between the subjects.</p>
<p>To understand this situation better, let’s take an example from the movie How to Train Your Dragon. In the scene, Hiccup is seen having a conversation with his father. Here, when Hiccup is talking, the camera is focused on him over his father’s shoulder. And when his father talks, the shot is taken over the shoulder of Hiccup.</p>
<h3 id="05-Insert-Shot-1"><a href="#05-Insert-Shot-1" class="headerlink" title="05 Insert Shot"></a>05 Insert Shot</h3><p>Insert short framing technique uses selective focus to draw the audience’s attention to the subject. Whether it be an object or merely a piece of information, insert shot has always been effective in emphasizing details.</p>
<p>For example, in The X-Files, an insert shot is used to provide the audience with a look at the file of Scully. This insert shot reveals the most shocking revelations in the file, including a tissue sample. Additionally, the file insert shot also shows how shady Mulder is.</p>
<h3 id="06-POV-Shot-1"><a href="#06-POV-Shot-1" class="headerlink" title="06 POV Shot"></a>06 POV Shot</h3><p>A POV shot is used to frame a video in a way that shows what a character is doing. You can take this as a shot showing the world from the character’s perspective. Our modern-day games, including Call of Duty Black Ops, are a common example of such POV shots.</p>
<p>The movie Friday the 13th is an iconic example of a POV shot frame on video. If you remember, the movie revolved around a killer who wasn’t identified until the end. So, the audience watched the film from the killer’s perspective until he was recognized.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>To sum it up, mastering the art of video framing, from full shots to POV shots, is an exciting journey that helps you to weave exciting stories. Understanding these techniques will empower you to craft a compelling narrative to captivate your audience, whether you are a beginner or a professional.</p>
<p>So, begin with framing videos now and let your work speak volumes!</p>

But to get to the end, there are several steps involved in the production process, and not every instance of it is perfect. But we all know, editing does often help iron out any kinks, with its ability to solve basic problems, like footage that is askew, or upside down. Thus with the steps listed in this article we will help you understand how you can rotate videos to ensure your edited project looks as intended.</p>
<p>This particular article considers the pre-installed Windows Media Player and WonderShare Filmora.</p>
<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> <em>We documented the steps in this guide with Windows Media Player</em> <em>(on a device running Windows 10</em> <em>) and WonderShare Filmora.</em></p>
<h2 id="How-to-Rotate-Videos-with-Windows-Media-Player"><a href="#How-to-Rotate-Videos-with-Windows-Media-Player" class="headerlink" title="How to Rotate Videos with Windows Media Player?"></a>How to Rotate Videos with Windows Media Player?</h2><p>Imagine you’re in a situation where you have gone ahead and finished the filming portion of a project on your smartphone but realise that the capture footage is upside down. Fortunately, this sort of a scenario is a common occurrence and it has quite a simple fix. If you look around the gallery app on your phone, you should be able to rotate the footage there itself, but if you’ve already moved it over to your laptop, hopping into a video editor can get this done in a jiffy.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, if you were planning to do this with the pre-installed Windows Media Player, <em>you will not be able to rotate the clip</em>. The software is only capable of being used as a Media Player that can help keep track of stored videos in a neat and easy to view format. It also has the ability to burn inserted discs, although we doubt any modern laptop comes with a disc drive.</p>
<p>Hence, to rotate video and still ensure its compatible with Windows Media Player, you can use free tools like VLC Media Player or Wondershare Filmora. The steps on how to use Wondershare Filmora to rotate video clips have been elaborated ahead in this article.</p>
<h3 id="TIPS-FOR-WINDOWS-MEDIA-PLAYER"><a href="#TIPS-FOR-WINDOWS-MEDIA-PLAYER" class="headerlink" title="TIPS FOR WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER"></a><strong>TIPS FOR WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER</strong></h3><p>In case you want to use Windows Media Player as your default software to manage stored content, read this section to understand how you can control displayed video libraries.</p>
<p>While Windows Media Player will pull all compatible files present in the Default Video Library, you can customise the information made available by using the Organises Function.</p>
<p>To configure the Videos Section to display specific content follow the steps listed below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on Organize.</li>
<li>Then move onto Manage Libraries</li>
<li>Now click on Videos.</li>

Sometimes, even though the video has informative content, the content might not be attractive to the viewers for various reasons, like the content might be routine and does not have more reach, likes, or shares. Along with good content, we also need new and creative ideas to get more viewers. Thus, we have some tools to provide unique and innovative ideas based on the niche you choose.</p>
<p>Videos Idea Generator is a tool that gives ideas for YouTube videos, and it works based on AI technology (Neural Networks). This tool will be more beneficial for the content creators to get more <strong>AI video ideas</strong>. Naturally, you might be out of ideas for your channel, or sometimes it takes more time to get an idea, or it could be a routine idea that does not sound interesting to the viewers. In such cases, <strong>an AI video idea generator</strong> is more helpful in suggesting new and innovative ideas for the content creators based on their interesting topics.</p>
<p>Some of the advantages of a video idea generator are:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Time-saving – as one can utilize the time in other work, such as editing the video&#x2F; adding subtitles, etc., instead of thinking of an idea.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Engaging with the audience – can utilize the time in engaging with the audience by answering their questions.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Promote videos – can utilize time to promote their videos on other social media platforms or collaborate with other content creators for promotions.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Add animations – animations and other visual effects can be added to the videos using AI. Also, we can add video and audio summaries after each video so that the viewers can get brief detailing of the whole video.</p>
<p><strong>How to use Videos Idea Generator:</strong></p>
<p>There are different <strong>AI video idea generator</strong> tools, and most of them work similarly. The most common steps are:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Provide Topic</strong></p>
<p>Here you need to provide the topic’s name on which we are planning to create the video.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Provide Keywords</strong></p>
<p>After providing a topic, give the keywords required for publishing. The video needs to have all the keywords so that the main content of the video can project adequately.</p>
<p>Based on the topic name and keywords, the tool will generate suggestions for the video ideas using the Neural Network concept of Artificial Learning.</p>

Once you get clarity on the area of interest, it’s easy to pick a topic from that and create an innovative video. Try to be more specific in the topic you choose. Also, have clarity on the section of audience you want to target.</p>
<p>For example, if your topic is more related to children, add more animations of animals&#x2F; cartoons that interest children. If you choose a related topic, do not add more animations that might confuse the audience. Add more reference links so that they can refer to those and be more particular on the specific topic you are trying to explain through the video. Similarly, if you choose a gaming-related topic, do not be more general about gaming.</p>
