Safety and privacy aspects are some of them. If you’re looking to blur out a bystander or cut out profanities from your video with Filmora, this is the right article for you.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-add-a-beep-sound-to-a-video-with-Filmora"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-add-a-beep-sound-to-a-video-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

You can censor any part of speech you want to exclude from your video with just these simple steps.</p>
<p>Step1 Create a new project and import the video to Filmora.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="import the video to filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Separate the audio component from the video by right-clicking on the video and selecting the Detach Audio option. You can now edit each of them individually.</p>

<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="find the mosaic effect from the effects library"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Drag the Mosaic filter to the timeline just above the main video track.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="drag the mosaic effect to timeline"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 A yellow box will appear in the viewer. You can drag and adjust its size to hide the targetted object. You can also adjust the opacity and intensity of the effect using the adjustment menu, accessible when you double-click the yellow box.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="adjust the mosaic effect"
                ></p>
<p>If the targetted object moves, you can set the automatic tracking before adding the mosaic filter by clicking on the <strong>Motion Tracking</strong>&gt;<strong>Start Tracking</strong> located above the timeline. Before you place the filter, preview and adjust the tracking frame to ensure tight proof censor.</p>
