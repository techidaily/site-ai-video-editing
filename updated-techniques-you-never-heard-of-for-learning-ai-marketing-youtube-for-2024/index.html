<h3 id="01Automatic-Removal-of-Inappropriate-Content"><a href="#01Automatic-Removal-of-Inappropriate-Content" class="headerlink" title="01Automatic Removal of Inappropriate Content"></a>01Automatic Removal of Inappropriate Content</h3><p>One of the main applications of <strong>AI on YouTube</strong> is to remove inappropriate content automatically. YouTube uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to remove the violative and inappropriate content from the platform. As this content was one of the main reasons for the rise in racism and terrorism. To avoid all these harmful after effects, YouTube introduced the “Trashy Video Classifier” to scan and examine the feedback.</p>
<p>Although these algorithms might not be 100% accurate, they can perform the task more easily and efficiently than the manual examination of the content. Due to these algorithms, it has become easier to automatically remove the controversial content from the platform immediately. AI aided feature helps in determining the inappropriate content faster. However, it doesn’t provide 100% accurate results. This is the reason why YouTube has a large team of human specialists to check the accuracy of determining violative content.</p>
<h3 id="02Add-New-Video-Effects"><a href="#02Add-New-Video-Effects" class="headerlink" title="02Add New Video Effects"></a>02Add New Video Effects</h3><p>The introduction of artificial intelligence and machine learning in the market has made it easier to add new video effects without the use of any external equipment. You can now swap out backgrounds from videos with just one click due to the in-built AI features on YouTube. This AI neural feature is prepared by <strong>Google’s AI YouTube</strong> researchers to make it easier for the AI algorithms to understand video patterns. This feature makes it easier for the system to maintain the correct pace with the video.</p>
<h3 id="03Maintain-Age-Restrictions"><a href="#03Maintain-Age-Restrictions" class="headerlink" title="03Maintain Age Restrictions"></a>03Maintain Age Restrictions</h3><p>Being an online platform, YouTube is open to everyone. There are many creators and viewers on the platform with different interests. Moreover, it is accessible to all age groups, which makes it necessary to optimize the content according to the age groups. YouTube has always been very particular about the age-restricted content. A lot of content is published on the platform that can be harmful to the children’s minds and growth. YouTube uses different AI tools and algorithms to maintain the age restrictions of adult content.</p>
<p>YouTube has guaranteed that the mature content will not be accessible to the kids and youngsters aged below 13 years. It has also created a separate application for the kids to maintain the age restrictions from the matured content.</p>
<p>Earlier, the YouTubers used to flag their content as mature themselves, but now the platform is planning to flag the content using machine learning technology. YouTube had also used machine learning technology to thwart the age-restricted content automatically in 2017.</p>
<h3 id="04”Up-Next”-Feature"><a href="#04”Up-Next”-Feature" class="headerlink" title="04”Up Next” Feature"></a>04”Up Next” Feature</h3><p>The “Up Next” feature of YouTube is also a result of artificial intelligence. With many creators uploading a large number of videos every minute, it was becoming difficult for the platform to manage the suggestion engine properly. So, YouTube has introduced the AI technique to streamline the recommendation process to maintain the real-time and latest suggestion.</p>
<p>This feature is a mix of two algorithms, one is used to optimize the suggestion engine according to the search history and watch history of the user, and the other is to determine according to the ranking. As the main aim is to provide the content so that the user can spend his&#x2F;her maximum time watching YouTube videos. This helps in creating a better sidebar full of user-specific recommendations. YouTube’s special recommendation feature ensures to recommend different videos to the different viewers as per their interests.</p>
<h3 id="05Training-on-Depth-Prediction"><a href="#05Training-on-Depth-Prediction" class="headerlink" title="05Training on Depth Prediction"></a>05Training on Depth Prediction</h3><p>YouTube has a lot of data stored that provides easy knowledge of AI algorithms. According to the recent data and announcement, it is now clear that <strong>Google’s AI YouTube</strong> researchers used the “mannequin challenge” to understand depth predictions.</p>
<p>In this challenge, they researched around 2000 groups, with 1 group in each video. Video had many people standing still like they have been frozen and one person was going through the scene to shoot the video. A better understanding of depth prediction can further help in generating the development of Augmented Reality (AR).</p>
<h3 id="06Tackle-Fake-News"><a href="#06Tackle-Fake-News" class="headerlink" title="06Tackle Fake News"></a>06Tackle Fake News</h3><p>Among the different features of the most engaging online platform comes the ability to detect and tackle fake news and misleading content. YouTube can understand and detect fake news. With so many users on different social media platforms, it has now become common to spread fake and false news. Unlike other platforms, YouTube is using artificial intelligence to detect and remove misleading content that is against YouTube’s privacy policy.</p>
<p>YouTube understands that this type of content can be harmful to the audience and can be the reason for disputes among different communities. Hence, giving rise to racism and terrorism. To reduce its wrong impact on society, YouTube is using AI technology and removing this type of fake and misleading content. Around 11 million videos were removed from the platform within a single quarter. The introduction of AI has also proved that the technology works more effectively and efficiently rather than the manual removal of such content.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-Is-YouTube-Using-AI-to-Recommend-Videos"><a href="#Part-2-How-Is-YouTube-Using-AI-to-Recommend-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How Is YouTube Using AI to Recommend Videos?"></a>Part 2 How Is YouTube Using AI to Recommend Videos?</h2><p><img

                ></p>
<p>YouTube aims at finding the perfect video for each user separately and anticipating the users to spend more time on the platform. Keeping both these things in mind, it decided to use AI technology to recommend videos and optimize the suggestion panel. Just like Netflix, AI technology makes it easier for the platform to determine the best suggestions for different viewers. It recommends the videos after researching the user’s age, interests, watch time, etc.</p>
<p>YouTube generally focuses on increasing the watch time of the viewer, that’s why it recommends the videos keeping the user’s interests on priority. The goal is to watch more rather than watch the best.</p>
<p>YouTube uses different AI algorithms to understand things and recommend optimized videos to stand out from the crowd. First of all, it uses AI algorithms to understand the user’s interest by scanning his&#x2F;her search history and watching history. It creates a list based on the findings and then ranks the videos as per the google rankings. Each video on YouTube has a different ranking.</p>
<p>YouTube has been changing its algorithms over time. Earlier, it used to rank videos according to view counts. But soon people understood the technique and started using the eye-catchy title and thumbnail to gain a large number of views. Due to this, viewers even started complaining about the content and YouTube changed its algorithms to resolve this issue.</p>
<p>YouTube introduced AI and ML technology to customize the recommendations in 2016. This introduction has made things easier for YouTube as well as its viewers. It has now announced to ban the “borderline content”.</p>

Moreover, it is accessible to all age groups, which makes it necessary to optimize the content according to the age groups. YouTube has always been very particular about the age-restricted content. A lot of content is published on the platform that can be harmful to the children’s minds and growth. YouTube uses different AI tools and algorithms to maintain the age restrictions of adult content.</p>
<p>YouTube has guaranteed that the mature content will not be accessible to the kids and youngsters aged below 13 years. It has also created a separate application for the kids to maintain the age restrictions from the matured content.</p>
<p>Earlier, the YouTubers used to flag their content as mature themselves, but now the platform is planning to flag the content using machine learning technology. YouTube had also used machine learning technology to thwart the age-restricted content automatically in 2017.</p>
<h3 id="04”Up-Next”-Feature-2"><a href="#04”Up-Next”-Feature-2" class="headerlink" title="04”Up Next” Feature"></a>04”Up Next” Feature</h3><p>The “Up Next” feature of YouTube is also a result of artificial intelligence. With many creators uploading a large number of videos every minute, it was becoming difficult for the platform to manage the suggestion engine properly. So, YouTube has introduced the AI technique to streamline the recommendation process to maintain the real-time and latest suggestion.</p>

<p>In this challenge, they researched around 2000 groups, with 1 group in each video. Video had many people standing still like they have been frozen and one person was going through the scene to shoot the video. A better understanding of depth prediction can further help in generating the development of Augmented Reality (AR).</p>

<p>YouTube aims at finding the perfect video for each user separately and anticipating the users to spend more time on the platform. Keeping both these things in mind, it decided to use AI technology to recommend videos and optimize the suggestion panel. Just like Netflix, AI technology makes it easier for the platform to determine the best suggestions for different viewers. It recommends the videos after researching the user’s age, interests, watch time, etc.</p>
<p>YouTube generally focuses on increasing the watch time of the viewer, that’s why it recommends the videos keeping the user’s interests on priority. The goal is to watch more rather than watch the best.</p>
<p>YouTube uses different AI algorithms to understand things and recommend optimized videos to stand out from the crowd. First of all, it uses AI algorithms to understand the user’s interest by scanning his&#x2F;her search history and watching history. It creates a list based on the findings and then ranks the videos as per the google rankings. Each video on YouTube has a different ranking.</p>
<p>YouTube has been changing its algorithms over time. Earlier, it used to rank videos according to view counts. But soon people understood the technique and started using the eye-catchy title and thumbnail to gain a large number of views. Due to this, viewers even started complaining about the content and YouTube changed its algorithms to resolve this issue.</p>
<p>YouTube introduced AI and ML technology to customize the recommendations in 2016. This introduction has made things easier for YouTube as well as its viewers. It has now announced to ban the “borderline content”.</p>

<p>Editing video with Final Cut Pro is not a complicated process. Here are the steps to help a beginner get started.</p>
<p><strong>Step1: Create a new project &amp; import media</strong></p>
<p>When you Launch the Final Cut Pro interface, Libraries and Events are automatically created. You only need to create a new project.</p>
<p>At the top menu bar, click <em>File &gt; New &gt; Project</em> to create a new project. Here you will have to type in a new name of the project and then select ‘<em>Use Automatic Settings’</em>.</p>
<p>At the top menu bar again, click <em>File &gt; Import &gt; Media</em> to enable the program to bring up the Media Import window where you can select the video and audio files you want to import into your new project.</p>
<p>After selecting all the media you want to include in your project press <em>‘Import Selected’</em> and then close the media window.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add your trimmed clips to the timeline.</strong></p>
<p>The thumbnails of all the media you have imported will be appearing in the browser. For you to create a new video you need to arrange and trim that media in the timeline.</p>
<p>In your browser, you can set the <em>‘In</em> and <em>Out’</em> points for each video clip by holding ‘_Option_’. To do this you will have to click the thumbnail and drag it. The yellow timeline that appears on the clip represents the range that will be added to your video timeline.</p>
<p>After arranging them in the order that you want them to play, trim your clips by moving the mouse cursor to the edge of its thumbnail. This is done by using the <em>‘Trim tool’.</em> Drag forward or backward to adjust the clip’s endings.</p>
<p>If you are arranging the clips in your sequence, you need to drag and drop any of the clips from the timeline into a different position. Final Cut Pro has a tool known as Magnetic timeline that will automatically insert and arrange the clips for you. You just need to ensure that your clips do not overlap or lay on top of each other.</p>
<p>To preview your video in the viewer, press the space bar on your keyboard or the Play icon in your software interface.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add Title, Texts, Transitions, and Effects</strong></p>
<p><strong>Title and Texts</strong>: Final Cut Pro has many Titles located in the browser where you imported your media. You can add them by dragging them into your video’s timeline. To access those titles you can press the <em>‘Title and Generators’</em> icon in the sidebar to open it.</p>
<p><strong>Transitions</strong>: When adding Transitions, there is nothing wrong with a “<em>hard cut_” between 2 clips. Use the transitions only where they make sense so as not to ruin your video. To add these transitions, you need to open the ‘_Transition browser’</em> by clicking on its indicated icon.</p>
<p>The transition’s length can be adjusted by dragging inwards or outwards. To customize your transition you can open the inspector by pressing ‘<em>Command + 4’</em> and make the adjustments.</p>
<p><strong>Effects</strong>: With Final Cut Pro inbuilt Effects, you can add some more value to your video after you are done with basic arrangements in the timeline. To add the effects click on the ‘<em>Effects browser’</em> icon to open it.</p>
<p>Next to the effects browser icon, choose your preferred effect and add it between any 2 clips. By doing this you will have added animation effect between them.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Add Audio, Music, and Color.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Audio &amp; Music:</strong> At this point, you can import and add your music. Photos and Audio sidebar icon is located above the browser and you can click to open, and then select Sound Effects.</p>
<p>To see all the songs available in Final Cut Pro, you can type the word <em>‘Jingle</em>‘ and you can preview them by pressing the small play button.</p>
<p><strong>Color correction</strong>: By highlighting all the video clips in your video timeline, you can see a yellow outline around them.</p>
<p>Then open the drop-down menu by clicking the ‘_Enhancement_’ icon situated below the Viewer.</p>
<p>To improve the color and contrast, select Balance Color or <em>‘Option + Cmd + B’</em>.</p>
<p>Now that you are done editing your video, you can save and share as you prefer.</p>

<p>These steps will help you to know how to edit video with Filmora software;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Start a new project.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/startup-window-01.png"
                      alt="filmora start new project"
                ></p>
<p>After making sure that you have Filmora video editor installed on your computer, start a new project. Open the app then choose a dropdown option from the Select Project Aspect Ratio.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Import your media</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/get-started-with-filmora-02.png"
                      alt="filmora import media"
                ></p>
<p>The footage, photos, and audios you use in your video are the key basic aspects of your video. Organizing all the files you are going to use in a single file. You can do this by browsing the file menu. Click the <em>‘File &gt; Import Media Folder’</em> menu in Filmora and select the folder that contains your video files.</p>
<p>After importing your video files the thumbnails for each file will appear in one half of the application. Double-click on the thumbnails for a preview.</p>
<p>These thumbnails prove that all your captured video clips are already in the application and ready to be edited. Click on the Filmora video editing guide to get to help you know what to do.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add clips to the timeline, trim, adjust appropriately and sequence them.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/filmora-split-button.jpg"
                      alt="filmora split video"
                ></p>
<p>Now that you have reviewed your video library and seen that they are there, you need to add them to the video editing timeline at the bottom of your app. This is quite easy as you can view all your video clips and determine which is to be added first.</p>
<p>Drag and drop each video or photo in the timeline to add it to your project.</p>
<p>After adding the clips, you can trim and adjust them appropriately. Click on the right or left edges of the clip you want to shorten in the timeline and drag it to shorten.</p>
<p>If you want to split a clip in the timeline, pick the scissors by clicking on the ‘_Scissors_’ icon.</p>
<p>When working on your video footage, click the spacebar of your computer keyboard to preview. By doing this, you will be able to see how your clips are joined together.</p>
<p>Trim appropriately and perfect the runtime of every single clip and re-order your clips where there is a need to do so. This can be done by clicking on the targeted clip and dragging it to where you want it to be.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Add video Effects, Transmissions between the clips, and Text overlays</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/modify-transitions-win-4.jpg"
                      alt="filmora add transitions"
                ></p>
<p>Click on the Effect icon at the top of the app and a deep visual library of effects will be visible. If you want to add a certain effect to your active clip, just double-click it.</p>
<p>Add transitions in your video timeline to cut the scene-to-scene. They are quite necessary as they help establish your audience’s attention.</p>
<p>The next thing after adding the transmissions will be adding the overlays and exporting your video by clicking on the ‘<em>Export</em>‘ button.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Export your finished video.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/export-to-local-win-1.png"
                      alt="filmora export video"
                ></p>
<p>You can click the ‘Export’ button and switch to the platform you want your video to be exported.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Choosing an appropriate video editing tool is equally as important as the video itself.

                ></p>
<p>After making sure that you have Filmora video editor installed on your computer, start a new project. Open the app then choose a dropdown option from the Select Project Aspect Ratio.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Import your media</strong></p>
<p><img

                      alt="filmora import media"
                ></p>
<p>The footage, photos, and audios you use in your video are the key basic aspects of your video. Organizing all the files you are going to use in a single file. You can do this by browsing the file menu. Click the <em>‘File &gt; Import Media Folder’</em> menu in Filmora and select the folder that contains your video files.</p>
<p>After importing your video files the thumbnails for each file will appear in one half of the application. Double-click on the thumbnails for a preview.</p>
<p>These thumbnails prove that all your captured video clips are already in the application and ready to be edited. Click on the Filmora video editing guide to get to help you know what to do.</p>

                      alt="filmora split video"
                ></p>
<p>Now that you have reviewed your video library and seen that they are there, you need to add them to the video editing timeline at the bottom of your app. This is quite easy as you can view all your video clips and determine which is to be added first.</p>
<p>Drag and drop each video or photo in the timeline to add it to your project.</p>
<p>After adding the clips, you can trim and adjust them appropriately. Click on the right or left edges of the clip you want to shorten in the timeline and drag it to shorten.</p>

<p>Trim appropriately and perfect the runtime of every single clip and re-order your clips where there is a need to do so. This can be done by clicking on the targeted clip and dragging it to where you want it to be.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Add video Effects, Transmissions between the clips, and Text overlays</strong></p>

<p><strong>Step 5: Export your finished video.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<li>It has a powerful architecture for your complex and heavy projects.</li>

</ul>
<p>Editing video with Final Cut Pro is not a complicated process. Here are the steps to help a beginner get started.</p>
<p><strong>Step1: Create a new project &amp; import media</strong></p>
<p>When you Launch the Final Cut Pro interface, Libraries and Events are automatically created. You only need to create a new project.</p>
<p>At the top menu bar, click <em>File &gt; New &gt; Project</em> to create a new project. Here you will have to type in a new name of the project and then select ‘<em>Use Automatic Settings’</em>.</p>
<p>At the top menu bar again, click <em>File &gt; Import &gt; Media</em> to enable the program to bring up the Media Import window where you can select the video and audio files you want to import into your new project.</p>
<p>After selecting all the media you want to include in your project press <em>‘Import Selected’</em> and then close the media window.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add your trimmed clips to the timeline.</strong></p>
<p>The thumbnails of all the media you have imported will be appearing in the browser. For you to create a new video you need to arrange and trim that media in the timeline.</p>
<p>In your browser, you can set the <em>‘In</em> and <em>Out’</em> points for each video clip by holding ‘_Option_’. To do this you will have to click the thumbnail and drag it. The yellow timeline that appears on the clip represents the range that will be added to your video timeline.</p>
<p>After arranging them in the order that you want them to play, trim your clips by moving the mouse cursor to the edge of its thumbnail. This is done by using the <em>‘Trim tool’.</em> Drag forward or backward to adjust the clip’s endings.</p>
<p>If you are arranging the clips in your sequence, you need to drag and drop any of the clips from the timeline into a different position. Final Cut Pro has a tool known as Magnetic timeline that will automatically insert and arrange the clips for you. You just need to ensure that your clips do not overlap or lay on top of each other.</p>
<p>To preview your video in the viewer, press the space bar on your keyboard or the Play icon in your software interface.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add Title, Texts, Transitions, and Effects</strong></p>
<p><strong>Title and Texts</strong>: Final Cut Pro has many Titles located in the browser where you imported your media. You can add them by dragging them into your video’s timeline. To access those titles you can press the <em>‘Title and Generators’</em> icon in the sidebar to open it.</p>
<p><strong>Transitions</strong>: When adding Transitions, there is nothing wrong with a “<em>hard cut_” between 2 clips. Use the transitions only where they make sense so as not to ruin your video. To add these transitions, you need to open the ‘_Transition browser’</em> by clicking on its indicated icon.</p>
<p>The transition’s length can be adjusted by dragging inwards or outwards. To customize your transition you can open the inspector by pressing ‘<em>Command + 4’</em> and make the adjustments.</p>
<p><strong>Effects</strong>: With Final Cut Pro inbuilt Effects, you can add some more value to your video after you are done with basic arrangements in the timeline. To add the effects click on the ‘<em>Effects browser’</em> icon to open it.</p>
<p>Next to the effects browser icon, choose your preferred effect and add it between any 2 clips. By doing this you will have added animation effect between them.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Add Audio, Music, and Color.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Audio &amp; Music:</strong> At this point, you can import and add your music. Photos and Audio sidebar icon is located above the browser and you can click to open, and then select Sound Effects.</p>
<p>To see all the songs available in Final Cut Pro, you can type the word <em>‘Jingle</em>‘ and you can preview them by pressing the small play button.</p>
<p><strong>Color correction</strong>: By highlighting all the video clips in your video timeline, you can see a yellow outline around them.</p>
<p>Then open the drop-down menu by clicking the ‘_Enhancement_’ icon situated below the Viewer.</p>
<p>To improve the color and contrast, select Balance Color or <em>‘Option + Cmd + B’</em>.</p>
<p>Now that you are done editing your video, you can save and share as you prefer.</p>

<p>After arranging them in the order that you want them to play, trim your clips by moving the mouse cursor to the edge of its thumbnail. This is done by using the <em>‘Trim tool’.</em> Drag forward or backward to adjust the clip’s endings.</p>
<p>If you are arranging the clips in your sequence, you need to drag and drop any of the clips from the timeline into a different position. Final Cut Pro has a tool known as Magnetic timeline that will automatically insert and arrange the clips for you. You just need to ensure that your clips do not overlap or lay on top of each other.</p>
<p>To preview your video in the viewer, press the space bar on your keyboard or the Play icon in your software interface.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add Title, Texts, Transitions, and Effects</strong></p>
<p><strong>Title and Texts</strong>: Final Cut Pro has many Titles located in the browser where you imported your media. You can add them by dragging them into your video’s timeline. To access those titles you can press the <em>‘Title and Generators’</em> icon in the sidebar to open it.</p>
<p><strong>Transitions</strong>: When adding Transitions, there is nothing wrong with a “<em>hard cut_” between 2 clips. Use the transitions only where they make sense so as not to ruin your video. To add these transitions, you need to open the ‘_Transition browser’</em> by clicking on its indicated icon.</p>
<p>The transition’s length can be adjusted by dragging inwards or outwards. To customize your transition you can open the inspector by pressing ‘<em>Command + 4’</em> and make the adjustments.</p>
<p><strong>Effects</strong>: With Final Cut Pro inbuilt Effects, you can add some more value to your video after you are done with basic arrangements in the timeline. To add the effects click on the ‘<em>Effects browser’</em> icon to open it.</p>
<p>Next to the effects browser icon, choose your preferred effect and add it between any 2 clips. By doing this you will have added animation effect between them.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Add Audio, Music, and Color.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Audio &amp; Music:</strong> At this point, you can import and add your music. Photos and Audio sidebar icon is located above the browser and you can click to open, and then select Sound Effects.</p>
<p>To see all the songs available in Final Cut Pro, you can type the word <em>‘Jingle</em>‘ and you can preview them by pressing the small play button.</p>
<p><strong>Color correction</strong>: By highlighting all the video clips in your video timeline, you can see a yellow outline around them.</p>
<p>Then open the drop-down menu by clicking the ‘_Enhancement_’ icon situated below the Viewer.</p>
<p>To improve the color and contrast, select Balance Color or <em>‘Option + Cmd + B’</em>.</p>
<p>Now that you are done editing your video, you can save and share as you prefer.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Add narrative to video</p>
<h2 id="Alternative-Way-to-Edit-Videos-3"><a href="#Alternative-Way-to-Edit-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Alternative Way to Edit Videos"></a>Alternative Way to Edit Videos</h2><p>Getting an appropriate video editing software is quite challenging as the makers of these software sometimes get confused about if the programs needed are for home videos or professional-quality work such as Hollywood movies. This is why you will find that some programs are complex to use while others lack essential features to make your work efficient.</p>

<p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p>
<p>These steps will help you to know how to edit video with Filmora software;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Start a new project.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/startup-window-01.png"
                      alt="filmora start new project"
                ></p>
<p>After making sure that you have Filmora video editor installed on your computer, start a new project. Open the app then choose a dropdown option from the Select Project Aspect Ratio.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Import your media</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/get-started-with-filmora-02.png"
                      alt="filmora import media"
                ></p>
<p>The footage, photos, and audios you use in your video are the key basic aspects of your video. Organizing all the files you are going to use in a single file. You can do this by browsing the file menu. Click the <em>‘File &gt; Import Media Folder’</em> menu in Filmora and select the folder that contains your video files.</p>
<p>After importing your video files the thumbnails for each file will appear in one half of the application. Double-click on the thumbnails for a preview.</p>
<p>These thumbnails prove that all your captured video clips are already in the application and ready to be edited. Click on the Filmora video editing guide to get to help you know what to do.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add clips to the timeline, trim, adjust appropriately and sequence them.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/filmora-split-button.jpg"
                      alt="filmora split video"
                ></p>
<p>Now that you have reviewed your video library and seen that they are there, you need to add them to the video editing timeline at the bottom of your app. This is quite easy as you can view all your video clips and determine which is to be added first.</p>
<p>Drag and drop each video or photo in the timeline to add it to your project.</p>
<p>After adding the clips, you can trim and adjust them appropriately. Click on the right or left edges of the clip you want to shorten in the timeline and drag it to shorten.</p>
<p>If you want to split a clip in the timeline, pick the scissors by clicking on the ‘_Scissors_’ icon.</p>
<p>When working on your video footage, click the spacebar of your computer keyboard to preview. By doing this, you will be able to see how your clips are joined together.</p>
<p>Trim appropriately and perfect the runtime of every single clip and re-order your clips where there is a need to do so. This can be done by clicking on the targeted clip and dragging it to where you want it to be.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Add video Effects, Transmissions between the clips, and Text overlays</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/modify-transitions-win-4.jpg"
                      alt="filmora add transitions"
                ></p>
<p>Click on the Effect icon at the top of the app and a deep visual library of effects will be visible. If you want to add a certain effect to your active clip, just double-click it.</p>
<p>Add transitions in your video timeline to cut the scene-to-scene. They are quite necessary as they help establish your audience’s attention.</p>
<p>The next thing after adding the transmissions will be adding the overlays and exporting your video by clicking on the ‘<em>Export</em>‘ button.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Export your finished video.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/export-to-local-win-1.png"
                      alt="filmora export video"
                ></p>
<p>You can click the ‘Export’ button and switch to the platform you want your video to be exported.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Choosing an appropriate video editing tool is equally as important as the video itself. And with the availability of so many of these video editing tools, choosing among them is quite hard. You can easily get confused especially if you are a beginner in the video editing industry. To avoid the complications you need to know what editing software is the best for your project.</p>
