Here are some editing tips you should stick to improve your video content.</p>
<p><strong>Get The Best Video Editor</strong> - Editing a video is equally important as shooting a video. Once you have the best video editor, you can rest assured that your editing work is half done. This is because you have all the tools to turn your raw video into stunning video. You can experiment and come up with the best editing work to your own surprise.</p>
<p><strong>Get The Length Correct</strong> - In today’s world, viewers have very less time to watch videos. Therefore, a lengthy and elaborative video is a bummer. Hence, you should trim the video and keep only the portions that are relevant, engaging, and not boring.</p>
<p><strong>Start with a Bang</strong> - The first impression is always the most important, and hence, the intro of your video is extremely crucial to keep the attention of the audiences intact. To make the intro interesting, you should not only focus on the content but also on video effects and animations that are attention-grabbing.</p>
<p><strong>Smooth Cuts and Soothing Colours</strong> - When you are cutting from one scene or angle to another, the transition should be smooth so that it does not feel abrupt. Therefore, you should cut scenes when the subjects and objects seem to be static so that the transition is smooth naturally. Play attention to colour and the video editors allow you to enhance the quality by adjusting the colors and picture properties.</p>
<p><strong>Graphical Objects</strong> - Use graphical objects and animated texts wherever possible for better explanations. Things can get boring visually when you do not add graphical elements, transitions, and animations appropriately in different places. Similarly, the use of texts and titles makes the video more engaging. Instead of static texts, there are animated texts and titles available with stickers and memes that you can edit your video with.</p>
<p><strong>Play Attention to Sound</strong> - Sound is the most neglected part of a video by amateur video creators when one should pay attention to it. The sound effects can keep the audiences hooked to your video and make them not get bored. Certain sound effects refresh the attention of the audiences when it starts to fade, and hence, you should place the sound effects wisely.</p>
<p><strong>Proper Flow</strong> - The editing work should be smooth so that the flow of the video is smooth and efficient. It takes time, and hence, you can practice and learn video editing so that your video can stand out instantly after your editing touches. Besides, the editing should be such that the video feels like a story that audiences can invest in and get engaged throughout.</p>
<h2 id="Part-6-How-to-Share-Your-Videos"><a href="#Part-6-How-to-Share-Your-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 6 How to Share Your Videos"></a>Part 6 How to Share Your Videos</h2><p>In order to share videos after trimming them, you need to save the video properly. There are different file formats available for video files. For example, MP4 is the most popular video file format among Windows users. On the contrary, MOV is the most popular video file format. Different file formats have different features such as compression and lossless. According to the file format, the file size varies for the same duration of video.</p>
<p>Therefore, the video trimmer you are using must have different file formats for saving and exporting the editing video files. Some video trimmers have in-built features to share videos on social media platforms and upload on video streaming platforms like YouTube. Depending on your target audiences, you need to adjust the parameters like aspect ratio, video resolution, as well as duration. Besides, you can upload videos on cloud storage and share with anyone as per your requirements.</p>

You have two options when it comes to making a video. You can either record a video with recording software or you can shoot a video with your camera. Let us discuss both options in detail now.</p>
<p><strong>-Record a video</strong></p>
<p>You can record a video with recording software when you are capturing video from your webcam or from your computer screen. There are two options you have when it comes to choose a recording software.</p>
<ul>
<li>Premium Recorder - A premium recorder is a professional video recording software that you have to purchase to avail all the features and functionalities. Choose the best video recorder.</li>
<li>Free Recorder - If you are not willing to spend any money on a recording software, there are plenty of free recording applications available. We recommend <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >OBS Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as the best free video recorder.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>-Shoot a video</strong></p>
<p>The second option is shooting a video with your external digital camera. You can also use your phone camera to shoot a video. For example, making vlogs, comedy skits, travel videos, or short films needs a digital camera. If you are using your phone camera, you can cut and crop the video after shooting using the video trimmer apps or online video trimmers. If you are shooting external with an external camera, you can transfer the video to your mobile or computer and use a preferred video trimmer for editing.</p>

<h2 id="Part-5-Editing-Tips-to-Improve-Your-Videos-1"><a href="#Part-5-Editing-Tips-to-Improve-Your-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 5 Editing Tips to Improve Your Videos"></a>Part 5 Editing Tips to Improve Your Videos</h2><p>Apart from trimming, you have to edit different other aspects so that you can make the video engaging and eye-catching. Here are some editing tips you should stick to improve your video content.</p>
<p><strong>Get The Best Video Editor</strong> - Editing a video is equally important as shooting a video. Once you have the best video editor, you can rest assured that your editing work is half done. This is because you have all the tools to turn your raw video into stunning video. You can experiment and come up with the best editing work to your own surprise.</p>
<p><strong>Get The Length Correct</strong> - In today’s world, viewers have very less time to watch videos. Therefore, a lengthy and elaborative video is a bummer. Hence, you should trim the video and keep only the portions that are relevant, engaging, and not boring.</p>
<p><strong>Start with a Bang</strong> - The first impression is always the most important, and hence, the intro of your video is extremely crucial to keep the attention of the audiences intact. To make the intro interesting, you should not only focus on the content but also on video effects and animations that are attention-grabbing.</p>
<p><strong>Smooth Cuts and Soothing Colours</strong> - When you are cutting from one scene or angle to another, the transition should be smooth so that it does not feel abrupt. Therefore, you should cut scenes when the subjects and objects seem to be static so that the transition is smooth naturally. Play attention to colour and the video editors allow you to enhance the quality by adjusting the colors and picture properties.</p>
<p><strong>Graphical Objects</strong> - Use graphical objects and animated texts wherever possible for better explanations. Things can get boring visually when you do not add graphical elements, transitions, and animations appropriately in different places. Similarly, the use of texts and titles makes the video more engaging. Instead of static texts, there are animated texts and titles available with stickers and memes that you can edit your video with.</p>
<p><strong>Play Attention to Sound</strong> - Sound is the most neglected part of a video by amateur video creators when one should pay attention to it. The sound effects can keep the audiences hooked to your video and make them not get bored. Certain sound effects refresh the attention of the audiences when it starts to fade, and hence, you should place the sound effects wisely.</p>
<p><strong>Proper Flow</strong> - The editing work should be smooth so that the flow of the video is smooth and efficient. It takes time, and hence, you can practice and learn video editing so that your video can stand out instantly after your editing touches. Besides, the editing should be such that the video feels like a story that audiences can invest in and get engaged throughout.</p>

Different file formats have different features such as compression and lossless. According to the file format, the file size varies for the same duration of video.</p>
<p>Therefore, the video trimmer you are using must have different file formats for saving and exporting the editing video files. Some video trimmers have in-built features to share videos on social media platforms and upload on video streaming platforms like YouTube. Depending on your target audiences, you need to adjust the parameters like aspect ratio, video resolution, as well as duration. Besides, you can upload videos on cloud storage and share with anyone as per your requirements.</p>

<h2 id="Part-5-Editing-Tips-to-Improve-Your-Videos-2"><a href="#Part-5-Editing-Tips-to-Improve-Your-Videos-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 5 Editing Tips to Improve Your Videos"></a>Part 5 Editing Tips to Improve Your Videos</h2><p>Apart from trimming, you have to edit different other aspects so that you can make the video engaging and eye-catching. Here are some editing tips you should stick to improve your video content.</p>
<p><strong>Get The Best Video Editor</strong> - Editing a video is equally important as shooting a video. Once you have the best video editor, you can rest assured that your editing work is half done. This is because you have all the tools to turn your raw video into stunning video. You can experiment and come up with the best editing work to your own surprise.</p>
<p><strong>Get The Length Correct</strong> - In today’s world, viewers have very less time to watch videos. Therefore, a lengthy and elaborative video is a bummer. Hence, you should trim the video and keep only the portions that are relevant, engaging, and not boring.</p>
<p><strong>Start with a Bang</strong> - The first impression is always the most important, and hence, the intro of your video is extremely crucial to keep the attention of the audiences intact. To make the intro interesting, you should not only focus on the content but also on video effects and animations that are attention-grabbing.</p>
<p><strong>Smooth Cuts and Soothing Colours</strong> - When you are cutting from one scene or angle to another, the transition should be smooth so that it does not feel abrupt. Therefore, you should cut scenes when the subjects and objects seem to be static so that the transition is smooth naturally. Play attention to colour and the video editors allow you to enhance the quality by adjusting the colors and picture properties.</p>
<p><strong>Graphical Objects</strong> - Use graphical objects and animated texts wherever possible for better explanations. Things can get boring visually when you do not add graphical elements, transitions, and animations appropriately in different places. Similarly, the use of texts and titles makes the video more engaging. Instead of static texts, there are animated texts and titles available with stickers and memes that you can edit your video with.</p>
<p><strong>Play Attention to Sound</strong> - Sound is the most neglected part of a video by amateur video creators when one should pay attention to it. The sound effects can keep the audiences hooked to your video and make them not get bored. Certain sound effects refresh the attention of the audiences when it starts to fade, and hence, you should place the sound effects wisely.</p>
<p><strong>Proper Flow</strong> - The editing work should be smooth so that the flow of the video is smooth and efficient. It takes time, and hence, you can practice and learn video editing so that your video can stand out instantly after your editing touches. Besides, the editing should be such that the video feels like a story that audiences can invest in and get engaged throughout.</p>

There are different file formats available for video files. For example, MP4 is the most popular video file format among Windows users. On the contrary, MOV is the most popular video file format. Different file formats have different features such as compression and lossless. According to the file format, the file size varies for the same duration of video.</p>
<p>Therefore, the video trimmer you are using must have different file formats for saving and exporting the editing video files. Some video trimmers have in-built features to share videos on social media platforms and upload on video streaming platforms like YouTube. Depending on your target audiences, you need to adjust the parameters like aspect ratio, video resolution, as well as duration. Besides, you can upload videos on cloud storage and share with anyone as per your requirements.</p>

Here are some editing tips you should stick to improve your video content.</p>
<p><strong>Get The Best Video Editor</strong> - Editing a video is equally important as shooting a video. Once you have the best video editor, you can rest assured that your editing work is half done. This is because you have all the tools to turn your raw video into stunning video. You can experiment and come up with the best editing work to your own surprise.</p>
<p><strong>Get The Length Correct</strong> - In today’s world, viewers have very less time to watch videos. Therefore, a lengthy and elaborative video is a bummer. Hence, you should trim the video and keep only the portions that are relevant, engaging, and not boring.</p>
<p><strong>Start with a Bang</strong> - The first impression is always the most important, and hence, the intro of your video is extremely crucial to keep the attention of the audiences intact. To make the intro interesting, you should not only focus on the content but also on video effects and animations that are attention-grabbing.</p>
<p><strong>Smooth Cuts and Soothing Colours</strong> - When you are cutting from one scene or angle to another, the transition should be smooth so that it does not feel abrupt. Therefore, you should cut scenes when the subjects and objects seem to be static so that the transition is smooth naturally. Play attention to colour and the video editors allow you to enhance the quality by adjusting the colors and picture properties.</p>
<p><strong>Graphical Objects</strong> - Use graphical objects and animated texts wherever possible for better explanations. Things can get boring visually when you do not add graphical elements, transitions, and animations appropriately in different places.

<h3 id="01Automatic-Removal-of-Inappropriate-Content"><a href="#01Automatic-Removal-of-Inappropriate-Content" class="headerlink" title="01Automatic Removal of Inappropriate Content"></a>01Automatic Removal of Inappropriate Content</h3><p>One of the main applications of <strong>AI on YouTube</strong> is to remove inappropriate content automatically. YouTube uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to remove the violative and inappropriate content from the platform. As this content was one of the main reasons for the rise in racism and terrorism. To avoid all these harmful after effects, YouTube introduced the “Trashy Video Classifier” to scan and examine the feedback.</p>
<p>Although these algorithms might not be 100% accurate, they can perform the task more easily and efficiently than the manual examination of the content. Due to these algorithms, it has become easier to automatically remove the controversial content from the platform immediately. AI aided feature helps in determining the inappropriate content faster. However, it doesn’t provide 100% accurate results. This is the reason why YouTube has a large team of human specialists to check the accuracy of determining violative content.</p>
<h3 id="02Add-New-Video-Effects"><a href="#02Add-New-Video-Effects" class="headerlink" title="02Add New Video Effects"></a>02Add New Video Effects</h3><p>The introduction of artificial intelligence and machine learning in the market has made it easier to add new video effects without the use of any external equipment. You can now swap out backgrounds from videos with just one click due to the in-built AI features on YouTube. This AI neural feature is prepared by <strong>Google’s AI YouTube</strong> researchers to make it easier for the AI algorithms to understand video patterns. This feature makes it easier for the system to maintain the correct pace with the video.</p>
<h3 id="03Maintain-Age-Restrictions"><a href="#03Maintain-Age-Restrictions" class="headerlink" title="03Maintain Age Restrictions"></a>03Maintain Age Restrictions</h3><p>Being an online platform, YouTube is open to everyone. There are many creators and viewers on the platform with different interests. Moreover, it is accessible to all age groups, which makes it necessary to optimize the content according to the age groups. YouTube has always been very particular about the age-restricted content. A lot of content is published on the platform that can be harmful to the children’s minds and growth. YouTube uses different AI tools and algorithms to maintain the age restrictions of adult content.</p>
<p>YouTube has guaranteed that the mature content will not be accessible to the kids and youngsters aged below 13 years. It has also created a separate application for the kids to maintain the age restrictions from the matured content.</p>
<p>Earlier, the YouTubers used to flag their content as mature themselves, but now the platform is planning to flag the content using machine learning technology. YouTube had also used machine learning technology to thwart the age-restricted content automatically in 2017.</p>
<h3 id="04”Up-Next”-Feature"><a href="#04”Up-Next”-Feature" class="headerlink" title="04”Up Next” Feature"></a>04”Up Next” Feature</h3><p>The “Up Next” feature of YouTube is also a result of artificial intelligence. With many creators uploading a large number of videos every minute, it was becoming difficult for the platform to manage the suggestion engine properly. So, YouTube has introduced the AI technique to streamline the recommendation process to maintain the real-time and latest suggestion.</p>
<p>This feature is a mix of two algorithms, one is used to optimize the suggestion engine according to the search history and watch history of the user, and the other is to determine according to the ranking. As the main aim is to provide the content so that the user can spend his&#x2F;her maximum time watching YouTube videos. This helps in creating a better sidebar full of user-specific recommendations. YouTube’s special recommendation feature ensures to recommend different videos to the different viewers as per their interests.</p>
<h3 id="05Training-on-Depth-Prediction"><a href="#05Training-on-Depth-Prediction" class="headerlink" title="05Training on Depth Prediction"></a>05Training on Depth Prediction</h3><p>YouTube has a lot of data stored that provides easy knowledge of AI algorithms. According to the recent data and announcement, it is now clear that <strong>Google’s AI YouTube</strong> researchers used the “mannequin challenge” to understand depth predictions.</p>
<p>In this challenge, they researched around 2000 groups, with 1 group in each video. Video had many people standing still like they have been frozen and one person was going through the scene to shoot the video. A better understanding of depth prediction can further help in generating the development of Augmented Reality (AR).</p>
<h3 id="06Tackle-Fake-News"><a href="#06Tackle-Fake-News" class="headerlink" title="06Tackle Fake News"></a>06Tackle Fake News</h3><p>Among the different features of the most engaging online platform comes the ability to detect and tackle fake news and misleading content. YouTube can understand and detect fake news. With so many users on different social media platforms, it has now become common to spread fake and false news. Unlike other platforms, YouTube is using artificial intelligence to detect and remove misleading content that is against YouTube’s privacy policy.</p>
<p>YouTube understands that this type of content can be harmful to the audience and can be the reason for disputes among different communities. Hence, giving rise to racism and terrorism. To reduce its wrong impact on society, YouTube is using AI technology and removing this type of fake and misleading content. Around 11 million videos were removed from the platform within a single quarter. The introduction of AI has also proved that the technology works more effectively and efficiently rather than the manual removal of such content.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-Is-YouTube-Using-AI-to-Recommend-Videos"><a href="#Part-2-How-Is-YouTube-Using-AI-to-Recommend-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How Is YouTube Using AI to Recommend Videos?"></a>Part 2 How Is YouTube Using AI to Recommend Videos?</h2><p><img

<p>YouTube aims at finding the perfect video for each user separately and anticipating the users to spend more time on the platform. Keeping both these things in mind, it decided to use AI technology to recommend videos and optimize the suggestion panel. Just like Netflix, AI technology makes it easier for the platform to determine the best suggestions for different viewers. It recommends the videos after researching the user’s age, interests, watch time, etc.</p>
<p>YouTube generally focuses on increasing the watch time of the viewer, that’s why it recommends the videos keeping the user’s interests on priority. The goal is to watch more rather than watch the best.</p>
<p>YouTube uses different AI algorithms to understand things and recommend optimized videos to stand out from the crowd. First of all, it uses AI algorithms to understand the user’s interest by scanning his&#x2F;her search history and watching history. It creates a list based on the findings and then ranks the videos as per the google rankings. Each video on YouTube has a different ranking.</p>
<p>YouTube has been changing its algorithms over time. Earlier, it used to rank videos according to view counts. But soon people understood the technique and started using the eye-catchy title and thumbnail to gain a large number of views. Due to this, viewers even started complaining about the content and YouTube changed its algorithms to resolve this issue.</p>
<p>YouTube introduced AI and ML technology to customize the recommendations in 2016. This introduction has made things easier for YouTube as well as its viewers. It has now announced to ban the “borderline content”.</p>

<h3 id="01Automatic-Removal-of-Inappropriate-Content-1"><a href="#01Automatic-Removal-of-Inappropriate-Content-1" class="headerlink" title="01Automatic Removal of Inappropriate Content"></a>01Automatic Removal of Inappropriate Content</h3><p>One of the main applications of <strong>AI on YouTube</strong> is to remove inappropriate content automatically. YouTube uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to remove the violative and inappropriate content from the platform. As this content was one of the main reasons for the rise in racism and terrorism. To avoid all these harmful after effects, YouTube introduced the “Trashy Video Classifier” to scan and examine the feedback.</p>
<p>Although these algorithms might not be 100% accurate, they can perform the task more easily and efficiently than the manual examination of the content. Due to these algorithms, it has become easier to automatically remove the controversial content from the platform immediately. AI aided feature helps in determining the inappropriate content faster. However, it doesn’t provide 100% accurate results. This is the reason why YouTube has a large team of human specialists to check the accuracy of determining violative content.</p>
<h3 id="02Add-New-Video-Effects-1"><a href="#02Add-New-Video-Effects-1" class="headerlink" title="02Add New Video Effects"></a>02Add New Video Effects</h3><p>The introduction of artificial intelligence and machine learning in the market has made it easier to add new video effects without the use of any external equipment.

This feature makes it easier for the system to maintain the correct pace with the video.</p>
<h3 id="03Maintain-Age-Restrictions-1"><a href="#03Maintain-Age-Restrictions-1" class="headerlink" title="03Maintain Age Restrictions"></a>03Maintain Age Restrictions</h3><p>Being an online platform, YouTube is open to everyone. There are many creators and viewers on the platform with different interests. Moreover, it is accessible to all age groups, which makes it necessary to optimize the content according to the age groups. YouTube has always been very particular about the age-restricted content. A lot of content is published on the platform that can be harmful to the children’s minds and growth. YouTube uses different AI tools and algorithms to maintain the age restrictions of adult content.</p>
<p>YouTube has guaranteed that the mature content will not be accessible to the kids and youngsters aged below 13 years. It has also created a separate application for the kids to maintain the age restrictions from the matured content.</p>
<p>Earlier, the YouTubers used to flag their content as mature themselves, but now the platform is planning to flag the content using machine learning technology. YouTube had also used machine learning technology to thwart the age-restricted content automatically in 2017.</p>
<h3 id="04”Up-Next”-Feature-1"><a href="#04”Up-Next”-Feature-1" class="headerlink" title="04”Up Next” Feature"></a>04”Up Next” Feature</h3><p>The “Up Next” feature of YouTube is also a result of artificial intelligence. With many creators uploading a large number of videos every minute, it was becoming difficult for the platform to manage the suggestion engine properly. So, YouTube has introduced the AI technique to streamline the recommendation process to maintain the real-time and latest suggestion.</p>
<p>This feature is a mix of two algorithms, one is used to optimize the suggestion engine according to the search history and watch history of the user, and the other is to determine according to the ranking. As the main aim is to provide the content so that the user can spend his&#x2F;her maximum time watching YouTube videos. This helps in creating a better sidebar full of user-specific recommendations. YouTube’s special recommendation feature ensures to recommend different videos to the different viewers as per their interests.</p>
<h3 id="05Training-on-Depth-Prediction-1"><a href="#05Training-on-Depth-Prediction-1" class="headerlink" title="05Training on Depth Prediction"></a>05Training on Depth Prediction</h3><p>YouTube has a lot of data stored that provides easy knowledge of AI algorithms.

<p>In this challenge, they researched around 2000 groups, with 1 group in each video. Video had many people standing still like they have been frozen and one person was going through the scene to shoot the video. A better understanding of depth prediction can further help in generating the development of Augmented Reality (AR).</p>

<p>YouTube aims at finding the perfect video for each user separately and anticipating the users to spend more time on the platform. Keeping both these things in mind, it decided to use AI technology to recommend videos and optimize the suggestion panel. Just like Netflix, AI technology makes it easier for the platform to determine the best suggestions for different viewers. It recommends the videos after researching the user’s age, interests, watch time, etc.</p>
<p>YouTube generally focuses on increasing the watch time of the viewer, that’s why it recommends the videos keeping the user’s interests on priority. The goal is to watch more rather than watch the best.</p>
<p>YouTube uses different AI algorithms to understand things and recommend optimized videos to stand out from the crowd. First of all, it uses AI algorithms to understand the user’s interest by scanning his&#x2F;her search history and watching history. It creates a list based on the findings and then ranks the videos as per the google rankings. Each video on YouTube has a different ranking.</p>
<p>YouTube has been changing its algorithms over time. Earlier, it used to rank videos according to view counts. But soon people understood the technique and started using the eye-catchy title and thumbnail to gain a large number of views. Due to this, viewers even started complaining about the content and YouTube changed its algorithms to resolve this issue.</p>
<p>YouTube introduced AI and ML technology to customize the recommendations in 2016. This introduction has made things easier for YouTube as well as its viewers. It has now announced to ban the “borderline content”.</p>

However, it doesn’t provide 100% accurate results. This is the reason why YouTube has a large team of human specialists to check the accuracy of determining violative content.</p>
<h3 id="02Add-New-Video-Effects-3"><a href="#02Add-New-Video-Effects-3" class="headerlink" title="02Add New Video Effects"></a>02Add New Video Effects</h3><p>The introduction of artificial intelligence and machine learning in the market has made it easier to add new video effects without the use of any external equipment. You can now swap out backgrounds from videos with just one click due to the in-built AI features on YouTube. This AI neural feature is prepared by <strong>Google’s AI YouTube</strong> researchers to make it easier for the AI algorithms to understand video patterns. This feature makes it easier for the system to maintain the correct pace with the video.</p>
<h3 id="03Maintain-Age-Restrictions-3"><a href="#03Maintain-Age-Restrictions-3" class="headerlink" title="03Maintain Age Restrictions"></a>03Maintain Age Restrictions</h3><p>Being an online platform, YouTube is open to everyone. There are many creators and viewers on the platform with different interests. Moreover, it is accessible to all age groups, which makes it necessary to optimize the content according to the age groups. YouTube has always been very particular about the age-restricted content. A lot of content is published on the platform that can be harmful to the children’s minds and growth. YouTube uses different AI tools and algorithms to maintain the age restrictions of adult content.</p>
<p>YouTube has guaranteed that the mature content will not be accessible to the kids and youngsters aged below 13 years. It has also created a separate application for the kids to maintain the age restrictions from the matured content.</p>
<p>Earlier, the YouTubers used to flag their content as mature themselves, but now the platform is planning to flag the content using machine learning technology. YouTube had also used machine learning technology to thwart the age-restricted content automatically in 2017.</p>
<h3 id="04”Up-Next”-Feature-3"><a href="#04”Up-Next”-Feature-3" class="headerlink" title="04”Up Next” Feature"></a>04”Up Next” Feature</h3><p>The “Up Next” feature of YouTube is also a result of artificial intelligence. With many creators uploading a large number of videos every minute, it was becoming difficult for the platform to manage the suggestion engine properly. So, YouTube has introduced the AI technique to streamline the recommendation process to maintain the real-time and latest suggestion.</p>
<p>This feature is a mix of two algorithms, one is used to optimize the suggestion engine according to the search history and watch history of the user, and the other is to determine according to the ranking. As the main aim is to provide the content so that the user can spend his&#x2F;her maximum time watching YouTube videos. This helps in creating a better sidebar full of user-specific recommendations. YouTube’s special recommendation feature ensures to recommend different videos to the different viewers as per their interests.</p>
<h3 id="05Training-on-Depth-Prediction-3"><a href="#05Training-on-Depth-Prediction-3" class="headerlink" title="05Training on Depth Prediction"></a>05Training on Depth Prediction</h3><p>YouTube has a lot of data stored that provides easy knowledge of AI algorithms. According to the recent data and announcement, it is now clear that <strong>Google’s AI YouTube</strong> researchers used the “mannequin challenge” to understand depth predictions.</p>
<p>In this challenge, they researched around 2000 groups, with 1 group in each video. Video had many people standing still like they have been frozen and one person was going through the scene to shoot the video. A better understanding of depth prediction can further help in generating the development of Augmented Reality (AR).</p>
<h3 id="06Tackle-Fake-News-3"><a href="#06Tackle-Fake-News-3" class="headerlink" title="06Tackle Fake News"></a>06Tackle Fake News</h3><p>Among the different features of the most engaging online platform comes the ability to detect and tackle fake news and misleading content. YouTube can understand and detect fake news. With so many users on different social media platforms, it has now become common to spread fake and false news. Unlike other platforms, YouTube is using artificial intelligence to detect and remove misleading content that is against YouTube’s privacy policy.</p>
<p>YouTube understands that this type of content can be harmful to the audience and can be the reason for disputes among different communities. Hence, giving rise to racism and terrorism. To reduce its wrong impact on society, YouTube is using AI technology and removing this type of fake and misleading content. Around 11 million videos were removed from the platform within a single quarter. The introduction of AI has also proved that the technology works more effectively and efficiently rather than the manual removal of such content.</p>

<p>YouTube aims at finding the perfect video for each user separately and anticipating the users to spend more time on the platform. Keeping both these things in mind, it decided to use AI technology to recommend videos and optimize the suggestion panel. Just like Netflix, AI technology makes it easier for the platform to determine the best suggestions for different viewers. It recommends the videos after researching the user’s age, interests, watch time, etc.</p>
<p>YouTube generally focuses on increasing the watch time of the viewer, that’s why it recommends the videos keeping the user’s interests on priority. The goal is to watch more rather than watch the best.</p>
<p>YouTube uses different AI algorithms to understand things and recommend optimized videos to stand out from the crowd. First of all, it uses AI algorithms to understand the user’s interest by scanning his&#x2F;her search history and watching history. It creates a list based on the findings and then ranks the videos as per the google rankings. Each video on YouTube has a different ranking.</p>
<p>YouTube has been changing its algorithms over time. Earlier, it used to rank videos according to view counts. But soon people understood the technique and started using the eye-catchy title and thumbnail to gain a large number of views. Due to this, viewers even started complaining about the content and YouTube changed its algorithms to resolve this issue.</p>
<p>YouTube introduced AI and ML technology to customize the recommendations in 2016. This introduction has made things easier for YouTube as well as its viewers. It has now announced to ban the “borderline content”.</p>
