<ol>
<li><strong>Importing an Xvid file</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>There are two ways to import a Xvid file.</p>
<p> Click Import to browse for Xvid videos on your computer and select all Xvid files to load while holding down the Ctrl or Shift key. Drag and drop the Xvid file directly into the program window.</p>
<p> If you want to add images and sounds and merge them seamlessly, do that. All regular image and audio files are supported.</p>

                ></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Drag and drop the Xvid video together</strong></li>
</ol>
<p> When you load all the Xvid files, they will appear as thumbnails in your album. To merge them, you need to drag and drop them one by one into the video timeline. They are seamlessly merged without gaps. Click the play icon to see the merged Xvid files in the screen on the right.</p>
<p> To change the order, simply drag the video element to the left or right. Note: Do not overlay another video clip. Otherwise, split and paste the original video in its place.</p>

<li><strong>Improve merged Xvid videos (optional)</strong></li>
</ol>
<p> You can also do other work to personalize your Xvid video before you export the merged Xvid video. As a powerful and easy-to-use video editor, you can use Wondershare Filmora:</p>
<p>for basic editing (trimming, splitting, rotating, trimming, brightness, contrast, tint adjustment, playback speed, pitch change, etc.). I can do it.

<li><strong>Export related Xvid files</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You can preview the content you created after making the necessary changes. When you are satisfied, click the “Create” button to save. In the pop-up output window, you can choose the desired format from all common formats such as WMV, MP4, AVI, MOV, MPG, FLV. In addition, in Advanced Settings, you can further select encoder resolution settings such as 1280 x 720, 640 x 480, 1920x1080.</p>
<p> Would you like to burn the merged Xvid files to DVD for viewing on a regular DVD player or big screen TV? Click the DVD tab, set the aspect ratio to 16: 9 or 4: 3, set the TV standard and create a DVD video.</p>

<p><strong>Another way to combine multiple Xvid files into one using Avidemux</strong></p>
<p>There are many different video formats, and it can be difficult to meet some of them without knowing exactly what they are. For example, Xvid files are Xviden-encoded video file formats that use the Xvid codec, rather than the formats you are used to in everyday life like the MP4 format. This program is used to compress and decompress video to the compression standard MPEG4 ASP, save disk space and file transfer speed, and open this type of file. Many modern DVD and Bluray players can play XVID files. Like a PC, any software program that can decode MPEG4 ASP-encoded video can play XVID files.</p>
<p> This article describes how to combine multiple Xvid files into one using Avidemux, a free video editor and encoder that supports multiple file types. Merging common video and video in Avidemux is not a big deal, but you can learn how to merge different Xvid files with this editor from the detailed article.</p>
<p> Therefore, first you need to change some of the settings for the selected video. Frame rate etc. Next, you need to open the first video clip, find and open the menu file option that displays the drop-down menu at the top left of the screen, and select Attach.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Adding Xvid Video to a program in batch</strong></p>
<p>Before importing an Xvid file, you need to make sure that you have the latest version of Joyoshare Video Joiner installed on your computer. Then it’s up to you to upload the Xvid video. There are two options. Touch the Open File icon in the lower left corner, or drag directly in bulk as needed.</p>
<p> <strong>Step 2</strong>:</p>
<p> <strong>Finish setting the output format</strong></p>
<p>When all the Xvid video files are loaded, click Format in the lower right corner of the main screen and select the output format. Formatting can be set in “Fast Mode” or “Encode Mode”. The only difference between the two modes is that the former is a lossless mode, which provides a 60x speed solution that stitches multiple Xvid files in their original quality, but the output format must be the same as the source video. The latter is a customizable mockup that allows you to choose any format as the output format and customize the output quality by simply clicking on the gear icon.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cut Xvid Video File When you have finished setting the</strong></p>
<p> output format, tap OK to save and you will be returned to the first interface. You can now crop Xvid videos as needed by simply dragging the timeline.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
<p><strong>Editing a Xvid file in encode mode</strong></p>
<p>The Joyoshare Video Joiner is equipped with a video editor that works only in encode mode. Therefore, if you want to combine Xvid files, then click the Edit icon next to the Xvid file you just added to crop, crop, mirror, adjust brightness, watermark, apply effects, subtitles, etc. You can edit the video.</p>

<p> First, upload the video to Kapwing’s video merging tool. This free tool is available for iPhone, Android, PC, or tablet in Chrome or Safari browser. Click Upload to add the videos one at a time, or select multiple clips to import them all at once.</p>
<p> Kapwing supports major video file types such as MP4, .FLV, .3PG. To embed a video from the web, just copy and paste the link. You can upload photos and GIFs and combine them with videos.</p>

                      alt="combine-several-xvid-files-"
                ></p>
<p>Think of a video that looks great when spliced together into two consecutive videos. This can be a similar color palette, an event or travel video, or a video of the same person. When</p>
<p>videos are uploaded, the video preview shows how they look combined. Kapwing highlights each scene with a purple box during playback.</p>

                      alt="combine-several-xvid-files-"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Place the video &#x2F;photo in the desired order.</strong></p>
<p>Think about which clips are next to each other and work best, and arrange them accordingly. You can drag clips to rearrange them and delete them when you no longer need them.</p>
<p>In the menu on the left, you can choose the format of the finished video (choose 1: 1 (square)), whether to crop the video (choose Fit to Border), and the length.</p>

                ></p>
<p>The video should be a montage photo Kapwing also has the option to crop the video clip to shorten the required section.</p>
<p>Creators can crop videos and remove sections from the center. To crop a clip, first select it and click Edit to open Kapwing Studio.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="combine-several-xvid-files-"
                ></p>
<p>Drag both ends of the layer to change the timing of the start and end of the clip, or click the timing and use the arrow keys to make fine adjustments.</p>
<p>Besides trimming, you can look at other edits. To remove a section or add a clip in the center, use the split tool above the timeline or type “s” on your keyboard and use the shortcut.</p>
<p>Next, delete the layers you no longer need, drag the clips to combine them, and display them side by side on the timeline.</p>
<p> creators have more control over the montage by editing the scene in Studio. In Studio, you can add music to your montage,</p>
<p> insert title slides, attach endings, watermark corners, and animate.</p>

<p><strong>Another way to combine multiple Xvid files into one using Avidemux</strong></p>
<p>There are many different video formats, and it can be difficult to meet some of them without knowing exactly what they are. For example, Xvid files are Xviden-encoded video file formats that use the Xvid codec, rather than the formats you are used to in everyday life like the MP4 format. This program is used to compress and decompress video to the compression standard MPEG4 ASP, save disk space and file transfer speed, and open this type of file. Many modern DVD and Bluray players can play XVID files. Like a PC, any software program that can decode MPEG4 ASP-encoded video can play XVID files.</p>
<p> This article describes how to combine multiple Xvid files into one using Avidemux, a free video editor and encoder that supports multiple file types. Merging common video and video in Avidemux is not a big deal, but you can learn how to merge different Xvid files with this editor from the detailed article.</p>
<p> Therefore, first you need to change some of the settings for the selected video. Frame rate etc. Next, you need to open the first video clip, find and open the menu file option that displays the drop-down menu at the top left of the screen, and select Attach.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Adding Xvid Video to a program in batch</strong></p>
<p>Before importing an Xvid file, you need to make sure that you have the latest version of Joyoshare Video Joiner installed on your computer. Then it’s up to you to upload the Xvid video. There are two options. Touch the Open File icon in the lower left corner, or drag directly in bulk as needed.</p>
<p> <strong>Step 2</strong>:</p>
<p> <strong>Finish setting the output format</strong></p>
<p>When all the Xvid video files are loaded, click Format in the lower right corner of the main screen and select the output format. Formatting can be set in “Fast Mode” or “Encode Mode”. The only difference between the two modes is that the former is a lossless mode, which provides a 60x speed solution that stitches multiple Xvid files in their original quality, but the output format must be the same as the source video. The latter is a customizable mockup that allows you to choose any format as the output format and customize the output quality by simply clicking on the gear icon.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cut Xvid Video File When you have finished setting the</strong></p>
<p> output format, tap OK to save and you will be returned to the first interface. You can now crop Xvid videos as needed by simply dragging the timeline.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
<p><strong>Editing a Xvid file in encode mode</strong></p>
<p>The Joyoshare Video Joiner is equipped with a video editor that works only in encode mode. Therefore, if you want to combine Xvid files, then click the Edit icon next to the Xvid file you just added to crop, crop, mirror, adjust brightness, watermark, apply effects, subtitles, etc. You can edit the video.</p>

<p><strong>Another way to combine multiple Xvid files into one using Avidemux</strong></p>
<p>There are many different video formats, and it can be difficult to meet some of them without knowing exactly what they are. For example, Xvid files are Xviden-encoded video file formats that use the Xvid codec, rather than the formats you are used to in everyday life like the MP4 format. This program is used to compress and decompress video to the compression standard MPEG4 ASP, save disk space and file transfer speed, and open this type of file. Many modern DVD and Bluray players can play XVID files. Like a PC, any software program that can decode MPEG4 ASP-encoded video can play XVID files.</p>
<p> This article describes how to combine multiple Xvid files into one using Avidemux, a free video editor and encoder that supports multiple file types. Merging common video and video in Avidemux is not a big deal, but you can learn how to merge different Xvid files with this editor from the detailed article.</p>
<p> Therefore, first you need to change some of the settings for the selected video. Frame rate etc. Next, you need to open the first video clip, find and open the menu file option that displays the drop-down menu at the top left of the screen, and select Attach.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Adding Xvid Video to a program in batch</strong></p>
<p>Before importing an Xvid file, you need to make sure that you have the latest version of Joyoshare Video Joiner installed on your computer. Then it’s up to you to upload the Xvid video. There are two options. Touch the Open File icon in the lower left corner, or drag directly in bulk as needed.</p>
<p> <strong>Step 2</strong>:</p>
<p> <strong>Finish setting the output format</strong></p>
<p>When all the Xvid video files are loaded, click Format in the lower right corner of the main screen and select the output format. Formatting can be set in “Fast Mode” or “Encode Mode”. The only difference between the two modes is that the former is a lossless mode, which provides a 60x speed solution that stitches multiple Xvid files in their original quality, but the output format must be the same as the source video. The latter is a customizable mockup that allows you to choose any format as the output format and customize the output quality by simply clicking on the gear icon.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cut Xvid Video File When you have finished setting the</strong></p>
<p> output format, tap OK to save and you will be returned to the first interface. You can now crop Xvid videos as needed by simply dragging the timeline.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
<p><strong>Editing a Xvid file in encode mode</strong></p>
<p>The Joyoshare Video Joiner is equipped with a video editor that works only in encode mode. Therefore, if you want to combine Xvid files, then click the Edit icon next to the Xvid file you just added to crop, crop, mirror, adjust brightness, watermark, apply effects, subtitles, etc. You can edit the video.</p>

<p><strong>Another way to combine multiple Xvid files into one using Avidemux</strong></p>
<p>There are many different video formats, and it can be difficult to meet some of them without knowing exactly what they are. For example, Xvid files are Xviden-encoded video file formats that use the Xvid codec, rather than the formats you are used to in everyday life like the MP4 format. This program is used to compress and decompress video to the compression standard MPEG4 ASP, save disk space and file transfer speed, and open this type of file. Many modern DVD and Bluray players can play XVID files. Like a PC, any software program that can decode MPEG4 ASP-encoded video can play XVID files.</p>
<p> This article describes how to combine multiple Xvid files into one using Avidemux, a free video editor and encoder that supports multiple file types. Merging common video and video in Avidemux is not a big deal, but you can learn how to merge different Xvid files with this editor from the detailed article.</p>
<p> Therefore, first you need to change some of the settings for the selected video. Frame rate etc. Next, you need to open the first video clip, find and open the menu file option that displays the drop-down menu at the top left of the screen, and select Attach.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Adding Xvid Video to a program in batch</strong></p>
<p>Before importing an Xvid file, you need to make sure that you have the latest version of Joyoshare Video Joiner installed on your computer. Then it’s up to you to upload the Xvid video. There are two options. Touch the Open File icon in the lower left corner, or drag directly in bulk as needed.</p>
<p> <strong>Step 2</strong>:</p>
<p> <strong>Finish setting the output format</strong></p>
<p>When all the Xvid video files are loaded, click Format in the lower right corner of the main screen and select the output format. Formatting can be set in “Fast Mode” or “Encode Mode”. The only difference between the two modes is that the former is a lossless mode, which provides a 60x speed solution that stitches multiple Xvid files in their original quality, but the output format must be the same as the source video. The latter is a customizable mockup that allows you to choose any format as the output format and customize the output quality by simply clicking on the gear icon.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cut Xvid Video File When you have finished setting the</strong></p>
<p> output format, tap OK to save and you will be returned to the first interface. You can now crop Xvid videos as needed by simply dragging the timeline.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
<p><strong>Editing a Xvid file in encode mode</strong></p>
<p>The Joyoshare Video Joiner is equipped with a video editor that works only in encode mode. Therefore, if you want to combine Xvid files, then click the Edit icon next to the Xvid file you just added to crop, crop, mirror, adjust brightness, watermark, apply effects, subtitles, etc. You can edit the video.</p>

To do this, navigate to the ‘Object Toolbar’ at the bottom of the project timeline and select the ‘Collage’ object, followed by dragging the same to the ‘Image List’ to add the latter to your presentation.

You can alternatively press the F9 key from your system’s keyboard to run the slideshow.

<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Make-a-Material-Transparent-in-Blender"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Make-a-Material-Transparent-in-Blender" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to Make a Material Transparent in Blender"></a>Part 2 How to Make a Material Transparent in Blender</h2><p>Blender is a top class graphic modulation tool; you can use to play with your editing creativity to your heart’s content, catering to a variety of design requirements, while adhering to a distinguished professional outlook. If you are pondering over the perfect task choice to start your editing journey with Blender, you can begin with making a material transparent in the software.</p>
<p>When beginning to create transparent artworks in Blender, you need to be familiar with the Transparent BSDF node. Here’s a quick explanation:</p>
<p><strong>Transparent BSDF Node</strong></p>
<p>When working with Blender, you get to access a variety of graphic nodes that cater to specific design purposes. Likewise, the transparent BSDF, as the name suggests, is an exclusive transparency creation graphic node that is essential to make materials transparent in Blender. Talking of the specific node function, it is there to facilitate the control of different transparency modes, in cohesion with specific user requirements.</p>
<p>Browse through the following section for a guided tutorial to make a material transparent using Blender:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p>Prepare a suitable BSDF material by selecting any image from your device and applying it to the object in the Blender’s viewport.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p>To start working with the Transparent BSDF node, you first need to insert the same into the node tree amongst the Principle BSDF and the Mix Shader nodes. To do this, you need to select ‘Add’ or press ‘Ctrl + A’, followed by locating the same in the ‘Shader’ submenu. Do not forget to add the ‘Mix Shader’ node, which is again, present in the ‘Shader’ submenu, to the node tree.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p>
<p>Plug in the Transparent BSDF output into the top Shader input of the Mix Shader, while dragging the latter into the connecting link between the Material Output and Principle BSDF nodes. This enables the Mix Shader node to pass through the two output generating nodes. The resultant ‘Transparency Effect’ can be seen on the viewpoint object within a few seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong></p>
<p>Make an additional connection of two fresh nodes into the node tree as follows:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Transparent BSDF output to the Mix Shader input</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Principal BSDF output to the Mix Shader input</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Mix Shader output to the Surface input</p>
<p>This will finally fetch a transparent material output for the selected image object.</p>

If you are pondering over the perfect task choice to start your editing journey with Blender, you can begin with making a material transparent in the software.</p>
<p>When beginning to create transparent artworks in Blender, you need to be familiar with the Transparent BSDF node. Here’s a quick explanation:</p>
<p><strong>Transparent BSDF Node</strong></p>
<p>When working with Blender, you get to access a variety of graphic nodes that cater to specific design purposes. Likewise, the transparent BSDF, as the name suggests, is an exclusive transparency creation graphic node that is essential to make materials transparent in Blender. Talking of the specific node function, it is there to facilitate the control of different transparency modes, in cohesion with specific user requirements.</p>
<p>Browse through the following section for a guided tutorial to make a material transparent using Blender:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p>Prepare a suitable BSDF material by selecting any image from your device and applying it to the object in the Blender’s viewport.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p>To start working with the Transparent BSDF node, you first need to insert the same into the node tree amongst the Principle BSDF and the Mix Shader nodes. To do this, you need to select ‘Add’ or press ‘Ctrl + A’, followed by locating the same in the ‘Shader’ submenu. Do not forget to add the ‘Mix Shader’ node, which is again, present in the ‘Shader’ submenu, to the node tree.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p>
<p>Plug in the Transparent BSDF output into the top Shader input of the Mix Shader, while dragging the latter into the connecting link between the Material Output and Principle BSDF nodes. This enables the Mix Shader node to pass through the two output generating nodes. The resultant ‘Transparency Effect’ can be seen on the viewpoint object within a few seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong></p>
<p>Make an additional connection of two fresh nodes into the node tree as follows:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Transparent BSDF output to the Mix Shader input</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Principal BSDF output to the Mix Shader input</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Mix Shader output to the Surface input</p>
<p>This will finally fetch a transparent material output for the selected image object.</p>

If you are pondering over the perfect task choice to start your editing journey with Blender, you can begin with making a material transparent in the software.</p>
<p>When beginning to create transparent artworks in Blender, you need to be familiar with the Transparent BSDF node. Here’s a quick explanation:</p>
<p><strong>Transparent BSDF Node</strong></p>
<p>When working with Blender, you get to access a variety of graphic nodes that cater to specific design purposes. Likewise, the transparent BSDF, as the name suggests, is an exclusive transparency creation graphic node that is essential to make materials transparent in Blender. Talking of the specific node function, it is there to facilitate the control of different transparency modes, in cohesion with specific user requirements.</p>
<p>Browse through the following section for a guided tutorial to make a material transparent using Blender:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p>Prepare a suitable BSDF material by selecting any image from your device and applying it to the object in the Blender’s viewport.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p>To start working with the Transparent BSDF node, you first need to insert the same into the node tree amongst the Principle BSDF and the Mix Shader nodes. To do this, you need to select ‘Add’ or press ‘Ctrl + A’, followed by locating the same in the ‘Shader’ submenu. Do not forget to add the ‘Mix Shader’ node, which is again, present in the ‘Shader’ submenu, to the node tree.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p>
<p>Plug in the Transparent BSDF output into the top Shader input of the Mix Shader, while dragging the latter into the connecting link between the Material Output and Principle BSDF nodes. This enables the Mix Shader node to pass through the two output generating nodes. The resultant ‘Transparency Effect’ can be seen on the viewpoint object within a few seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong></p>
<p>Make an additional connection of two fresh nodes into the node tree as follows:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Transparent BSDF output to the Mix Shader input</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Principal BSDF output to the Mix Shader input</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Mix Shader output to the Surface input</p>
<p>This will finally fetch a transparent material output for the selected image object.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p>Begin with choosing a suitable image to create a transparent background in either of the Eevee or Cycles render engines, followed by navigating to the ‘Render Properties’ tab in the software’s main interface. Click on the same to get a related drop down menu for activating selected image effects.</p>

<p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Import Image File</strong></p>
<p>When you are done with the installation, launch the software and navigate to the ’Import’ tab in its welcome interface. Click and tap ‘Import Media File’ from the dropdown that appears to import the desired image to Filmora’s media library.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Blender-tips-how-to-make-blender-render-transparent-background-8.JPG"
                      alt="Filmora- Media Import Interface"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Drag to Timeline</strong></p>
<p>The next step is to drag your image selection from the software’s media library to its editor timeline. Either right click the image and select ‘Insert’ option from the submenu that appears, or use the conventional ‘Drag and Drop’ method to accomplish this task.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Blender-tips-how-to-make-blender-render-transparent-background-9.JPG"
                      alt="Filmora- Image Timeline Dragging"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Transparency Adjustments</strong></p>
<p>Once the image reaches the timeline, tap the same to see the ‘Settings’ tab get opened. Navigate through the tab options until you find ‘Chroma Key Settings’. Enable the ‘Chroma Key’ with a right side toggle to see your selected image get transparent with a ‘Green’ color in the background.</p>
<p>An alternative to the above method is to hit the ‘Color Picker’ option to the right of the ‘Select Color’ tab and navigate to a desired section of the image to make it transparent with a single click.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Blender-tips-how-to-make-blender-render-transparent-background-10.JPG"
                      alt="Filmora- Image Transparency Adjustments"
                ></p>
<p>If you observe partial transparency in the resultant image background, consider making additional adjustments in ’Chroma Key’ setting parameters like, offset, edge thickness, tolerance, edge feather, etc., to ensure that the image background is totally transparent. When the final artwork makes you happy, tap ‘OK’.</p>

                      alt="Filmora- Additional Chroma Key Settings"
                ></p>
