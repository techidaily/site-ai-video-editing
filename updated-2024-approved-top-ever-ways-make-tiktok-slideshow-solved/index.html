You should however take caution to add all the files in a common language.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Language Selection</strong></p>
<p>Navigate to the ‘Language List’ window and pick a preferred language to convert the text files into audio transcripts. Remember to choose the same conversion language as added of the ‘Text Window’ files in Step 2, lest you would end up getting an undesirable speech output.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Voice Selection</strong></p>
<p>As you complete Step 4, a series of preset text to speech voice alternatives present within your system for the preferred language will show up in the ‘Voice Window’. Proceed to select the voice type you like.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Read Aloud!</strong></p>
<p>After you have selected the voice, tap the ‘Speak’ button and start reading your text aloud. Amid the process, you will see the ‘Stop’, ‘Resume’ and ‘Pause’ buttons getting enabled.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7: Save Your Transcription</strong></p>
<p>When you have finished reading the text, click on the ‘Stop’ button to end the transcription process. The ‘Save as Audio’ option gets enabled, allowing you to convert your text into speech in the MP3, OGG, WAV and FLAC file formats.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8: Customize Your Audio</strong></p>
<p>The Panopreter program lets you add suitable customizations to the transcribed audio to ensure affordable file size and sound quality. You can adjust the bit rate and sample rate to address the aforesaid concern. All you need to do is, head to the ‘Menu Options’ at the top of the app screen and select ‘Settings’.</p>
<p>Click on the ‘Audio Format’ option within the ‘Settings’ window pops up, followed by selecting a suitable format for the audio file. On most cases, the WAV format works best to address the output quality requirements in an affordable manner.</p>
