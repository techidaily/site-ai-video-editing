<h2 id="Part-1-What-Scene-is-Photoshop’s-Color-Matching-Generally-Used-For"><a href="#Part-1-What-Scene-is-Photoshop’s-Color-Matching-Generally-Used-For" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What Scene is Photoshop’s Color Matching Generally Used For?"></a>Part 1 What Scene is Photoshop’s Color Matching Generally Used For?</h2><p>You can <strong>match color in Photoshop</strong> in just a few simple steps. And as far as the question of what scene can be used for it, you can use any and every photo you want to match the colour for. And the following steps will be noting how you can adjust the color of an image in Photoshop.</p>
<p><strong>Step</strong> Open both the images, the one you want to alter and the one you want to change it with. And if it is just one image, open and select that one image.</p>
<p><strong>Step</strong> Choose the “Image” and then select the “Adjustment” option. And after you choose the “Adjustment” option, go to the “Match Colour” option. You will be noticing the target photo that you have opted for.</p>
<p><strong>Step</strong> You will find the “Image Statistics” portion in the dialogue portion. Opt for the “Source” list and select the image name consisting of the shades and hues you would want your image to be altered. You will notice a thumbnail appearing in the dialogue as you do so. And you will automatically see the colours of the photo have changed.</p>
<p><strong>Step</strong> Now use the “Preview” feature to see the <strong>photoshop match colour tone</strong>, and then you will be done with adjusting the colour!</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-perfectly-match-colors-in-Photoshop-when-combining-photos"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-perfectly-match-colors-in-Photoshop-when-combining-photos" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to perfectly match colors in Photoshop when combining photos"></a>Part 2 How to perfectly match colors in Photoshop when combining photos</h2><p>Now, we will be discussing the different steps that will help you <strong>match color from photo</strong> in Photoshop, with absolute precision and effortlessness. Here is the list of steps that you would need to follow to <strong>match skin tone in Photoshop</strong> most perfectly.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1 Duplicate the background of the original photo</strong></p>
<p>The first and the most essential step to <strong>match lighting photoshop</strong> or the colour or any other editing task is to duplicate the background of the original image. The reason for this is that without this step, we might lose out on the original background information, which is essential for the image.</p>
<p>And to duplicate the background of an image in Photoshop, you need to use a few shortcuts of your keyboard. If you are using a Windows device, then the shortcut for this will be “Ctrl+J”, and if you are using Mac, then the shortcut will be “ Command+J”.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-1.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop duplicate layer"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2 Select the Image whose colour you want to change.</strong></p>
<p>Photoshop has several selection tools. Choose one of the many selection tools. You might choose the “Pen Tool” or the “Lasso Tool” or anything else. Select the image with the tool by drawing along the image with the tool. And when you are done with tracing the image with the selection tool of your choice, you will see a border marching around the image.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-2.jpg"
                      alt="selection tool"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3 Select the area of the second image</strong></p>
<p>You will need the selection tool again. The second image is the one that consists of the colour you would want the original image to match with. So, use the selection tool again to trace out an area in the second picture with the colour you want.</p>
<p>Ensure that you trace out a substantial area with the colour you need. You need not be highly precise with selecting the area. Instead, focus on covering a large area so that you can cover up the different shades and hues of the colour.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-3.jpg"
                      alt="select purple"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4 Move back to the original picture</strong></p>
<p>We will proceed with the “Colour Match” feature in Photoshop, but before that, you must make sure that you have the original image selected. The technical term to use here is “Focus”. So, ensure that the original image is in focus.</p>
<p>You can bring the original image into “focus” by clicking anywhere inside the document’s window where the original image is present. And that will automatically bring back the focus to the original image.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5 Bring the “Colour Match” command into function</strong></p>
<p>After selecting the original image, reach out to the “Image” option and click on the “Adjustments” option. You will find the “Match Colour” option; click on it.</p>
<p>There are two sections of the “Color Match” option. One is the “Image Statistics” portion, and the other is the “Destination Image”. The “destination Image” portion consists of the name of the original image and a few image settings as well. The options include “luminescence”, “color intensity”, “fade”, and “neutralize”.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6 Head to the “Image Statistics” portion</strong></p>
<p>The “Image Statistics” portion consists of the “Source” option. It is present in the bottom down part of the “Image Statistics” box. It is a drop-down box, and you will have to click on it. Tap on the small downward arrow beside the “Source” option and then choose the second image where you traced out the area of the colour you would want your original image to have.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-5.jpg"
                      alt="match color source"
                ></p>
<p>Your image might have more than one layer, and if so, you will have to opt for the correct layer from the “Layer” option of Photoshop.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7 Select the correct options in the “Image Statistics” area</strong></p>
<p>In the “Image Statistics” portion, you will find some options, such as “Use Selection in Source to Calculate Colours” and “Use Selection In Target To Calculate Adjustment”. You will have to click on this option and agree to them. It will instruct Photoshop to follow these instructions and colour match photos accordingly.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-6.jpg"
                      alt="match color"
                ></p>
<p>Click on “OK” after doing the changes mentioned above and exit the dialogue box to proceed with the next step.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8 Add “Adjustment Layer”</strong></p>
<p>Go to the “Layers” option and then opt for the “Layers Palette” present at the bottom. Then select “New Adjustment Layer” and click on the “Levels” option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-7.jpg"
                      alt="choose levels"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 9 Adjust the Pointers</strong></p>
<p>You will find two pointers, one black and the other white. You will have to bring both the pointers to the centre of the line.</p>

Here is the list of steps that you would need to follow to <strong>match skin tone in Photoshop</strong> most perfectly.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1 Duplicate the background of the original photo</strong></p>
<p>The first and the most essential step to <strong>match lighting photoshop</strong> or the colour or any other editing task is to duplicate the background of the original image. The reason for this is that without this step, we might lose out on the original background information, which is essential for the image.</p>
<p>And to duplicate the background of an image in Photoshop, you need to use a few shortcuts of your keyboard. If you are using a Windows device, then the shortcut for this will be “Ctrl+J”, and if you are using Mac, then the shortcut will be “ Command+J”.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="photoshop duplicate layer"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2 Select the Image whose colour you want to change.</strong></p>
<p>Photoshop has several selection tools. Choose one of the many selection tools. You might choose the “Pen Tool” or the “Lasso Tool” or anything else. Select the image with the tool by drawing along the image with the tool. And when you are done with tracing the image with the selection tool of your choice, you will see a border marching around the image.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-2.jpg"
                      alt="selection tool"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3 Select the area of the second image</strong></p>
<p>You will need the selection tool again. The second image is the one that consists of the colour you would want the original image to match with. So, use the selection tool again to trace out an area in the second picture with the colour you want.</p>
<p>Ensure that you trace out a substantial area with the colour you need. You need not be highly precise with selecting the area. Instead, focus on covering a large area so that you can cover up the different shades and hues of the colour.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="select purple"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4 Move back to the original picture</strong></p>
<p>We will proceed with the “Colour Match” feature in Photoshop, but before that, you must make sure that you have the original image selected. The technical term to use here is “Focus”. So, ensure that the original image is in focus.</p>
<p>You can bring the original image into “focus” by clicking anywhere inside the document’s window where the original image is present. And that will automatically bring back the focus to the original image.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5 Bring the “Colour Match” command into function</strong></p>
<p>After selecting the original image, reach out to the “Image” option and click on the “Adjustments” option. You will find the “Match Colour” option; click on it.</p>
<p>There are two sections of the “Color Match” option. One is the “Image Statistics” portion, and the other is the “Destination Image”. The “destination Image” portion consists of the name of the original image and a few image settings as well. The options include “luminescence”, “color intensity”, “fade”, and “neutralize”.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6 Head to the “Image Statistics” portion</strong></p>
<p>The “Image Statistics” portion consists of the “Source” option. It is present in the bottom down part of the “Image Statistics” box. It is a drop-down box, and you will have to click on it. Tap on the small downward arrow beside the “Source” option and then choose the second image where you traced out the area of the colour you would want your original image to have.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="match color source"
                ></p>
<p>Your image might have more than one layer, and if so, you will have to opt for the correct layer from the “Layer” option of Photoshop.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7 Select the correct options in the “Image Statistics” area</strong></p>
<p>In the “Image Statistics” portion, you will find some options, such as “Use Selection in Source to Calculate Colours” and “Use Selection In Target To Calculate Adjustment”. You will have to click on this option and agree to them. It will instruct Photoshop to follow these instructions and colour match photos accordingly.</p>

                      alt="match color"
                ></p>
<p>Click on “OK” after doing the changes mentioned above and exit the dialogue box to proceed with the next step.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8 Add “Adjustment Layer”</strong></p>
<p>Go to the “Layers” option and then opt for the “Layers Palette” present at the bottom. Then select “New Adjustment Layer” and click on the “Levels” option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="choose levels"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 9 Adjust the Pointers</strong></p>
<p>You will find two pointers, one black and the other white. You will have to bring both the pointers to the centre of the line.</p>
<p>Then click on “OK” and exit the box to proceed with the next step.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="level adjustment layer"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 10 Select “Luminosity”</strong></p>
<p>You will find the “Blend Mode” in the “Layers palette”. Select the “Blend Mode” from there. You will find it reflecting “Normal”, which is the default setting. You need to click on the small drop-down arrow and change the option from “Normal” to “Luminosity”.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 10 Select “Luminosity”</strong></p>
<p>You will find the “Blend Mode” in the “Layers palette”. Select the “Blend Mode” from there. You will find it reflecting “Normal”, which is the default setting. You need to click on the small drop-down arrow and change the option from “Normal” to “Luminosity”.</p>

<p>02 [How to perfectly match colors in Photoshop when combining photos?](#Part 2)</p>
<p>03 [Is There Any Other Ways to Use Color Matching?](#Part 3)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-Scene-is-Photoshop’s-Color-Matching-Generally-Used-For-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-Scene-is-Photoshop’s-Color-Matching-Generally-Used-For-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What Scene is Photoshop’s Color Matching Generally Used For?"></a>Part 1 What Scene is Photoshop’s Color Matching Generally Used For?</h2><p>You can <strong>match color in Photoshop</strong> in just a few simple steps. And as far as the question of what scene can be used for it, you can use any and every photo you want to match the colour for. And the following steps will be noting how you can adjust the color of an image in Photoshop.</p>
<p><strong>Step</strong> Open both the images, the one you want to alter and the one you want to change it with. And if it is just one image, open and select that one image.</p>
<p><strong>Step</strong> Choose the “Image” and then select the “Adjustment” option. And after you choose the “Adjustment” option, go to the “Match Colour” option. You will be noticing the target photo that you have opted for.</p>
<p><strong>Step</strong> You will find the “Image Statistics” portion in the dialogue portion. Opt for the “Source” list and select the image name consisting of the shades and hues you would want your image to be altered. You will notice a thumbnail appearing in the dialogue as you do so. And you will automatically see the colours of the photo have changed.</p>
<p><strong>Step</strong> Now use the “Preview” feature to see the <strong>photoshop match colour tone</strong>, and then you will be done with adjusting the colour!</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-perfectly-match-colors-in-Photoshop-when-combining-photos-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-perfectly-match-colors-in-Photoshop-when-combining-photos-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to perfectly match colors in Photoshop when combining photos"></a>Part 2 How to perfectly match colors in Photoshop when combining photos</h2><p>Now, we will be discussing the different steps that will help you <strong>match color from photo</strong> in Photoshop, with absolute precision and effortlessness. Here is the list of steps that you would need to follow to <strong>match skin tone in Photoshop</strong> most perfectly.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1 Duplicate the background of the original photo</strong></p>
<p>The first and the most essential step to <strong>match lighting photoshop</strong> or the colour or any other editing task is to duplicate the background of the original image. The reason for this is that without this step, we might lose out on the original background information, which is essential for the image.</p>
<p>And to duplicate the background of an image in Photoshop, you need to use a few shortcuts of your keyboard. If you are using a Windows device, then the shortcut for this will be “Ctrl+J”, and if you are using Mac, then the shortcut will be “ Command+J”.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-1.jpg"
                      alt="photoshop duplicate layer"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2 Select the Image whose colour you want to change.</strong></p>
<p>Photoshop has several selection tools. Choose one of the many selection tools. You might choose the “Pen Tool” or the “Lasso Tool” or anything else. Select the image with the tool by drawing along the image with the tool. And when you are done with tracing the image with the selection tool of your choice, you will see a border marching around the image.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-2.jpg"
                      alt="selection tool"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3 Select the area of the second image</strong></p>
<p>You will need the selection tool again. The second image is the one that consists of the colour you would want the original image to match with. So, use the selection tool again to trace out an area in the second picture with the colour you want.</p>
<p>Ensure that you trace out a substantial area with the colour you need. You need not be highly precise with selecting the area. Instead, focus on covering a large area so that you can cover up the different shades and hues of the colour.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-3.jpg"
                      alt="select purple"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4 Move back to the original picture</strong></p>
<p>We will proceed with the “Colour Match” feature in Photoshop, but before that, you must make sure that you have the original image selected. The technical term to use here is “Focus”. So, ensure that the original image is in focus.</p>
<p>You can bring the original image into “focus” by clicking anywhere inside the document’s window where the original image is present. And that will automatically bring back the focus to the original image.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5 Bring the “Colour Match” command into function</strong></p>
<p>After selecting the original image, reach out to the “Image” option and click on the “Adjustments” option. You will find the “Match Colour” option; click on it.</p>
<p>There are two sections of the “Color Match” option. One is the “Image Statistics” portion, and the other is the “Destination Image”. The “destination Image” portion consists of the name of the original image and a few image settings as well. The options include “luminescence”, “color intensity”, “fade”, and “neutralize”.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6 Head to the “Image Statistics” portion</strong></p>
<p>The “Image Statistics” portion consists of the “Source” option. It is present in the bottom down part of the “Image Statistics” box. It is a drop-down box, and you will have to click on it. Tap on the small downward arrow beside the “Source” option and then choose the second image where you traced out the area of the colour you would want your original image to have.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="match color source"
                ></p>
<p>Your image might have more than one layer, and if so, you will have to opt for the correct layer from the “Layer” option of Photoshop.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7 Select the correct options in the “Image Statistics” area</strong></p>
<p>In the “Image Statistics” portion, you will find some options, such as “Use Selection in Source to Calculate Colours” and “Use Selection In Target To Calculate Adjustment”. You will have to click on this option and agree to them. It will instruct Photoshop to follow these instructions and colour match photos accordingly.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="match color"
                ></p>
<p>Click on “OK” after doing the changes mentioned above and exit the dialogue box to proceed with the next step.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8 Add “Adjustment Layer”</strong></p>
<p>Go to the “Layers” option and then opt for the “Layers Palette” present at the bottom. Then select “New Adjustment Layer” and click on the “Levels” option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="choose levels"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 9 Adjust the Pointers</strong></p>
<p>You will find two pointers, one black and the other white. You will have to bring both the pointers to the centre of the line.</p>
<p>Then click on “OK” and exit the box to proceed with the next step.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="level adjustment layer"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 10 Select “Luminosity”</strong></p>
<p>You will find the “Blend Mode” in the “Layers palette”. Select the “Blend Mode” from there. You will find it reflecting “Normal”, which is the default setting. You need to click on the small drop-down arrow and change the option from “Normal” to “Luminosity”.</p>
