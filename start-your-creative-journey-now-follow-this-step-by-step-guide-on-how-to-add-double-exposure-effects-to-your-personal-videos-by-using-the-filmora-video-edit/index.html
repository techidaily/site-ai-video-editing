<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p>
<p>To start your creative journey, you can hone your skills by focusing on at least one technique and progressively learning new skills. One of the various video editing techniques you can employ is double exposure. This method is based on an old technique in photography in which a film is exposed twice to create a single image. This article shows you how to use the same method to combine two or more video clips and create a double exposure effect.</p>
<p>You can create artistic videos that tell various stories and captivate viewers by using Filmora. The following steps describe how to create a double exposure effect in Filmora.</p>
<p>Step1 Download the Filmora application</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-double-exposure-effect-in-filmora-1.jpg"
                      alt="filmora download page"
                ></p>
<p>Before you start editing, click <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://bit.ly/3tav2d5" >https://bit.ly/3tav2d5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to download the Filmora app. On the page that appears, click the <strong>Free Download</strong> option. Then, the Filmora installer is automatically downloaded. To start installing Filmora, double-click the installer and click <strong>Agree</strong> to agree with the terms and conditions. Then, wait for approximately 2 minutes for the installation to complete.</p>
<p>Step2 Start a new project in Filmora</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-double-exposure-effect-in-filmora-2.jpg"
                      alt="set up a new project"
                ></p>
<p>After a successful installation, the app automatically runs, and you can start editing videos. Click <strong>New Project</strong> to start a project on a clean canvas.</p>
<p>Before starting a new project, we recommend you plan a theme for your videos. You can incorporate different elements into your videos to convey a dramatic, light, or fun theme. This step will help you communicate the mood and message you want to convey to the audience.</p>
<p>Step3 Select a foreground video</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-double-exposure-effect-in-filmora-3.jpg"
                      alt="add a base video"
                ></p>
<p>To create a trendy double exposure effect, record a video clip with a white or neutral background. Then, import the specified video to Filmora. In the second layer of the video editing pane, drag the video.</p>
<p>The first video is called the foreground video, which serves as the base video to achieve the desired double exposure effect. It is important to choose neutral or calm colors to make it easier for you to remove the background and highlight the main subject of your video.</p>
<p>Step4 Edit the foreground video</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-double-exposure-effect-in-filmora-4.jpg"
                      alt="adjust the color settings of the foreground video"

                      alt="set up a new project"
                ></p>
<p>After a successful installation, the app automatically runs, and you can start editing videos. Click <strong>New Project</strong> to start a project on a clean canvas.</p>
<p>Before starting a new project, we recommend you plan a theme for your videos. You can incorporate different elements into your videos to convey a dramatic, light, or fun theme. This step will help you communicate the mood and message you want to convey to the audience.</p>
<p>Step3 Select a foreground video</p>
