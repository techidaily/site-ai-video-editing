Sometimes, even though the video has informative content, the content might not be attractive to the viewers for various reasons, like the content might be routine and does not have more reach, likes, or shares. Along with good content, we also need new and creative ideas to get more viewers. Thus, we have some tools to provide unique and innovative ideas based on the niche you choose.</p>
<p>Videos Idea Generator is a tool that gives ideas for YouTube videos, and it works based on AI technology (Neural Networks). This tool will be more beneficial for the content creators to get more <strong>AI video ideas</strong>. Naturally, you might be out of ideas for your channel, or sometimes it takes more time to get an idea, or it could be a routine idea that does not sound interesting to the viewers. In such cases, <strong>an AI video idea generator</strong> is more helpful in suggesting new and innovative ideas for the content creators based on their interesting topics.</p>
<p>Some of the advantages of a video idea generator are:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Time-saving – as one can utilize the time in other work, such as editing the video&#x2F; adding subtitles, etc., instead of thinking of an idea.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Engaging with the audience – can utilize the time in engaging with the audience by answering their questions.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Promote videos – can utilize time to promote their videos on other social media platforms or collaborate with other content creators for promotions.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Add animations – animations and other visual effects can be added to the videos using AI. Also, we can add video and audio summaries after each video so that the viewers can get brief detailing of the whole video.</p>
<p><strong>How to use Videos Idea Generator:</strong></p>
<p>There are different <strong>AI video idea generator</strong> tools, and most of them work similarly. The most common steps are:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Provide Topic</strong></p>
<p>Here you need to provide the topic’s name on which we are planning to create the video.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Provide Keywords</strong></p>
<p>After providing a topic, give the keywords required for publishing. The video needs to have all the keywords so that the main content of the video can project adequately.</p>
<p>Based on the topic name and keywords, the tool will generate suggestions for the video ideas using the Neural Network concept of Artificial Learning.</p>

Once you get clarity on the area of interest, it’s easy to pick a topic from that and create an innovative video. Try to be more specific in the topic you choose. Also, have clarity on the section of audience you want to target.</p>
<p>For example, if your topic is more related to children, add more animations of animals&#x2F; cartoons that interest children. If you choose a related topic, do not add more animations that might confuse the audience. Add more reference links so that they can refer to those and be more particular on the specific topic you are trying to explain through the video. Similarly, if you choose a gaming-related topic, do not be more general about gaming.</p>
<p>Be specific towards a particular section of games like mobile gaming&#x2F; desktop&#x2F; virtual to reach more audience, and it does not seem boring to the audience.</p>

Any video related to any technology course can get more views. Using <strong>the YouTube video idea generator AI</strong> tool, you can generate more unique videos related to education.

These tools usually work in three simple steps.</p>
<ul>
<li>Analyze the footage,</li>
<li>Separate the subject or “subjects” from the background,</li>
<li>Switch backgrounds.</li>
</ul>
<p>The process starts when a user uploads a video clip. The tool analyzes the footage and separates the subjects from the background. The user can select other available pre-made backgrounds or upload a preferred one to the platform. After this process, users can share the finished video or save it to their devices. Other kinds of background changers only merge a transparent clip with a background.</p>
