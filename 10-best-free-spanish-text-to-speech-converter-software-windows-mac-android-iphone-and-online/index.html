<p><strong>Tools To Use to Combine videos for Instagram.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Wondershare Filmora is an easy-to-use video merger.</li>
</ol>
<p>Before I detail online video joiners, I’d like to mention Wondershare Filmora, which can automatically merge video files without or with transitions. It merges video files with the same or various file extensions in 1:1 quality (.mp4, .mov, .mkv, .avi, etc). Continue reading to learn more about this simple video merging and how to merge videos.</p>
<p>Part 2: Using Filmora to combine, merge, and join clips</p>
<p>To join videos, first, import them.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/combine-video-instagram-2.jpg"
                      alt="combine-video-instagram-"
                ></p>
<p>You can drag the files from Windows File Explorer to the User’s Album or click the “Import” button on the window and choose files from your computer. All imported files will appear in thumbnail format in the User’s Album. To preview a file in the right-hand preview window, double-click it.</p>
<ol>
<li>To merge video files, drag &amp; drop them.</li>
</ol>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/combine-video-instagram-3.jpg"
                      alt="combine-video-instagram-"
                ></p>
<p>Move videos from the User’s Album to the video track on the Timeline after that. All video files will be combined into a single video with no transition. However, you can use the following method to add transitions between video clips.</p>
<ol>
<li>Add transitions in the third step (optional)</li>
</ol>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/combine-video-instagram-4.jpg"
                      alt="combine-video-instagram-"
                ></p>
<p>Add transitions between clips for a smooth transition from one to the next to make the linked videos look like a complete movie. Go to the Transition tab and drag the desired change to the intersection of two clips. You can also right-click any transition to bring up a menu with choices such as “Apply to All” and “Random to All” for your convenience.</p>
<p>Step 4: Combine video files into a single file.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="combine-video-instagram-"
                ></p>
<p>Now that you’ve seen the merged Movie click the “Export” option to save the several video segments to a single file. Select any format from the list under the Format tab. All of the most common video formats are supported. Choose “Device” and choose the thumbnail of your device to play the combined video file on iPod, iPhone, or iPad. You may also publish the combined Video on YouTube or burn it to DVDs to watch on television.</p>
