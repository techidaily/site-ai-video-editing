<h2 id="Adjust-the-aspect-ratio"><a href="#Adjust-the-aspect-ratio" class="headerlink" title="Adjust the aspect ratio"></a>Adjust the aspect ratio</h2><p>The aspect ratio is known as the size of the video frame. For example, the most common aspect ratios are 16:9 and 4:3. The first number represents the width, and the second represents the height.</p>
<p>You should always ask your cinematographer about the aspect ratio. There are chances when cameras won’t shoot at the intended aspect ratio they were framed for. In that case, you’ll need to crop or letterbox them when editing.</p>

<h2 id="Assembly"><a href="#Assembly" class="headerlink" title="Assembly"></a>Assembly</h2><p>The next step is assembly. You will arrange the shots, clips, and elements in this process and get everything in order. It can be daunting and inspiring for you, as it’s a blank canvas you are going to start with. Before editing, you can also get some guidance from your art director.</p>
<p>If your music video has shots of the band performing, drop them off first and sync them with the audio. On the contrary, if you are doing a narrative style, you can arrange the shots according to the story you want to portray.</p>

<h2 id="Send-your-first-draft"><a href="#Send-your-first-draft" class="headerlink" title="Send your first draft"></a>Send your first draft</h2><p>The first draft is the video in which you added audio and re-ordered the shots. You decided on the pace and flow of the video to create a basic structure. You made changes to make it interesting and captivating.</p>
<p>Before you put too much effort into editing your video, send it to your director, producer, or client for review. It will help ensure that any big changes can be made before you invest too much time in the edit.</p>
<p>For first drafts, you don’t need anything fancy. A lower-resolution and more compressed file can make sending it to a director or client much easier. You can also add a timer on the music video, so the person reviewing it can give you accurate timing on where he wants any revision.</p>
<h3 id="How-to-add-the-timer-in-the-music-video"><a href="#How-to-add-the-timer-in-the-music-video" class="headerlink" title="How to add the timer in the music video?"></a>How to add the timer in the music video?</h3><ol>
<li>Click on <strong>Effects</strong> and search for <strong>Timecode</strong> in the search bar.</li>
<li>Choose the timer style you like and drop it onto the new timeline.</li>
<li>Extend the timer to the end of the video.</li>
<li>Adjust the position and add the duration of your music video.</li>
</ol>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="adding timer"
                ></p>
<p>Now you are all set to export the first draft of your music video. You can also adjust the video format on the export option, but MP4 is recommended.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>We hope this blog has helped you edit the initials of your music video. By adjusting the aspect ratio to fit the desired screen size and properly planning the first cut, you can lay a solid foundation for the rest of the editing process.</p>
<p>These two steps can greatly impact the overall look and feel of the final product. Remember to communicate with your director, producer, or client throughout the process to ensure that the final product meets their expectations.</p>

<p>AR i.e. Augmented reality is a unique approach that is trendy for its variety of applications. It is a technology that provides the composite view to the user’s perception of real world images and videos.</p>
<p>It is a great development in the direction of technological advancement. AR is the concept that combines real-life objects with simulated 3D objects. Businesses use this approach to make their products more presentable and lively for the customers. Whereas, it is also very helpful for the users to experiment and have fun. With the evolution of this approach, now there are many applications available in the market that offers AR functionaltiy.

<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-the-Difference-Between-VR-and-AR"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-the-Difference-Between-VR-and-AR" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What Is the Difference Between VR and AR?"></a>Part 1 What Is the Difference Between VR and AR?</h2><p>Both AR and VR use a distinctive approach and consider different use cases. They work on the concept of bringing a simulated environment to the user. Both VR i.e. the virtual reality and AR i.e. augmented reality are technologies used to replace or enhance the real-life environment with the simulated one. Virtual reality is the replacement of real-life environments with simulated ones. Whereas, Augmented reality is the procedure of augmenting the real-life environment with the addition of digital elements to a live view. This can be done by the camera on a smartphone.</p>
<p>The main aim of designing AR is to provide detailed information to the user about the real world. Its whole design is done by considering and adding the elements of the real world. Whereas, virtual reality is an entirely different simulation. It completely replaces the real-world environment with the virtual world.</p>
<p>Even Though both technologies are the simulation of the real world, they use different components of design and also have distinct targeted audiences. The concept behind VR is to distance the user from the real world as much as possible. Whereas, the concept of AR works with the real world to create a simulated environment.</p>
<p>The use of an eye-covering headset and headphones is very common to make an illusion of the real world, in the case of VR. Whereas, AR is usually accomplished with a smartphone or tablet screen. Here, the camera of the phone is focused at a point to capture the live-streaming of a moment on the screen. The captured data is then prepared by adding some useful information.</p>
<p>The applications of VR are architecture and retail, training, product design, etc. Whereas, the applications of AR are diagnostic data, navigation information, repair instructions, etc. The availability of <strong>ar video maker</strong> also eases the task of the industries for the mentioned purposes.</p>

They work on the concept of bringing a simulated environment to the user. Both VR i.e. the virtual reality and AR i.e. augmented reality are technologies used to replace or enhance the real-life environment with the simulated one. Virtual reality is the replacement of real-life environments with simulated ones. Whereas, Augmented reality is the procedure of augmenting the real-life environment with the addition of digital elements to a live view. This can be done by the camera on a smartphone.</p>
<p>The main aim of designing AR is to provide detailed information to the user about the real world. Its whole design is done by considering and adding the elements of the real world. Whereas, virtual reality is an entirely different simulation. It completely replaces the real-world environment with the virtual world.</p>
<p>Even Though both technologies are the simulation of the real world, they use different components of design and also have distinct targeted audiences. The concept behind VR is to distance the user from the real world as much as possible. Whereas, the concept of AR works with the real world to create a simulated environment.</p>
<p>The use of an eye-covering headset and headphones is very common to make an illusion of the real world, in the case of VR. Whereas, AR is usually accomplished with a smartphone or tablet screen. Here, the camera of the phone is focused at a point to capture the live-streaming of a moment on the screen. The captured data is then prepared by adding some useful information.</p>
<p>The applications of VR are architecture and retail, training, product design, etc. Whereas, the applications of AR are diagnostic data, navigation information, repair instructions, etc. The availability of <strong>ar video maker</strong> also eases the task of the industries for the mentioned purposes.</p>

They work on the concept of bringing a simulated environment to the user. Both VR i.e. the virtual reality and AR i.e. augmented reality are technologies used to replace or enhance the real-life environment with the simulated one. Virtual reality is the replacement of real-life environments with simulated ones. Whereas, Augmented reality is the procedure of augmenting the real-life environment with the addition of digital elements to a live view. This can be done by the camera on a smartphone.</p>
<p>The main aim of designing AR is to provide detailed information to the user about the real world. Its whole design is done by considering and adding the elements of the real world. Whereas, virtual reality is an entirely different simulation. It completely replaces the real-world environment with the virtual world.</p>
<p>Even Though both technologies are the simulation of the real world, they use different components of design and also have distinct targeted audiences. The concept behind VR is to distance the user from the real world as much as possible. Whereas, the concept of AR works with the real world to create a simulated environment.</p>
<p>The use of an eye-covering headset and headphones is very common to make an illusion of the real world, in the case of VR. Whereas, AR is usually accomplished with a smartphone or tablet screen. Here, the camera of the phone is focused at a point to capture the live-streaming of a moment on the screen. The captured data is then prepared by adding some useful information.</p>
<p>The applications of VR are architecture and retail, training, product design, etc. Whereas, the applications of AR are diagnostic data, navigation information, repair instructions, etc. The availability of <strong>ar video maker</strong> also eases the task of the industries for the mentioned purposes.</p>

<p>Do you want to edit a time lapse video on an iPhone or want to know how to shoot a time-lapse video? If so, you’ve come to the right place.</p>
<p>Time-lapses, which show how much something changes over a period of time are some of the coolest videos you can make.</p>
<p>They aren’t exactly easy to make and edit at first, but we’ve put together this guide to take you through the steps. We’ll give you a few time lapse video ideas, steps to shoot them, and good practices for managing your footage after you’ve shot it.</p>
<p>Let’s get started.</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-A-Time-Lapse-Video"><a href="#What-Is-A-Time-Lapse-Video" class="headerlink" title="What Is A Time Lapse Video?"></a>What Is A Time Lapse Video?</h2><p>In its simplest definition, a time lapse video is a cinematography technique where the frequency at which film frames are captured (the frame rate) is much lower than that used to view the sequence.</p>
<p>When played at normal speed, time appears to be moving faster and thus lapsing. For example, an image of a scene may be captured once every second, then played back at 30 frames per second; the result is an apparent 30 times speed increase.</p>
<p>Time-lapse photography can be considered to be the opposite of slow motion.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Shoot-A-Time-Lapse-Video"><a href="#How-to-Shoot-A-Time-Lapse-Video" class="headerlink" title="How to Shoot A Time-Lapse Video?"></a>How to Shoot A Time-Lapse Video?</h2><h3 id="Subjects-to-shoot-in-a-time-lapse-video"><a href="#Subjects-to-shoot-in-a-time-lapse-video" class="headerlink" title="Subjects to shoot in a time-lapse video"></a>Subjects to shoot in a time-lapse video</h3><p>Wondering what can be shot in a time-lapse video? The answer is any subject that moves, grows, decays, or changes. But what’s more important than the subject is the motion and change that it goes through.</p>
<p>When shooting a time-lapse video, you are composing not only the shot but also the movement of the subject. If a subject doesn’t move or change throughout your film, then it is just a regular video. So try to think of subjects that are constantly moving or changing.</p>
<p>Time-Lapse videos are visually appealing and easy to make. When it comes to subjects that can be chosen to shoot in a time-lapse video, the possibilities are endless. But if you’re stuck for ideas, here are 10 suggestions to get you started:</p>
<h4 id="1-Sunset-Sunrise"><a href="#1-Sunset-Sunrise" class="headerlink" title="1. Sunset&#x2F;Sunrise"></a>1. Sunset&#x2F;Sunrise</h4><p>These are quite possibly the most common subjects for timelapse videos, but there’s a reason for it! Watching the sun go up and down is always mesmerizing.</p>
<h4 id="2-Clouds"><a href="#2-Clouds" class="headerlink" title="2. Clouds"></a>2. Clouds</h4><p>Clouds move very slowly most of the time, making them perfect for time-lapse sequences. You can shoot a single cloud passing overhead, or record a passing storm front as it sweeps across the sky. Depending on the weather conditions and movement of clouds, this can look stunning or simply spectacular!</p>
<h4 id="3-Starry-sky"><a href="#3-Starry-sky" class="headerlink" title="3. Starry sky"></a>3. Starry sky</h4><p>Probably one of the most fascinating time lapse videos is the ones with stars on the move. Time-lapses that capture the Milky Way or starry sky are becoming increasingly popular as camera technology improves. There are even some cameras now that have built-in settings specifically for capturing stars and other celestial bodies.</p>
<h4 id="4-Flowers"><a href="#4-Flowers" class="headerlink" title="4. Flowers"></a>4. Flowers</h4><p>Flowers blooming is another fantastic subject for time-lapse photography. The change can be incredibly subtle; however, if you shoot a timelapse over several days or weeks, you will be amazed at just how much they grow and change!</p>
<h4 id="5-Season-changing"><a href="#5-Season-changing" class="headerlink" title="5. Season changing"></a>5. Season changing</h4><p>The most obvious example is trees budding and shedding leaves, but all sorts of plants and animals follow seasonal cycles. You can see flowers blooming, grasses growing, and migrating birds. Even if you don’t have a chance to go somewhere exotic for your subject matter, you can find something interesting right outside your own door.</p>
<h4 id="6-Cars-or-Pedestrians"><a href="#6-Cars-or-Pedestrians" class="headerlink" title="6. Cars or Pedestrians"></a>6. Cars or Pedestrians</h4><p>If you want something a little more exciting then you can choose things like cars passing by or people walking on the street.</p>
<h4 id="7-Cooking-dinner"><a href="#7-Cooking-dinner" class="headerlink" title="7. Cooking dinner"></a>7. Cooking dinner</h4><p>Got a recipe for dinner that has lots of steps? Rather than just snap photos of the process, why not make a time-lapse video instead? It’s easy and fun to do, especially if you have kids who can help you out!</p>
<h4 id="8-DIY-projects"><a href="#8-DIY-projects" class="headerlink" title="8. DIY projects"></a>8. DIY projects</h4><p>Are you building something? Whether it’s a new table, shelves, or whatever else, set up your camera and take photos as you go along in a time lapse mode and you’ll get a fun time lapse video. It works well to show people how it all came together.</p>
<h4 id="9-Construction-work-in-progress"><a href="#9-Construction-work-in-progress" class="headerlink" title="9. Construction work in progress"></a>9. Construction work in progress</h4><p>If you’re watching construction work being done on your property or nearby, consider recording its time lapse video. It’s hard to imagine the amount of resources it takes to construct an office building or skyscraper before it’s finished. Time-lapse videos have helped reveal just how much work goes into something like that.</p>
<h4 id="10-A-fun-art-project"><a href="#10-A-fun-art-project" class="headerlink" title="10. A fun art project"></a>10. A fun art project</h4><p>Capturing a time lapse video of an art project can make a mesmerizing video. Whether it’s you or someone else doing the artwork, always capture its time lapse video to show to others what goes into completing an art project. All you need to do is to set your camera up on a tripod aimed at the canvas and capture one or two frames per second to get an excellent time lapse video.</p>
<h3 id="Steps-to-shoot-a-time-lapse-video"><a href="#Steps-to-shoot-a-time-lapse-video" class="headerlink" title="Steps to shoot a time-lapse video"></a>Steps to shoot a time-lapse video</h3><p>Time-lapse videography is something that most photographers and videographers are familiar with. But, shooting a time-lapse video needs more than setting the camera on a tripod and waiting for it to shoot for several hours.</p>
<p>The amazing thing about time-lapse videos is that they can be shot using your smartphone. There are apps and built-in camera settings to capture time lapse videos with just a click of the button.</p>
<p>If you want to create a time-lapse video that is high quality, you have to use professional cameras, and learn some important steps.</p>
<h4 id="1-Decide-on-a-subject"><a href="#1-Decide-on-a-subject" class="headerlink" title="1. Decide on a subject"></a>1. Decide on a subject</h4><p>The movement of clouds, a sunrise or sunset, waves crashing at the beach, cars coming and going in your parking lot, people walking around your office building — all of these subjects can yield great time-lapse sequences.</p>
<h4 id="2-Find-a-place-to-set-up-your-camera-on-tripod"><a href="#2-Find-a-place-to-set-up-your-camera-on-tripod" class="headerlink" title="2. Find a place to set up your camera on tripod"></a>2. Find a place to set up your camera on tripod</h4><p>While recording a time-lapse video, it’s important to keep the camera as stable as possible. It ensures a smooth video, making it visually appealing and easy to edit post-shooting. Typically, a tripod is needed for stable recording. If you are not using a tripod, find something steady and level to set it upon.</p>
<p><em>Important tip: Shoot only with manual settings. You don’t want the camera to adjust for you; rather, you should adjust the camera settings so that it takes optimal pictures. Even if you use auto mode, make sure you take control of the camera and push it to its limits to get great shots.</em></p>
<h4 id="3-Set-the-camera-focus"><a href="#3-Set-the-camera-focus" class="headerlink" title="3. Set the camera focus"></a>3. Set the camera focus</h4><p>Use either autofocus or manual focus to make sure the camera is focused on what you want to be the main subject of the video.</p>
<h4 id="4-Set-your-exposure-settings"><a href="#4-Set-your-exposure-settings" class="headerlink" title="4. Set your exposure settings"></a>4. Set your exposure settings</h4><p>Depending on how much the light is going to change over time, you may want to use aperture priority or shutter priority so that the camera will automatically adjust for changes in light. Or, if you know exactly how much light will be changing over time, you could set all exposure settings manually.</p>
<h4 id="5-Calculate-how-many-frames-and-shots-are-needed"><a href="#5-Calculate-how-many-frames-and-shots-are-needed" class="headerlink" title="5. Calculate how many frames and shots are needed"></a>5. Calculate how many frames and shots are needed</h4><p>For example, if you are shooting at 10 frames per second and want a total of 30 seconds of video at 24 fps (which is standard), you will need 720 frames&#x2F;photos (30 seconds x 24 fps &#x3D; 720 frames).</p>
<h4 id="6-Import-and-stitch-together"><a href="#6-Import-and-stitch-together" class="headerlink" title="6. Import and stitch together"></a>6. Import and stitch together</h4><p>Once you’ve captured the images, import them into a video editing software, stitch them together, and perform necessary editing.</p>

That’s where Wondershare Filmora comes into play.</p>
<p>Wondershare Filmore is a professional video editing software with a wide variety of basic to advanced-level editing tools. It allows for turning RAW videos into fun, engaging, and professional videos.</p>
<p>If you need to refine your time-lapse video, you can use it and benefit from its capabilities. Similarly, you can use it to speed up or slow down your time-lapse video.</p>
<p>Let’s see how you can do both with Filmora.</p>
<h3 id="Speed-up-your-time-lapse-video"><a href="#Speed-up-your-time-lapse-video" class="headerlink" title="Speed up your time-lapse video"></a>Speed up your time-lapse video</h3><p>Why speed up a time-lapse in the first place? There are a couple of reasons you might want to speed up your time-lapse.</p>
<p>When shooting with a fast lens, you might want to dial down the shutter speed to achieve more motion blur, to make the scenes more interesting. However, doing so can also create motion blur on time-lapse footage when sped up.</p>
<p>Another reason you might want to speed up your time-lapse is when you have too many frames. When you shoot at low frame rate (e.g. 15 FPS), not everyone will experience the same viewing quality if they don’t have high frame rate monitors. Speeding up the footage is one way to reduce the number of frames without compromising the quality of your video.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to speed up the time-lapse video using Filmora:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download and install Wondershare Filmora on your computer.</li>
<li>Launch Filmora and click the <strong>New project</strong> button to open the video editor or drag and drop the file directly.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h3 id="Slow-down-your-time-lapse-video"><a href="#Slow-down-your-time-lapse-video" class="headerlink" title="Slow down your time-lapse video"></a>Slow down your time-lapse video</h3><p>As the speed at which your time-lapse moves increases, so does the amount of motion blur. This can make for an undesirable look, especially in shots where there is already a lot of movement.</p>
<p>The best way to avoid this is to slow down your time-lapse as much as possible while still maintaining an interesting level of movement within your shot.</p>
<p>You can slow down your time-lapse video in Filmora following the same process as you’d do for speeding-up the video (Explained above). However, there’s only one catch; instead of opting for the <strong>Fast</strong> option choose <strong>Slow</strong> when you’re at step 4.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Hopefully, this guide has provided a good knowledge of how to put together your own time lapse video – and how to edit it on iPhone and Wondershare Filmora. It’s easier than you may think, and the resulting videos are quite impressive.</p>
<p>Take your time with it, record your movies from different angles, and don’t be afraid to create something unique and experimental.</p>

<p>Do you want to edit a time lapse video on an iPhone or want to know how to shoot a time-lapse video? If so, you’ve come to the right place.</p>
<p>Time-lapses, which show how much something changes over a period of time are some of the coolest videos you can make.</p>
<p>They aren’t exactly easy to make and edit at first, but we’ve put together this guide to take you through the steps. We’ll give you a few time lapse video ideas, steps to shoot them, and good practices for managing your footage after you’ve shot it.</p>
<p>Let’s get started.</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-A-Time-Lapse-Video-1"><a href="#What-Is-A-Time-Lapse-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="What Is A Time Lapse Video?"></a>What Is A Time Lapse Video?</h2><p>In its simplest definition, a time lapse video is a cinematography technique where the frequency at which film frames are captured (the frame rate) is much lower than that used to view the sequence.</p>
<p>When played at normal speed, time appears to be moving faster and thus lapsing. For example, an image of a scene may be captured once every second, then played back at 30 frames per second; the result is an apparent 30 times speed increase.</p>
<p>Time-lapse photography can be considered to be the opposite of slow motion.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Shoot-A-Time-Lapse-Video-1"><a href="#How-to-Shoot-A-Time-Lapse-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Shoot A Time-Lapse Video?"></a>How to Shoot A Time-Lapse Video?</h2><h3 id="Subjects-to-shoot-in-a-time-lapse-video-1"><a href="#Subjects-to-shoot-in-a-time-lapse-video-1" class="headerlink" title="Subjects to shoot in a time-lapse video"></a>Subjects to shoot in a time-lapse video</h3><p>Wondering what can be shot in a time-lapse video? The answer is any subject that moves, grows, decays, or changes. But what’s more important than the subject is the motion and change that it goes through.</p>
<p>When shooting a time-lapse video, you are composing not only the shot but also the movement of the subject. If a subject doesn’t move or change throughout your film, then it is just a regular video. So try to think of subjects that are constantly moving or changing.</p>
<p>Time-Lapse videos are visually appealing and easy to make. When it comes to subjects that can be chosen to shoot in a time-lapse video, the possibilities are endless. But if you’re stuck for ideas, here are 10 suggestions to get you started:</p>
<h4 id="1-Sunset-Sunrise-1"><a href="#1-Sunset-Sunrise-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Sunset&#x2F;Sunrise"></a>1. Sunset&#x2F;Sunrise</h4><p>These are quite possibly the most common subjects for timelapse videos, but there’s a reason for it! Watching the sun go up and down is always mesmerizing.</p>
<h4 id="2-Clouds-1"><a href="#2-Clouds-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Clouds"></a>2. Clouds</h4><p>Clouds move very slowly most of the time, making them perfect for time-lapse sequences. You can shoot a single cloud passing overhead, or record a passing storm front as it sweeps across the sky. Depending on the weather conditions and movement of clouds, this can look stunning or simply spectacular!</p>
<h4 id="3-Starry-sky-1"><a href="#3-Starry-sky-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Starry sky"></a>3. Starry sky</h4><p>Probably one of the most fascinating time lapse videos is the ones with stars on the move. Time-lapses that capture the Milky Way or starry sky are becoming increasingly popular as camera technology improves. There are even some cameras now that have built-in settings specifically for capturing stars and other celestial bodies.</p>
<h4 id="4-Flowers-1"><a href="#4-Flowers-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Flowers"></a>4. Flowers</h4><p>Flowers blooming is another fantastic subject for time-lapse photography. The change can be incredibly subtle; however, if you shoot a timelapse over several days or weeks, you will be amazed at just how much they grow and change!</p>
<h4 id="5-Season-changing-1"><a href="#5-Season-changing-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Season changing"></a>5. Season changing</h4><p>The most obvious example is trees budding and shedding leaves, but all sorts of plants and animals follow seasonal cycles. You can see flowers blooming, grasses growing, and migrating birds. Even if you don’t have a chance to go somewhere exotic for your subject matter, you can find something interesting right outside your own door.</p>
<h4 id="6-Cars-or-Pedestrians-1"><a href="#6-Cars-or-Pedestrians-1" class="headerlink" title="6. Cars or Pedestrians"></a>6. Cars or Pedestrians</h4><p>If you want something a little more exciting then you can choose things like cars passing by or people walking on the street.</p>
<h4 id="7-Cooking-dinner-1"><a href="#7-Cooking-dinner-1" class="headerlink" title="7. Cooking dinner"></a>7. Cooking dinner</h4><p>Got a recipe for dinner that has lots of steps? Rather than just snap photos of the process, why not make a time-lapse video instead? It’s easy and fun to do, especially if you have kids who can help you out!</p>
<h4 id="8-DIY-projects-1"><a href="#8-DIY-projects-1" class="headerlink" title="8. DIY projects"></a>8. DIY projects</h4><p>Are you building something? Whether it’s a new table, shelves, or whatever else, set up your camera and take photos as you go along in a time lapse mode and you’ll get a fun time lapse video. It works well to show people how it all came together.</p>
<h4 id="9-Construction-work-in-progress-1"><a href="#9-Construction-work-in-progress-1" class="headerlink" title="9. Construction work in progress"></a>9. Construction work in progress</h4><p>If you’re watching construction work being done on your property or nearby, consider recording its time lapse video. It’s hard to imagine the amount of resources it takes to construct an office building or skyscraper before it’s finished. Time-lapse videos have helped reveal just how much work goes into something like that.</p>
<h4 id="10-A-fun-art-project-1"><a href="#10-A-fun-art-project-1" class="headerlink" title="10. A fun art project"></a>10. A fun art project</h4><p>Capturing a time lapse video of an art project can make a mesmerizing video. Whether it’s you or someone else doing the artwork, always capture its time lapse video to show to others what goes into completing an art project. All you need to do is to set your camera up on a tripod aimed at the canvas and capture one or two frames per second to get an excellent time lapse video.</p>
<h3 id="Steps-to-shoot-a-time-lapse-video-1"><a href="#Steps-to-shoot-a-time-lapse-video-1" class="headerlink" title="Steps to shoot a time-lapse video"></a>Steps to shoot a time-lapse video</h3><p>Time-lapse videography is something that most photographers and videographers are familiar with. But, shooting a time-lapse video needs more than setting the camera on a tripod and waiting for it to shoot for several hours.</p>
<p>The amazing thing about time-lapse videos is that they can be shot using your smartphone. There are apps and built-in camera settings to capture time lapse videos with just a click of the button.</p>
<p>If you want to create a time-lapse video that is high quality, you have to use professional cameras, and learn some important steps.</p>
<h4 id="1-Decide-on-a-subject-1"><a href="#1-Decide-on-a-subject-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Decide on a subject"></a>1. Decide on a subject</h4><p>The movement of clouds, a sunrise or sunset, waves crashing at the beach, cars coming and going in your parking lot, people walking around your office building — all of these subjects can yield great time-lapse sequences.</p>
<h4 id="2-Find-a-place-to-set-up-your-camera-on-tripod-1"><a href="#2-Find-a-place-to-set-up-your-camera-on-tripod-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Find a place to set up your camera on tripod"></a>2. Find a place to set up your camera on tripod</h4><p>While recording a time-lapse video, it’s important to keep the camera as stable as possible. It ensures a smooth video, making it visually appealing and easy to edit post-shooting. Typically, a tripod is needed for stable recording. If you are not using a tripod, find something steady and level to set it upon.</p>
<p><em>Important tip: Shoot only with manual settings. You don’t want the camera to adjust for you; rather, you should adjust the camera settings so that it takes optimal pictures. Even if you use auto mode, make sure you take control of the camera and push it to its limits to get great shots.</em></p>
<h4 id="3-Set-the-camera-focus-1"><a href="#3-Set-the-camera-focus-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Set the camera focus"></a>3. Set the camera focus</h4><p>Use either autofocus or manual focus to make sure the camera is focused on what you want to be the main subject of the video.</p>
<h4 id="4-Set-your-exposure-settings-1"><a href="#4-Set-your-exposure-settings-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Set your exposure settings"></a>4. Set your exposure settings</h4><p>Depending on how much the light is going to change over time, you may want to use aperture priority or shutter priority so that the camera will automatically adjust for changes in light. Or, if you know exactly how much light will be changing over time, you could set all exposure settings manually.</p>
<h4 id="5-Calculate-how-many-frames-and-shots-are-needed-1"><a href="#5-Calculate-how-many-frames-and-shots-are-needed-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Calculate how many frames and shots are needed"></a>5. Calculate how many frames and shots are needed</h4><p>For example, if you are shooting at 10 frames per second and want a total of 30 seconds of video at 24 fps (which is standard), you will need 720 frames&#x2F;photos (30 seconds x 24 fps &#x3D; 720 frames).</p>
<h4 id="6-Import-and-stitch-together-1"><a href="#6-Import-and-stitch-together-1" class="headerlink" title="6. Import and stitch together"></a>6.

<p>Wondershare Filmore is a professional video editing software with a wide variety of basic to advanced-level editing tools. It allows for turning RAW videos into fun, engaging, and professional videos.</p>
<p>If you need to refine your time-lapse video, you can use it and benefit from its capabilities. Similarly, you can use it to speed up or slow down your time-lapse video.</p>
<p>Let’s see how you can do both with Filmora.</p>
<h3 id="Speed-up-your-time-lapse-video-1"><a href="#Speed-up-your-time-lapse-video-1" class="headerlink" title="Speed up your time-lapse video"></a>Speed up your time-lapse video</h3><p>Why speed up a time-lapse in the first place? There are a couple of reasons you might want to speed up your time-lapse.</p>
<p>When shooting with a fast lens, you might want to dial down the shutter speed to achieve more motion blur, to make the scenes more interesting. However, doing so can also create motion blur on time-lapse footage when sped up.</p>
<p>Another reason you might want to speed up your time-lapse is when you have too many frames. When you shoot at low frame rate (e.g. 15 FPS), not everyone will experience the same viewing quality if they don’t have high frame rate monitors. Speeding up the footage is one way to reduce the number of frames without compromising the quality of your video.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to speed up the time-lapse video using Filmora:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download and install Wondershare Filmora on your computer.</li>
<li>Launch Filmora and click the <strong>New project</strong> button to open the video editor or drag and drop the file directly.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Slow-down-your-time-lapse-video-1"><a href="#Slow-down-your-time-lapse-video-1" class="headerlink" title="Slow down your time-lapse video"></a>Slow down your time-lapse video</h3><p>As the speed at which your time-lapse moves increases, so does the amount of motion blur. This can make for an undesirable look, especially in shots where there is already a lot of movement.</p>
<p>The best way to avoid this is to slow down your time-lapse as much as possible while still maintaining an interesting level of movement within your shot.</p>
<p>You can slow down your time-lapse video in Filmora following the same process as you’d do for speeding-up the video (Explained above). However, there’s only one catch; instead of opting for the <strong>Fast</strong> option choose <strong>Slow</strong> when you’re at step 4.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Hopefully, this guide has provided a good knowledge of how to put together your own time lapse video – and how to edit it on iPhone and Wondershare Filmora. It’s easier than you may think, and the resulting videos are quite impressive.</p>

<p>Do you want to edit a time lapse video on an iPhone or want to know how to shoot a time-lapse video? If so, you’ve come to the right place.</p>
<p>Time-lapses, which show how much something changes over a period of time are some of the coolest videos you can make.</p>
<p>They aren’t exactly easy to make and edit at first, but we’ve put together this guide to take you through the steps. We’ll give you a few time lapse video ideas, steps to shoot them, and good practices for managing your footage after you’ve shot it.</p>
<p>Let’s get started.</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-A-Time-Lapse-Video-2"><a href="#What-Is-A-Time-Lapse-Video-2" class="headerlink" title="What Is A Time Lapse Video?"></a>What Is A Time Lapse Video?</h2><p>In its simplest definition, a time lapse video is a cinematography technique where the frequency at which film frames are captured (the frame rate) is much lower than that used to view the sequence.</p>
<p>When played at normal speed, time appears to be moving faster and thus lapsing. For example, an image of a scene may be captured once every second, then played back at 30 frames per second; the result is an apparent 30 times speed increase.</p>
<p>Time-lapse photography can be considered to be the opposite of slow motion.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Shoot-A-Time-Lapse-Video-2"><a href="#How-to-Shoot-A-Time-Lapse-Video-2" class="headerlink" title="How to Shoot A Time-Lapse Video?"></a>How to Shoot A Time-Lapse Video?</h2><h3 id="Subjects-to-shoot-in-a-time-lapse-video-2"><a href="#Subjects-to-shoot-in-a-time-lapse-video-2" class="headerlink" title="Subjects to shoot in a time-lapse video"></a>Subjects to shoot in a time-lapse video</h3><p>Wondering what can be shot in a time-lapse video? The answer is any subject that moves, grows, decays, or changes. But what’s more important than the subject is the motion and change that it goes through.</p>
<p>When shooting a time-lapse video, you are composing not only the shot but also the movement of the subject. If a subject doesn’t move or change throughout your film, then it is just a regular video. So try to think of subjects that are constantly moving or changing.</p>
<p>Time-Lapse videos are visually appealing and easy to make. When it comes to subjects that can be chosen to shoot in a time-lapse video, the possibilities are endless. But if you’re stuck for ideas, here are 10 suggestions to get you started:</p>
<h4 id="1-Sunset-Sunrise-2"><a href="#1-Sunset-Sunrise-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Sunset&#x2F;Sunrise"></a>1. Sunset&#x2F;Sunrise</h4><p>These are quite possibly the most common subjects for timelapse videos, but there’s a reason for it! Watching the sun go up and down is always mesmerizing.</p>
<h4 id="2-Clouds-2"><a href="#2-Clouds-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Clouds"></a>2. Clouds</h4><p>Clouds move very slowly most of the time, making them perfect for time-lapse sequences. You can shoot a single cloud passing overhead, or record a passing storm front as it sweeps across the sky. Depending on the weather conditions and movement of clouds, this can look stunning or simply spectacular!</p>
<h4 id="3-Starry-sky-2"><a href="#3-Starry-sky-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Starry sky"></a>3. Starry sky</h4><p>Probably one of the most fascinating time lapse videos is the ones with stars on the move. Time-lapses that capture the Milky Way or starry sky are becoming increasingly popular as camera technology improves. There are even some cameras now that have built-in settings specifically for capturing stars and other celestial bodies.</p>
<h4 id="4-Flowers-2"><a href="#4-Flowers-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Flowers"></a>4. Flowers</h4><p>Flowers blooming is another fantastic subject for time-lapse photography. The change can be incredibly subtle; however, if you shoot a timelapse over several days or weeks, you will be amazed at just how much they grow and change!</p>
<h4 id="5-Season-changing-2"><a href="#5-Season-changing-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Season changing"></a>5. Season changing</h4><p>The most obvious example is trees budding and shedding leaves, but all sorts of plants and animals follow seasonal cycles. You can see flowers blooming, grasses growing, and migrating birds. Even if you don’t have a chance to go somewhere exotic for your subject matter, you can find something interesting right outside your own door.</p>
<h4 id="6-Cars-or-Pedestrians-2"><a href="#6-Cars-or-Pedestrians-2" class="headerlink" title="6. Cars or Pedestrians"></a>6. Cars or Pedestrians</h4><p>If you want something a little more exciting then you can choose things like cars passing by or people walking on the street.</p>
<h4 id="7-Cooking-dinner-2"><a href="#7-Cooking-dinner-2" class="headerlink" title="7. Cooking dinner"></a>7. Cooking dinner</h4><p>Got a recipe for dinner that has lots of steps? Rather than just snap photos of the process, why not make a time-lapse video instead? It’s easy and fun to do, especially if you have kids who can help you out!</p>
<h4 id="8-DIY-projects-2"><a href="#8-DIY-projects-2" class="headerlink" title="8. DIY projects"></a>8. DIY projects</h4><p>Are you building something? Whether it’s a new table, shelves, or whatever else, set up your camera and take photos as you go along in a time lapse mode and you’ll get a fun time lapse video. It works well to show people how it all came together.</p>
<h4 id="9-Construction-work-in-progress-2"><a href="#9-Construction-work-in-progress-2" class="headerlink" title="9. Construction work in progress"></a>9. Construction work in progress</h4><p>If you’re watching construction work being done on your property or nearby, consider recording its time lapse video. It’s hard to imagine the amount of resources it takes to construct an office building or skyscraper before it’s finished. Time-lapse videos have helped reveal just how much work goes into something like that.</p>
<h4 id="10-A-fun-art-project-2"><a href="#10-A-fun-art-project-2" class="headerlink" title="10. A fun art project"></a>10. A fun art project</h4><p>Capturing a time lapse video of an art project can make a mesmerizing video. Whether it’s you or someone else doing the artwork, always capture its time lapse video to show to others what goes into completing an art project. All you need to do is to set your camera up on a tripod aimed at the canvas and capture one or two frames per second to get an excellent time lapse video.</p>
<h3 id="Steps-to-shoot-a-time-lapse-video-2"><a href="#Steps-to-shoot-a-time-lapse-video-2" class="headerlink" title="Steps to shoot a time-lapse video"></a>Steps to shoot a time-lapse video</h3><p>Time-lapse videography is something that most photographers and videographers are familiar with. But, shooting a time-lapse video needs more than setting the camera on a tripod and waiting for it to shoot for several hours.</p>
<p>The amazing thing about time-lapse videos is that they can be shot using your smartphone. There are apps and built-in camera settings to capture time lapse videos with just a click of the button.</p>
<p>If you want to create a time-lapse video that is high quality, you have to use professional cameras, and learn some important steps.</p>
<h4 id="1-Decide-on-a-subject-2"><a href="#1-Decide-on-a-subject-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Decide on a subject"></a>1. Decide on a subject</h4><p>The movement of clouds, a sunrise or sunset, waves crashing at the beach, cars coming and going in your parking lot, people walking around your office building — all of these subjects can yield great time-lapse sequences.</p>
<h4 id="2-Find-a-place-to-set-up-your-camera-on-tripod-2"><a href="#2-Find-a-place-to-set-up-your-camera-on-tripod-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Find a place to set up your camera on tripod"></a>2. Find a place to set up your camera on tripod</h4><p>While recording a time-lapse video, it’s important to keep the camera as stable as possible. It ensures a smooth video, making it visually appealing and easy to edit post-shooting. Typically, a tripod is needed for stable recording. If you are not using a tripod, find something steady and level to set it upon.</p>
<p><em>Important tip: Shoot only with manual settings. You don’t want the camera to adjust for you; rather, you should adjust the camera settings so that it takes optimal pictures. Even if you use auto mode, make sure you take control of the camera and push it to its limits to get great shots.</em></p>
<h4 id="3-Set-the-camera-focus-2"><a href="#3-Set-the-camera-focus-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Set the camera focus"></a>3. Set the camera focus</h4><p>Use either autofocus or manual focus to make sure the camera is focused on what you want to be the main subject of the video.</p>
<h4 id="4-Set-your-exposure-settings-2"><a href="#4-Set-your-exposure-settings-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Set your exposure settings"></a>4. Set your exposure settings</h4><p>Depending on how much the light is going to change over time, you may want to use aperture priority or shutter priority so that the camera will automatically adjust for changes in light. Or, if you know exactly how much light will be changing over time, you could set all exposure settings manually.</p>
<h4 id="5-Calculate-how-many-frames-and-shots-are-needed-2"><a href="#5-Calculate-how-many-frames-and-shots-are-needed-2" class="headerlink" title="5. Calculate how many frames and shots are needed"></a>5. Calculate how many frames and shots are needed</h4><p>For example, if you are shooting at 10 frames per second and want a total of 30 seconds of video at 24 fps (which is standard), you will need 720 frames&#x2F;photos (30 seconds x 24 fps &#x3D; 720 frames).</p>

<p>When shooting with a fast lens, you might want to dial down the shutter speed to achieve more motion blur, to make the scenes more interesting. However, doing so can also create motion blur on time-lapse footage when sped up.</p>
<p>Another reason you might want to speed up your time-lapse is when you have too many frames. When you shoot at low frame rate (e.g. 15 FPS), not everyone will experience the same viewing quality if they don’t have high frame rate monitors. Speeding up the footage is one way to reduce the number of frames without compromising the quality of your video.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to speed up the time-lapse video using Filmora:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download and install Wondershare Filmora on your computer.</li>
<li>Launch Filmora and click the <strong>New project</strong> button to open the video editor or drag and drop the file directly.</li>

<h3 id="Slow-down-your-time-lapse-video-2"><a href="#Slow-down-your-time-lapse-video-2" class="headerlink" title="Slow down your time-lapse video"></a>Slow down your time-lapse video</h3><p>As the speed at which your time-lapse moves increases, so does the amount of motion blur. This can make for an undesirable look, especially in shots where there is already a lot of movement.</p>
<p>The best way to avoid this is to slow down your time-lapse as much as possible while still maintaining an interesting level of movement within your shot.</p>
<p>You can slow down your time-lapse video in Filmora following the same process as you’d do for speeding-up the video (Explained above). However, there’s only one catch; instead of opting for the <strong>Fast</strong> option choose <strong>Slow</strong> when you’re at step 4.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-4"><a href="#Conclusion-4" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Hopefully, this guide has provided a good knowledge of how to put together your own time lapse video – and how to edit it on iPhone and Wondershare Filmora. It’s easier than you may think, and the resulting videos are quite impressive.</p>

<p>Do you want to edit a time lapse video on an iPhone or want to know how to shoot a time-lapse video? If so, you’ve come to the right place.</p>
<p>Time-lapses, which show how much something changes over a period of time are some of the coolest videos you can make.</p>
<p>They aren’t exactly easy to make and edit at first, but we’ve put together this guide to take you through the steps. We’ll give you a few time lapse video ideas, steps to shoot them, and good practices for managing your footage after you’ve shot it.</p>
<p>Let’s get started.</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-A-Time-Lapse-Video-3"><a href="#What-Is-A-Time-Lapse-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="What Is A Time Lapse Video?"></a>What Is A Time Lapse Video?</h2><p>In its simplest definition, a time lapse video is a cinematography technique where the frequency at which film frames are captured (the frame rate) is much lower than that used to view the sequence.</p>
<p>When played at normal speed, time appears to be moving faster and thus lapsing. For example, an image of a scene may be captured once every second, then played back at 30 frames per second; the result is an apparent 30 times speed increase.</p>
<p>Time-lapse photography can be considered to be the opposite of slow motion.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Shoot-A-Time-Lapse-Video-3"><a href="#How-to-Shoot-A-Time-Lapse-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Shoot A Time-Lapse Video?"></a>How to Shoot A Time-Lapse Video?</h2><h3 id="Subjects-to-shoot-in-a-time-lapse-video-3"><a href="#Subjects-to-shoot-in-a-time-lapse-video-3" class="headerlink" title="Subjects to shoot in a time-lapse video"></a>Subjects to shoot in a time-lapse video</h3><p>Wondering what can be shot in a time-lapse video? The answer is any subject that moves, grows, decays, or changes. But what’s more important than the subject is the motion and change that it goes through.</p>
<p>When shooting a time-lapse video, you are composing not only the shot but also the movement of the subject. If a subject doesn’t move or change throughout your film, then it is just a regular video. So try to think of subjects that are constantly moving or changing.</p>
<p>Time-Lapse videos are visually appealing and easy to make. When it comes to subjects that can be chosen to shoot in a time-lapse video, the possibilities are endless. But if you’re stuck for ideas, here are 10 suggestions to get you started:</p>
<h4 id="1-Sunset-Sunrise-3"><a href="#1-Sunset-Sunrise-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Sunset&#x2F;Sunrise"></a>1. Sunset&#x2F;Sunrise</h4><p>These are quite possibly the most common subjects for timelapse videos, but there’s a reason for it! Watching the sun go up and down is always mesmerizing.</p>
<h4 id="2-Clouds-3"><a href="#2-Clouds-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Clouds"></a>2. Clouds</h4><p>Clouds move very slowly most of the time, making them perfect for time-lapse sequences. You can shoot a single cloud passing overhead, or record a passing storm front as it sweeps across the sky. Depending on the weather conditions and movement of clouds, this can look stunning or simply spectacular!</p>
<h4 id="3-Starry-sky-3"><a href="#3-Starry-sky-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Starry sky"></a>3. Starry sky</h4><p>Probably one of the most fascinating time lapse videos is the ones with stars on the move. Time-lapses that capture the Milky Way or starry sky are becoming increasingly popular as camera technology improves. There are even some cameras now that have built-in settings specifically for capturing stars and other celestial bodies.</p>
<h4 id="4-Flowers-3"><a href="#4-Flowers-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Flowers"></a>4. Flowers</h4><p>Flowers blooming is another fantastic subject for time-lapse photography. The change can be incredibly subtle; however, if you shoot a timelapse over several days or weeks, you will be amazed at just how much they grow and change!</p>
<h4 id="5-Season-changing-3"><a href="#5-Season-changing-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Season changing"></a>5. Season changing</h4><p>The most obvious example is trees budding and shedding leaves, but all sorts of plants and animals follow seasonal cycles. You can see flowers blooming, grasses growing, and migrating birds. Even if you don’t have a chance to go somewhere exotic for your subject matter, you can find something interesting right outside your own door.</p>
<h4 id="6-Cars-or-Pedestrians-3"><a href="#6-Cars-or-Pedestrians-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Cars or Pedestrians"></a>6. Cars or Pedestrians</h4><p>If you want something a little more exciting then you can choose things like cars passing by or people walking on the street.</p>
<h4 id="7-Cooking-dinner-3"><a href="#7-Cooking-dinner-3" class="headerlink" title="7. Cooking dinner"></a>7. Cooking dinner</h4><p>Got a recipe for dinner that has lots of steps? Rather than just snap photos of the process, why not make a time-lapse video instead? It’s easy and fun to do, especially if you have kids who can help you out!</p>
<h4 id="8-DIY-projects-3"><a href="#8-DIY-projects-3" class="headerlink" title="8. DIY projects"></a>8. DIY projects</h4><p>Are you building something? Whether it’s a new table, shelves, or whatever else, set up your camera and take photos as you go along in a time lapse mode and you’ll get a fun time lapse video. It works well to show people how it all came together.</p>
<h4 id="9-Construction-work-in-progress-3"><a href="#9-Construction-work-in-progress-3" class="headerlink" title="9. Construction work in progress"></a>9. Construction work in progress</h4><p>If you’re watching construction work being done on your property or nearby, consider recording its time lapse video. It’s hard to imagine the amount of resources it takes to construct an office building or skyscraper before it’s finished. Time-lapse videos have helped reveal just how much work goes into something like that.</p>
<h4 id="10-A-fun-art-project-3"><a href="#10-A-fun-art-project-3" class="headerlink" title="10. A fun art project"></a>10. A fun art project</h4><p>Capturing a time lapse video of an art project can make a mesmerizing video. Whether it’s you or someone else doing the artwork, always capture its time lapse video to show to others what goes into completing an art project. All you need to do is to set your camera up on a tripod aimed at the canvas and capture one or two frames per second to get an excellent time lapse video.</p>
<h3 id="Steps-to-shoot-a-time-lapse-video-3"><a href="#Steps-to-shoot-a-time-lapse-video-3" class="headerlink" title="Steps to shoot a time-lapse video"></a>Steps to shoot a time-lapse video</h3><p>Time-lapse videography is something that most photographers and videographers are familiar with. But, shooting a time-lapse video needs more than setting the camera on a tripod and waiting for it to shoot for several hours.</p>
<p>The amazing thing about time-lapse videos is that they can be shot using your smartphone. There are apps and built-in camera settings to capture time lapse videos with just a click of the button.</p>
<p>If you want to create a time-lapse video that is high quality, you have to use professional cameras, and learn some important steps.</p>
<h4 id="1-Decide-on-a-subject-3"><a href="#1-Decide-on-a-subject-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Decide on a subject"></a>1. Decide on a subject</h4><p>The movement of clouds, a sunrise or sunset, waves crashing at the beach, cars coming and going in your parking lot, people walking around your office building — all of these subjects can yield great time-lapse sequences.</p>
<h4 id="2-Find-a-place-to-set-up-your-camera-on-tripod-3"><a href="#2-Find-a-place-to-set-up-your-camera-on-tripod-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Find a place to set up your camera on tripod"></a>2. Find a place to set up your camera on tripod</h4><p>While recording a time-lapse video, it’s important to keep the camera as stable as possible. It ensures a smooth video, making it visually appealing and easy to edit post-shooting. Typically, a tripod is needed for stable recording. If you are not using a tripod, find something steady and level to set it upon.</p>
<p><em>Important tip: Shoot only with manual settings. You don’t want the camera to adjust for you; rather, you should adjust the camera settings so that it takes optimal pictures. Even if you use auto mode, make sure you take control of the camera and push it to its limits to get great shots.</em></p>
<h4 id="3-Set-the-camera-focus-3"><a href="#3-Set-the-camera-focus-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Set the camera focus"></a>3. Set the camera focus</h4><p>Use either autofocus or manual focus to make sure the camera is focused on what you want to be the main subject of the video.</p>
<h4 id="4-Set-your-exposure-settings-3"><a href="#4-Set-your-exposure-settings-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Set your exposure settings"></a>4. Set your exposure settings</h4><p>Depending on how much the light is going to change over time, you may want to use aperture priority or shutter priority so that the camera will automatically adjust for changes in light. Or, if you know exactly how much light will be changing over time, you could set all exposure settings manually.</p>

This can make for an undesirable look, especially in shots where there is already a lot of movement.</p>
<p>The best way to avoid this is to slow down your time-lapse as much as possible while still maintaining an interesting level of movement within your shot.</p>
<p>You can slow down your time-lapse video in Filmora following the same process as you’d do for speeding-up the video (Explained above). However, there’s only one catch; instead of opting for the <strong>Fast</strong> option choose <strong>Slow</strong> when you’re at step 4.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-5"><a href="#Conclusion-5" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Hopefully, this guide has provided a good knowledge of how to put together your own time lapse video – and how to edit it on iPhone and Wondershare Filmora. It’s easier than you may think, and the resulting videos are quite impressive.</p>
<p>Take your time with it, record your movies from different angles, and don’t be afraid to create something unique and experimental.</p>
