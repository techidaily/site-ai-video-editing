                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Cut the Part</strong></p>

<p><strong>What is a Storyboard?</strong></p>
<p>Attempting to define a <strong>storyboard</strong>, you can regard the utility as a sequential setup of sketches, images, elements and illustrations that create a road map to address a video editing task. Dividing the entire process into a series of individual processes, the aforesaid facility caters to ease out the video creation task.</p>
<p>Moving ahead to draft a technical explanation of storyboards, they are a collection of chronologically arranged drawings, supplemented with video customization elements, such as dialogues, camera direction and other allied detailing. The fundamental merit of these visual arrangements lies in the sequential and scene unfolding of a video footage.</p>
<p>This in turn, works to simplify the film creation process, while ensuring the latter’s cohesiveness and facilitating the elimination of errors and inconsistencies.

The facility works additionally to minimize unnecessary production delays, while significantly cutting down on the overall creation cost.</p>
<p>Having a visibility more or less similar to a comic strip, storyboards have a varying scale of design, ranging from being modestly simple to explicitly complex, in cohesion with the specific creation requirements. These visual scripts are mostly hand crafted, through there are a host of storyboard creation software packages and programs available in the IT design market, as well as across the web.</p>
<p>Extending our discussion a bit further, let us have a walk-through of the essential storyboard categories and types in what follows next:</p>

<p>You are granted the liberty to add as much detailing to these drawings as you wish, while using them for filming either a single or a series of film shots. These easily editable storyboards are often supplemented with written text notes for describing the events of a specific scene.</p>

<h2 id="Sync-Audio-With-Video-With-Filmora"><a href="#Sync-Audio-With-Video-With-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Sync Audio With Video With Filmora"></a>Sync Audio With Video With Filmora</h2><p>Syncing audio with video is an integral part of video editing for any video creator. But believe me; it’s not such a difficult task if you know what to do. The point is IF YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO.</p>
<p>That’s why in this brief guide, we’ll show you the simplest way to sync audio with video using a fantastic video editor easily. But wait a minute, some of you might be confused about why we even need to sync separate audio &amp; video when a single camera can record both. So let’s first answer this simple question.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Why-Do-We-Need-to-Sync-Separate-Audio-Video"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Do-We-Need-to-Sync-Separate-Audio-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why Do We Need to Sync Separate Audio &amp; Video?"></a>Part 1: Why Do We Need to Sync Separate Audio &amp; Video?</h2><p>Creating great video needs extraordinary video graphics, content, and top-notch audio. And you can’t expect a single camera to achieve all these goals. That’s why all professional video creators use a specialized camera for recording with a separate audio recording device.</p>
<p>You might think it’s an exaggeration, but this small change can have massive effects on the quality of your video. Especially the background noise removal effect of separate external microphones.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/recording-audio-and-video-separately-for-higher-quality.jpg"
                      alt="recording audio and video separately for higher quality"
                ></p>
<p>But the downside of using this method is that after the recording is complete, you must sync these audio and video files. And if you don’t do it right, all the effort goes to the drain within a split second. Well, nobody wants to watch a video with an audio lag. Isn’t it?</p>
<p>Correctly synching an audio file with a video is easier than you think. You just need to prepare beforehand and use a suitable video editing tool. So considering these factors, let’s first see what preparations we need. After that, we’ll recommend a top-class video editing tool to achieve this goal in detailed steps. Why are we still waiting? Let’s begin our journey.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Preparation-for-Syncing-Audio-With-Video-During-Recording"><a href="#Part-2-Preparation-for-Syncing-Audio-With-Video-During-Recording" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Preparation for Syncing Audio With Video During Recording"></a>Part 2: Preparation for Syncing Audio With Video During Recording</h2><p>You must make some preparations to sync an audio file with a video properly. It’s to have a sound spike to match the footage properly with the separate audio file. And it might look disturbing, but even a simple Clap might do the job.</p>
<p>And if you want a professional way, just imagine the clapper board. You must have seen it in the film industry. This clapper board is used not only to mark the shot but also to create a sound spike when it claps. We use this audio spike as a reference to sync the audio files with the video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="a clapper board used to start a film scene"
                ></p>
<p>Every time you cut your shot, remember to clap on camera again the next time you roll. It’s best to clap before you say “Action” or speak so that it’s easy to find and sync when editing. But if you forget, you can also clap at the end of the shot before you cut. That is called a <strong>Tail Slate</strong>!!!</p>
<p>After you’ve recorded your video like this, the next step is pretty simple. The video editor we recommend is no other than the world’s leading tool in the market, Wondershare Filmora. Let’s move forward and see how to sync audio with video using <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>

<p>As far as the audio synching is concerned, you can do it either manually or with auto synchronization. And we will explain both of these processes in a stepwise manner to give you complete mastery over your audio synching. Let’s start with the manual process first.</p>

<h5 id="Step2Import-your-files"><a href="#Step2Import-your-files" class="headerlink" title="Step2Import your files"></a>Step2Import your files</h5><p>The next step is to import all the files. Launch the Filmora and click on the “New Project” button from the opening interface.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="click on the new project"
                ></p>
<p>When a new project is created, you’ll see an “Import Media” section on it. Click on this section to browse your audio and video files from the computer. Or you can also drag and drop these files here to import them.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<h5 id="Step3Prepare-your-files"><a href="#Step3Prepare-your-files" class="headerlink" title="Step3Prepare your files"></a>Step3Prepare your files</h5><p>Now, it’s time to prepare our files for synchronization. First, drag the video file down to the timeline from the “Import Media” section. After that, drag the audio file in the same way below the video on the panel.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

Look at the waveform from the in-camera audio and the independent audio track. At the moment you clap, we’ll see a spike.</p>
<p><strong><em>Bonus Tip:</em></strong> <em>If you can’t find the audio spike, zoom the panel to make it easier.</em></p>

                      alt="find the sound spike on video and audio files"
                ></p>
<p>Now take the independent audio clip and align it so that both the spikes match.</p>

                ></p>
<p>As far as the audio synching is concerned, you can do it either manually or with auto synchronization. And we will explain both of these processes in a stepwise manner to give you complete mastery over your audio synching. Let’s start with the manual process first.</p>
<h3 id="Steps-To-Manually-Sync-Audio-With-Video-Using-Filmora-1"><a href="#Steps-To-Manually-Sync-Audio-With-Video-Using-Filmora-1" class="headerlink" title="Steps To Manually Sync Audio With Video Using Filmora"></a>Steps To Manually Sync Audio With Video Using Filmora</h3><h5 id="Step1Download-install-1"><a href="#Step1Download-install-1" class="headerlink" title="Step1Download &amp; install"></a>Step1Download &amp; install</h5><p>If you haven’t downloaded the latest version of Filmora yet, click the button below to download it without any cost.

<h5 id="Step2Import-your-files-1"><a href="#Step2Import-your-files-1" class="headerlink" title="Step2Import your files"></a>Step2Import your files</h5><p>The next step is to import all the files. Launch the Filmora and click on the “New Project” button from the opening interface.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/create-a-new-project-on-filmora.jpg"
                      alt="click on the new project"
                ></p>
<p>When a new project is created, you’ll see an “Import Media” section on it. Click on this section to browse your audio and video files from the computer. Or you can also drag and drop these files here to import them.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/import-media-section-in-filmora.jpg"
                      alt="import your media files"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step3Prepare-your-files-1"><a href="#Step3Prepare-your-files-1" class="headerlink" title="Step3Prepare your files"></a>Step3Prepare your files</h5><p>Now, it’s time to prepare our files for synchronization. First, drag the video file down to the timeline from the “Import Media” section. After that, drag the audio file in the same way below the video on the panel.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="drag the media files to the timeline"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step4Sync-the-audio-video-files-using-the-audio-spike-1"><a href="#Step4Sync-the-audio-video-files-using-the-audio-spike-1" class="headerlink" title="Step4Sync the audio &amp; video files using the audio spike"></a>Step4Sync the audio &amp; video files using the audio spike</h5><p>Now that the video and audio files are on the timeline, you’ll have to find the moment you clap your hands. Look at the waveform from the in-camera audio and the independent audio track. At the moment you clap, we’ll see a spike.</p>
<p><strong><em>Bonus Tip:</em></strong> <em>If you can’t find the audio spike, zoom the panel to make it easier.</em></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/find-the-sound-spike-on-video-and-audio-files.jpg"
                      alt="find the sound spike on video and audio files"
                ></p>
<p>Now take the independent audio clip and align it so that both the spikes match.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="align the sound spikes with each other"
                ></p>
<p>That’s it! We just need to remove the in-camera audio now. Let’s see how to do it now.</p>
<h5 id="Step5Remove-the-audio-from-the-video-footage-1"><a href="#Step5Remove-the-audio-from-the-video-footage-1" class="headerlink" title="Step5Remove the audio from the video footage"></a>Step5Remove the audio from the video footage</h5><p>To detach the audio in the video footage, right-click on this file and select the “Detach Audio” option. Or you can also use the “Ctrl+Alt+D” as the hotkey.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="detach audio from video file"
                ></p>
<p>Once the audio file has been separated, you can move forward and delete it. To delete this audio, right-click on it and select “Delete.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
