Read on to Learn More About AV1 and How It Could Impact Your Life</h2><p>Have you heard about the <strong>AV1 format video</strong>? This format is a new compression standard that promises to improve video quality while reducing file size. If you frequently stream video, the <strong>AV1 files</strong> could make an impact on your life, and we are just beginning to see its potential. Let’s take a further look at what AV1 is and what you need to know about this new video codec.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Where-does-it-come-from"><a href="#Part-1-Where-does-it-come-from" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Where does it come from?"></a>Part 1: Where does it come from?</h2><p>AV1 (AOMedia Video 1) is a new video compression format that is being developed by the Alliance for Open Media (AOMedia). AOMedia is a consortium of major tech companies including Google, Microsoft, Netflix, and Amazon. The AV1 codec is an improvement on VP9 in several ways, most notably in its ability to compress video more efficiently.</p>
<p>Although the AV1 codec is still in the early stages of development, it is already being adopted by some major tech companies. Netflix has announced that it will start using AV1 for its streaming service, and Google has said that AV1 will be the default codec for YouTube.</p>
<h3 id="How-can-streaming-platforms-and-users-benefit-from-a-new-codec"><a href="#How-can-streaming-platforms-and-users-benefit-from-a-new-codec" class="headerlink" title="How can streaming platforms and users benefit from a new codec?"></a>How can streaming platforms and users benefit from a new codec?</h3><p><img

<p><strong>The importance of codecs</strong></p>
<p>A codec is a device that encodes and decodes digital audio signals. Without a codec, your audio would sound garbled and distorted. There are two metrics to take into account to judge the performance of video codecs: quality and bitrate.</p>
<h3 id="The-benefits-of-the-new-codec"><a href="#The-benefits-of-the-new-codec" class="headerlink" title="The benefits of the new codec"></a>The benefits of the new codec</h3><p>Two of the most popular video formats, provide high-quality video at a relatively low bit rate.</p>
<p>The new AV1 codec offers several benefits for streaming platforms and their users. Take a look at a few of them:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Lower bitrate</strong></li>
<li><strong>Reduced costs for encoding</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>For streaming platforms, AV1 could lead to reducing costs for encoding as well as increasing quality and compatibility. For users, AV1 could improve streaming quality, especially on mobile devices.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Smaller size with better quality</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>AV1 files</strong> will take up less space on your hard drive or be smaller in file size when streamed online. Since AV1 can compress video files to a much smaller size without sacrificing quality, users will be able to save data when streaming video on their devices!</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>More efficient</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>AV1 will use less processing power to decode a video compared to other video codecs. As a result, the streaming platforms can save on bandwidth costs, which can be passed on to users in the form of lower subscription prices eventually.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Royalty-free</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The ultimate goal of AOMedia is to develop an open and royalty-free video codec that can be used by anyone. So, you will have better video quality, lower bandwidth costs, and faster loading times.</p>
<p>AV1 is just one of the many new technologies that are revolutionizing online media delivery. With its superior quality and efficiency, AV1 is poised to become the standard codec for online video in the years to come where everyone can access more affordable and high-quality videos.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-are-the-Trends-of-Codec-War-AV1"><a href="#Part-2-What-are-the-Trends-of-Codec-War-AV1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What are the Trends of Codec War AV1?"></a>Part 2: What are the Trends of Codec War AV1?</h2><p>As we have already discussed, AV1 is a newer codec that promises better compression. This video format has already been widely used and gaining traction in the streaming industry. It is being used more for live broadcasts and other time-sensitive applications.</p>
<h4 id="Who-will-prevail"><a href="#Who-will-prevail" class="headerlink" title="Who will prevail?"></a>Who will prevail?</h4><p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="video editing program on a computer"
                ></p>
<p>Since both codecs have their pros and cons, it’s unclear which one will ultimately prevail. However, as the world moves towards more open standards for video codecs, there is growing concern that AV1 codec will be used to monopolize the market. While AV1 is free to use, it is encumbered by patents held by members of the Alliance for Open Media (AOMedia), which includes companies like Google, Microsoft, and Apple.</p>

<p>The EU Commissions’ questionnaire, as reported by <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-eu-antitrust-regulators-probing-tech-group-aoms-video-licensing-policy-2022-07-07/" >Reuters <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, unveiled that the alliance and its members had been requiring companies to cross-license their patents for no charge to receive the AV1 format. These companies had no affiliation with AOM when AV1 was originally devised. This was a non-negotiable requisite for companies who owned patents that were necessary to contribute to the AV1 standard’s technical specifications.</p>
<p>As a result, this action is concerned to hinder innovation and thus prevents the new entities feasible to flourish. Therefore, there is a growing movement to antitrust AV1 which has been investigated by the European Commission.</p>
<h3 id="What-happened-after-the-AV1-Antitrust-Investigation"><a href="#What-happened-after-the-AV1-Antitrust-Investigation" class="headerlink" title="What happened after the AV1 Antitrust Investigation"></a>What happened after the AV1 Antitrust Investigation</h3><p><img

                      alt="google logo"
                ></p>
<p>The European Commission is looking into whether this licensing scheme violates antitrust law and whether the companies involved are colluding to keep AV1 closed off to competitors. The investigation is in its early stages, and no formal charges have been filed against Google at this time.</p>
<p>However, if the Commission finds that Google has indeed abused its market position, it could order Google to make changes to AV1 or face steep fines. Although the fines have yet to be determined, each company involved could ultimately pay up to 10% of their global turnover.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, this issue has shed light on the competitive landscape of the codec market. Well, although the outcome of the antitrust investigation is still uncertain, it is clear that it has the potential to shake up the codec market.</p>

                ></p>
<p>H.266 is the next-generation video codec that is being developed to improve upon the current standard and the latest advances in video technology. We can expect H.266 to continue to evolve and be improved upon as time goes on. Some of their transcendence that you can look forward to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Improve compression efficiency</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>H.266&#x2F;VVC is designed to improve compression efficiency by 20-50% over previous versions. You can have a video of the same file size and bit rate but make it look significantly better.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inter-Layer Prediction (ILP) usage</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The H.266 codec uses a new type of inter-frame prediction called Inter-Layer Prediction (ILP). ILP allows the codec to exploit the correlations between different layers of a video signal. Therefore, it gives better results on image quality and file size when you encode a video with the H.266 codec.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Higher-quality video</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>We can expect higher-quality video content to become more widespread. This new codec will also enable new types of content, such as virtual reality and 360-degree video, to be streamed and enjoyed by a wider audience.</p>
<h3 id="AV2-codec"><a href="#AV2-codec" class="headerlink" title="AV2 codec"></a>AV2 codec</h3><p>The AV2 codec is an improvement on the current AV1. The AV2 codec is said to be more efficient and have better quality than the AV1 codec. It is still in development and is not yet available for use.</p>
<p>Since this codec is expected to provide better quality video at lower bit rates than other codecs, it would be ideal for use in video applications such as streaming and video conferencing. So, what can we expect from the AV2 codec in the future? Here are a few things to look out for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved quality at lower bitrates</li>
<li>Wider adoption in streaming and conferencing applications</li>
<li>Continued development and improvement</li>
</ul>

How do I open an AV1 file?"></a>1. How do I open an AV1 file?</h3><p>AV1 is a relatively new file format. If you have an AV1 file that you need to open, you can use one of the following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a media player that supports AV1, such as VLC Media Player or MPV</li>
<li>Use conversion software to convert the AV1 file into a more widely-supported file format</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-Can-MP4-contain-AV1"><a href="#2-Can-MP4-contain-AV1" class="headerlink" title="2. Can MP4 contain AV1?"></a>2. Can MP4 contain AV1?</h3><p>Yes. While AV1 is a relatively new codec, it is already supported by many popular media players and devices. MP4 is a container format, which means it can hold multiple types of data. The data can be encoded using any codec, including AV1. Therefore, you can encode your content in AV1 and store it in an MP4 container for playback on the devices.</p>

<p>Text-to-speech (TTS) is a type of assistive technology that reads digital text aloud. It’s sometimes called “read aloud” technology. This technology has evolved to the point of being inculcated or introduced directly to some video editing applications without having to visit a separate text-to-speech application or software for support. This article therefore aims at discussing ten video makers that have inbuilt the text-to-speech feature.</p>

You can make your video captivating by adding features such as filters, stickers, speed changes, background music, effects, split, reverse and more to make your wonderful moments more polished and professional.</p>
<p>FEATURES</p>
<p>After reviewing both versions (Android and iOS) of CapCut, we found that the app is indeed easy to use and includes a ton of attractive features designed for TikTok users. Would we recommend it to you? Yes, definitely, but with some caveats.</p>
<ul>
<li>Split function: This is similar to trimming where you have to separate the clip in order to define your desired part of the clip. Your clip can be further extended after splitting, so it’s just a process of simple trimming in editing.</li>
<li>Video overlay: This feature helps you place a video on another video. Those who do this often are those who have reaction channels, online teachers and gamers. This feature helps the viewers to simultaneously comprehend explanations the main video content alongside the reaction or explanation.</li>
<li>Speed control: This feature aids speed ramping. You can slow down your video and increase the speed just as you want. One thing to have in mind is when you plan to edit such a video, you have to shoot in a high resolution and high frame rate like 30-60fps so as to avoid the amateurish look.</li>
<li>Reverse video: The reverse feature helps you to rewind your clip to create the effect you have pictured in your mind while shooting.</li>
<li>Music library: CapCut comes with an impressive collection of royalty-free music and sound effects that can really make a huge difference to your videos. The tracks have a high quality and you can effortlessly insert them into your video to create the feel you desire.</li>
<li>Filters: Choose from various filters to soften or sharpen your videos and make them more professional-looking. There are color-based and season-based filters, as well as a range of beautification tools to enhance video quality. Filters can also be used effectively if you have multiple clips that have color variations or different contrast and brightness levels. Since you can’t edit most of these in CapCut, you can avoid having to use a desktop editor by choosing the right filters and applying them to all your clips to bring some uniformity.</li>
<li>Effects: There’s a collection of effects you can select from to appeal to the visual cravings of your audience. This will add colour to your content as it makes your viewers involved in the video. These effects include split-screen, retro, comic, party, dreamy, and so on. These effects will make your video look fresh and professionally edited.</li>
<li>Stickers and text: Stickers could be fun to use due to their expressive nature. Your choice as a content creator will go a long way in determining the fascination of your content. CapCut has therefore had you covered when it comes to adding fun features to your content to make it more interactive and exciting. Stickers and texts are therefore engaging tools you can employ to drive the fantasy of your audience.

Since you can’t edit most of these in CapCut, you can avoid having to use a desktop editor by choosing the right filters and applying them to all your clips to bring some uniformity.</li>
<li>Effects: There’s a collection of effects you can select from to appeal to the visual cravings of your audience. This will add colour to your content as it makes your viewers involved in the video. These effects include split-screen, retro, comic, party, dreamy, and so on. These effects will make your video look fresh and professionally edited.</li>
<li>Stickers and text: Stickers could be fun to use due to their expressive nature. Your choice as a content creator will go a long way in determining the fascination of your content. CapCut has therefore had you covered when it comes to adding fun features to your content to make it more interactive and exciting. Stickers and texts are therefore engaging tools you can employ to drive the fantasy of your audience. Also, it creates room for more details to be added without necessarily having to introduce more audio contents especially. With this feature, you can literally do more with less using CapCut.</li>

<h2 id="Capture-the-moment-and-Cut-2"><a href="#Capture-the-moment-and-Cut-2" class="headerlink" title="Capture the moment and Cut"></a>Capture the moment and Cut</h2><p>CapCut is a free all-in-one video editing app that helps you create amazing videos. It is a mobile app for iOS and Android devices which is easy to use in terms of creating your content. It makes your cutting, reversing and speed change easier than ever when you get it right to produce incredible results as you share on social media. You can make your video captivating by adding features such as filters, stickers, speed changes, background music, effects, split, reverse and more to make your wonderful moments more polished and professional.</p>
<p>FEATURES</p>
<p>After reviewing both versions (Android and iOS) of CapCut, we found that the app is indeed easy to use and includes a ton of attractive features designed for TikTok users. Would we recommend it to you? Yes, definitely, but with some caveats.</p>
<ul>
<li>Split function: This is similar to trimming where you have to separate the clip in order to define your desired part of the clip. Your clip can be further extended after splitting, so it’s just a process of simple trimming in editing.</li>
<li>Video overlay: This feature helps you place a video on another video. Those who do this often are those who have reaction channels, online teachers and gamers. This feature helps the viewers to simultaneously comprehend explanations the main video content alongside the reaction or explanation.</li>
<li>Speed control: This feature aids speed ramping. You can slow down your video and increase the speed just as you want. One thing to have in mind is when you plan to edit such a video, you have to shoot in a high resolution and high frame rate like 30-60fps so as to avoid the amateurish look.</li>
<li>Reverse video: The reverse feature helps you to rewind your clip to create the effect you have pictured in your mind while shooting.</li>
<li>Music library: CapCut comes with an impressive collection of royalty-free music and sound effects that can really make a huge difference to your videos. The tracks have a high quality and you can effortlessly insert them into your video to create the feel you desire.</li>
<li>Filters: Choose from various filters to soften or sharpen your videos and make them more professional-looking. There are color-based and season-based filters, as well as a range of beautification tools to enhance video quality. Filters can also be used effectively if you have multiple clips that have color variations or different contrast and brightness levels. Since you can’t edit most of these in CapCut, you can avoid having to use a desktop editor by choosing the right filters and applying them to all your clips to bring some uniformity.</li>
<li>Effects: There’s a collection of effects you can select from to appeal to the visual cravings of your audience. This will add colour to your content as it makes your viewers involved in the video. These effects include split-screen, retro, comic, party, dreamy, and so on. These effects will make your video look fresh and professionally edited.</li>
<li>Stickers and text: Stickers could be fun to use due to their expressive nature. Your choice as a content creator will go a long way in determining the fascination of your content. CapCut has therefore had you covered when it comes to adding fun features to your content to make it more interactive and exciting. Stickers and texts are therefore engaging tools you can employ to drive the fantasy of your audience. Also, it creates room for more details to be added without necessarily having to introduce more audio contents especially. With this feature, you can literally do more with less using CapCut.</li>

<p>Text-to-speech (TTS) is a type of assistive technology that reads digital text aloud. It’s sometimes called “read aloud” technology. This technology has evolved to the point of being inculcated or introduced directly to some video editing applications without having to visit a separate text-to-speech application or software for support. This article therefore aims at discussing ten video makers that have inbuilt the text-to-speech feature.</p>

It is a mobile app for iOS and Android devices which is easy to use in terms of creating your content. It makes your cutting, reversing and speed change easier than ever when you get it right to produce incredible results as you share on social media. You can make your video captivating by adding features such as filters, stickers, speed changes, background music, effects, split, reverse and more to make your wonderful moments more polished and professional.</p>
<p>FEATURES</p>
<p>After reviewing both versions (Android and iOS) of CapCut, we found that the app is indeed easy to use and includes a ton of attractive features designed for TikTok users. Would we recommend it to you? Yes, definitely, but with some caveats.</p>
<ul>
<li>Split function: This is similar to trimming where you have to separate the clip in order to define your desired part of the clip. Your clip can be further extended after splitting, so it’s just a process of simple trimming in editing.</li>
<li>Video overlay: This feature helps you place a video on another video. Those who do this often are those who have reaction channels, online teachers and gamers. This feature helps the viewers to simultaneously comprehend explanations the main video content alongside the reaction or explanation.</li>
<li>Speed control: This feature aids speed ramping. You can slow down your video and increase the speed just as you want. One thing to have in mind is when you plan to edit such a video, you have to shoot in a high resolution and high frame rate like 30-60fps so as to avoid the amateurish look.</li>
<li>Reverse video: The reverse feature helps you to rewind your clip to create the effect you have pictured in your mind while shooting.</li>
<li>Music library: CapCut comes with an impressive collection of royalty-free music and sound effects that can really make a huge difference to your videos. The tracks have a high quality and you can effortlessly insert them into your video to create the feel you desire.</li>
<li>Filters: Choose from various filters to soften or sharpen your videos and make them more professional-looking. There are color-based and season-based filters, as well as a range of beautification tools to enhance video quality. Filters can also be used effectively if you have multiple clips that have color variations or different contrast and brightness levels. Since you can’t edit most of these in CapCut, you can avoid having to use a desktop editor by choosing the right filters and applying them to all your clips to bring some uniformity.</li>
<li>Effects: There’s a collection of effects you can select from to appeal to the visual cravings of your audience. This will add colour to your content as it makes your viewers involved in the video. These effects include split-screen, retro, comic, party, dreamy, and so on. These effects will make your video look fresh and professionally edited.</li>
<li>Stickers and text: Stickers could be fun to use due to their expressive nature. Your choice as a content creator will go a long way in determining the fascination of your content. CapCut has therefore had you covered when it comes to adding fun features to your content to make it more interactive and exciting. Stickers and texts are therefore engaging tools you can employ to drive the fantasy of your audience. Also, it creates room for more details to be added without necessarily having to introduce more audio contents especially. With this feature, you can literally do more with less using CapCut.</li>

<p>Masking is a tool in editing software that allows you to hide, duplicate, show, or adjust footage by selecting a specific section of the video or using video overlays. The steps for adding the masking effect are given below:</p>
<p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
<p>Step1 Now click on the clip view to open the “settings” window.</p>
<p>Step2 Click on the “mask” section and select the circle mask and create the mask of the jumping subject.</p>
<p>Step3 Hide the first track clip so that mask can be viewed better and edited effectively.</p>
<p>Step4 Adjust the scale, position, and shape of the mask and make the edges smoother to match the object.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Boris Fx Effect</strong></p>
<p>Boris FX is a video editing and visual effects software. Filmora supports six continuum units-professional quality effects plugins from award-winning developer Boris FX.</p>
<p>To add these effects to your videos, follow the steps below:</p>
<p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
<p>Step1 Go to the “effects” window and open the Boris FX effects.</p>
<p>Step2 Select the directional blur from the bcc blur category.</p>
<p>Step3 Drag the effect to the freeze frame.</p>
<p>Step4 Now clicking on freeze frame, its settings will open.</p>
<p>Step5 Adjust the degree and angle of blur to get a perfect mask object. Turn ON the first video track.</p>
<p>Step6 Add the landing clip (shot 2) on top of the first video track after the freezing frame.</p>
<p>Step7 Find the point where the subject starts to descend toward the floor. Cut the clip here and delete the previous part.</p>
<p>Step8 Move the clip next to the freeze frame clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/super-jump-effect-6.gif"
                      alt="borax fx effect"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Keyframing</strong></p>
<p>Now we have to add animation in the freezing frame so that the masked shadow can be shown moving from the back towards the front, a speedy moving shadow. This is probably the most crucial step in editing.</p>
<p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
<p>Step1 Click on the freezing frame, and in the settings window, open “animation.”</p>
<p>Step2 Click on the customized option. Add the first keyframe at the start of the clip.</p>
<p>Step3 Now move two frames and add another keyframe with the position of the masked shadow as it is moving out of frame.</p>
<p>Step4 Now move two frames keeping the settings the same.</p>
<p>Step5 Add another keyframe at the end with your masked shadow appearing half from the top of the frame.</p>
<p>This step is a bit tricky to understand, but the most important. Once it is done, your animation will give the impression of an object moving like a flash from the back to the front of view.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/super-jump-effect-7.gif"
                      alt="keyframing"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Speed Ramping</strong></p>
<p>Once the keyframing is done, your super jump effect is roughly ready. All you have to do now is synchronize the speed of jumping, moving shadow, and landing. Here we will use the “speed ramping” tool.</p>
<p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
<p>Step1 Click on the clip, and in the settings window, choose “speed.”</p>
<p>Step2 Click on customize and increase the speed of any frame or clip.</p>
<p>Step3 Move the play head on the frame that you intend to increase the speed of, and move the frame on the speed window to speed up that part.</p>
<p>Once you have done speed ramping on both clips, your editing is done. Now play the video and see how the clip looks and if your super jump effect is remarkable or not.</p>

                ></p>
<h2 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h2><p>Make sure you follow all these steps in the correct order. You can get Filmora from the Filmora website, but its cracked versions are also available. While editing, try to make the transitions and clips as smooth and synchronized as you can.
