In This Article, You Get a Guide to Adding the BCC Glitch Effect to Give Your Sports Montages a More Professional Look</h2><p>Are you tired of using the same old way to edit your montages? Or do you want to learn to be more professional in your creativity? Don’t worry. We got you.</p>
<p>Here you will learn how to take your videos to the next level using speed ramping with a professional video editor- Wondershare Filmora. Moreover, you will get to know two ways to add the effect.</p>
<ol>
<li>Using speed ramping effect and glitch effects.</li>
<li>Using the standard speed settings.</li>
</ol>
<p>These effects can work well for any action sports or dance video. Let’s check out about speed ramping effect and ways to add it.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-speed-ramping"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-speed-ramping" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is speed ramping?"></a>Part 1. What is speed ramping?</h2><p>You’ve probably seen speed ramping used in suspenseful moments of a basketball video before, like a ball bouncing on the rim or a long buzzer-beating shot.</p>

<p>With speed ramping, we can slow down our most exciting moments to show our audience. And then speed it up again to keep pace with the music or action. So it will give you a smooth transition effect.</p>

<h5 id="Step1-Shot-the-footage"><a href="#Step1-Shot-the-footage" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Shot the footage"></a>Step1 Shot the footage</h5><p>To edit a montage, you must first capture it correctly. For our example footage, we want to ensure we have set our camera to a higher frame rate for filming this type of video since we’re going to use slow motion.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="shot footage from a higher angels"
                ></p>
<p><strong>How to capture the best footage?</strong></p>
<p>You can shoot handheld with a camera or a mobile phone because it allows you to move around your talent and catch some movements and action while giving a shaky camera effect for added suspense. To make evenly balanced videos, you can use a gimbal stabilizer. Here are some tips to get better shots.</p>
<ul>
<li>Change camera angles. Try getting shots low to the ground as well as at higher angles. That will give you more options to cut between when you edit the video.</li>
<li>Get various shots. You can get shots of dribbling, shooting, and just running with the ball to work with.</li>
<li>Try shooting on a longer lens. It is because you may not be able to get close to the action.</li>
<li>Record footage in slow mode on your camera or phone. It will allow you to capture more frames: the more frames, the smoother the slow-motion effect.</li>
</ul>
<p>Best capturing will make your video more cinematic and visually pleasing after preparing the footage. Finally, we will dive into edit tutorials on speed ramping and glitch effects separately for better understanding.</p>
<h5 id="Step2-Edit-the-speed-of-footage-in-Filmora"><a href="#Step2-Edit-the-speed-of-footage-in-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Edit the speed of footage in Filmora"></a>Step2 Edit the speed of footage in Filmora</h5><p>There are two ways to achieve the speed ramping effect. One is to use the speed ramping feature to adjust the video speed—the other way to achieve a similar effect is by using the standard speed settings.</p>
<p><strong>Edit with speed ramping feature in Filmora</strong></p>
<p>The speed ramping feature is included in Filmora standard license. So let’s start by opening Filmora.</p>
<p>1. Import media</p>
<p>First, import a video from your media library in the Wondershare Filmora. And drag the clip down on the timeline to start editing.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-ramping-3.jpg"
                      alt="library in wondershare filmora"
                ></p>
<p>2. Apply the speed ramping feature</p>
<p>To apply the speed ramping feature, <strong>right-click</strong> on the clip on the timeline. And click speed in the menu and choose <strong>speed ramping</strong> to open the settings window.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add speed ramping option"
                ></p>
<p>You can choose different speed templates in the setting window. Or, on the left corner, click on the customize option to adjust the keyframes and create the speed you want for the video.</p>

<p><strong>Edit with standard speed settings in Filmora</strong></p>
<p>Since speed ramping can only be used for paid users, we also provide you with an alternative way to give an exact transition effect, like speed ramping. Check out the following steps to add it.</p>
<p>1. You can <strong>drag</strong> the video from your library to the timeline. While in the <strong>timeline</strong>, double-click to open the speed menu. Then choose the starting speed you want your video to be with the speed slider.</p>

For our example footage, we want to ensure we have set our camera to a higher frame rate for filming this type of video since we’re going to use slow motion.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>How to capture the best footage?</strong></p>
<p>You can shoot handheld with a camera or a mobile phone because it allows you to move around your talent and catch some movements and action while giving a shaky camera effect for added suspense. To make evenly balanced videos, you can use a gimbal stabilizer. Here are some tips to get better shots.</p>
<ul>
<li>Change camera angles. Try getting shots low to the ground as well as at higher angles. That will give you more options to cut between when you edit the video.</li>
<li>Get various shots. You can get shots of dribbling, shooting, and just running with the ball to work with.</li>
<li>Try shooting on a longer lens. It is because you may not be able to get close to the action.</li>
<li>Record footage in slow mode on your camera or phone. It will allow you to capture more frames: the more frames, the smoother the slow-motion effect.</li>
</ul>
<p>Best capturing will make your video more cinematic and visually pleasing after preparing the footage. Finally, we will dive into edit tutorials on speed ramping and glitch effects separately for better understanding.</p>
<h5 id="Step2-Edit-the-speed-of-footage-in-Filmora-1"><a href="#Step2-Edit-the-speed-of-footage-in-Filmora-1" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Edit the speed of footage in Filmora"></a>Step2 Edit the speed of footage in Filmora</h5><p>There are two ways to achieve the speed ramping effect. One is to use the speed ramping feature to adjust the video speed—the other way to achieve a similar effect is by using the standard speed settings.</p>
<p><strong>Edit with speed ramping feature in Filmora</strong></p>
<p>The speed ramping feature is included in Filmora standard license. So let’s start by opening Filmora.</p>
<p>1. Import media</p>
<p>First, import a video from your media library in the Wondershare Filmora. And drag the clip down on the timeline to start editing.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="library in wondershare filmora"
                ></p>
<p>2. Apply the speed ramping feature</p>
<p>To apply the speed ramping feature, <strong>right-click</strong> on the clip on the timeline. And click speed in the menu and choose <strong>speed ramping</strong> to open the settings window.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add speed ramping option"
                ></p>
<p>You can choose different speed templates in the setting window. Or, on the left corner, click on the customize option to adjust the keyframes and create the speed you want for the video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="speed templates on wondershare filmora"
                ></p>
<p>The lower keyframe is when the video is slowest, and the peak is when the video is fastest. The middle parts between the keyframes are when it speeds up or slows down to reach the specific speed you set on each keyframe.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="adjusting key-frames wondershare filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Grab the keyframes and move them up to increase the speed or down to slow down the rate. You can also add more keyframes by moving the playhead to the spot where you want to change speed and clicking the plus button.</p>
<p>After adjusting our keyframes, we can play it back to see if we like the result.</p>

<h2 id="Shoot-Video-with-Virtual-Green-Screen"><a href="#Shoot-Video-with-Virtual-Green-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Shoot Video with Virtual Green Screen"></a>Shoot Video with Virtual Green Screen</h2><p>We have seen video creators on YouTube using green screen effects to beautify their background to make the video look professional and eye-catching. The same is applicable for gamers who live stream their gameplay on Twitch. Instead of physically hanging green screens in the background, some video creators opt for virtual green screens. Yes, it is possible to shoot videos with a virtual green background, and you do not have to buy screen greens and deal with the problem of hanging them in the background.</p>
<p>The concept of using virtual greenscreen is rather new, but it is getting popular among amateur video creators who do not want to invest in purchasing green screens initially. When you use a virtual background to shoot your video, the actual physical background is replaced completely with a virtual green background. Thereafter, you have to replace this virtual background with anything by using a video editor. In this article, we will illustrate how to use a virtual green screen to shoot video.</p>
<h2 id="1-Free-Virtual-Green-Screen"><a href="#1-Free-Virtual-Green-Screen" class="headerlink" title="1. Free Virtual Green Screen"></a>1. Free Virtual Green Screen</h2><p>In order to shoot a video with green virtual background, you cannot shoot your video with your regular camera app. Otherwise, your physical background will get recorded, and replacing that through video editor is going to be time-consuming. Therefore, there are specific apps available through which you have to shoot your video so that your physical background gets completely replaced by virtual greenscreen in real-time.</p>
<p>Snap Camera from Snapchat is a free app through which you can shoot your video to get a virtual green background. The app comes with a Green Screen filter that makes this virtual background effect possible. However, you will need a camera recording app that can record your video with green screen effects from Snap Camera. We will be using OBS Studio for recording the video which is also available for free. Snap Camera is compatible with Windows 10 and Mac 10.11+, and hence, you can use it to shoot video from your computer webcam. Here are the steps to follow –</p>
<p>Step 1: Download and install <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://snapcamera.snapchat.com/" >Snap Camera app <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your computer.</p>
<p>Step 2: Set up your webcam perfectly so that its angle is direct to your face.</p>
<p>Step 3: Open Snap Camera app and you will see yourself on the app through your webcam. Select the appropriate Lens(filter) and you have to select Green Screen Snap Filter.</p>

                      alt="video capture"
                ></p>
<p>Step 6: While configuration the new device, select Snap Camera as Device. This will enable green screen virtual backgrounds and you can start recording. After recording is done, save the file on your hard drive.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

A time-lapse video is to create photos at regular intervals and assemble them into the video to record changes that would be slow for the human eye to see. Time-Lapse video shows the technique of slow-motion videos using the same principle.</p>
<p>Time-lapse is usually for several purposes but mostly it is utilized to show the passage of time in a fast-forward format. time-lapse means that the camera takes the picture and then combined them into one video that seems to something happen in quickly. The lapse is set into video form in post-production, so movie mode is not necessary. Once the lapse is finished, it’s time to take it into post-production to bring it to life.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Use-QuickTime-Player-to-Create-Timelapse-Video"><a href="#Part-1-Use-QuickTime-Player-to-Create-Timelapse-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Use QuickTime Player to Create Timelapse Video"></a>Part 1. Use QuickTime Player to Create Timelapse Video</h2><p>QuickTime player creates a high-resolution video file from the series of photos without having to render the photos twice. The result of QuickTime is a much higher quality result. With this toolkit, after the recording is done, the illusion of fast-moving footage i-e time-lapse is to be created. QuickTime will always ask you what frame rate would you like to video in.</p>
<p><strong>Steps to Create Timelapse Video with QuickTime Player:</strong></p>
<p>To produce a timelapse movie using QuickTime Player, follow these steps:</p>
<p>Step 1: Launch the Recording</p>
<p>By selecting the File * New Screen Recording option in QuickTime, you may record your screen. After choosing the region to record, your screen will start to be recorded. Real-time video will be captured, and it will be archived.</p>

<p>Step 2: Import the Files</p>
<p>Go to the file &gt; Open Image Sequence menu after starting QuickTime. One of the video files you want to turn into a time-lapse should be opened in QuickTime Player. “Open File.” may be found by clicking the File menu link in the menu bar.</p>
<p>Step 3: Create the Timelapse</p>
<p>Within QuickTime, the series of images will be turned into time-lapse films. Choose one picture from the series, and then change the settings as necessary. Use the Higher Quality Apple Pro Resolution video codec, Actual size resolution, and 25 frames per second.</p>

Create Timelapse Video with iMovie</h2><p>To make an iMovie time-lapse on Mac, you have to capture the video and create a time-lapse out of it. For a multiple-hour recording in a few seconds to be fit, you will need software of time-lapse. Timelapse is utilized for accelerated or slow-motion videos with changes in the frame rate and playback videos in speed. The time-lapse software is available to handle the tasks without sacrificing the quality, size, and format of the video.</p>
<p><strong>Steps To Create Timelapse Video with iMovie</strong></p>
<p>Step 1: Launch iMovie</p>
<p>On your Mac, launch the iMovie application, and then import the video clip from the library that you wish to use to create a time-lapse. Drag the video to the timeline. Then you may see additional frames in the timeline by clicking the setting bar below.</p>
