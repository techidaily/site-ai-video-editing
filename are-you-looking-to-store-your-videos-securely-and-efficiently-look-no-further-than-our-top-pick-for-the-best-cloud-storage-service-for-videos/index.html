Look No Further than Our Top Pick for the Best Cloud Storage Service for Videos"></a>Are You Looking to Store Your Videos Securely and Efficiently? Look No Further than Our Top Pick for the Best Cloud Storage Service for Videos</h2><p>Which <strong>video cloud storage</strong> service is the best for storing videos? Many options are available, so it can be hard to decide which is the best for you.</p>
<p>Some factors to consider when choosing a cloud storage service for videos include how easy it is to use, the number of storage options available, and the price.</p>
<p>Some popular <strong>best video cloud storage</strong> services for videos include Flicker, Wondershare Drive, and Adobe Creative Cloud. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages, so it’s essential to consider what you need before making a decision.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the best cloud storage service for videos is one that meets your specific needs. So don’t hesitate to try out different services to see which one is best for you.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-No-1-Flicker"><a href="#Part-1-No-1-Flicker" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: No.1 Flicker"></a>Part 1: No.1 Flicker</h2><p>Flickr is an online image hosting and video hosting service that has been around for a long time. However, SmugMug now owns it, and you can access photos and videos from Flickr without registering an account.</p>
<h3 id="Flicker-Free-Storage-Policy"><a href="#Flicker-Free-Storage-Policy" class="headerlink" title="Flicker Free Storage Policy"></a>Flicker Free Storage Policy</h3><p>Flickr is a great <strong>online video storage</strong> service, but it can be limiting if you want to store many pictures and videos. For example, a Flickr free account can only store 1000 photos and videos, which means it can only hold about 2-3 GB of data.</p>
<p>Flickr also has some limitations when it comes to file size. For example, photos are limited to 200 MB and videos are limited to 1 GB. However, you can get around these limitations by storing the maximum allowed file size (e.g., photo files are limited to 200 MB and video files are limited to 1 GB). Additionally, if you want to share photos and videos with others, you’ll need to <strong>upload video to the cloud</strong> or use the Flickr app on a device.</p>
<p>Overall, Flickr is a great online photo and video storage service, but it may not be the best option for you if you’re looking for a lot of space or want to share photos and videos with others.</p>

We’ll look at three different methods to correct color distortion in videos.</p>

<h2 id="What-Is-Color-Distortion"><a href="#What-Is-Color-Distortion" class="headerlink" title="What Is Color Distortion"></a>What Is Color Distortion</h2><p>Color distortion, also called chromatic aberration (CA), happens when the camera’s lens cannot resolve the wavelengths of light that it is recording. It occurs due to dispersion, which is when the lens elements’ refractive index varies with the light wavelength.</p>
<p>The refractive index of transparent materials often reduces with increasing wavelength. Because a lens’ focal length depends on the index of refraction, this variation in refraction index affects focusing.</p>
<p>There are two types of CA: transverse (lateral) and axial (longitudinal). Axial aberration happens when different wavelengths of light focus at different distances from a lens (focus shift). Essentially, longitudinal aberration is often at long focal lengths.</p>
<p>On the other hand, transverse aberration happens when different wavelengths focus at different places in the focal plane due to the magnification or distortion of the lens varying with wavelength. Ideally, transverse aberration is often at short focal lengths.</p>
<p>The two types of CA have different characteristics, and they may occur together. Axial chromatic aberration occurs throughout an image, and you can reduce it by stopping down, hence increasing the depth of the field so that although the different wavelengths are focusing at different distances, they’re still in acceptable focus.</p>
<p>When it comes to transverse chromatic aberration, it doesn’t occur in the middle of the image, and it increases towards the edge. What’s more? Stopping down does not affect it.</p>

Color distortion can also occur when adding effects to a video, such as the use of a green screen. By using the green screen to replace the real thing, the colors in the video can appear a little off.</p>

<p>Nothing is more satisfying than seeing the final cut of a video and realizing that everything we filmed is crystal clear, with vibrant colors and balanced light. Unfortunately, whether you are editing on your own or collaborating with a team, this can be difficult to achieve because color problems often occur. Unlike photo editors, where one photo can easily be fixed without affecting the rest of an album, video editing requires adjusting to fix one problem. We’ll look at three different methods to correct color distortion in videos.</p>

<p>Nothing is more satisfying than seeing the final cut of a video and realizing that everything we filmed is crystal clear, with vibrant colors and balanced light. Unfortunately, whether you are editing on your own or collaborating with a team, this can be difficult to achieve because color problems often occur. Unlike photo editors, where one photo can easily be fixed without affecting the rest of an album, video editing requires adjusting to fix one problem. We’ll look at three different methods to correct color distortion in videos.</p>

<h2 id="What-Is-Color-Distortion-2"><a href="#What-Is-Color-Distortion-2" class="headerlink" title="What Is Color Distortion"></a>What Is Color Distortion</h2><p>Color distortion, also called chromatic aberration (CA), happens when the camera’s lens cannot resolve the wavelengths of light that it is recording. It occurs due to dispersion, which is when the lens elements’ refractive index varies with the light wavelength.</p>
<p>The refractive index of transparent materials often reduces with increasing wavelength. Because a lens’ focal length depends on the index of refraction, this variation in refraction index affects focusing.</p>
<p>There are two types of CA: transverse (lateral) and axial (longitudinal). Axial aberration happens when different wavelengths of light focus at different distances from a lens (focus shift). Essentially, longitudinal aberration is often at long focal lengths.</p>
<p>On the other hand, transverse aberration happens when different wavelengths focus at different places in the focal plane due to the magnification or distortion of the lens varying with wavelength. Ideally, transverse aberration is often at short focal lengths.</p>
<p>The two types of CA have different characteristics, and they may occur together. Axial chromatic aberration occurs throughout an image, and you can reduce it by stopping down, hence increasing the depth of the field so that although the different wavelengths are focusing at different distances, they’re still in acceptable focus.</p>
<p>When it comes to transverse chromatic aberration, it doesn’t occur in the middle of the image, and it increases towards the edge. What’s more? Stopping down does not affect it.</p>

Color distortion can also occur when adding effects to a video, such as the use of a green screen. By using the green screen to replace the real thing, the colors in the video can appear a little off.</p>

<p>Brightness and Contrast Effect: With this effect, you can adjust the contrast and brightness of your video. Using this effect allows you to make adjustments to all pixel values in your video image at once — mid-tones, shadows, and highlights.</p>
<p>Color Balance Effect: This effect changes the amount of blue, green, and red in the shadow, highlights of an image, and mid-tones. Preserve Luminosity preserves the average brightness of your video image and changes the color. It maintains the tonal balance in your video image.</p>

<h2 id="What-Is-a-Miniature-Effect"><a href="#What-Is-a-Miniature-Effect" class="headerlink" title="What Is a Miniature Effect?"></a>What Is a Miniature Effect?</h2><p><img

                      alt="after adding a miniature effect"
                ></p>
<p>But first, let’s learn the logic of making the miniature effect. As many video editing pros present on Tiktok, the miniature effect is a fun way to brighten up your photography or video shots. For example, when taking a video or a time-lapse of a landscape, we always have a bigger depth of field, so most objects in the frame are in focus.</p>
<p>However, when we film a miniature model, the depth of field is shallow. So, we only see some objects in focus, and the rest is blurry. This visual trick makes our brain believe that the big landscape we’re seeing is actually a tiny model.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="a miniature effect for landscape"
                ></p>
<p>To create a miniature look, we can use specific effects to fake a shallow depth of field, and then the landscape view will look like a tiny model. While some keys to notice before making the miniature effect are:</p>
<ul>
<li>It utilizes <strong>selective blur</strong> to make things appear like <strong>small</strong></li>
<li>The miniature effect works best for footage filmed from <strong>a high angle</strong>.</li>
<li>The tiny effect is usually used in <strong>drone footage, time lapses</strong>, or <strong>landscape photography</strong>.</li>
</ul>

First, we ensure that we have a <strong>Blur</strong> effect on the video.</p>
<p><img

<p>To add a blur effect from the panel, follow the below-mentioned steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>First of all, move toward the above tabs.</li>
<li>Then click on the 5th section, which is <strong>Effect</strong></li>

Again, see how precise it turned out. To add effect, follow below steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First, drag</strong> and <strong>Drop</strong> the effect toward the timeline.</li>
<li>Then, make sure to release the effect on the video to give it a lens blur appearance.</li>
</ul>

If you need more blur level in your video and make it more cinematic, then follow the below steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, ensure that the <strong>opacity</strong> of the blur effect is 100%.</li>
<li>Then, if you still want more blurriness, add <strong>Blur 2</strong> effect multiple times on the video.</li>
<li>Finally, add effect by just the <strong>Drag and Drop</strong></li>
</ul>

Due to this, we will have a selective blur portion. For this, follow the below guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> on the video present in 2nd track.</li>
<li>The settings tab will be open in the top left section.</li>
<li>Then find the <strong>Mask</strong> section and click on it.</li>
<li>After this, <strong>click</strong> on the <strong>Double-line</strong>.</li>
<li>Set the mask on video according to your style and choice.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p><img  
                     lazyload

                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> you can adjust the mask size and position by rotating and changing its shape.</p>
<p>Watch the rotating and adjusting actions as shown below!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="rotation of mask in wondershare filmora"
                ></p>
<p>For example, when we add a mask in the below time-lapse video, follow the above mask adjustments. Unfortunately, we can’t get good results. Therefore, we will apply another way to add a mask by changing shape and position. Follow the instructions for modifications:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-11.gif"
                      alt="blur the object near to camera and focus on the distant object"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Make a building or any object <strong>Blurry</strong> near the camera because it is not present within the depth of field.</li>
<li>While the <strong>object is far</strong> from the camera, it is focused because it is in the depth of the field.</li>
<li>Then adjust the mask, as per your choice.</li>
</ul>
<p>Want to change the shape of the mask? Then follow the below steps:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-12.gif"
                      alt="changing the mask of video on wondershare filmora"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Double-click on the video present in 2nd video track.</li>
<li><strong>Settings</strong> will activate on the top left side.</li>
<li>Then click on the <strong>Mask</strong> tab to open it.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Rectangular</strong> mask from the list and apply it.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> make sure you are masking the same extent and excluding the object you want to be out of focus.</p>
<p>Now, it’s time to mask the whole object, which is far, but we want to make it in focus! For this, follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add the same stock video clip a <strong>third time</strong> on the third video track of the timeline.</li>
<li>Then add a mask in a <strong>Rectangle</strong> shape on the building.</li>
<li>Don’t <strong>blur</strong> the edge of this mask.</li>
</ul>

If you need more blur level in your video and make it more cinematic, then follow the below steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, ensure that the <strong>opacity</strong> of the blur effect is 100%.</li>
<li>Then, if you still want more blurriness, add <strong>Blur 2</strong> effect multiple times on the video.</li>
<li>Finally, add effect by just the <strong>Drag and Drop</strong></li>
</ul>

</ul>

Due to this, we will have a selective blur portion. For this, follow the below guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> on the video present in 2nd track.</li>
<li>The settings tab will be open in the top left section.</li>
<li>Then find the <strong>Mask</strong> section and click on it.</li>
<li>After this, <strong>click</strong> on the <strong>Double-line</strong>.</li>
<li>Set the mask on video according to your style and choice.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-9.gif"
                      alt="add mask to the video on wondershare filmora"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> you can adjust the mask size and position by rotating and changing its shape.</p>
<p>Watch the rotating and adjusting actions as shown below!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-10.gif"
                      alt="rotation of mask in wondershare filmora"
                ></p>
<p>For example, when we add a mask in the below time-lapse video, follow the above mask adjustments. Unfortunately, we can’t get good results. Therefore, we will apply another way to add a mask by changing shape and position. Follow the instructions for modifications:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-11.gif"
                      alt="blur the object near to camera and focus on the distant object"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Make a building or any object <strong>Blurry</strong> near the camera because it is not present within the depth of field.</li>
<li>While the <strong>object is far</strong> from the camera, it is focused because it is in the depth of the field.</li>
<li>Then adjust the mask, as per your choice.</li>
</ul>
<p>Want to change the shape of the mask? Then follow the below steps:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-12.gif"
                      alt="changing the mask of video on wondershare filmora"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Double-click on the video present in 2nd video track.</li>
<li><strong>Settings</strong> will activate on the top left side.</li>
<li>Then click on the <strong>Mask</strong> tab to open it.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Rectangular</strong> mask from the list and apply it.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> make sure you are masking the same extent and excluding the object you want to be out of focus.</p>
<p>Now, it’s time to mask the whole object, which is far, but we want to make it in focus! For this, follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add the same stock video clip a <strong>third time</strong> on the third video track of the timeline.</li>
<li>Then add a mask in a <strong>Rectangle</strong> shape on the building.</li>
<li>Don’t <strong>blur</strong> the edge of this mask.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-13.gif"
                      alt="mask the object far from the camera for the main focus"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step8-Final-Look-1"><a href="#Step8-Final-Look-1" class="headerlink" title="Step8 Final Look"></a>Step8 Final Look</h5><p>You are excited now to see the final look of your miniature effect! Finally, it’s in front of you! Just modify it more if you want to make it more precise.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-14.gif"
                      alt="final look of miniature effect on wondershare filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Have you tried to add a miniature effect before? If yes, then share your experience with us! Try with more mask shapes and add more blur effects. Make sure that you are using Wondershare Filmora to make more filmy shots. Feel free to try out different effects and enjoy the following results!</p>
