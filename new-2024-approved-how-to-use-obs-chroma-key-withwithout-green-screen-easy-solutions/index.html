<h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The usage of chroma keying has been increasingly popular in recent years, with various uses of this video effect employed for live streaming. Chroma keying is used to erase the backdrop of a video clip which is then composited over another scene or picture. The most apparent usage of this technology is for weather broadcasts when the presenter is composited over the top of a weather radar picture. In more recent times we’re seeing video game broadcasters chroma keying themselves into their live feeds. There are various sites to explore for streaming backdrops. Most come as overlay packages with distinct themes. A good location to look is Filmora. Else, if you want to add a new backdrop to your broadcast, you may simply add a new picture source to your scene in OBS. So, check out what best fits you and opt for the one.</p>

<p>~ Some FAQs about FLV Videos:</p>
<p><strong>why is .flv format used?</strong></p>
<p>FLV is basically used to publish or distribute videos on the Internet. Many social platforms and web pages (such as youtube, Hulu, e.t.c.) use .flv files as it provide high-quality synchronized audio and video in compact file size. It was mostly used for embedded videos on these platforms. It is compatible with most browsers and devices even with older phones and computers.</p>
<p><strong>How to play .FLV files?</strong></p>
<p>To play .flv files a flash player is required. Which is pre-installed in almost most of the computers and browsers, if that’s not the case. Then you need a good video player which supports .flv format. Therefore VLC media prayer is a good choice. It is quite easy to use and has some useful features like Speed, Adding subtitles, Audio sync, e.t.c.</p>
<p><strong>Is .flv file easy to edit?</strong></p>
<p>FLV is just a format, It can be edited like any other format. Steps may differ from software to software. But don’t worry as I have mentioned the steps of some popular FLV video editors above.</p>
<p><strong>Can the .flv file be converted?</strong></p>
<p>If you don’t want to stick with the .flv format for long enough and want to switch over to a more convenient format then you can try these converters.</p>
<p><strong>VLC Media Player:</strong> Yes, apart from being a video player it can convert video formats. It’s quite easy to use.</p>
<p>Simply Open VLC Media Player &gt;&gt; Click Media tab &gt;&gt; Click “Convert&#x2F;Save” &gt;&gt; On pop up menu Select “Add” to add file (can add multiple files also) &gt;&gt; Click “Convert&#x2F;Save” &gt;&gt; Add Destination folder and File Format (to convert in) then click “Start”.</p>

<p>Open HandBrake-“Drop a file” screen will appear &gt;&gt; Select the specific file you one to convert &gt;&gt; Select Destination filder &gt;&gt; Click “Start encoding”.</p>
<p><strong>Flv vs Mp4 which is better?</strong></p>
<p>FLV format was quite popular back in 2010 as it provides high-quality compressed video for the internet. It takes less space which makes it easy to download and transfer quickly. Nowadays MP4 format is used more as it is versatile and is compatible with almost all devices like Mobile, PC, TV, e.t.c. FLV uses H.263 codec while MP4 uses  codec which provides better quality after compression. Still .flv file is a better choice for streaming platforms as one of the most common software used for streaming is OBS studio and it produces .flv files.</p>

<p>~ Some FAQs about FLV Videos:</p>

<p><strong>Is .flv file easy to edit?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Flv vs Mp4 which is better?</strong></p>
<p>FLV format was quite popular back in 2010 as it provides high-quality compressed video for the internet. It takes less space which makes it easy to download and transfer quickly. Nowadays MP4 format is used more as it is versatile and is compatible with almost all devices like Mobile, PC, TV, e.t.c.

<p>~ Some FAQs about FLV Videos:</p>
<p><strong>why is .flv format used?</strong></p>
<p>FLV is basically used to publish or distribute videos on the Internet. Many social platforms and web pages (such as youtube, Hulu, e.t.c.) use .flv files as it provide high-quality synchronized audio and video in compact file size. It was mostly used for embedded videos on these platforms. It is compatible with most browsers and devices even with older phones and computers.</p>
<p><strong>How to play .FLV files?</strong></p>
<p>To play .flv files a flash player is required. Which is pre-installed in almost most of the computers and browsers, if that’s not the case. Then you need a good video player which supports .flv format. Therefore VLC media prayer is a good choice. It is quite easy to use and has some useful features like Speed, Adding subtitles, Audio sync, e.t.c.</p>
<p><strong>Is .flv file easy to edit?</strong></p>
<p>FLV is just a format, It can be edited like any other format. Steps may differ from software to software. But don’t worry as I have mentioned the steps of some popular FLV video editors above.</p>
<p><strong>Can the .flv file be converted?</strong></p>
<p>If you don’t want to stick with the .flv format for long enough and want to switch over to a more convenient format then you can try these converters.</p>
<p><strong>VLC Media Player:</strong> Yes, apart from being a video player it can convert video formats. It’s quite easy to use.</p>
<p>Simply Open VLC Media Player &gt;&gt; Click Media tab &gt;&gt; Click “Convert&#x2F;Save” &gt;&gt; On pop up menu Select “Add” to add file (can add multiple files also) &gt;&gt; Click “Convert&#x2F;Save” &gt;&gt; Add Destination folder and File Format (to convert in) then click “Start”.</p>

<p>Open HandBrake-“Drop a file” screen will appear &gt;&gt; Select the specific file you one to convert &gt;&gt; Select Destination filder &gt;&gt; Click “Start encoding”.</p>
<p><strong>Flv vs Mp4 which is better?</strong></p>
<p>FLV format was quite popular back in 2010 as it provides high-quality compressed video for the internet. It takes less space which makes it easy to download and transfer quickly. Nowadays MP4 format is used more as it is versatile and is compatible with almost all devices like Mobile, PC, TV, e.t.c. FLV uses H.263 codec while MP4 uses  codec which provides better quality after compression. Still .flv file is a better choice for streaming platforms as one of the most common software used for streaming is OBS studio and it produces .flv files.</p>
<p> <strong>It is available for both Windows and Mac.</strong></p>

Now, when you look at the Timeline, you can quickly distinguish footage from different cameras.</p>

Rename Individual Clips</strong></p>
<p>It would be much simpler to organize the timeline if you could quickly rename individual clips. Cut a clip into smaller segments and give each clip a different name. Make sure these clips have a name other than the source video to avoid confusion.</p>
<p><strong>2. Remove Empty Timeline</strong></p>
<p>For quick video editing, timeline organization is essential. Organize your materials and footage at all times to prevent delays. Put everything in the correct folders with the proper labels. To keep your timeline organized, select “Delete Empty Tracks” from the context menu when right-clicking on the track window on the left.</p>
<p><strong>3. Use Keyboard Shortcuts</strong></p>
<p>Knowing keyboard shortcuts allows you to carry out the editing process quickly and precisely.</p>
<p><strong>4. Select Good Music</strong></p>
<p>Don’t only concentrate on the images; the music also affects how well your video comes out. For example, suppose you’re making a drama movie. In that case, you should pick the right music track to evoke particular emotions in your viewers.</p>
<p><strong>5. Add Text and Graphics</strong></p>
<p>Depending on the style of the video, adding text, graphics, or stock video to your project could be helpful. You should provide more text than just the title for some videos.</p>
<h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>You don’t need to be an expert in video editing to produce high-quality videos. In reality, you can complete the task without any expensive, high-end professional training. So how? Well, with the proper video editing tools like Wondershare Filmora, anything is possible.

<p><strong>4. Color Code Your Clips</strong></p>
<p>Suppose you want to make the timeline even easier to view. In that case, you can select all clips from a camera or a subject and color code them into a specific color. For example, you can color code the footage from camera A in red, camera B in yellow, and Camera C in blue. Now, when you look at the Timeline, you can quickly distinguish footage from different cameras.</p>

Rename Individual Clips</strong></p>
<p>It would be much simpler to organize the timeline if you could quickly rename individual clips. Cut a clip into smaller segments and give each clip a different name. Make sure these clips have a name other than the source video to avoid confusion.</p>
<p><strong>2. Remove Empty Timeline</strong></p>
<p>For quick video editing, timeline organization is essential. Organize your materials and footage at all times to prevent delays. Put everything in the correct folders with the proper labels. To keep your timeline organized, select “Delete Empty Tracks” from the context menu when right-clicking on the track window on the left.</p>
<p><strong>3. Use Keyboard Shortcuts</strong></p>
<p>Knowing keyboard shortcuts allows you to carry out the editing process quickly and precisely.</p>
<p><strong>4. Select Good Music</strong></p>
<p>Don’t only concentrate on the images; the music also affects how well your video comes out. For example, suppose you’re making a drama movie. In that case, you should pick the right music track to evoke particular emotions in your viewers.</p>
<p><strong>5. Add Text and Graphics</strong></p>
<p>Depending on the style of the video, adding text, graphics, or stock video to your project could be helpful. You should provide more text than just the title for some videos.</p>
<h2 id="Summary-1"><a href="#Summary-1" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>You don’t need to be an expert in video editing to produce high-quality videos. In reality, you can complete the task without any expensive, high-end professional training. So how? Well, with the proper video editing tools like Wondershare Filmora, anything is possible. Follow the above guide, organize your timeline and keep the tracks consistent while video editing on Filmora so it’s easier to come back and edit a project or share with other editors.</p>

The Common Reasons If You Can’t Adjust the Length of TikTok Video"></a>Part 3. The Common Reasons If You Can’t Adjust the Length of TikTok Video</h2><p>Hope the above part will prove helpful to you in terms of adjusting the TikTok video using Wondershare Filmora. Now, let’s see what the common reasons which hinder users from adjusting the length of TikTok Videos are:</p>
<h3 id="1-The-Video-is-Too-Short"><a href="#1-The-Video-is-Too-Short" class="headerlink" title="1. The Video is Too Short"></a>1. The Video is Too Short</h3><p>Most TikTok users worry about <strong>why they can’t adjust TikTok clip length.</strong> The common reason behind this query is the short length of the video. If your video length is 3 seconds, then it would not be possible to shorten it further on TikTok. Thus, try to make a Video of at least 15 seconds to upload it on TikTok successfully.</p>
<h3 id="2-The-Video-is-Too-Long"><a href="#2-The-Video-is-Too-Long" class="headerlink" title="2. The Video is Too Long"></a>2. The Video is Too Long</h3><p>If you have recorded a too-long video, it would not be possible to adjust its length on TikTok. Too long videos, especially more than 10 minutes, are less likely to be modified by TikTok. For that, you can take the help of Filmora to adjust its size. Filmora will trim the video to a suitable length within seconds.</p>
<h3 id="3-Using-Green-Screen-or-Other-Incompatible-Effects"><a href="#3-Using-Green-Screen-or-Other-Incompatible-Effects" class="headerlink" title="3.

For example, using a green screen creates some technical issues in your video, which gets weirder when you try to adjust the length of such a video. Due to this, proper adjustments in such videos are difficult to do on TikTok.</p>

It becomes pretty difficult to adjust the length of TikTok videos when the app shows glitches. However, on Filmora, the case is totally the opposite.
