This video camera can now be from a mobile phone or a high-quality DSLR. It will all depend upon your preference for quality and frame rate.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Stability is the key here, as the captured videos will be masked and combined in the later stages of the steps. To do so, consistently capturing the video in the same ratio is necessary. You can stabilize the video with a simple gorilla pod that you can get of good quality or a simple tripod.</p>
<h3 id="The-prop"><a href="#The-prop" class="headerlink" title="The prop"></a>The prop</h3><p>The prop will be the object that we will be flying in the video. It could be a fluffy toy, a ball, a box, or anything you desire to be flying in your video.</p>

<h3 id="Good-presentation"><a href="#Good-presentation" class="headerlink" title="Good presentation"></a>Good presentation</h3><p>Now, if you want your video to shine like the good ones, you will need to know how to present it. In this section, the requirement will be yourself. As you are not flying an object, you must act the part.</p>
<p>A good presentation will allow you to make the video more natural. Because no matter how skilled you are with video editing, a video with props will only be of quality until the subject acts their part with quality.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-capture-the-footage"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-capture-the-footage" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to capture the footage?"></a>Part 2. How to capture the footage?</h2><p>Before we get into how we edit our footage, we need to know how to shoot the video to edit. Follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Set up</strong> your camera on a tripod or a gorilla pod.</li>
<li>After setting up the camera, <strong>record</strong> an empty frame.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="note"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> An empty frame video will be the one you will use to mask the original clip.</p>
<h3 id="Reference-video"><a href="#Reference-video" class="headerlink" title="Reference video"></a>Reference video</h3><p>Start recording a five-second clip of the sofa where you will be sitting without yourself or the prop. Here you don’t need to add anything except the reference. Follow the guidelines below when making the reference video:</p>
<ul>
<li>The video should be plain.</li>
<li>It should be simple.</li>
<li>There should be no moving object or subject.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/reference-video.gif"
                      alt="reference video"
                ></p>
<h3 id="Main-video"><a href="#Main-video" class="headerlink" title="Main video"></a>Main video</h3><p>After shooting the empty frame video, move on to shooting the video with yourself in it. Follow the below to achieve something unique:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your focus should be on the prop.</li>
<li>Use a thread or a rope to attach the prop to it. (In this case, we are using a ball.)</li>
<li>Attach the ball to the thread and hand it on the roof.</li>
<li>Record yourself now with the prop with your desired content or script.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/main-video.gif"
                      alt="main video"
                ></p>
<p>After completing the video, simply stop recording. Now you will end up with two video clips.</p>
<p>Adding these two clips in the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, you can easily create the flying object effect. To do so, follow the steps explained in the section ahead.</p>

<li>Open the Wondershare Filmora software and Click on the New Project icon on the window.</li>
<li>After you have clicked on the New Project icon, our main workplace will be launched.</li>
<li>Here you can see various options.</li>
<li>To get started, we need to import our video clips to edit them.</li>

<li>Shows you to drag and drop the file from your main directory simply.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can choose whatever suits you the best!</p>
<h5 id="Step2Add-your-clips-to-your-timeline"><a href="#Step2Add-your-clips-to-your-timeline" class="headerlink" title="Step2Add your clips to your timeline"></a>Step2Add your clips to your timeline</h5><p>Now that we have imported our videos into the timeline, our next step will be to add our videos to the timeline.</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply click on the imported clips on the import window.</li>
<li>Then drag it to the timeline below.</li>
<li>Doing so will create a working timeline you can view and edit as you go along the editing process.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

You will need to size it to the original video for that to work. Doing so is simple and will require you to take some easy steps.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, click on the clip.</li>
<li>Then, when it is selected, move on to the tab above to choose the speed option from the bar.</li>
<li>Here, you will also see options such as cropping, Green screen, and color.</li>
<li>Choose the option of speed.</li>
<li>Then, a drop-down tile will pop up. Here you can see different options available to speed up your video.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<ul>
<li>You can speed up your video and slow it down.</li>
<li>For now, we will have to slow it down.</li>
</ul>

                      alt="note"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Slowing it down will increase the time of the video clip and allow you to match it with the original video clip.</p>
<p>Don’t worry about the speed, as the video is already empty, and there will be no distractions to disturb our editing.</p>
<h5 id="Step4Add-the-masking-effect"><a href="#Step4Add-the-masking-effect" class="headerlink" title="Step4Add the masking effect"></a>Step4Add the masking effect</h5><p>Now that we have our video aligned with the reference video we are using. Let’s move to the next step.</p>
<p>This step will try to remove the thread attached to the ball; otherwise, it will show in the video, and our effect will be ruined. However, before we do that, we will need to know what <strong>masking</strong> is.</p>
<h5 id="What-is-the-Masking-effect-in-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#What-is-the-Masking-effect-in-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="What is the Masking effect in Wondershare Filmora?"></a>What is the Masking effect in Wondershare Filmora?</h5><p>Have you ever seen the behind-the-scenes of those big-budget movies? Then you might have seen the actors and the stunt workers hanging from big ropes performing stunts in front of green screens.</p>
<p>Well, the directors capture the video in real-time. But they can do those big stunts on TV with editing and CGI, and one of the effects is “<strong>Masking</strong>.”</p>
<p>The masking effect allows you to mask the object on the screen with a reference video. So that’s how the ropes attached to the stuntmen get removed in the original videos.</p>
<h5 id="How-to-add-a-masking-effect"><a href="#How-to-add-a-masking-effect" class="headerlink" title="How to add a masking effect?"></a>How to add a masking effect?</h5><p>Although there are numerous ways to do that, the one we will use in this video is to remove the thread. For this, follow the below steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply go to the <strong>effect icon</strong> that you can see in the bar above.</li>
<li>In the effects bar, move to the utility tab.</li>
<li>You will see a window showing you the many effects Wondershare Filmora provides you from default.</li>
<li>Select the shape mask tile.</li>
<li>Now drag and drop it on the timeline below.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="note"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You must ensure the effect is applied to the main video, not the reference video.</p>
<ul>
<li>When you drag the effect into the main video, you will notice a transparent shape added to the video. This is your <strong>Mask</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="Step5Edit-the-masking-effect"><a href="#Step5Edit-the-masking-effect" class="headerlink" title="Step5Edit the masking effect"></a>Step5Edit the masking effect</h5><p>You must hide the thread attached to the ball with the masking effect. To do this, follow the below guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Double-click on the effect added to the main video.</li>
<li>You will notice another window pop up on the import library.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="note"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In the pop-up window, you will see the multiple options and edits you can apply to the masking effect, such as Transform, Compositing, Motion tracking, and stabilization.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="wondershare filmora effect editing panel"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Scroll down on the window and notice a video <strong>effect tab</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the effect tab, you will have multiple options, such as the shape mask, X, Y, and scale and blur strength options, as shown below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Now adjust the mask to hide the string. It may be easy to invert the mask.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="note"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> That the borders of the mask are blurred. But you can also change them by inverting the mask, which turns the borders and the space between them.</p>
<p><strong>Remember</strong> the invisibility cloak from Harry Potter? It works just like that, only with a solid shape.</p>
<ul>
<li>Now use the <strong>X</strong> and <strong>Y options</strong> to move the mask anywhere in the video.</li>
</ul>

To blend the borders with the background, follow the steps below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply <strong>Double-click</strong> on the effect in the timeline.</li>
<li>Then, in the editing tab, find out the blur strength option.</li>
</ul>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Please keep looking in the window on the right. Check and increase the blur strength until you are satisfied with the result.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lastly, click on <strong>OK</strong> when you are done.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="Step7Creating-the-popup-effect"><a href="#Step7Creating-the-popup-effect" class="headerlink" title="Step7Creating the popup effect"></a>Step7Creating the popup effect</h5><p>Now, if you want your object to appear out of thin air, you must create that pop-up effect. You can create the pop-up effect in simple and easy steps, as shown below:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, drag the timeline dragger to the point where you want the prop or the ball to pop up.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Your presentation should be accurate and precise!</strong></p>
<p>Imagine you were doing a “<strong>swoosh</strong>“ action, similar to swinging a wand. Now you want your object to appear at that time.</p>
<p><strong>Split the Video:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drag</strong> the timeline dragger to that point.</li>
<li>Now press <strong>Ctrl+B</strong> to split both videos.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Add Popup Effect:</strong></p>
<p>The masking effect will be applied from the start. Our goal is to hide the masking effect before the ball pop-ups. For this, follow the below steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go into the setting by <strong>Double-Clicking</strong> the masking effect on the original video.</li>

<h3 id="Good-presentation-1"><a href="#Good-presentation-1" class="headerlink" title="Good presentation"></a>Good presentation</h3><p>Now, if you want your video to shine like the good ones, you will need to know how to present it. In this section, the requirement will be yourself. As you are not flying an object, you must act the part.</p>
<p>A good presentation will allow you to make the video more natural. Because no matter how skilled you are with video editing, a video with props will only be of quality until the subject acts their part with quality.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-capture-the-footage-1"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-capture-the-footage-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to capture the footage?"></a>Part 2. How to capture the footage?</h2><p>Before we get into how we edit our footage, we need to know how to shoot the video to edit. Follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Set up</strong> your camera on a tripod or a gorilla pod.</li>
<li>After setting up the camera, <strong>record</strong> an empty frame.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                      alt="note"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> An empty frame video will be the one you will use to mask the original clip.</p>
<h3 id="Reference-video-1"><a href="#Reference-video-1" class="headerlink" title="Reference video"></a>Reference video</h3><p>Start recording a five-second clip of the sofa where you will be sitting without yourself or the prop. Here you don’t need to add anything except the reference. Follow the guidelines below when making the reference video:</p>
<ul>
<li>The video should be plain.</li>
<li>It should be simple.</li>
<li>There should be no moving object or subject.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/reference-video.gif"
                      alt="reference video"
                ></p>
<h3 id="Main-video-1"><a href="#Main-video-1" class="headerlink" title="Main video"></a>Main video</h3><p>After shooting the empty frame video, move on to shooting the video with yourself in it. Follow the below to achieve something unique:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your focus should be on the prop.</li>
<li>Use a thread or a rope to attach the prop to it. (In this case, we are using a ball.)</li>
<li>Attach the ball to the thread and hand it on the roof.</li>
<li>Record yourself now with the prop with your desired content or script.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/main-video.gif"
                      alt="main video"
                ></p>
<p>After completing the video, simply stop recording. Now you will end up with two video clips.</p>
<p>Adding these two clips in the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, you can easily create the flying object effect. To do so, follow the steps explained in the section ahead.</p>

<li>Open the Wondershare Filmora software and Click on the New Project icon on the window.</li>
<li>After you have clicked on the New Project icon, our main workplace will be launched.</li>
<li>Here you can see various options.</li>
<li>To get started, we need to import our video clips to edit them.</li>
</ul>

</ol>
<p>You can choose whatever suits you the best!</p>

<ul>
<li>Simply click on the imported clips on the import window.</li>
<li>Then drag it to the timeline below.</li>
<li>Doing so will create a working timeline you can view and edit as you go along the editing process.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

You will need to size it to the original video for that to work. Doing so is simple and will require you to take some easy steps.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, click on the clip.</li>
<li>Then, when it is selected, move on to the tab above to choose the speed option from the bar.</li>
<li>Here, you will also see options such as cropping, Green screen, and color.</li>
<li>Choose the option of speed.</li>
<li>Then, a drop-down tile will pop up. Here you can see different options available to speed up your video.</li>
</ul>
<p><img

<ul>
<li>You can speed up your video and slow it down.</li>

                      alt="note"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Slowing it down will increase the time of the video clip and allow you to match it with the original video clip.</p>
<p>Don’t worry about the speed, as the video is already empty, and there will be no distractions to disturb our editing.</p>
<h5 id="Step4Add-the-masking-effect-1"><a href="#Step4Add-the-masking-effect-1" class="headerlink" title="Step4Add the masking effect"></a>Step4Add the masking effect</h5><p>Now that we have our video aligned with the reference video we are using. Let’s move to the next step.</p>
<p>This step will try to remove the thread attached to the ball; otherwise, it will show in the video, and our effect will be ruined. However, before we do that, we will need to know what <strong>masking</strong> is.</p>
<h5 id="What-is-the-Masking-effect-in-Wondershare-Filmora-1"><a href="#What-is-the-Masking-effect-in-Wondershare-Filmora-1" class="headerlink" title="What is the Masking effect in Wondershare Filmora?"></a>What is the Masking effect in Wondershare Filmora?</h5><p>Have you ever seen the behind-the-scenes of those big-budget movies? Then you might have seen the actors and the stunt workers hanging from big ropes performing stunts in front of green screens.</p>
<p>Well, the directors capture the video in real-time. But they can do those big stunts on TV with editing and CGI, and one of the effects is “<strong>Masking</strong>.”</p>
<p>The masking effect allows you to mask the object on the screen with a reference video. So that’s how the ropes attached to the stuntmen get removed in the original videos.</p>
<h5 id="How-to-add-a-masking-effect-1"><a href="#How-to-add-a-masking-effect-1" class="headerlink" title="How to add a masking effect?"></a>How to add a masking effect?</h5><p>Although there are numerous ways to do that, the one we will use in this video is to remove the thread. For this, follow the below steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply go to the <strong>effect icon</strong> that you can see in the bar above.</li>
<li>In the effects bar, move to the utility tab.</li>
<li>You will see a window showing you the many effects Wondershare Filmora provides you from default.</li>
<li>Select the shape mask tile.</li>
<li>Now drag and drop it on the timeline below.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="note"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You must ensure the effect is applied to the main video, not the reference video.</p>
<ul>
<li>When you drag the effect into the main video, you will notice a transparent shape added to the video. This is your <strong>Mask</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="Step5Edit-the-masking-effect-1"><a href="#Step5Edit-the-masking-effect-1" class="headerlink" title="Step5Edit the masking effect"></a>Step5Edit the masking effect</h5><p>You must hide the thread attached to the ball with the masking effect. To do this, follow the below guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Double-click on the effect added to the main video.</li>
<li>You will notice another window pop up on the import library.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="note"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In the pop-up window, you will see the multiple options and edits you can apply to the masking effect, such as Transform, Compositing, Motion tracking, and stabilization.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="wondershare filmora effect editing panel"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Scroll down on the window and notice a video <strong>effect tab</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the effect tab, you will have multiple options, such as the shape mask, X, Y, and scale and blur strength options, as shown below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Now adjust the mask to hide the string. It may be easy to invert the mask.</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                      alt="note"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> That the borders of the mask are blurred. But you can also change them by inverting the mask, which turns the borders and the space between them.</p>
<p><strong>Remember</strong> the invisibility cloak from Harry Potter? It works just like that, only with a solid shape.</p>
<ul>
<li>Now use the <strong>X</strong> and <strong>Y options</strong> to move the mask anywhere in the video.</li>
</ul>

To blend the borders with the background, follow the steps below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply <strong>Double-click</strong> on the effect in the timeline.</li>
<li>Then, in the editing tab, find out the blur strength option.</li>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Please keep looking in the window on the right. Check and increase the blur strength until you are satisfied with the result.</p>

You can create the pop-up effect in simple and easy steps, as shown below:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, drag the timeline dragger to the point where you want the prop or the ball to pop up.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Your presentation should be accurate and precise!</strong></p>
<p>Imagine you were doing a “<strong>swoosh</strong>“ action, similar to swinging a wand. Now you want your object to appear at that time.</p>
<p><strong>Split the Video:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drag</strong> the timeline dragger to that point.</li>
<li>Now press <strong>Ctrl+B</strong> to split both videos.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Add Popup Effect:</strong></p>
<p>The masking effect will be applied from the start. Our goal is to hide the masking effect before the ball pop-ups. For this, follow the below steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go into the setting by <strong>Double-Clicking</strong> the masking effect on the original video.</li>
<li>Then <strong>move</strong> the mask over the ball instead of on the thread. Doing so would make the ball disappear.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="7-Tips-to-Create-Teaching-Videos"><a href="#7-Tips-to-Create-Teaching-Videos" class="headerlink" title="7 Tips to Create Teaching Videos"></a>7 Tips to Create Teaching Videos</h2><p>For many teachers, online classes begin with a live recording of their lectures or lessons. Sending the recorded lectures to the students allows them to pause the video and rewatch it multiple times.</p>
<p>Recording lectures before class can assist lecturers in filling gaps that may arise due to your absence. You don’t have to worry about missing lessons if you’re going on vacation or to be sick for an extended time.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="create teaching video"
                ></p>
<p>You can keep the class continuing even if you are absent by using pre-recorded lectures and sending the file to the class, so they know the lesson. With the help of an online lecture software or tool available on the internet, you can download it free.</p>
<p>These are the steps in creating an instructional video in your classes:</p>
<h2 id="Know-Your-Target-Audience"><a href="#Know-Your-Target-Audience" class="headerlink" title="Know Your Target Audience"></a>Know Your Target Audience</h2><p>Before you record the video to present in your classes, you need to <strong>know your target audience</strong>. We all know that some teachers handle grade school, and some handle high school level. We need to discover what kind of knowledge or skills your students hope to gain in your class learning the topic you presented. Try to use your book, or maybe add some research and then use that information to help you discuss with your students.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/know-your-target-audience.jpg"
                      alt="know your target audience"
                ></p>
<p>Things you need to remember before you proceed to the next step:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who is your audience? We, educators, already know our audience. It depends on the school and what level we are going to handle. It’s either grade school level or high school level.</li>
<li>What is your topic&#x2F;s? There are a lot of topics and subjects in the field of teaching but try to pick only one topic or subject to present to your class. For example, Computer Subject because I’m a computer teacher. I will be using this subject or topic about computers to create my instructional video for the class.</li>
<li>What is the learning objective or learning outcome of your video? The learning objective of your video is the outcome that captures precisely what knowledge, skills, and attitudes the students should be able to exhibit following the instructions.</li>
<li>How will your video benefit your audience? The students will learn and understand the lesson you are discussing, helping them gain knowledge of that subject to answer all the assignments, quizzes, or maybe an activity you will give them.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Write-a-Script"><a href="#Write-a-Script" class="headerlink" title="Write a Script"></a>Write a Script</h2><p>Once you know your audience and have the topic you need, it’s time to <strong>write a script</strong>. Think about your plan for presenting your video in your classes.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/write-video-script.jpg"
                      alt="write video script"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Here are a few more writing script tips to help you in your classes:</li>
</ul>
<p>Go to the mirror and practice. This tip may help some teachers instead of calling their loved ones and getting feedback about the script they write.</p>
<ul>
<li>Explain what you’re doing and why you’re doing it. You are not only presenting the topic and explaining it but also showing the class what the topic is all about, which will be suitable for your students. Present some examples, pictures, or videos for them to know better what your discussion is all about.</li>
<li>Knowing your script 100% is important. Make sure that you already know your script before you record. If you forget something or make a mistake, go back to the beginning and repeat it correctly. Remember as a teacher that we are not allowed to make mistakes in the eyes of the students. So, double-check everything before you record it and show it to the class.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Record-the-Narration"><a href="#Record-the-Narration" class="headerlink" title="Record the Narration"></a>Record the Narration</h2><p>After writing your script, let’s try to <strong>record the narration</strong>. You don’t need any application software where you can record the narration. Simply using your mobile phone and having a good background is enough.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/record-narration.jpg"
                      alt="record narration"
                ></p>
<p>Using a microphone to record the narration is necessary. Getting those headphones with one connected microphone is good. Some of that has noise cancellation, providing a much better sound quality while recording and ensuring that your videos don’t contain background noise. Then, find a quiet place to record. Explain to your family members that no one will ever talk loud or shout while you are recording the narration.</p>
<p>Once you are ready to hit that record button, speak clearly. Nobody is perfect, so it’s ok if you make a mistake. You don’t need to start over, just pause and start again. You can remove the error or mistake by editing your finished product. Make sure your narration will be the same on the screen while recording your video.</p>
<h2 id="Record-and-Edit-your-Video"><a href="#Record-and-Edit-your-Video" class="headerlink" title="Record and Edit your Video"></a>Record and Edit your Video</h2><p>The first thing you need to do in <strong>recording your video</strong> is to clean up your computer screen and close all the unnecessary applications. You need to turn off also the notifications that will pop up on your computer before you start recording. You can also add your recorded narration to your video.</p>
<p>Here are a few simple tips for <strong>editing your video</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add some interactive elements like motions to highlight key points of your video.</li>
<li>Adding music to your video is optional but may elevate a decent video to the next level. Pick something cheery. You want your audience to feel good while learning.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="The-Video-Duration"><a href="#The-Video-Duration" class="headerlink" title="The Video Duration"></a>The Video Duration</h2><p>I’d say it’s one of the first things students look at before they click the ‘play’ button of the video. It will benefit both teacher and the students if the video is brief and direct to the point. Some students are more likely to want a short video, or maybe let’s focus on the time between 20 - 30 minutes video, where they can watch and learn on any platform, anytime. After that, you can add time by adding other pieces of information and giving activities and assignments.</p>
<h2 id="Be-Yourself"><a href="#Be-Yourself" class="headerlink" title="Be Yourself"></a>Be Yourself</h2><p>Be yourself, and don’t be afraid to make mistakes sometimes. Make sure that your personality shines throughout the video. Try to research how some teachers or maybe some speakers speak naturally and have a conversational manner with an enthusiastic tone.</p>
<p>When you are recording yourself talking, look right at the camera so students can feel eye contact with you, even if it is online. Sometimes we forget the words we need to say to the class, so try to prepare a note next to your webcam. The messages you prepare will help you don’t look away from the camera all the time. Don’t pretend to the class that you’re reading something, just talk naturally as you would in real classrooms.</p>
<h2 id="Sharing-your-Video"><a href="#Sharing-your-Video" class="headerlink" title="Sharing your Video"></a>Sharing your Video</h2><p>Instead of sharing your recorded video with your students, you can also share it directly to online video platforms like YouTube, Facebook, and Vimeo or save the video as a local file to upload on a social media platform. They can go there and watch the video. You can also upload your file to the school learning management system like Google Classroom. Please take note of this; before sending the recorded video to your students, share it with first to a few people to get some video feedback about what you created. This might help you ensure that your message is clear and that your video accomplishes your goals for your students.</p>
<p>There’s a chance that your recorded video doesn’t meet your requirements or you are not satisfied with that for the first time. Don’t worry; try it again, even if you recorded it once or several times. You need to trust yourself by doing it because we are teachers; we are doing our best for the students to learn something from us.</p>

                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/default.png"
                      alt="default title filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3</p>
<p>Now, double-click on the Default Title clip. Here, change its font to any bold font. Increase the text size to 120. Type in your text in the box. Scroll a bit down and change the <strong>Text Spacing</strong> to <strong>8.</strong> Click <strong>OK.</strong></p>

                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/edit-text.png"
                      alt="edit text"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4</p>
<p>Take a Snapshot of this Default Title.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/snapshot.png"
                      alt="take snapshot filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5</p>
<p>Double-click on the Default Title clip once again. This time, click on its <strong>Advanced</strong> settings. Here, turn OFF <strong>Text Fill →</strong> turn ON <strong>Outline →</strong> change the Outline color to <strong>White →</strong> reduce <strong>Thickness</strong> to <strong>1.</strong> Click <strong>OK.</strong> Now, take another Snapshot.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/advanced.png"
                      alt="advanced title settings"
                ></p>
<p>Step 6</p>
<p>Delete the Default Title clip from the Timeline. Now, drag the Outline snapshot that we just created to the Timeline. Open the <strong>Crop</strong> tool <strong>→</strong> change the Ratio to <strong>Custom</strong> <strong>→</strong> replace “<strong>1080</strong>” with “<strong>540</strong>”. Lastly, move the highlighted crop section to the top. Click <strong>OK.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/crop.png"
                      alt="crop filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 7</p>
<p>Double-click on the Snapshot to open its settings panel. Go to the <strong>Animation</strong> tab. Here, change the value of the <strong>Y-axis</strong> to “<strong>275</strong>”**.** Click <strong>OK.</strong> Now, take a Snapshot.</p>

                      alt="y axis value"
                ></p>
<p>Step 8</p>
<p>Next, click on the <strong>Crop</strong> tool again and simply move the highlighted crop section to the bottom part of the screen. Click <strong>OK.</strong> Then, double-click on the snapshot clip in the Timeline and change the value of the <strong>Y-axis</strong> from “275” to “<strong>-275</strong>”**.** Click <strong>OK.</strong> Take a Snapshot again.</p>
<p>Step 9</p>
<p>Import a background image to <strong>My Media.</strong> Drag the background image to the Timeline. Double-click on it and drag the <strong>Scale</strong> bar until the background image covers the whole screen. Click <strong>OK.</strong> You should cut the background clip to make it 3 seconds long as well.</p>

<p>Step 13</p>
<p>Move the Playhead to 1 minute and 5 seconds on the Timeline. Add a keyframe by clicking on the <strong>“+Add”</strong> button. Then, move the Playhead 5 frames forward. Here, change the <strong>Zoom Level</strong> to <strong>25%.</strong></p>

<p>Step 15</p>
<p>Hide the clips on Track 6 and Track 1 by clicking the “eye” icons next to them. Then, take a Snapshot. Now, drag this Snapshot right next to the clip on Track 5.</p>

<p>Step 16</p>
<p>Move the Playhead 3 frames forward from the starting point of the clip you just added. Unhide Track 6. Double-click on the clip on the right side of Track 5 and click on <strong>“+Add”.</strong> Move the Playhead 5 seconds forward and adjust the Upward Outline to fit the text.</p>

<p>Step 17</p>
<p>Move the Playhead 5 frames forward again. Drag the <strong>Y-axis</strong> value to the left until the outline clip overlaps the main text. Then, reduce the <strong>Opacity</strong> to <strong>0%.</strong> Move the Playhead to 2 minutes and 10 seconds. Cut the Track and delete the clip on the right side. Lastly, <strong>Lock</strong> Track 5.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 22</p>
<p>Move the Playhead to 1 minute and 16 seconds. Split the clip and delete the part on the right side. Hide Track 4, 5, and 6. Then, take a Snapshot. Drag this Snapshot next to the clip on Track 3. Place the Playhead on 1 minute and 18 seconds. Then, unhide Track 4, 5, and 6.</p>
<p>Step 23</p>
<p>Double-click on the clip on the right side of Track 3. Add a keyframe by pressing <strong>“+Add”.</strong> Move the Playhead to 1 minute and 23 seconds. Now, resize the clip back to its original size by moving the rectangle left and right. Right now, it should look like this.</p>

<p>Step 25</p>
<p>Move the Playhead 5 frames forward again. Drag the value of the <strong>Y-axis</strong> to the left until the screen looks like this. Then, change the <strong>Opacity</strong> to <strong>0%.</strong> Finally, split the clip at 2 minutes and 10 seconds. Delete the part on the right side. Lock Track 3.</p>

<p>Step 26</p>
<p>Next, drag the Downward Snapshot on Track 2 and follow the same process as in <strong>Steps 19 through 25.</strong></p>
<p>Step 27</p>
<p>Unhide the Background clip at the bottom of the Timeline. Then, Unlock Track 6. Split the clip on Track 6 at the 15th frame.</p>

<p>Step 28</p>
<p>Move the Playhead at the beginning of the Timeline. Click on the first part of the clip on Track 6. Add a keyframe. Drag the <strong>X-axis</strong> value to the right until the word disappears out of the screen.

<p>Step 29</p>
<p>Take the Playhead to 2 minutes and 10 seconds. Split it. Now, move the Playhead to 2 minutes and 19 seconds and add a keyframe. Lastly, take the Playhead to the very end of the clip and drag the text to the right side until it’s out of the screen once again.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
