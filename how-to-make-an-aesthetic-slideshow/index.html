But, how can you make your slideshows look aesthetic? If you include them in your slideshows, there are a few factors that can readily turn them aesthetic.</p>
<p>So, let us look into the different aspects that can help you turn your <strong>slides aesthetic</strong> when you integrate them into it.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Minimalistic Text Designs</strong></p>
<p>Minimalism and aesthetic aura go simultaneously. So, the more your efforts to keep your texts and writings in your slide minimalistic, the more aesthetic your slide would look. Several such finds or text designs are available, and you can readily choose among them and integrate them into your slides.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Use soft and pastel colours for your theme of the template</strong></p>
<p>Every aesthetic object’s most common and signature feature is its subtle, pastel shade. So, stick to using a soft pastel shade for the theme of your template. The colours, such as lavender, sift purple, millennial pink, powder blue or tones of silver, can ideally fit under the collection of aesthetic shades for the youth template of the slideshows.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Minimalistic Pictures</strong></p>
<p>The images you use in your slideshow will play a considerable role in deeming how aesthetic your slides look. So, choose them after enough analysis. See whether the photos have an aesthetic or minimalistic feature. By that, we are referring to the copper tone of the picture, its content and its size. It is best to include small images to reflect the slide’s minimalistic character.</p>

The possibilities are limitless, from the hustle and bustle of a busy city street to the tranquil beauty of a remote beach.</p>
<p>Suppose you’re a new vlogger and want to capture the perfect scene in public. Then this blog is for you. It will explain various tips and tricks to help you create the best videos, regardless of location. So let’s start and learn more about how to film better in public!</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-Gear-Will-You-Need-to-Record-a-Better-Video-in-Public"><a href="#Part-1-What-Gear-Will-You-Need-to-Record-a-Better-Video-in-Public" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Gear Will You Need to Record a Better Video in Public?"></a>Part 1. What Gear Will You Need to Record a Better Video in Public?</h2><p>While recording in public, you want to avoid setting and holding unnecessary camera gear. That’s why you should keep your gear as low-key as possible. The essential shooting gears that you are going to need are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="A-Good-Camera"><a href="#A-Good-Camera" class="headerlink" title="A Good Camera"></a>A Good Camera</h3><p>A good camera is essential to record a video in public because it will provide quality footage. It will also allow you to capture more detail and create more engaging videos. But if you use a phone instead, make sure it is the latest iPhone or other with high pixels camera.</p>

<h3 id="A-Tripod"><a href="#A-Tripod" class="headerlink" title="A Tripod"></a>A Tripod</h3><p>A tripod is essential when recording video in public to ensure that your shots are stable and steady. Without a tripod, your camera can shake and create a distorted, blurry image that can ruin a shot. So having a secure tripod will help you capture professional-looking footage.</p>

<h3 id="A-Microphone"><a href="#A-Microphone" class="headerlink" title="A Microphone"></a>A Microphone</h3><p>A microphone is essential for recording a video in public because it captures the sound in the environment, allowing the video to be recorded with better-quality audio. Without a microphone, the video would be recorded with distorted sound and would likely be challenging to understand.</p>
<p><img

<p>Apart from the gear mentioned above, you can also bring an ND filter, extra batteries, and SD cards. Because If the battery runs out or the SD card becomes full, the video recording could be lost. The spare batteries and SD cards help to ensure that the video can be captured uninterrupted. Let’s see what we need further.</p>

<h3 id="1-Clean-Shots"><a href="#1-Clean-Shots" class="headerlink" title="1. Clean Shots"></a>1. Clean Shots</h3><p>When recording in a busy location, it is essential to try and capture clean shots.

<h3 id="2-Clean-Audio"><a href="#2-Clean-Audio" class="headerlink" title="2. Clean Audio"></a>2. Clean Audio</h3><p>Getting a clean and clear sound when recording audio in a busy location is essential.

<h3 id="3-Decent-Lighting"><a href="#3-Decent-Lighting" class="headerlink" title="3. Decent Lighting"></a>3. Decent Lighting</h3><p>In a busy location, decent lighting is as important as the other two factors. Look for natural light sources that can provide good light, even illumination. If these are unavailable, consider using portable lighting equipment or lamps to create a more flattering environment.</p>
<p>Now that we know what we need let’s see how to make a video.</p>

<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/downloading-premiere-pro.png"
                      alt="downloading premiere pro"
                ></p>
<p>Click the downloaded installer to install the software and launch it. Now, click the <strong>“File”</strong> option from the top toolbar and select <strong>“Import”</strong> to open the <strong>File Explorer</strong> window. Locate your video footage and click <strong>“Open”</strong> to import it to Adobe Premiere.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/importing-file-to-premiere-pro.png"
                      alt="importing file to premiere pro"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 In the next step, click the <strong>“Window”</strong> option from the top toolbar and select <strong>“Effects”</strong> from the drop-down menu to open the <strong>“Effects Panel.”</strong></p>
<p>In the Effects Panel, type <strong>“Blur”</strong> in the search bar and scroll down to find the <strong>“Gaussian Blur”</strong> effect. Drag and drop the effect on the clip in the timeline to apply.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/applying-gaussian-blur-effect-to-blur-video-background-in-premiere-pro.png"
                      alt="applying gaussian blur effect to blur video background in premiere pro"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 Now, click <strong>“Window”</strong> in the top toolbar and select <strong>“Effect Controls”</strong> to open its panel. Scroll down to <strong>“Gaussian Effect”</strong> in the panel and increase the blurriness amount. This will make your entire clip blurry, including the subject&#x2F;main element.If the edges of your clips become dark, checkmark the <strong>“Repeat Edge Pixels”</strong> option to resolve this issue.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="applying the repeat edge pixels to remove dark edges"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 Next, you have to create a mask around the subject to unblur it. To do so, click the <strong>“Free</strong></p>
<p><strong>Draw Bezier”</strong> under the <strong>“Gaussian Blur”</strong> option in the <strong>Effects Control Panel.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/creating-outline-around-the-subject-to-blur-video-background-in-premiere-pro.png"
                      alt="creating outline around the subject to blur video background in premiere pro"
                ></p>
<p>Now, in the <strong>Program Monitor</strong> window, trace the outline of the element&#x2F;subject in your video. Make sure to bring the trace line to the original point.</p>
<p>Step5 Checkmark the <strong>“Inverted”</strong> option under the <strong>Mask Expansion</strong> header in the <strong>Effects Control Panel</strong> to make your background blurry. Click the <strong>“Play”</strong> icon to preview your video and if you find any hard edges around the subject, click <strong>“Mask”</strong> and choose the selection tool.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="inverting the mask to blur background in premiere pro"
                ></p>
<p>Now, make adjustments to the individual points in the outline. Click <strong>“Mask Expansion”</strong> and increase its value to expand the mask size. Then, click <strong>“Mask Feather”</strong> and decrease its value to soften the edges.</p>
<p>Step6 If your subject moves around in some parts, click the toggle next to <strong>“Mask Path”</strong> to create keyframes. Now, move through the timeline and adjust the mask on the subject to make a professional-looking video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/adding-keyframes-to-adjust-the-mask-on-the-subject-in-premiere-pro.png"
                      alt="adding keyframes to adjust the mask on the subject in premiere pro"
                ></p>
