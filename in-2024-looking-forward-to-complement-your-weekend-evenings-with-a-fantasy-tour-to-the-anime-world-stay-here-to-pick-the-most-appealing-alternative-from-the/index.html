<p><strong>1. Create folders in Filmora</strong></p>
<p>If you have footage from multiple cameras, it is best to create some folders first.</p>
<h5 id="Step1-Create-a-Folder-for-Camera-1"><a href="#Step1-Create-a-Folder-for-Camera-1" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Create a Folder for Camera 1"></a>Step1 Create a Folder for Camera 1</h5><p>If you have video footage from three cameras, you can create one folder for each camera.</p>
<p>Go to the default folder on the top left and rename it Cam_A.</p>
<p><img

<p><strong>2. Organize your Timeline and Video Tracks</strong></p>
<h5 id="Step1-Create-Tracks-for-Picture-Editing"><a href="#Step1-Create-Tracks-for-Picture-Editing" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Create Tracks for Picture Editing"></a>Step1 Create Tracks for Picture Editing</h5><p>Keep the first three tracks for picture editing.

In this example, you can put the subtitles here.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p><strong>3. Organize your Audio Tracks</strong></p>
<h5 id="Step1-Create-Tracks-for-Dialects"><a href="#Step1-Create-Tracks-for-Dialects" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Create Tracks for Dialects"></a>Step1 Create Tracks for Dialects</h5><p>The first two tracks are usually for dialects. You can include all the dialects of characters in these tracks. Keep one track for each character. If you have more characters, feel free to assign more tracks to them.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

If you don’t have a voiceover in your video, you can leave it empty.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_12.jpg"

You can add all the clapping sounds, laughing, and all kinds of other foley sound here.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h5 id="Step4-Create-Tracks-for-Ambient-Sound"><a href="#Step4-Create-Tracks-for-Ambient-Sound" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Create Tracks for Ambient Sound"></a>Step4 Create Tracks for Ambient Sound</h5><p>Keep the fifth track for Ambient sound and room tone. You can use it to keep a very subtle environment sound in specific scenes. For example, you can use the room tone recorded on sets.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

But, of course, you could also keep it empty if your project has no background music.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p><strong>4. Color Code Your Clips</strong></p>
<p>Suppose you want to make the timeline even easier to view. In that case, you can select all clips from a camera or a subject and color code them into a specific color. For example, you can color code the footage from camera A in red, camera B in yellow, and Camera C in blue. Now, when you look at the Timeline, you can quickly distinguish footage from different cameras.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_16.jpg"
                      alt="color code your clips"

<h2 id="Part-2-Pro-Tips-about-Improving-Video-Editing-Efficiency"><a href="#Part-2-Pro-Tips-about-Improving-Video-Editing-Efficiency" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Pro Tips about Improving Video Editing Efficiency"></a>Part 2: Pro Tips about Improving Video Editing Efficiency</h2><p><strong>1. Rename Individual Clips</strong></p>
<p>It would be much simpler to organize the timeline if you could quickly rename individual clips. Cut a clip into smaller segments and give each clip a different name. Make sure these clips have a name other than the source video to avoid confusion.</p>
<p><strong>2. Remove Empty Timeline</strong></p>
<p>For quick video editing, timeline organization is essential. Organize your materials and footage at all times to prevent delays. Put everything in the correct folders with the proper labels. To keep your timeline organized, select “Delete Empty Tracks” from the context menu when right-clicking on the track window on the left.</p>
<p><strong>3. Use Keyboard Shortcuts</strong></p>
<p>Knowing keyboard shortcuts allows you to carry out the editing process quickly and precisely.</p>
<p><strong>4. Select Good Music</strong></p>
<p>Don’t only concentrate on the images; the music also affects how well your video comes out. For example, suppose you’re making a drama movie. In that case, you should pick the right music track to evoke particular emotions in your viewers.</p>
<p><strong>5. Add Text and Graphics</strong></p>
<p>Depending on the style of the video, adding text, graphics, or stock video to your project could be helpful. You should provide more text than just the title for some videos.</p>
<h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>You don’t need to be an expert in video editing to produce high-quality videos. In reality, you can complete the task without any expensive, high-end professional training. So how? Well, with the proper video editing tools like Wondershare Filmora, anything is possible. Follow the above guide, organize your timeline and keep the tracks consistent while video editing on Filmora so it’s easier to come back and edit a project or share with other editors.</p>

<p><strong>4. Color Code Your Clips</strong></p>
<p>Suppose you want to make the timeline even easier to view. In that case, you can select all clips from a camera or a subject and color code them into a specific color. For example, you can color code the footage from camera A in red, camera B in yellow, and Camera C in blue. Now, when you look at the Timeline, you can quickly distinguish footage from different cameras.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h2 id="Part-2-Pro-Tips-about-Improving-Video-Editing-Efficiency-1"><a href="#Part-2-Pro-Tips-about-Improving-Video-Editing-Efficiency-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Pro Tips about Improving Video Editing Efficiency"></a>Part 2: Pro Tips about Improving Video Editing Efficiency</h2><p><strong>1. Rename Individual Clips</strong></p>
<p>It would be much simpler to organize the timeline if you could quickly rename individual clips. Cut a clip into smaller segments and give each clip a different name. Make sure these clips have a name other than the source video to avoid confusion.</p>
<p><strong>2. Remove Empty Timeline</strong></p>
<p>For quick video editing, timeline organization is essential. Organize your materials and footage at all times to prevent delays. Put everything in the correct folders with the proper labels. To keep your timeline organized, select “Delete Empty Tracks” from the context menu when right-clicking on the track window on the left.</p>
<p><strong>3. Use Keyboard Shortcuts</strong></p>
<p>Knowing keyboard shortcuts allows you to carry out the editing process quickly and precisely.</p>
<p><strong>4. Select Good Music</strong></p>
<p>Don’t only concentrate on the images; the music also affects how well your video comes out. For example, suppose you’re making a drama movie. In that case, you should pick the right music track to evoke particular emotions in your viewers.</p>
<p><strong>5. Add Text and Graphics</strong></p>
<p>Depending on the style of the video, adding text, graphics, or stock video to your project could be helpful. You should provide more text than just the title for some videos.</p>
<h2 id="Summary-1"><a href="#Summary-1" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>You don’t need to be an expert in video editing to produce high-quality videos. In reality, you can complete the task without any expensive, high-end professional training. So how? Well, with the proper video editing tools like Wondershare Filmora, anything is possible. Follow the above guide, organize your timeline and keep the tracks consistent while video editing on Filmora so it’s easier to come back and edit a project or share with other editors.</p>

<p><strong>Pick a template</strong></p>
<p>After installing the slideshow maker, explore it. See the features available, template and media library and themes you can use. After going through the templates and themes, pick a template with them you want to make your slideshow on and go to the next step.</p>
<p><strong>Upload your files</strong></p>
<p>Upload your photos and arrange them in the order you want. In most of the slideshow makers, you will get the option of sliding pictures and rearranging them. You can also insert text on pictures after this step.</p>
<p><strong>Apply effects, filters and transitions</strong></p>
<p>Your basic slideshow is ready. Now apply effects, filters and transitions to make your slideshow beautiful. The theme itself comes with the effects sometimes; for example; if you choose holiday theme, romance or party, the theme will come with effects and filters accordingly. But you can customize it as per your choice and apply filters and effects according to your preference. Then check transition library and apply the one that attract you. You can also use different transitions for different set of pictures.</p>

                ></p>
<p>More or less, the process of making slideshow is same in all slideshow makers. Basic steps are as follows –</p>
<p><strong>Install the application</strong></p>
<p>First of all, you need to install the <strong>slideshow maker no watermark</strong> that you want. Pick a slideshow maker of your choice as per the features you need to work with. After choosing the slideshow maker, install it from internet and allow your device to run the application.</p>
<p><strong>Pick a template</strong></p>
<p>After installing the slideshow maker, explore it. See the features available, template and media library and themes you can use. After going through the templates and themes, pick a template with them you want to make your slideshow on and go to the next step.</p>
<p><strong>Upload your files</strong></p>
<p>Upload your photos and arrange them in the order you want. In most of the slideshow makers, you will get the option of sliding pictures and rearranging them. You can also insert text on pictures after this step.</p>
<p><strong>Apply effects, filters and transitions</strong></p>
<p>Your basic slideshow is ready. Now apply effects, filters and transitions to make your slideshow beautiful. The theme itself comes with the effects sometimes; for example; if you choose holiday theme, romance or party, the theme will come with effects and filters accordingly. But you can customize it as per your choice and apply filters and effects according to your preference. Then check transition library and apply the one that attract you. You can also use different transitions for different set of pictures.</p>

<p><strong>Remove watermark</strong></p>
<p>The most important step is removing the watermark of the product. The procedure of removing watermark can vary product to product. For instance, some comes without watermark while some offers watching free promotional video of a few second to remove watermark. In some products watermark can be removed by cracking the product while in others, watermark can be removed with the help of online watermark remover. The procedure of removing watermark depends totally upon the slideshow maker you choose.</p>

<p>After removing the watermark, you need nothing but to export the video and saving it into your device.</p>
<p><strong>Share with friends</strong></p>
<p>Your slideshow is completely ready to be shared with your friends.</p>
