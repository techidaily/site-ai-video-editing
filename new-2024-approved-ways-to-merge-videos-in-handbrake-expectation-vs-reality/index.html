<p>For macOS 10.14 or later</p>
<p>Now, without any more delay, let’s start learning how to combine videos in Filmora through the following steps.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Install Filmora on Your Computer</strong></p>
<p>Just visit <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora’s website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to download the latest version of the software for your Windows or MAC.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-2.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>
<p>After downloading the software on your computer, install it. Once the software is ready, double-click the “Wondershare Filmora” icon (it should be on your desktop screen) to open the program.</p>
<p>As you can see, the interface is simple with user-friendly options.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-3.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Import Multiple Videos in Filmora</strong></p>
<p>Click on the blue icon with a “+” sign to import videos.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-4.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>
<p>Or, click on the “File” button on the top menu to import files and drag and drop both clips to the same timeline.</p>
<p>As you can see, there are two clips on the timeline. The first clip is called “Cherry Blossom,” and the second clip’s name is “Plating Food.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-5.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Keep Video Clips on the Same Timeline</strong></p>
<p>There shouldn’t be any gap or spaces between the two clips.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-6.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>
<p>It is because gaps will create a dark blank space between the clips when you export the clips, like this:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-7.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>
<p>Therefore, slide the second video right next to the first video without leaving any gaps with your mouse.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-8.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>
<p>And guess what? You have already merged the two clips.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Save Video on Your PC</strong></p>
<p>Now, hit the “Export” button and save the merged video on your computer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-9.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>

<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-6.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>
<p>It is because gaps will create a dark blank space between the clips when you export the clips, like this:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-7.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>
<p>Therefore, slide the second video right next to the first video without leaving any gaps with your mouse.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-8.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>
<p>And guess what? You have already merged the two clips.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Save Video on Your PC</strong></p>
<p>Now, hit the “Export” button and save the merged video on your computer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>

<p>Text-to-speech (TTS) is a type of assistive technology that reads digital text aloud. It’s sometimes called “read aloud” technology. This technology has evolved to the point of being inculcated or introduced directly to some video editing applications without having to visit a separate text-to-speech application or software for support. This article therefore aims at discussing ten video makers that have inbuilt the text-to-speech feature.</p>

<p>FEATURES</p>
<p>After reviewing both versions (Android and iOS) of CapCut, we found that the app is indeed easy to use and includes a ton of attractive features designed for TikTok users. Would we recommend it to you? Yes, definitely, but with some caveats.</p>
<ul>
<li>Split function: This is similar to trimming where you have to separate the clip in order to define your desired part of the clip. Your clip can be further extended after splitting, so it’s just a process of simple trimming in editing.</li>
<li>Video overlay: This feature helps you place a video on another video. Those who do this often are those who have reaction channels, online teachers and gamers. This feature helps the viewers to simultaneously comprehend explanations the main video content alongside the reaction or explanation.</li>
<li>Speed control: This feature aids speed ramping. You can slow down your video and increase the speed just as you want. One thing to have in mind is when you plan to edit such a video, you have to shoot in a high resolution and high frame rate like 30-60fps so as to avoid the amateurish look.</li>
<li>Reverse video: The reverse feature helps you to rewind your clip to create the effect you have pictured in your mind while shooting.</li>
<li>Music library: CapCut comes with an impressive collection of royalty-free music and sound effects that can really make a huge difference to your videos. The tracks have a high quality and you can effortlessly insert them into your video to create the feel you desire.</li>
<li>Filters: Choose from various filters to soften or sharpen your videos and make them more professional-looking. There are color-based and season-based filters, as well as a range of beautification tools to enhance video quality. Filters can also be used effectively if you have multiple clips that have color variations or different contrast and brightness levels. Since you can’t edit most of these in CapCut, you can avoid having to use a desktop editor by choosing the right filters and applying them to all your clips to bring some uniformity.</li>
<li>Effects: There’s a collection of effects you can select from to appeal to the visual cravings of your audience. This will add colour to your content as it makes your viewers involved in the video. These effects include split-screen, retro, comic, party, dreamy, and so on. These effects will make your video look fresh and professionally edited.</li>
<li>Stickers and text: Stickers could be fun to use due to their expressive nature. Your choice as a content creator will go a long way in determining the fascination of your content. CapCut has therefore had you covered when it comes to adding fun features to your content to make it more interactive and exciting. Stickers and texts are therefore engaging tools you can employ to drive the fantasy of your audience.

<p>FEATURES</p>
<p>After reviewing both versions (Android and iOS) of CapCut, we found that the app is indeed easy to use and includes a ton of attractive features designed for TikTok users. Would we recommend it to you? Yes, definitely, but with some caveats.</p>
<ul>
<li>Split function: This is similar to trimming where you have to separate the clip in order to define your desired part of the clip. Your clip can be further extended after splitting, so it’s just a process of simple trimming in editing.</li>
<li>Video overlay: This feature helps you place a video on another video. Those who do this often are those who have reaction channels, online teachers and gamers. This feature helps the viewers to simultaneously comprehend explanations the main video content alongside the reaction or explanation.</li>
<li>Speed control: This feature aids speed ramping. You can slow down your video and increase the speed just as you want. One thing to have in mind is when you plan to edit such a video, you have to shoot in a high resolution and high frame rate like 30-60fps so as to avoid the amateurish look.</li>
<li>Reverse video: The reverse feature helps you to rewind your clip to create the effect you have pictured in your mind while shooting.</li>
<li>Music library: CapCut comes with an impressive collection of royalty-free music and sound effects that can really make a huge difference to your videos. The tracks have a high quality and you can effortlessly insert them into your video to create the feel you desire.</li>
<li>Filters: Choose from various filters to soften or sharpen your videos and make them more professional-looking. There are color-based and season-based filters, as well as a range of beautification tools to enhance video quality. Filters can also be used effectively if you have multiple clips that have color variations or different contrast and brightness levels. Since you can’t edit most of these in CapCut, you can avoid having to use a desktop editor by choosing the right filters and applying them to all your clips to bring some uniformity.</li>
<li>Effects: There’s a collection of effects you can select from to appeal to the visual cravings of your audience. This will add colour to your content as it makes your viewers involved in the video. These effects include split-screen, retro, comic, party, dreamy, and so on. These effects will make your video look fresh and professionally edited.</li>
<li>Stickers and text: Stickers could be fun to use due to their expressive nature. Your choice as a content creator will go a long way in determining the fascination of your content. CapCut has therefore had you covered when it comes to adding fun features to your content to make it more interactive and exciting. Stickers and texts are therefore engaging tools you can employ to drive the fantasy of your audience. Also, it creates room for more details to be added without necessarily having to introduce more audio contents especially. With this feature, you can literally do more with less using CapCut.</li>

<h2 id="Capture-the-moment-and-Cut-2"><a href="#Capture-the-moment-and-Cut-2" class="headerlink" title="Capture the moment and Cut"></a>Capture the moment and Cut</h2><p>CapCut is a free all-in-one video editing app that helps you create amazing videos. It is a mobile app for iOS and Android devices which is easy to use in terms of creating your content. It makes your cutting, reversing and speed change easier than ever when you get it right to produce incredible results as you share on social media. You can make your video captivating by adding features such as filters, stickers, speed changes, background music, effects, split, reverse and more to make your wonderful moments more polished and professional.</p>
<p>FEATURES</p>
<p>After reviewing both versions (Android and iOS) of CapCut, we found that the app is indeed easy to use and includes a ton of attractive features designed for TikTok users. Would we recommend it to you? Yes, definitely, but with some caveats.</p>
<ul>
<li>Split function: This is similar to trimming where you have to separate the clip in order to define your desired part of the clip. Your clip can be further extended after splitting, so it’s just a process of simple trimming in editing.</li>
<li>Video overlay: This feature helps you place a video on another video. Those who do this often are those who have reaction channels, online teachers and gamers. This feature helps the viewers to simultaneously comprehend explanations the main video content alongside the reaction or explanation.</li>
<li>Speed control: This feature aids speed ramping. You can slow down your video and increase the speed just as you want. One thing to have in mind is when you plan to edit such a video, you have to shoot in a high resolution and high frame rate like 30-60fps so as to avoid the amateurish look.</li>
<li>Reverse video: The reverse feature helps you to rewind your clip to create the effect you have pictured in your mind while shooting.</li>
<li>Music library: CapCut comes with an impressive collection of royalty-free music and sound effects that can really make a huge difference to your videos. The tracks have a high quality and you can effortlessly insert them into your video to create the feel you desire.</li>
<li>Filters: Choose from various filters to soften or sharpen your videos and make them more professional-looking. There are color-based and season-based filters, as well as a range of beautification tools to enhance video quality. Filters can also be used effectively if you have multiple clips that have color variations or different contrast and brightness levels. Since you can’t edit most of these in CapCut, you can avoid having to use a desktop editor by choosing the right filters and applying them to all your clips to bring some uniformity.</li>
<li>Effects: There’s a collection of effects you can select from to appeal to the visual cravings of your audience. This will add colour to your content as it makes your viewers involved in the video. These effects include split-screen, retro, comic, party, dreamy, and so on. These effects will make your video look fresh and professionally edited.</li>
<li>Stickers and text: Stickers could be fun to use due to their expressive nature. Your choice as a content creator will go a long way in determining the fascination of your content. CapCut has therefore had you covered when it comes to adding fun features to your content to make it more interactive and exciting. Stickers and texts are therefore engaging tools you can employ to drive the fantasy of your audience. Also, it creates room for more details to be added without necessarily having to introduce more audio contents especially. With this feature, you can literally do more with less using CapCut.</li>

<p>Text-to-speech (TTS) is a type of assistive technology that reads digital text aloud. It’s sometimes called “read aloud” technology. This technology has evolved to the point of being inculcated or introduced directly to some video editing applications without having to visit a separate text-to-speech application or software for support. This article therefore aims at discussing ten video makers that have inbuilt the text-to-speech feature.</p>

It is a mobile app for iOS and Android devices which is easy to use in terms of creating your content. It makes your cutting, reversing and speed change easier than ever when you get it right to produce incredible results as you share on social media. You can make your video captivating by adding features such as filters, stickers, speed changes, background music, effects, split, reverse and more to make your wonderful moments more polished and professional.</p>
<p>FEATURES</p>
<p>After reviewing both versions (Android and iOS) of CapCut, we found that the app is indeed easy to use and includes a ton of attractive features designed for TikTok users. Would we recommend it to you? Yes, definitely, but with some caveats.</p>
<ul>
<li>Split function: This is similar to trimming where you have to separate the clip in order to define your desired part of the clip. Your clip can be further extended after splitting, so it’s just a process of simple trimming in editing.</li>
<li>Video overlay: This feature helps you place a video on another video. Those who do this often are those who have reaction channels, online teachers and gamers. This feature helps the viewers to simultaneously comprehend explanations the main video content alongside the reaction or explanation.</li>
<li>Speed control: This feature aids speed ramping. You can slow down your video and increase the speed just as you want. One thing to have in mind is when you plan to edit such a video, you have to shoot in a high resolution and high frame rate like 30-60fps so as to avoid the amateurish look.</li>
<li>Reverse video: The reverse feature helps you to rewind your clip to create the effect you have pictured in your mind while shooting.</li>
<li>Music library: CapCut comes with an impressive collection of royalty-free music and sound effects that can really make a huge difference to your videos. The tracks have a high quality and you can effortlessly insert them into your video to create the feel you desire.</li>
<li>Filters: Choose from various filters to soften or sharpen your videos and make them more professional-looking. There are color-based and season-based filters, as well as a range of beautification tools to enhance video quality. Filters can also be used effectively if you have multiple clips that have color variations or different contrast and brightness levels. Since you can’t edit most of these in CapCut, you can avoid having to use a desktop editor by choosing the right filters and applying them to all your clips to bring some uniformity.</li>
<li>Effects: There’s a collection of effects you can select from to appeal to the visual cravings of your audience. This will add colour to your content as it makes your viewers involved in the video. These effects include split-screen, retro, comic, party, dreamy, and so on. These effects will make your video look fresh and professionally edited.</li>
<li>Stickers and text: Stickers could be fun to use due to their expressive nature. Your choice as a content creator will go a long way in determining the fascination of your content. CapCut has therefore had you covered when it comes to adding fun features to your content to make it more interactive and exciting. Stickers and texts are therefore engaging tools you can employ to drive the fantasy of your audience. Also, it creates room for more details to be added without necessarily having to introduce more audio contents especially. With this feature, you can literally do more with less using CapCut.</li>

<p>The following list points out the importance of learning colours for children.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Integrates basic knowledge</strong></p>
<p>Knowing about the different colours is the basic and the most initial information that every child must have. We need colours in every instance of our lives. Therefore, it is vital for the children to learn about them from the initial stages of their lives.</p>
<p>So, learning about the colours integrates the basic knowledge of colours in their minds which is to stay with them throughout their lives and utilize them as and when the necessity arises.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Offers them a means for verbal communication</strong></p>
<p>When a child learns about colours, they attain a way to describe the world around them. Therefore, it helps in enhancing their method of communication. As a result, it also nurtures and improves their verbal skills to a large extent.</p>
<p>When they know about the colours, it inaugurates a novel hallway of set communicating and knowing about the world around them.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Offers a way of describing the world</strong></p>
<p>For the children, this world is an absolutely new place. They have been introduced to this planet quite recently and are exploring and discovering the different aspects. And one of the major aspects of the world is its colour.</p>
<p>So, when they learn about colours, they tend to find a way to describe the environment. It gives them a better understanding of the world and their surrounding as they learn about the colours.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Learning to classify and sort</strong></p>
<p>When a child learns about colours, they tend to learn about sorting things and classifying the different objects based on colours. For example, they might be able to separate blue balloons from the red ones from a bunch of balloons in front of them.</p>
<p>Though it is based on colours, they learn the process of classification and sorting, which then gets applied to the other factors in life.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Learning about safety and health through colours</strong></p>
<p>The colour red is commonly associated with danger, and the colour danger is associated with safety. And this is generalized across almost all cultures. That is commonly reflected through the traffic lights, where we stop at red colour, get ready to move in the colour tallow and the green colour gives us the signal to move or the message of being out of danger.</p>
<p>Also, the colour blue indicates paleness or bruises in the skin. The colour red indicates rashes or blood. So, the knowledge of colour helps the children learn about safety and health.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Learn about association</strong></p>
<p>The above point of learning about health and safety with the help of colours includes learning another important aspect in life, which is association. If a child is unable to understand that the colour red is associated with danger, green is associated with safety and the like; then the knowledge will be of no use.</p>
<p>So, when the child learns about colours and connects them to the different safety and health measures, they automatically learn how to associate one thing with another. This process is crucial and will benefit them throughout their lives.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Learn about letters</strong></p>
<p>Eventually, as the child learns about colours, they would spell them as well. So, as a result, they will learn how to spell different colours. That will be a way to practice spelling, and this will result in them learning about letters and words a lot more efficiently and excitingly.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Offers them a means for verbal communication</strong></p>
<p>When a child learns about colours, they attain a way to describe the world around them. Therefore, it helps in enhancing their method of communication. As a result, it also nurtures and improves their verbal skills to a large extent.</p>
<p>When they know about the colours, it inaugurates a novel hallway of set communicating and knowing about the world around them.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Offers a way of describing the world</strong></p>
<p>For the children, this world is an absolutely new place. They have been introduced to this planet quite recently and are exploring and discovering the different aspects. And one of the major aspects of the world is its colour.</p>
<p>So, when they learn about colours, they tend to find a way to describe the environment. It gives them a better understanding of the world and their surrounding as they learn about the colours.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Learning to classify and sort</strong></p>
<p>When a child learns about colours, they tend to learn about sorting things and classifying the different objects based on colours. For example, they might be able to separate blue balloons from the red ones from a bunch of balloons in front of them.</p>
<p>Though it is based on colours, they learn the process of classification and sorting, which then gets applied to the other factors in life.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Learning about safety and health through colours</strong></p>
<p>The colour red is commonly associated with danger, and the colour danger is associated with safety. And this is generalized across almost all cultures. That is commonly reflected through the traffic lights, where we stop at red colour, get ready to move in the colour tallow and the green colour gives us the signal to move or the message of being out of danger.</p>
<p>Also, the colour blue indicates paleness or bruises in the skin. The colour red indicates rashes or blood. So, the knowledge of colour helps the children learn about safety and health.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Learn about association</strong></p>
<p>The above point of learning about health and safety with the help of colours includes learning another important aspect in life, which is association. If a child is unable to understand that the colour red is associated with danger, green is associated with safety and the like; then the knowledge will be of no use.</p>
<p>So, when the child learns about colours and connects them to the different safety and health measures, they automatically learn how to associate one thing with another. This process is crucial and will benefit them throughout their lives.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Learn about letters</strong></p>
<p>Eventually, as the child learns about colours, they would spell them as well. So, as a result, they will learn how to spell different colours. That will be a way to practice spelling, and this will result in them learning about letters and words a lot more efficiently and excitingly.</p>
