Mastering Scopes in DaVinci Resolve: A Brief Guide"></a><strong>Part 2. Mastering Scopes in DaVinci Resolve: A Brief Guide</strong></h2><p>DaVinci scopes help you to analyze images as a basis for color correction. When used properly, scopes help in fixing white balance issues and checking saturation. They also allow you to get the correct exposure and check details like skin tone. To use scopes in DaVinci Resolve, go to the color page in the bottom right corner. You can also click on the small graph icon to view the scope. Here is how to use them:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#davinci1">Waveform</a></li>
<li><a href="#davinci2">Parade (RGB)</a></li>
<li><a href="#davinci3">Vectorscope</a></li>
<li><a href="#davinci4">Histogram</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-Waveform"><a href="#1-Waveform" class="headerlink" title="1. Waveform"></a><strong>1. Waveform</strong></h3><p>The Waveform represents the brightness or luminance of your image. In this video scope, the brightest parts are at the top while the darkest are at the bottom. The pixels are represented from left to right.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/mastering-davinci-resolve-scopes-a-comprehensive-guide-8.JPG"
                      alt="waveform"
                ></p>
<p>The Waveform scope on DaVinci Resolve is helpful when you are checking for clipping. This simply means finding out whether the image is too bright or too dark. The waveform also ensures that the image is properly exposed. The colorize feature of the waveform shows the colors of the image while the extent shows the darkest or lightest parts of the image.</p>
<h3 id="2-Parade-RGB"><a href="#2-Parade-RGB" class="headerlink" title="2. Parade (RGB)"></a><strong>2. Parade (RGB)</strong></h3><p>The RGB Parade comprises 3 waveforms that represent the luminance of red, green, and blue channels. The approach for reading the parade video scope is similar to that of the waveform. However, you now look at the balance between the colors correct the white balance, and check for a color cast.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/mastering-davinci-resolve-scopes-a-comprehensive-guide-9.JPG"
                      alt="parade"
                ></p>
<p>The Parade works almost in a similar manner as the waveform. It displays the red, green, and blue channels of the image as separate waveforms. This way, you can easily identify and correct color casts while ensuring the colors in the image are balanced. The video scope provides useful information to decide which parts of the image need to be corrected or tweaked further.</p>
<h3 id="3-Vectorscope"><a href="#3-Vectorscope" class="headerlink" title="3. Vectorscope"></a><strong>3. Vectorscope</strong></h3><p>Vectorscope in DaVinci Resolve shows hue and saturation on a circular graph. Hues (the colors) are indicated outside of the color wheel for easier color correction. Saturation is indicated by how far the graph extends from the center.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/mastering-davinci-resolve-scopes-a-comprehensive-guide-10.JPG"
                      alt="vectorscope"
                ></p>
<p>By displaying the hue and saturation of the image as a vector, this video scope helps check skin tones. The scope specifically checks whether skin tones are shifted toward colors such as yellow, magenta, or green. It allows you to make sure that the colors in your subject skin tones are not too saturated or desaturated.</p>
<h3 id="4-Histogram"><a href="#4-Histogram" class="headerlink" title="4. Histogram"></a><strong>4. Histogram</strong></h3><p>Histogram is a video scope in DaVinci Resolve that displays the brightness or luminance of an image from left to right for the RGB channel. The video scope is based on the number of pixels that the colors red, blue, and green have in an image.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/mastering-davinci-resolve-scopes-a-comprehensive-guide-11.JPG"
                      alt="histogram"
                ></p>
<p>Using the histogram video scope on DaVinci Resolve allows you to check for overexposure or underexposure in your image. You can also ensure that the image has a good overall brightness range. The scope provides a graphical representation of tonal distribution in each channel. This way, you can evaluate the tone in detail for more accurate brightness and contrast adjustments.</p>

Mastering Scopes in DaVinci Resolve: A Brief Guide"></a><strong>Part 2. Mastering Scopes in DaVinci Resolve: A Brief Guide</strong></h2><p>DaVinci scopes help you to analyze images as a basis for color correction. When used properly, scopes help in fixing white balance issues and checking saturation. They also allow you to get the correct exposure and check details like skin tone. To use scopes in DaVinci Resolve, go to the color page in the bottom right corner. You can also click on the small graph icon to view the scope. Here is how to use them:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#davinci1">Waveform</a></li>
<li><a href="#davinci2">Parade (RGB)</a></li>
<li><a href="#davinci3">Vectorscope</a></li>
<li><a href="#davinci4">Histogram</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-Waveform-1"><a href="#1-Waveform-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Waveform"></a><strong>1. Waveform</strong></h3><p>The Waveform represents the brightness or luminance of your image. In this video scope, the brightest parts are at the top while the darkest are at the bottom. The pixels are represented from left to right.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/mastering-davinci-resolve-scopes-a-comprehensive-guide-8.JPG"
                      alt="waveform"
                ></p>
<p>The Waveform scope on DaVinci Resolve is helpful when you are checking for clipping. This simply means finding out whether the image is too bright or too dark. The waveform also ensures that the image is properly exposed. The colorize feature of the waveform shows the colors of the image while the extent shows the darkest or lightest parts of the image.</p>
<h3 id="2-Parade-RGB-1"><a href="#2-Parade-RGB-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Parade (RGB)"></a><strong>2. Parade (RGB)</strong></h3><p>The RGB Parade comprises 3 waveforms that represent the luminance of red, green, and blue channels. The approach for reading the parade video scope is similar to that of the waveform. However, you now look at the balance between the colors correct the white balance, and check for a color cast.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/mastering-davinci-resolve-scopes-a-comprehensive-guide-9.JPG"
                      alt="parade"
                ></p>
<p>The Parade works almost in a similar manner as the waveform. It displays the red, green, and blue channels of the image as separate waveforms. This way, you can easily identify and correct color casts while ensuring the colors in the image are balanced. The video scope provides useful information to decide which parts of the image need to be corrected or tweaked further.</p>
<h3 id="3-Vectorscope-1"><a href="#3-Vectorscope-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Vectorscope"></a><strong>3. Vectorscope</strong></h3><p>Vectorscope in DaVinci Resolve shows hue and saturation on a circular graph. Hues (the colors) are indicated outside of the color wheel for easier color correction. Saturation is indicated by how far the graph extends from the center.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/mastering-davinci-resolve-scopes-a-comprehensive-guide-10.JPG"
                      alt="vectorscope"
                ></p>
<p>By displaying the hue and saturation of the image as a vector, this video scope helps check skin tones. The scope specifically checks whether skin tones are shifted toward colors such as yellow, magenta, or green. It allows you to make sure that the colors in your subject skin tones are not too saturated or desaturated.</p>
<h3 id="4-Histogram-1"><a href="#4-Histogram-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Histogram"></a><strong>4. Histogram</strong></h3><p>Histogram is a video scope in DaVinci Resolve that displays the brightness or luminance of an image from left to right for the RGB channel. The video scope is based on the number of pixels that the colors red, blue, and green have in an image.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/mastering-davinci-resolve-scopes-a-comprehensive-guide-11.JPG"
                      alt="histogram"
                ></p>
<p>Using the histogram video scope on DaVinci Resolve allows you to check for overexposure or underexposure in your image. You can also ensure that the image has a good overall brightness range. The scope provides a graphical representation of tonal distribution in each channel. This way, you can evaluate the tone in detail for more accurate brightness and contrast adjustments.</p>

<h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>Scopes are indeed valuable to video editors and colorists. While viewing images on a monitor can be subjective, scopes allow you to analyze and define them objectively. This gives you the power to color grade and correct to ensure that viewers look at the image with a clear representation. When working on or editing your videos, we recommend Wondershare Filmora. The video editing software comes with a wide range of features and video scopes that allow you to do everything on the same platform.</p>
