<h3 id="1-Finding-the-Niche-and-Audience-of-Choice"><a href="#1-Finding-the-Niche-and-Audience-of-Choice" class="headerlink" title="1. Finding the Niche and Audience of Choice"></a>1. Finding the Niche and Audience of Choice</h3><p>Looking into the variety of niches that can be tried for vlog videos, the selection can never be easy. You need to be sure which genre you are looking forward to picking, which then develops a target audience that you would be addressing. Your content heavily depends on the type of target audience you pick for yourselves. Be very appropriate and original while you add yourselves in the vlog video.</p>
<p>Finding the appropriate niche and working across it while understanding the answer to what is a vlog is quite essential. This guides the complete future of your channel across this section.</p>
<h3 id="2-Look-And-Inspire-From-Competition"><a href="#2-Look-And-Inspire-From-Competition" class="headerlink" title="2. Look And Inspire From Competition"></a>2. Look And Inspire From Competition</h3><p>The second most important thing to be done before starting vlogs on your channel is an overview of the competitive market. Understanding the current video creator market dynamics is the next direction that you need to consider for starting vlogging. Competition lets you understand the loopholes that exist in the current system. This is a highly effective way of discovering innovation within any market.</p>
<p>Get inspired from the competition that exists within the current vlogging market. Find what they do best and consider the strong points within yourself.</p>
<h3 id="3-Creating-a-Brand"><a href="#3-Creating-a-Brand" class="headerlink" title="3. Creating a Brand"></a>3. Creating a Brand</h3><p>The next step to starting your personal vlogs is setting up a brand that would become a highlight of yours across the platforms. People need something unifying to follow a certain party or personality; the same is true with vlogging. As many vloggers describe their community as a family, they set up a complete brand across this narrative and present a great idea of inclusivity.</p>
<p>While you prepare for your vlog video, you need to specify the name logo and create art that would set up the complete vlog channel. These should be extremely attractive and alluring for the community to watch and learn.</p>
<h3 id="4-Familiarize-and-Invest"><a href="#4-Familiarize-and-Invest" class="headerlink" title="4. Familiarize and Invest"></a>4. Familiarize and Invest</h3><p>You should be sure about what you need to do across the platform.

This feature helps create slow-motion videos by slowing down the recorded action when played at normal speed. These <strong>slow-motion</strong> <strong>cameras</strong> are popular in filmmaking, sports analysis, science, and content creation. That’s because they capture detailed moments and highlight fast-moving things.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Higher Frame Rate:</strong> Regular videos usually record 24, 30, or 60 frames per second (fps). But <strong>slow-motion cameras</strong> can capture hundreds or thousands of frames per second. More frames mean more details and smoother slow-motion videos when played back.</li>
<li><strong>Smooth Playback:</strong> Slow-motion videos look smooth and purposeful when played at regular speeds. More frames are recorded initially to achieve this effect. Ultimately, it will preserve all details when the video is played in slow motion.</li>
<li><strong>High-Resolution Sensors:</strong> Lots of <strong>slow-motion cameras</strong> have high-quality sensors. These sensors ensure that even with more frames captured, the picture stays sharp and detailed in slow-motion videos. This helps capture fine details without losing clarity.</li>
<li><strong>Creative Control:</strong> <strong>Slow-motion cameras</strong> let filmmakers and videographers control how fast or slow some parts of a scene look. This helps tell stories better, focus on details, and make videos more interesting and attractive to watch.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced Motion Blur:</strong> More frames per second make pictures clearer and sharper. This feature works especially for fast-moving things. This is important when you need to see tiny details or when the lighting isn’t great.</li>
<li><strong>Temporal Resolution: Slow-motion cameras</strong> can record lots of details in quick movements. They’re handy in sports, science, and creative videos where catching fast and detailed actions matter a lot.</li>

This feature helps create slow-motion videos by slowing down the recorded action when played at normal speed. These <strong>slow-motion</strong> <strong>cameras</strong> are popular in filmmaking, sports analysis, science, and content creation. That’s because they capture detailed moments and highlight fast-moving things.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Higher Frame Rate:</strong> Regular videos usually record 24, 30, or 60 frames per second (fps). But <strong>slow-motion cameras</strong> can capture hundreds or thousands of frames per second. More frames mean more details and smoother slow-motion videos when played back.</li>
<li><strong>Smooth Playback:</strong> Slow-motion videos look smooth and purposeful when played at regular speeds. More frames are recorded initially to achieve this effect. Ultimately, it will preserve all details when the video is played in slow motion.</li>
<li><strong>High-Resolution Sensors:</strong> Lots of <strong>slow-motion cameras</strong> have high-quality sensors. These sensors ensure that even with more frames captured, the picture stays sharp and detailed in slow-motion videos. This helps capture fine details without losing clarity.</li>
<li><strong>Creative Control:</strong> <strong>Slow-motion cameras</strong> let filmmakers and videographers control how fast or slow some parts of a scene look. This helps tell stories better, focus on details, and make videos more interesting and attractive to watch.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced Motion Blur:</strong> More frames per second make pictures clearer and sharper. This feature works especially for fast-moving things. This is important when you need to see tiny details or when the lighting isn’t great.</li>
<li><strong>Temporal Resolution: Slow-motion cameras</strong> can record lots of details in quick movements. They’re handy in sports, science, and creative videos where catching fast and detailed actions matter a lot.</li>

<h2 id="Easy-Ways-to-Edit-Recorded-Video"><a href="#Easy-Ways-to-Edit-Recorded-Video" class="headerlink" title="Easy Ways to Edit Recorded Video"></a>Easy Ways to Edit Recorded Video</h2><p>The most critical component of post-production for a video marketer is editing. Your video will seem unfinished and repel your viewers if you cannot effortlessly weave your images together or get your cut to reach the proper frame. Learning to edit a video may soon become a never-ending task. While each project you work on will have somewhat different editing needs, the principles of video editing remain basically the same. You don’t need to spend a lot on costly equipment to have a professional appearance; if you pay attention to a few important things, you can produce excellent movies with whatever you have right now.</p>
<p>Content producers, entrepreneurs, and influencers can have much too much material to include into a single YouTube video. You may not be able to buy video editing software if you’re on a tight budget. So, what does a video marketer do if they don’t have editing software? To assist you with the process of video editing, we’ve put up this thorough tutorial that covers everything you’ll need to know to make stunning films, even if you’ve never done it before. We’ll also demonstrate how to utilize the super-intuitive and user-friendly editor to create a video.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Edit-Recorded-Video-in-OBS"><a href="#Part-1-Edit-Recorded-Video-in-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Edit Recorded Video in OBS"></a><strong>Part 1. Edit Recorded Video in OBS</strong></h2><p>OBS is a video streaming and recording application. It’s open source, free, and works on Macs, Windows, and Linux. It is a strong and adaptable screencast video creation tool when paired with competent audio and video editing tools. Unfortunately, OBS doesn’t support editing feature and hence, we’re enlisting the recording steps so you can edit them by using a third-party toolkit mentioned in the guide.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1. Download and Install OBS</strong></p>
<p>Install OBS according to the instructions for your operating system by downloading it from the link below.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2. Setup Screen Recording</strong></p>
<p>The window is divided into separate parts called “docks” when you initially launch the app. Every dock has a distinct function. Scenes, Sources, Mixer, and Controls are the areas to pay attention to. OBS employs a Scenes and Sources system, which will be discussed in more depth in a later lesson. These two tools operate in tandem to help you keep track of your video, audio, and other production materials. When you first start OBS, you’ll see that a scene is already loaded, which you can locate in the bottom left corner of the interface.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="obs setup screen recording"
                ></p>
<p>You’ll also need to add a source to this scene before you can begin recording. Click the Add button at the bottom of the Sources panel, then pick Screen Capture on Linux or Display Capture on Mac and Windows with the default Scene chosen (it will be highlighted).</p>
<p><strong>Step 3. Customize the Recording Source</strong></p>
<p>You’ll need to create a new source before you can begin recording your desktop screen. Select “Display Capture” by clicking the “+” icon on the Sources dock. You will be prompted to name the Display source in a popup window. Click “OK”. At the bottom right of the screen, click the Settings icon. Take note of the Recording Path field under the Output tab. This is where your recorded video will be kept on your computer.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4. Start&#x2F;Stop Recording</strong></p>
<p>You’ll be able to choose the computer screen display you wish to capture in the following window. If you just have one monitor, make that the default. OBS Studios should show you the screen in the window after a valid display has been chosen. We need to change your graphics settings if OBS is unable to successfully load the screen video. Click the Start Recording button in the bottom right corner when you’re ready to begin recording. When you’re finished, click Stop Recording, and a movie will be saved to the folder you chose in the preferences.</p>

<h2 id="Part-6-Related-FAQs-3"><a href="#Part-6-Related-FAQs-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: Related FAQs"></a><strong>Part 6: Related FAQs</strong></h2><p><strong>1. How do I edit video recordings?</strong></p>
<p>Most individuals have the tools they need to film and edit small videos. With a smartphone or tablet and access to a computer, you can get the job done without even checking out equipment, much less employing a key grip. A laptop isn’t the finest equipment to film a movie–that would be extremely uncomfortable. Smartphone or tablet is easy to use. This topic is for those with access to an iPhone and a PC. Android, iPad, and Mac users will have a distinct process. Smartphones and tablets often default to recording video at a very high-Quality level, which takes up a lot of memory and results in big file sizes. Most likely you will want to lessen the resolution that you photograph.</p>
<p><strong>Can you edit an already uploaded video?</strong></p>
<p>If you have found yourself in this circumstance, your initial instinct could be to worry and assume you must repair the issue, delete the uploaded video, and re-upload the new one. However, this procedure will make your prior video URL dead, and any embeds of your video will display the following graphic to visitors. Nevertheless, these aforementioned sites recognizes that artists occasionally make small honest errors, or someone included in the uploaded video may demand that they be removed from it. So, to permit that, makers may chop away sections from their film without resetting a video’s metrics.</p>
<p><strong>How to edit recorded video on iPhone?</strong></p>
<p>If you have iOS 13 or later, you can edit films in the built-in Photos app… much as you edit your images. You may cut, crop, and straighten your films. And you may make your film more attractive by altering brightness, color, or even making it black and white. Filming films on iPhone has gotten more popular as iPhone camera lenses have progressed over the years. Many iPhone filmmakers desire the capacity to edit their video directly from their phone for simple social sharing. Using a video editing software for iPhone is a terrific method to effortlessly produce and upload videos. just open the video you want to modify, then press Edit at the upper right to get it done.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-5"><a href="#Conclusion-5" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion:"></a><strong>Conclusion:</strong></h2><p>If you routinely use Google Meet or Zoom, it can be a good idea to record your conferences so you can still return to them at a later period. Recording these conversations and meetings may be a big assistance when it’s time for later evaluations, updates, and enabling absent team members catch up on the meeting topic. For instance, do you wish to share meeting minutes or information with people missing in this meeting? Essentially the call recording is for other co-workers to view afterwards. Instead, you may use the recommended screen recorders to capture every moment and then use a specialist video editor like Filmora to make the required edits before sharing it with others.</p>

<h2 id="How-to-Use-Blender-Green-Screen"><a href="#How-to-Use-Blender-Green-Screen" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Blender Green Screen"></a>How to Use Blender Green Screen</h2><p>Blender is an open-source cross-platform 3D graphics program, but this doesn’t mean it’s a low-rent option. Just like commercial packages like Lightwave 3D, it is also a very capable compositing package. Unlike Lightwave, it is a modern node-based compositor like Nuke or Fusion. It’s not what the software is designed for, but it does a bangup job of green screen compositing, as you will soon see.</p>
<p>Blender green screen uses technique of the <strong><strong>chroma key</strong> a color is isolated (in our case the green of the</strong><strong>green screen</strong>), or a particular luminance, it is removed and the area that was occupied by it becomes transparent, thus becoming part of the alpha channel. The transparent parts will thus show the video or the image below, which will thus define the environment in which the subject of the first movie will act.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Use-Green-Screen-in-Blender"><a href="#How-to-Use-Green-Screen-in-Blender" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Green Screen in Blender"></a>How to Use Green Screen in Blender</h2><p>So we need to pull these two elements into Blender and pull a key on the green bits to make the background show through in as naturalistic a way as possible. Blender is a node-based compositor which means the control mechanism is nodes or little LEGO blocks of love which you place on the screen and link with little strings which form your signal path.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>Locate the drop-down (it goes up, actually, but you know what we mean) at the bottom of the view, and select “Movie Clip Editor.”</p>
<p>Click the “Open” button and choose and load your green screen footage. (You can also load sequences of images for uncompressed keys in this step if you have the space, and the footage is the right size.)</p>
<p>Once the clip is loaded, go back to the drop-down and select Node Editor.</p>
<p>The screen will be blank, but just go to the bottom of the view and click the middle button marked “Node Tree Type” to Display, and then check the Use Nodes and Backdrop buttons.</p>
<p>Select the “Render Layers” node, and because we won’t need it you can delete it (on the Mac this is the Forward Delete key). Then move the Compositing node out of the way because we won’t need it yet.</p>
<p>**<strong>Note:</strong> to zoom in and out of the nodes, use the centre scroll wheel of the mouse if you have it. To zoom in and out of the images you are working on, use the V and Alt-V keys.</p>
<p>**<strong>Compositing Nodes</strong></p>
<p>Click the Add menu in the bar at the bottom of the view and select “Input -&gt; Movie Clip.” Select the green screen clip you added in the Movie Clip Editor. This is the input. We have to push this through a keyer to remove the green and make those areas transparent.</p>
<p>**<strong>Important:</strong> in this program flow goes from left to right, so node inputs are on the left of a node, and outputs are on the right of a node.</p>
<p>Now select “Add -&gt; Matte -&gt; Keying” to add a keying node. Also “Add -&gt; Output -&gt; Viewer” to make the output from the key visible. Click on the little yellow dot next to Image output on the Input node, and drag it to Image input on the Keying node. Then drag the little dot next to Image output on the keying node, and drag it to the image input on the viewer node.</p>
<p>You now have to select the key colour, the colour which the keyer is changing to transparent. Click the Key Colour button on the Keying node, and this displays a colour selector. Click the eyedropper, and click on the image in the background somewhere on the green screen.</p>
<p>If you look carefully, you will see that there are some areas which still have a bit of colour and are not fully transparent. You can check this more accurately by dragging the string from the Matte output on the Keying node and linking to the input on the viewer. This is the key you have made. As you can see, the dark bits are supposed to be totally black, and there are still greys showing through. (This is because the source material wasn’t perfect.)</p>
<p>There are many different ways to fix this depending on the shot, but if it’s a reasonably well-shot green screen, all you will need to do is the following.</p>
<p>Adjust the Black Clip slider to expand the amount of greens which turn to black. Then adjust the White Clip to push the whites to prevent them from becoming transparent.</p>
<p>Once you have pure white and pure black, reconnect the image output of the keying node to the image input on the viewer, and you’ll see you have a decent key.</p>
<p>You can adjust the amount of fringing and spill (reflections from the green screen on the model), but generally the keyer does a good job of guessing that for you with a decently-shot green screen.</p>
<p>**<strong>Adding the background</strong></p>
<p>After this, adding the background is more of the same with a slight twist. “Add -&gt; Input -&gt; Movie Clip,” navigate to your background clip and load it.</p>
<p>To blend the two layers, you have to make a mix of the two clips so that the background shows through the now transparent bits of the foreground.</p>
<p>“Add -&gt; Colour -&gt; Mix node”. Take the output from the background clip, and feed it to the top image input of the mix node. Take the output from the keying node, and feed it into the lower image input on the mix node.</p>
<p>Click the Alpha channel button next to the drop-down on the mix node.</p>
<p>And finally we have our key. The background is way too sharp and makes the green screen footage look really soft and crappy, so we need to soften the background. There is a really nice Bokeh Blur filter in blender for just this purpose to make the background look out of focus and add lots of gorgeous Bokeh blobs.</p>
<p>“Add -&gt; Filter -&gt; Bokeh Blur” and put it between the background clip and the mix. In Blender, if you add a node and place it over a string between two nodes, the string goes yellow, and dropping it will automatically insert the new node into the signal path connecting inputs and outputs.</p>
<p>Finally add an image to the Bokeh Blur for the shape you want the bokeh to be; we opted for a donut-shaped iris pattern.</p>
<p>To render out your video, connect the output of the Mix node to the input of the compositing node we left lying about earlier. It’s okay for this output to be connected to the input node of the viewer, too, as this means we see progress while rendering.</p>
<p>Make sure you are set up to render the right amount of frames at 30fps in the render panel on the far right. 30fps for 5 seconds (the duration of our clip) is 150 frames. Insert 150 where it says End Fr.</p>
<p>Select a place and a filename to output to in the Output panel further down the right-hand side. Then to render, select the info menu bar from the top-left drop-down, and finally choose “Render Menu -&gt; Render Animation,” and the render will begin.</p>
