<h2 id="How-to-Add-a-Custom-Transition-to-OBS"><a href="#How-to-Add-a-Custom-Transition-to-OBS" class="headerlink" title="How to Add a Custom Transition to OBS"></a>How to Add a Custom Transition to OBS</h2><p>OBS Studio is an open-source video editor that is widely popular for live streaming on online platforms. Even though OBS is a completely free application, its features are comparable to any premium video editor. We always look for available transition effects in a video editor and OBS takes it to the next level by allowing users to add custom transitions.</p>
<p>Among custom transitions, Stinger transitions have gained a lot of traction from the users. Stinger transitions are made popular by sports channels who use Stinger frequently whenever there is a change in the scene. We will illustrate how to add custom transitions in OBS and apply Stinger transitions in your video.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Stinger-in-OBS"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Stinger-in-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is Stinger in OBS"></a>Part 1. What is Stinger in OBS</h2><p>Stinger is a special type of customized animated video transition effect that is available in the latest version of OBS Studio. It is a combination of a transparent video animation and a cut transition. Stinger begins with the transparent video animation that grows into full-screen overlay, and it is followed by the cut transition. After the cut transition, you place the next scene or video clip. You will notice Stinger transition whenever sports channels show an instant replay during a live match.</p>
<p>The transparent video animation starts on top of the current video you are editing. When the animation expands and covers up the entire screen, you place the cut transition, and thereafter, you place the next video clip or scene as per your requirement. Some customized stinger effect also includes audio effects along with video effect.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-add-stinger-transitions-to-OBS"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-add-stinger-transitions-to-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to add stinger transitions to OBS"></a>Part 2. How to add stinger transitions to OBS</h2><p>The Stinger transition is available on OBS Studio and Streamlabs, and both of them are open-source and free applications. Before you add stinger transition, you should have a video animation ready that you will play on top of the current video followed by the cut transition effect. You can download several stinger video animations from the internet and include any of them in OBS while adding stinger transition. Here are the steps on how to add a custom transition to OBS.</p>
<p>Step1 Go to Scene Transitions section and click on Effects option to open the drop-down menu.</p>
<p>Step2 From the drop-down menu, click on “Add: Stinger” option.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step5 For Transition Point Type, select Time(milliseconds) option. In the Transition Point field, add the duration of the transparent video animation so that the transition to the next scene takes place immediately after the video animation gets completed.</p>

                ></p>
