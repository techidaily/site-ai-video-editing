<p>Nowadays, digital means such as Photoshop or Illustrator are used to create the screen print effect, which is achieved by using a layer mask to cut out a portion of the image and filling it with the color or pattern of your choice. The design is then printed onto fabric using water-based <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMYK%5Fcolor%5Fmodel" >CMYK <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (cyan, magenta, yellow, black) inks with inkjet printers.</p>
<p>Suppose you’ve ever wanted to create the screen print effect in Photoshop to give that artistic look to your pictures and embed them in your clothes or other accessories but don’t know where to start or are not familiar with the process. In that case, this guide can surely help you figure this out quickly!</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Picture of the object:</strong> We will cut out the object from the original image using the Lasso tool and unsaturate it. However, you have to ensure that the object is clear and easily detectable within the picture.</li>
<li><strong>A background image:</strong> You will need a background image to add the object to. For this, you can use a solid background, capture scenery, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Fonts</strong>: You can also add fonts to the final image to add your ideas or thoughts, making your final project more eye-catching and engaging.</li>
<li><strong>Photoshop latest version:</strong> For this tutorial, we will use the Photoshop CC 2021 version, so make sure to download and install it to your computer immediately!</li>

<p>Step1 Launch the<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html" >Photoshop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> program on your laptop&#x2F;desktop and click <strong>“Create New”</strong> on the software dashboard. Next, select the page size, such as <strong>“letter,”</strong> and click <strong>“Open.”</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/creating-new-document-in-photoshop-to-use-screen-print-effect.png"
                      alt="click create new"
                ></p>
<p>Now, click the <strong>“File”</strong> option in the top toolbar, and from the drop-down menu, select <strong>“Open.”</strong> Next, choose the image you want to apply the screen print effect by browsing to its location on your computer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/adding-object-image-in-photoshop-to-create-screen-print-effect.png"
                      alt="click the file option"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Next, click the <strong>“Lasso”</strong> tool from the left-side menu to create the selection around the object in the image.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/selecting-object-via-lasso-tool-to-create-screen-print-effect-in-Photoshop.png"
                      alt="click the lasso tool"
                ></p>
<p>Press the <strong>CMD&#x2F;Ctrl + C</strong> on your computer’s keyboard to copy the selection. Next, click the “<strong>Layer</strong>“ option in the top toolbar, select “<strong>New</strong>,” and click “<strong>Layer via Copy</strong>.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/new-layer-via-copy-to-create-screen-print-effect-in-photoshop.png"
                      alt="click layer via copy"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 Now, hide the background layer in the <strong>“Layers”</strong> panel on the right-hand side, and you will get your object without any BG. Click the <strong>“Image”</strong> option in the top toolbar and select <strong>“Adjustments.”</strong></p>
<p>Click <strong>“Threshold…”</strong> from the drop-down menu, and set the <strong>“Threshold level.”</strong> Alternatively, you can click <strong>“Cmd&#x2F;ctrl+Shift+U”</strong> on the keyboard to desaturate the image.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/setting-the-threshold-level-to-create-screen-print-effect-in-photoshop.png"
                      alt="click threshold"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 Next, select the <strong>“Magic Eraser Tool”</strong> from the left-side menu and remove the white parts to smooth down the background. Afterward, choose the <strong>“Move Tool”</strong> from the menu and drag your object to a new layer.</p>
<p>To add the background image, click <strong>“File”</strong> and select <strong>“Open.”</strong> Next, select the file and again click <strong>“Open.”</strong></p>
<p>Step5 Select the object using the <strong>“Move Tool”</strong> and drag it to the background image layer. If the thing is too large and you want to resize it, select the object using the <strong>“CMD&#x2F;Ctrl”</strong> key and click <strong>“Edit”</strong> from the top toolbar. From the drop-down menu, choose <strong>“Transform”</strong> and click <strong>“Scale.”</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="select the object using the move tool"
                ></p>
<p>Next, drag the handles to adjust the size of the object on the Background image.</p>
<p>Step6 Click the <strong>“T”</strong> icon from the left-hand side menu and set the font style, color, and size. You can also click the <strong>“3D”</strong> option to convert your text to a three-dimensional form.</p>

Many people use both of them interchangeably, and that’s wrong. Although color grading and color correction are post-production processes that enhance image colors, they perform different roles.</p>
<p>Here’s how to differentiate color grading from color correction:</p>

<tr>
<td>Purpose</td>
<td>The primary aim of color grading an image is to evoke specific emotions in the viewers. Color grading leverages the emotional and psychological effects of colors to manipulate the viewers’ moods. You can use color grading to give your images different tones or themes like fear, femininity, youthfulness, passion, anger, sadness, etc.</td>
<td>Unlike color grading, the color correction does very little in setting the tone or mood that an image carries. Instead, it corrects specific mistakes in the image to make it look as natural to the human eyes as possible. Generally, camera lenses and the human eyes view pictures differently. Color correction changes a photo’s look to make it more appealing to humans than the camera. It makes black colors appear darker and adds more white to whites to create the desired effect.</td>

However, you will notice a little redder in romantic movies. Note that filmmakers can use different color grades in movies to draw attention to specific details or represent changes in the storyline. Color grading produces the same effects in pictures.</td>
<td>Color correction is most prominent in documentaries to make pictures and videos look more real to the human eye. Other times, color corrections just adjust one color to merge the rest of the image or video.</td>

<h4 id="●-Hue"><a href="#●-Hue" class="headerlink" title="● Hue"></a>● Hue</h4><p>Hue is the general name for describing pure color. That means it defines color without alluding to its brightness, vividness, etc. It describes a color’s position in the color wheel.</p>
<h4 id="●-Saturation"><a href="#●-Saturation" class="headerlink" title="● Saturation"></a>● Saturation</h4><p>When a photo editor talks about saturation, they refer to the hue concentration that defines a specific color. Saturation describes color shades and focuses on how colorful they are. Examples of colors with zero saturation are white, black, and grey.</p>

<h4 id="●-Color-Cast"><a href="#●-Color-Cast" class="headerlink" title="● Color Cast"></a>● Color Cast</h4><p>Color cast means that the image’s coloring doesn’t look as natural as it should be. This usually happens when different light sources get mixed.</p>
<h4 id="●-Temperature"><a href="#●-Temperature" class="headerlink" title="● Temperature"></a>● Temperature</h4><p>Temperature defines how cool or warm a color is. Cool temperatures typically describe blues and purples, while orange and red represent the warmth.</p>

However, there are many limitations with the number of potential looks you can achieve with this tool. The fast color corrector primarily focuses on adjusting tint and saturation. Its major advantage over the three-way corrector is its user-friendliness and simplicity.</p>

Many people use both of them interchangeably, and that’s wrong. Although color grading and color correction are post-production processes that enhance image colors, they perform different roles.</p>
<p>Here’s how to differentiate color grading from color correction:</p>
<table>

</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>Definition</td>
<td>Color grading is a process that enhances an image’s color by stylizing or giving it a cinematic appearance.</td>
<td>Color correction is a process that adjusts color mistakes in an image by giving it a consistent appearance. This process balances colors by adjusting whites and blacks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Purpose</td>
<td>The primary aim of color grading an image is to evoke specific emotions in the viewers. Color grading leverages the emotional and psychological effects of colors to manipulate the viewers’ moods. You can use color grading to give your images different tones or themes like fear, femininity, youthfulness, passion, anger, sadness, etc.</td>
<td>Unlike color grading, the color correction does very little in setting the tone or mood that an image carries. Instead, it corrects specific mistakes in the image to make it look as natural to the human eyes as possible. Generally, camera lenses and the human eyes view pictures differently. Color correction changes a photo’s look to make it more appealing to humans than the camera. It makes black colors appear darker and adds more white to whites to create the desired effect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Stage in the production process</td>
<td>Color grading typically comes after color correction in the post-production process. That’s because the effects of color grading are more appealing on a color-corrected picture.</td>
<td>Color correction comes before color grading. This process does the major work of balancing colors and correcting errors. Color grading only fine-tunes what color correction has done, giving it a professional finish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Example</td>
<td>One of the most obvious examples of color grading is in motion pictures. For example, Sci-Fi movies typically have a very saturated blue color. However, you will notice a little redder in romantic movies. Note that filmmakers can use different color grades in movies to draw attention to specific details or represent changes in the storyline. Color grading produces the same effects in pictures.</td>
<td>Color correction is most prominent in documentaries to make pictures and videos look more real to the human eye. Other times, color corrections just adjust one color to merge the rest of the image or video.</td>

<p>● Step 1:<br>The first step in color grading is deciding how warm or cool you want your image to look. Then, modify the white balance to suit your desired warmth or coolness.</p>
<p>● Step 2:<br>After adjusting the white balance, the next step is to adjust saturation or hue.</p>
<p>● Step 3:<br>The next step is to focus on the histogram. A histogram is a common feature in many photo editing software that informs you of your image’s tonal values. The goal in this stage is to ensure equal color distribution. Keep adjusting your image till the colors are even.</p>
<p>● Step 4:<br>Work on your highlights and shadows by modifying the green, red, and blue curves. Also, adjust your vibrancy setting for a good effect.</p>
<p>● Step 5:<br>Explore split toning. Split toning is a process that involves adding colors to highlight and shadows independently. Learning how to split tone can make a difference in your photo editing.</p>
