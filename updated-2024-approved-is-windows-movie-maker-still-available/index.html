At first sight, you’ll see that these two operations are similar because they involve the cutting of videos. Let’s look at the differences between these two operations.</p>
<h3 id="Trimming"><a href="#Trimming" class="headerlink" title="Trimming"></a>Trimming</h3><p>Trimming is the process of cutting off a portion of the end or beginning of your video to reduce its length, leaving the desired content only. Trimming is vital when you want to ensure your video starts swiftly and your viewers will not get bored while waiting for something captivating to occur.</p>
<p>The first seconds of a video are what draw viewers’ attention and convince them to continue watching the entire video. When you apply it intelligently, video trimming allows you to remove unnecessary frames from the beginning and end of your video and leave content that your audience will like.</p>
<h3 id="Cutting"><a href="#Cutting" class="headerlink" title="Cutting"></a>Cutting</h3><p>Cutting is also a fundamental video editing skill, and it involves removing a portion of a video clip by cutting in two places. You’ll then lift out the middle area and combine the leftover video back together.</p>
<p>This operation is helpful when you want to polish your video and cut off meaningless snippets. What’s more? You can apply cutting if you intend to insert a section of your video clip into another one.</p>
<p>You might want to consider cutting when you want to share your video on social networks and need to cut it into pieces due to the video length limits.</p>
<p>People often confuse trimming with cutting because they are all about deleting sections of the video. However, trimming involves deleting the beginning and end of a video, while cutting refers to cutting a part of a video file from somewhere else. Understanding this crucial difference will allow you to edit your videos like a professional.</p>

At first sight, you’ll see that these two operations are similar because they involve the cutting of videos. Let’s look at the differences between these two operations.</p>
<h3 id="Trimming-3"><a href="#Trimming-3" class="headerlink" title="Trimming"></a>Trimming</h3><p>Trimming is the process of cutting off a portion of the end or beginning of your video to reduce its length, leaving the desired content only. Trimming is vital when you want to ensure your video starts swiftly and your viewers will not get bored while waiting for something captivating to occur.</p>
<p>The first seconds of a video are what draw viewers’ attention and convince them to continue watching the entire video. When you apply it intelligently, video trimming allows you to remove unnecessary frames from the beginning and end of your video and leave content that your audience will like.</p>
<h3 id="Cutting-3"><a href="#Cutting-3" class="headerlink" title="Cutting"></a>Cutting</h3><p>Cutting is also a fundamental video editing skill, and it involves removing a portion of a video clip by cutting in two places. You’ll then lift out the middle area and combine the leftover video back together.</p>
<p>This operation is helpful when you want to polish your video and cut off meaningless snippets. What’s more? You can apply cutting if you intend to insert a section of your video clip into another one.</p>
<p>You might want to consider cutting when you want to share your video on social networks and need to cut it into pieces due to the video length limits.</p>
<p>People often confuse trimming with cutting because they are all about deleting sections of the video. However, trimming involves deleting the beginning and end of a video, while cutting refers to cutting a part of a video file from somewhere else. Understanding this crucial difference will allow you to edit your videos like a professional.</p>

It’s the area Premiere Pro where you arrange your videos and map out the edits you want to apply. You will see all your video clips, transitions, effects, and more laid out in chronological order while you are working on your project. You can Premiere Pro trim video clips on the timeline, and at any point, play your project to check how your edits will look.</p>
<p>Remember that edits on the Premiere Pro timeline don’t alter your source files, and they are previews of how your edits will appear. That means you can untrim a video clip to extend it to its original length without consequence.</p>

<ol>
<li>Double click on the video file you want to trim in Premiere Pro.</li>
<li>Adjust the timings of your edits. Drag the ends of your video clip as if you are resizing a window to shorten or extend by trimming. As your cursor gets closer at the edge of the video clip, you’ll see a red arrow.</li>

<p><strong>3. Organize your Audio Tracks</strong></p>
<h5 id="Step1-Create-Tracks-for-Dialects"><a href="#Step1-Create-Tracks-for-Dialects" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Create Tracks for Dialects"></a>Step1 Create Tracks for Dialects</h5><p>The first two tracks are usually for dialects. You can include all the dialects of characters in these tracks. Keep one track for each character. If you have more characters, feel free to assign more tracks to them.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p><strong>4. Color Code Your Clips</strong></p>
<p>Suppose you want to make the timeline even easier to view. In that case, you can select all clips from a camera or a subject and color code them into a specific color. For example, you can color code the footage from camera A in red, camera B in yellow, and Camera C in blue. Now, when you look at the Timeline, you can quickly distinguish footage from different cameras.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_16.jpg"

<h2 id="Part-2-Pro-Tips-about-Improving-Video-Editing-Efficiency"><a href="#Part-2-Pro-Tips-about-Improving-Video-Editing-Efficiency" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Pro Tips about Improving Video Editing Efficiency"></a>Part 2: Pro Tips about Improving Video Editing Efficiency</h2><p><strong>1. Rename Individual Clips</strong></p>
<p>It would be much simpler to organize the timeline if you could quickly rename individual clips. Cut a clip into smaller segments and give each clip a different name. Make sure these clips have a name other than the source video to avoid confusion.</p>
<p><strong>2. Remove Empty Timeline</strong></p>
<p>For quick video editing, timeline organization is essential. Organize your materials and footage at all times to prevent delays. Put everything in the correct folders with the proper labels. To keep your timeline organized, select “Delete Empty Tracks” from the context menu when right-clicking on the track window on the left.</p>
<p><strong>3. Use Keyboard Shortcuts</strong></p>
<p>Knowing keyboard shortcuts allows you to carry out the editing process quickly and precisely.</p>
<p><strong>4. Select Good Music</strong></p>
<p>Don’t only concentrate on the images; the music also affects how well your video comes out. For example, suppose you’re making a drama movie. In that case, you should pick the right music track to evoke particular emotions in your viewers.</p>
<p><strong>5. Add Text and Graphics</strong></p>
<p>Depending on the style of the video, adding text, graphics, or stock video to your project could be helpful. You should provide more text than just the title for some videos.</p>
<h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>You don’t need to be an expert in video editing to produce high-quality videos. In reality, you can complete the task without any expensive, high-end professional training. So how? Well, with the proper video editing tools like Wondershare Filmora, anything is possible. Follow the above guide, organize your timeline and keep the tracks consistent while video editing on Filmora so it’s easier to come back and edit a project or share with other editors.</p>

<h5 id="Step1-Create-Tracks-for-Picture-Editing-1"><a href="#Step1-Create-Tracks-for-Picture-Editing-1" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Create Tracks for Picture Editing"></a>Step1 Create Tracks for Picture Editing</h5><p>Keep the first three tracks for picture editing. These tracks are usually for picture editing that includes footage with no effects or some simple effects—for example resizing, keyframing, transitions, or Green Screen.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_7.jpg"
                      alt="create tracks for picture editing"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step2-Create-Tracks-for-Temporary-Footage-1"><a href="#Step2-Create-Tracks-for-Temporary-Footage-1" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Create Tracks for Temporary Footage"></a>Step2 Create Tracks for Temporary Footage</h5><p>Set up the fourth track for the temporary footage or placeholders so you can quickly switch the temporary footage without spending extra time looking for them.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_8.jpg"
                      alt="create tracks for temporary footage"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step3-Create-Tracks-for-Effects-1"><a href="#Step3-Create-Tracks-for-Effects-1" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Create Tracks for Effects"></a>Step3 Create Tracks for Effects</h5><p>Set the fifth video track as the effect track. It will include all effects from firmware that do not apply to the footage directly.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_9.jpg"
                      alt="create tracks for effects"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step4-Create-Tracks-for-On-and-Off-Content-1"><a href="#Step4-Create-Tracks-for-On-and-Off-Content-1" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Create Tracks for On and Off Content"></a>Step4 Create Tracks for On and Off Content</h5><p>Next, on the sixth video track, you can add the content that you would want to turn on and off from time to time. In this example, you can put the subtitles here.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_10.jpg"
                      alt="create tracks for on and off content"
                ></p>
<p><strong>3. Organize your Audio Tracks</strong></p>
<h5 id="Step1-Create-Tracks-for-Dialects-1"><a href="#Step1-Create-Tracks-for-Dialects-1" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Create Tracks for Dialects"></a>Step1 Create Tracks for Dialects</h5><p>The first two tracks are usually for dialects. You can include all the dialects of characters in these tracks. Keep one track for each character. If you have more characters, feel free to assign more tracks to them.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_11.jpg"
                      alt="create tracks for dialects"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step2-Create-Tracks-for-Additional-Audio-1"><a href="#Step2-Create-Tracks-for-Additional-Audio-1" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Create Tracks for Additional Audio"></a>Step2 Create Tracks for Additional Audio</h5><p>The third audio track could be for any additional audio, such as voiceover. If you don’t have a voiceover in your video, you can leave it empty.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_12.jpg"
                      alt="create tracks for additional audio"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step3-Create-Tracks-for-Sound-Effects-1"><a href="#Step3-Create-Tracks-for-Sound-Effects-1" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Create Tracks for Sound Effects"></a>Step3 Create Tracks for Sound Effects</h5><p>The fourth track could usually be the sound effects track. You can add all the clapping sounds, laughing, and all kinds of other foley sound here.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_13.jpg"
                      alt="create tracks for sound effects"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step4-Create-Tracks-for-Ambient-Sound-1"><a href="#Step4-Create-Tracks-for-Ambient-Sound-1" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Create Tracks for Ambient Sound"></a>Step4 Create Tracks for Ambient Sound</h5><p>Keep the fifth track for Ambient sound and room tone. You can use it to keep a very subtle environment sound in specific scenes. For example, you can use the room tone recorded on sets.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_14.jpg"
                      alt="create tracks for ambient sound"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step5-Create-Tracks-for-Background-Music-1"><a href="#Step5-Create-Tracks-for-Background-Music-1" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Create Tracks for Background Music"></a>Step5 Create Tracks for Background Music</h5><p>Finally, the sixth track is usually for background music. But, of course, you could also keep it empty if your project has no background music.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_15.jpg"
                      alt="create tracks for background music"
                ></p>
<p><strong>4. Color Code Your Clips</strong></p>
<p>Suppose you want to make the timeline even easier to view. In that case, you can select all clips from a camera or a subject and color code them into a specific color. For example, you can color code the footage from camera A in red, camera B in yellow, and Camera C in blue. Now, when you look at the Timeline, you can quickly distinguish footage from different cameras.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_16.jpg"
                      alt="color code your clips"
                ></p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Pro-Tips-about-Improving-Video-Editing-Efficiency-1"><a href="#Part-2-Pro-Tips-about-Improving-Video-Editing-Efficiency-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Pro Tips about Improving Video Editing Efficiency"></a>Part 2: Pro Tips about Improving Video Editing Efficiency</h2><p><strong>1. Rename Individual Clips</strong></p>
<p>It would be much simpler to organize the timeline if you could quickly rename individual clips. Cut a clip into smaller segments and give each clip a different name. Make sure these clips have a name other than the source video to avoid confusion.</p>
<p><strong>2. Remove Empty Timeline</strong></p>
<p>For quick video editing, timeline organization is essential. Organize your materials and footage at all times to prevent delays. Put everything in the correct folders with the proper labels. To keep your timeline organized, select “Delete Empty Tracks” from the context menu when right-clicking on the track window on the left.</p>
<p><strong>3. Use Keyboard Shortcuts</strong></p>
<p>Knowing keyboard shortcuts allows you to carry out the editing process quickly and precisely.</p>
<p><strong>4. Select Good Music</strong></p>
<p>Don’t only concentrate on the images; the music also affects how well your video comes out. For example, suppose you’re making a drama movie. In that case, you should pick the right music track to evoke particular emotions in your viewers.</p>
<p><strong>5. Add Text and Graphics</strong></p>
<p>Depending on the style of the video, adding text, graphics, or stock video to your project could be helpful. You should provide more text than just the title for some videos.</p>
<h2 id="Summary-1"><a href="#Summary-1" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>You don’t need to be an expert in video editing to produce high-quality videos. In reality, you can complete the task without any expensive, high-end professional training. So how? Well, with the proper video editing tools like Wondershare Filmora, anything is possible. Follow the above guide, organize your timeline and keep the tracks consistent while video editing on Filmora so it’s easier to come back and edit a project or share with other editors.</p>
