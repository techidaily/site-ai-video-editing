Randomly placing beats yield an inferior-quality video. It also gives the impression that video editing is not done by a professional. The beats must be adjusted to synchronize with the storyline of the video.</p>
<p>Moreover, the video will lose its charm if you put cuts on every beat. People will not be able to enjoy, let alone understand, what is happening in the film.</p>
<h5 id="What-are-the-beats"><a href="#What-are-the-beats" class="headerlink" title="What are the beats?"></a>What are the beats?</h5><p>Beats are pieces of music that recur in a pattern.

<h3 id="How-to-smooth-out-cuts"><a href="#How-to-smooth-out-cuts" class="headerlink" title="How to smooth out cuts"></a>How to smooth out cuts</h3><p>Adding cuts in the beats is one part of the job, not the whole job. After adding these cuts, you have to smoothen them. With it, the point of interest for the audience becomes clear.</p>
<p>To maintain the audience’s attention on our video, we have to smoothen the cuts so that our audience quickly understands the ongoing story in our video. If sudden changes occur on the screen, watching it gets disconcerting.</p>
<p>Indeed, you would not want your audience to have this experience. Head to the following techniques to understand how to smooth out video cuts</p>
<h5 id="Technique-1-Showing-multiple-perspectives"><a href="#Technique-1-Showing-multiple-perspectives" class="headerlink" title="Technique 1: Showing multiple perspectives"></a>Technique 1: Showing multiple perspectives</h5><p>The focal person in the video must occupy the same spot in the previous shot as it maintains in the current shot.</p>
<p>Let us understand from the example given below.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shot 1</strong>: The actress in the music video is occupying the left seat on the bus while looking outside.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="focusing on the main lead in the first shot"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shot 2</strong>: The actress occupies the same spot in the subsequent shot.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="focusing the actress in the second shot from a different angle"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Third Shot</strong>: The shot shows the wide angle of the bus from the inside. The actress is still sitting in the same position and the same place.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/smooth-out-cuts-3.jpg"
                      alt="focusing the actress in the third shot from a different angle"
                ></p>
<p>This technique keeps the audience focused on the point of interest while giving them a different perspective of the scene.</p>
<h5 id="Technique-2-Using-light-leaks"><a href="#Technique-2-Using-light-leaks" class="headerlink" title="Technique 2: Using light leaks"></a>Technique 2: Using light leaks</h5><p>The technique is quite helpful for the transition between two cuts. It uses different levels of colors to shine between cuts, adding smoothness and providing coherence.</p>
<h5 id="What-are-light-leaks"><a href="#What-are-light-leaks" class="headerlink" title="What are light leaks?"></a>What are light leaks?</h5><p>Light leaks are great effects in Filmora. These effects fill the screen with light. It seems that light is leaking in a disorderly fashion. For the time being, the whole screen is filled with that effect. Thus, it explains the name of this effect as a light leak.</p>
<p>Filmora provides a plethora of features for adding Light Leak for transitioning cuts. With the use of Filmora, one can quickly bring a level of flow to the music video. Keep reading to understand how to use this remarkable feature of Filmora.</p>

Randomly placing beats yield an inferior-quality video. It also gives the impression that video editing is not done by a professional. The beats must be adjusted to synchronize with the storyline of the video.</p>
<p>Moreover, the video will lose its charm if you put cuts on every beat. People will not be able to enjoy, let alone understand, what is happening in the film.</p>
<h5 id="What-are-the-beats-1"><a href="#What-are-the-beats-1" class="headerlink" title="What are the beats?"></a>What are the beats?</h5><p>Beats are pieces of music that recur in a pattern.

After adding these cuts, you have to smoothen them. With it, the point of interest for the audience becomes clear.</p>
<p>To maintain the audience’s attention on our video, we have to smoothen the cuts so that our audience quickly understands the ongoing story in our video. If sudden changes occur on the screen, watching it gets disconcerting.</p>
<p>Indeed, you would not want your audience to have this experience. Head to the following techniques to understand how to smooth out video cuts</p>
<h5 id="Technique-1-Showing-multiple-perspectives-1"><a href="#Technique-1-Showing-multiple-perspectives-1" class="headerlink" title="Technique 1: Showing multiple perspectives"></a>Technique 1: Showing multiple perspectives</h5><p>The focal person in the video must occupy the same spot in the previous shot as it maintains in the current shot.</p>
<p>Let us understand from the example given below.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shot 1</strong>: The actress in the music video is occupying the left seat on the bus while looking outside.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shot 2</strong>: The actress occupies the same spot in the subsequent shot.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="focusing the actress in the second shot from a different angle"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Third Shot</strong>: The shot shows the wide angle of the bus from the inside. The actress is still sitting in the same position and the same place.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="focusing the actress in the third shot from a different angle"
                ></p>
<p>This technique keeps the audience focused on the point of interest while giving them a different perspective of the scene.</p>

<h5 id="What-are-light-leaks-1"><a href="#What-are-light-leaks-1" class="headerlink" title="What are light leaks?"></a>What are light leaks?</h5><p>Light leaks are great effects in Filmora. These effects fill the screen with light. It seems that light is leaking in a disorderly fashion. For the time being, the whole screen is filled with that effect. Thus, it explains the name of this effect as a light leak.</p>
<p>Filmora provides a plethora of features for adding Light Leak for transitioning cuts. With the use of Filmora, one can quickly bring a level of flow to the music video. Keep reading to understand how to use this remarkable feature of Filmora.</p>

<p>Click <strong>“Threshold…”</strong> from the drop-down menu, and set the <strong>“Threshold level.”</strong> Alternatively, you can click <strong>“Cmd&#x2F;ctrl+Shift+U”</strong> on the keyboard to desaturate the image.</p>

                      alt="click t icon"
                ></p>
<p>Try removing the left-out white patches on the object using the <strong>“Magic Eraser Tool”</strong> to give a polished look to the print screen effect. Once you are satisfied, click the <strong>“File”</strong> option from the top toolbar panel and select <strong>“Save As.”</strong></p>
<p>Type in the file name and select the file type from the drop-down menu next to <strong>“Save As Type.”</strong> Choose the storage location, click <strong>“Save”</strong> to export your final project, and you’re done!</p>
