<h6 id="▷-What’s-a-Cut-1"><a href="#▷-What’s-a-Cut-1" class="headerlink" title="▷ What’s a Cut"></a>▷ What’s a Cut</h6><p>In the film and video industry, a cut is described by when one clip ends and another one starts. For example, say you have a wide shot clip of a car driving as well as clip of a man’s eyes watching.</p>
<h6 id="▷-When-Would-the-Cut-Happen-1"><a href="#▷-When-Would-the-Cut-Happen-1" class="headerlink" title="▷ When Would the Cut Happen"></a>▷ When Would the Cut Happen</h6><p>The cut would happen when the first shot has ended and is followed by the second shot. Repeating that will have an impact on how the viewer sees the movie and follows the story.</p>

<h6 id="▷-Sound-Effects-1"><a href="#▷-Sound-Effects-1" class="headerlink" title="▷ Sound Effects"></a>▷ Sound Effects</h6><p>Depending on what kind of movie it is, sound effects can make a huge difference in the viewing experience. No matter if it’s an explosion, an extra wind sound, a door crackle, or laughing people in the background.</p>
<h6 id="▷-Deliver-the-Emotion-1"><a href="#▷-Deliver-the-Emotion-1" class="headerlink" title="▷ Deliver the Emotion"></a>▷ Deliver the Emotion</h6><p>Many sound effects are placed into the film to deliver the emotion and get the viewer onto the edge of their seat as it amplifies the moment.</p>
<h3 id="C-Adding-Visual-Effects-1"><a href="#C-Adding-Visual-Effects-1" class="headerlink" title="C. Adding Visual Effects"></a>C. Adding Visual Effects</h3><p>Tips</p>
<h6 id="▷-The-Benefit-of-Post-production-1"><a href="#▷-The-Benefit-of-Post-production-1" class="headerlink" title="▷ The Benefit of Post-production"></a>▷ The Benefit of Post-production</h6><p>When there are visual effects showing in the movie, these are not made physically on set. The benefit of post-production is that there are unlimited choices of adding visual effects to strengthen a moment and the impact on the viewer.</p>
<h6 id="▷-Visual-Effects-1"><a href="#▷-Visual-Effects-1" class="headerlink" title="▷ Visual Effects"></a>▷ Visual Effects</h6><p>A lot of results are accomplished by visual effects because they would be impossible to re-create on set.</p>
<h2 id="4-Distribution-1"><a href="#4-Distribution-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Distribution"></a>4. Distribution</h2><p>Distribution is the final stage of production, which happens after the film has been edited, and is ready for release. Many film makers and production companies will advertise the movie’s trailer on social media and the general internet to target the audience that loves the type of movie that has been made. They will either see it on social media or on television to drive people to theaters to watch the movie and get them into the story. A lot of movies have follow-ups when it’s been received really well creating a storyline.</p>
