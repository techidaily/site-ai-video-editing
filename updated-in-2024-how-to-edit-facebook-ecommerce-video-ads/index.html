Setting a play duration somewhere between 2-2.5 seconds would be an optimal choice. Avoid choosing shorter slide duration unless it becomes an obvious requirement, lest the audience may find it hard to process the contents.</p>

You can further, modify the length of the audio clips by extending and trimming them.</p>

To do this, take the cursor to the end of the track and drag the red indicator line to the point where you wish the audio to end at or begin playing from.</p>

A green colored indicative light will mark the spot where the images are being dropped. You are free to drop all the images at the same time and sort them at a later stage.

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Adjust Image Pans and Transitions</strong></p>
<p>Having included the desired images within the slideshow project, it is now time to improvise them with classic and enhanced looks. You can adhere to the task by making suitable changes under the ‘Video Adjustments’, ‘Crop Tool’ and ‘Clock’ options. Drag the cursor to a desired slide to see all the 3 options pop up at the top your slide screen.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Video Adjustment Tool</strong></p>
<p>Using the ‘Video Adjustment’ option, you are granted the liberty to adjust the brightness, contrast, white point, exposure, saturation and levels of the added images. If your images have an appreciable quality by default, you can skip this step.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Crop Tool</strong></p>
<p>Consider working with the ‘Crop Tool’ to zoom or pan the system camera across a selected slide. Click on the ‘Fit’ option to set the image within a chosen frame size; however you need to be cautious lest using the tool may render an incorrectly cropped image. Select the ‘Crop’ option to adjust the image aspect ratio according to your specific size constraints.</p>
<p>The ‘Ken Burns’ tool, you can rely on this one to spark the slideshow images with the coolest zoom and pan effects. The tool is represented by ‘Red and Green’ boxes above the ‘Video Preview’ box in the editor timeline.

When you are satisfied with your work, hit ‘Done’ to return and confirm the changes, or click on the next presentation slide to crop and pan the same.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Clock Tool</strong></p>
<p>The ‘Clock’ icon lets you adjust the screen time of each slide, assigning a preset minimum duration of 0.25 seconds to each slide. Setting a play duration somewhere between 2-2.5 seconds would be an optimal choice. Avoid choosing shorter slide duration unless it becomes an obvious requirement, lest the audience may find it hard to process the contents.</p>
<p>Prefer adjusting the screen time separately for each slide, in case you have a large project with more than 50 slides. It is instead, advisable to time the entire project under one time frame, while setting a longer screen time for the title slide.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Add an Upbeat Background Audio</strong></p>
<p>Adding background music to your presentation slides is pretty simple, with you having to just position the audio files within the desired slides using the ‘Drag and Drop’ method. The slides containing music pieces will have a ‘Light Green’ highlighting box under them. To correct a wrong placement, drag the audio file across the individual slides and drop at the correct space. You can further, modify the length of the audio clips by extending and trimming them.</p>
<p>To import audio files from your online iTunes account, navigate to and click within the ‘Music and Sound Effects’ box at the bottom right corner of the editor timeline. You can also clip the music file to start playing the background audio from a certain point within the track. To do this, take the cursor to the end of the track and drag the red indicator line to the point where you wish the audio to end at or begin playing from.</p>

                ></p>

When all looks good, navigate to the ‘Functions Toolbar’ at the top and hit the ‘Share’ tab to select a media sharing platform of your choice. You can even choose to export your slideshow directly from the editor timeline via QuickTime.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Split a Clip</strong></p>
<p>You can reduce the size of a sufficiently long video clip by choosing to break the same into several parts or trim it to ward off unwanted portions. To split your footage, take your cursor to the specific splitting point of the clip within the editor timeline, make a right click, and select the ‘Split Clip’ option from the dropdown menu that follows next.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Detach an Audio File</strong></p>
<p>Detaching audio from a clip allows you to experiment with different video play options. You can let the run the in the background as you proceed to split a clip for inserting a still image. To work with the effect, navigate to and right click on a desired clip within the editor timeline and tap on ‘Detach Audio’ in the upcoming list of options. The added music clip in ’Blue’ will detach to appear as an independent clip in ‘Green’ within the software timeline.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Fade Audio In and Out</strong></p>
<p>To ensure a smooth audio transition between successive clips, try hands at fading the audio in and out by pointing the cursor at a detached green or an attached blue audio clip, followed by dragging the small round circles at the beginning or end of the footage. To introduce a gradual fade in or out effect, drag the round button to the center of the video clip.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Include Transitions</strong></p>
<p>Transitions allow a seamless presentation flow by ensuring a smooth movement between different slides appearing in continuity. Add a suitable transition element to the video footage of your slideshow by navigating to and hitting the ‘Transition’ tab in the ‘Functions Toolbar’. The default transition screen time is 1 second, but you can customize the same by double clicking on the effect post the latter’s addition within the editor timeline.</p>

Along with this, it helps the viewers to watch the video as you can add effects about fun, travel, guides and etc. accordingly. Adding a border is super easy and it’s not more than fun!</p>
<p>So let’s start…</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Add-Borders-to-Videos-in-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#How-to-Add-Borders-to-Videos-in-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="How to Add Borders to Videos in Premiere Pro"></a><strong>How to Add Borders to Videos in Premiere Pro</strong></h2><p>Today we are going to discuss how to add borders to the video clips or images in premiere pro. It’s pretty simple to make borders of different colors and sizes for your video clips.</p>
<p>So, here are the two different ways we can use to add borders to our videos or images.</p>
<ol>
<li>Adding a border to the video using a grid effect</li>
<li>Adding a border to the video using the essential graphics panel</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="Way-1-Using-a-Grid-Effect"><a href="#Way-1-Using-a-Grid-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Way 1. Using a Grid Effect"></a><strong>Way 1.</strong> <strong>Using a Grid Effect</strong></h3><p>While working on the project, make sure the aspect ratio of the video is 16:9, and project settings are HD (1080P) and UHD 4K in premiere pro.</p>
<p>Let’s start step by step.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Drag all the video clips by stacking them on video tracks in the timeline.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Hit the <strong>Effects</strong> tab and write the <strong>grid</strong> in the search panel.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Simply drag the <strong>grid</strong> option into the timeline of the videos.</p>
</li>

Using the Essential Graphics Panel"></a><strong>Way 2.</strong> <strong>Using the Essential Graphics Panel</strong></h3><p>First of all, you wanna be in your premium pro graphics workspace. This will pull off your graphics panel on your right. The good thing about the essential graphics panel is, that it is vector-based. So the different video clips with different resolutions will not pixelate.</p>
<p>Let’s dive in…</p>
<p>Now, to use the graphics panel you need to perform the following steps.</p>
<ul>

</li>
</ul>
<p>A rectangular mask will be created. You can edit it according to the frame requirement.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Go to the corner of the mask border and press the shift key. Drag the border to resize and scale it proportionally.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Again go to effect controls, under <strong>opacity</strong> hit <strong>invert alpha</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Under <strong>mask</strong> hit <strong>inverted</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Go to <strong>motion</strong> settings, change the <strong>position</strong>, and</p>
</li>
<li><p>Go to <strong>Alpha adjust</strong> and set the <strong>mask feathering</strong> to <strong>0</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Now go back to the <strong>effects</strong> panel and search the <strong>paint bucket</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Under effects controls, hit the <strong>alpha channel</strong> under the <strong>fill selector</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>Then hit <strong>stroke</strong> under the <strong>stroke</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>You can turn up the <strong>stroke width</strong> to make it a bit thicker.</p>

<h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>We have discussed different software to add borders. All the software and tools are free to use. Similarly, they can be used on both Mac as well as Windows. They are user-friendly and provide full control over borders. You can use any one of them to make your borders and can easily engage viewers in your videos.</p>
<p>In all of the above applications, I recommend you to use <strong>Wondershare filmora 11</strong>. It is the most professional software and makes your video stand out.</p>
<p><strong>Way 1.</strong> <strong>Using a Grid Effect</strong></p>
<p>While working on the project, make sure the aspect ratio of the video is 16:9, and project settings are HD (1080P) and UHD 4K in premiere pro.</p>
<p>Let’s start step by step.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Drag all the video clips by stacking them on video tracks in the timeline.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Hit the <strong>Effects</strong> tab and write the <strong>grid</strong> in the search panel.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Simply drag the <strong>grid</strong> option into the timeline of the videos.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select the <strong>anchor value</strong> to <strong>0</strong> for the x and y.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Change the <strong>size</strong> to <strong>width and height slider.</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>Change the <strong>width</strong> to <strong>1920</strong> and <strong>height</strong> to <strong>1080</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we have borders added as you can see below.</p>
<p>You can also change the width of the borders.</p>
<ul>
<li>Change the <strong>width</strong> to <strong>30</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You have the option to change the color of the border.</p>
<ul>
<li>Select the <strong>blending mode</strong> to <strong>normal</strong>.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>color picker</strong> tool and change the color of your desire.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Way-2-Using-the-Essential-Graphics-Panel-2"><a href="#Way-2-Using-the-Essential-Graphics-Panel-2" class="headerlink" title="Way 2. Using the Essential Graphics Panel"></a><strong>Way 2.</strong> <strong>Using the Essential Graphics Panel</strong></h3><p>First of all, you wanna be in your premium pro graphics workspace. This will pull off your graphics panel on your right. The good thing about the essential graphics panel is, that it is vector-based. So the different video clips with different resolutions will not pixelate.</p>
<p>Let’s dive in…</p>
<p>Now, to use the graphics panel you need to perform the following steps.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Import</strong> the videos and drag them into the timeline.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select the <strong>effects</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>Find <strong>“alpha adjust”</strong> and drag it into the effects control.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Create a <strong>4-point polygon mask</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A rectangular mask will be created. You can edit it according to the frame requirement.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Go to the corner of the mask border and press the shift key. Drag the border to resize and scale it proportionally.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Again go to effect controls, under <strong>opacity</strong> hit <strong>invert alpha</strong>.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li><p>Go to <strong>motion</strong> settings, change the <strong>position</strong>, and</p>
</li>
<li><p>Go to <strong>Alpha adjust</strong> and set the <strong>mask feathering</strong> to <strong>0</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Now go back to the <strong>effects</strong> panel and search the <strong>paint bucket</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Under effects controls, hit the <strong>alpha channel</strong> under the <strong>fill selector</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>Then hit <strong>stroke</strong> under the <strong>stroke</strong></p>
</li>

<h2 id="Conclusion-4"><a href="#Conclusion-4" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>We have discussed different software to add borders. All the software and tools are free to use. Similarly, they can be used on both Mac as well as Windows. They are user-friendly and provide full control over borders. You can use any one of them to make your borders and can easily engage viewers in your videos.</p>
<p>In all of the above applications, I recommend you to use <strong>Wondershare filmora 11</strong>. It is the most professional software and makes your video stand out.</p>
<p><strong>Way 1.</strong> <strong>Using a Grid Effect</strong></p>
<p>While working on the project, make sure the aspect ratio of the video is 16:9, and project settings are HD (1080P) and UHD 4K in premiere pro.</p>
<p>Let’s start step by step.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Drag all the video clips by stacking them on video tracks in the timeline.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Hit the <strong>Effects</strong> tab and write the <strong>grid</strong> in the search panel.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Simply drag the <strong>grid</strong> option into the timeline of the videos.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select the <strong>anchor value</strong> to <strong>0</strong> for the x and y.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Change the <strong>size</strong> to <strong>width and height slider.</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>Change the <strong>width</strong> to <strong>1920</strong> and <strong>height</strong> to <strong>1080</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we have borders added as you can see below.</p>
<p>You can also change the width of the borders.</p>
<ul>
<li>Change the <strong>width</strong> to <strong>30</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You have the option to change the color of the border.</p>
<ul>
<li>Select the <strong>blending mode</strong> to <strong>normal</strong>.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>color picker</strong> tool and change the color of your desire.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Way-2-Using-the-Essential-Graphics-Panel-3"><a href="#Way-2-Using-the-Essential-Graphics-Panel-3" class="headerlink" title="Way 2. Using the Essential Graphics Panel"></a><strong>Way 2.</strong> <strong>Using the Essential Graphics Panel</strong></h3><p>First of all, you wanna be in your premium pro graphics workspace. This will pull off your graphics panel on your right. The good thing about the essential graphics panel is, that it is vector-based. So the different video clips with different resolutions will not pixelate.</p>
<p>Let’s dive in…</p>
<p>Now, to use the graphics panel you need to perform the following steps.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Import</strong> the videos and drag them into the timeline.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select the <strong>effects</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>Find <strong>“alpha adjust”</strong> and drag it into the effects control.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Create a <strong>4-point polygon mask</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A rectangular mask will be created. You can edit it according to the frame requirement.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Go to the corner of the mask border and press the shift key. Drag the border to resize and scale it proportionally.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Again go to effect controls, under <strong>opacity</strong> hit <strong>invert alpha</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Under <strong>mask</strong> hit <strong>inverted</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Go to <strong>motion</strong> settings, change the <strong>position</strong>, and</p>
</li>
<li><p>Go to <strong>Alpha adjust</strong> and set the <strong>mask feathering</strong> to <strong>0</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Now go back to the <strong>effects</strong> panel and search the <strong>paint bucket</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Under effects controls, hit the <strong>alpha channel</strong> under the <strong>fill selector</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>Then hit <strong>stroke</strong> under the <strong>stroke</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>You can turn up the <strong>stroke width</strong> to make it a bit thicker.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Hit the <strong>color</strong> tab to change the color of the border as desired.</p>
</li>
</ul>
