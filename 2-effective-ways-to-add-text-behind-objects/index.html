<ul>
<li>You have to start by importing your video in the import library.</li>
<li>From the import library, you can click on the video and drag it down below to the timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Adding video to the timelines will allow you to create a workspace to edit your video.</p>
<p>Now let’s move on to how we will add the text tile to our video.</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Add-the-Text-Tile"><a href="#Step3-Add-the-Text-Tile" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Add the Text Tile"></a>Step3 Add the Text Tile</h5><p>It is time to add the text tile you will animate behind the object. To do that, follow the steps mentioned as such.:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the <strong>Titles</strong> icon on the bar above the import library.</li>
<li>A drop-down option will be available on the left side.</li>
<li>Scroll down to the <strong>Plain text</strong>.</li>
<li>Here, you can see many text tiles to add to your video.</li>
<li>You can choose anyone you like.</li>
<li>The most commonly used tile is the <strong>Basic 6</strong>.</li>
<li>When you add the text tile to the timeline, you must ensure that the text is of equal length to the video.</li>
<li>To do that, drag the right corner of the text tile and drag it to the right to match the length of the video.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h5 id="Step4-Edit-the-Text-Tile"><a href="#Step4-Edit-the-Text-Tile" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Edit the Text Tile"></a>Step4 Edit the Text Tile</h5><p>After you have added the text tile you desire, you need to type in the text. For this article, we will keep it simple. We will be typing a simple statement such as “<strong>Hello, World.</strong>“</p>
<ul>
<li>Double-click the Text tile to open the settings menu.</li>
<li>After the settings menu is opened, type in the text box on the import window.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will notice changes on the main window that your text has changed.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="edit the text tile"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>After the text appears, you can make the font look as desired.</li>
<li>Look above the text window, and you will see the type of text font selected.</li>
<li>Click on the drop-down option and choose whatever you like.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s move on to animate the text tile.</p>
<h5 id="Step5-Animate-the-text-tile"><a href="#Step5-Animate-the-text-tile" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Animate the text tile"></a>Step5 Animate the text tile</h5><p>After adding text, it is time to animate it. This animation will decide how your text will appear behind the target object.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, you must open the text settings by <strong>double-clicking</strong> on the text tile in the timeline.</li>
<li>In the settings opened in the import window, you will have to click on the animation tab in the upper left corner, aside from the <strong>Preset</strong></li>
<li>Now scroll down to where you will see the <strong>Right Roll</strong></li>
<li>Click on <strong>Right Roll</strong> and then click on the <strong>OK</strong> in the bottom right corner of the import window.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-6.png"
                      alt="animate the text"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You may notice now that the text appears in front of our object. Don’t worry now! We are getting there. With a few simple steps, we will see the results.</p>
<p>Now let us move on to the more significant part of the editing, masking the object. Again, look ahead to see how you can mask the object!</p>
<h5 id="Step6-Mask-the-Object"><a href="#Step6-Mask-the-Object" class="headerlink" title="Step6 Mask the Object"></a>Step6 Mask the Object</h5><p>To mask our object, we will need to be technical. We will begin by adding the same footage of the static object on our timeline. Follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drag and drop the static object footage above the timeline text. Make sure the text stays in the middle of the sandwich.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-7.png"
                      alt="add the main video above the text tile"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>We will hide the video in the first track to simplify things. In addition, this will make our editing easier.</li>
<li>We will have to look in the effects library to insert the masking effect.</li>
<li>You can see the <strong>Effects</strong> icon on the bar at the top.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Effects</strong>.</li>
<li>You will see the search bar at the top of the import window.</li>
<li>In the search bar, type in Image mask.</li>
<li>Drag the <strong>Image mask</strong> effect on the video above the text tile.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now the masking effect has been added. But we would have to adjust so that it stays upon our object.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> on the video and the settings option will open up.</li>
<li>Go into the <strong>Effects</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You must select your target object’s mask shape exactly as its shape.</p>
<ul>
<li>We have to mask out a building, so that we will need a vertical rectangle.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-8.png"
                      alt="change the shape of the image mask"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>After you have selected the shape of your object, we will need to convert it to the object’s size so that it only masks the building.</li>
<li>To do that, scroll down below the import window to the settings.</li>
<li>Here you can see the X, Y, and width settings.</li>
<li>First, move the width bar so that it matches the width of the building.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-9.png"
                      alt="change the width of the mask"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Now drag the X bar until the mask is confined to the building. You would have created the mask only limited to the building.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-10.png"
                      alt="change the position of the mask by dragging x"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Once you complete this step, click OK in the bottom right corner.</li>
<li>Now un-hide the original video that you imported in the beginning.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, play the video in the main play window from the beginning.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-11.gif"
                      alt="final result of the static video"
                ></p>
<p>You have successfully created a text behind the object effect. Now that you know how to add text behind static objects let us move to learn how to add text to a video that has high contrast and a clean background.</p>
<h3 id="Add-text-behind-a-high-contrast-and-clean-background"><a href="#Add-text-behind-a-high-contrast-and-clean-background" class="headerlink" title="Add text behind a high contrast and clean background"></a>Add text behind a high contrast and clean background</h3><p>Besides the text can be added behind a static object, it can also be added to a clean background with high contrast. But how is it? Let’s dive into it.</p>
<h5 id="Step1-Import-the-video-into-the-timeline"><a href="#Step1-Import-the-video-into-the-timeline" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Import the video into the timeline"></a>Step1 Import the video into the timeline</h5><ul>
<li>Import the video from the location in your PC media.</li>

<h5 id="Step2-Add-the-text-tile"><a href="#Step2-Add-the-text-tile" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Add the text tile"></a>Step2 Add the text tile</h5><p>To add the text to your video, follow the steps mentioned below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the titles icon on the bar above the import window.</li>
<li>On the left drop-down option, scroll down to the titles.</li>
<li>Select the Plain text option.</li>
<li>You will notice that multiple options will pop up in the import window.</li>
<li>Select the text title that suits you best.</li>
<li>After you have selected the text style, drag and drop it down above your video in the timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-13.png"
                      alt="add the text tile above the video"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Our next step would be to add the text.</li>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> on the text tile. Doing so will open the settings menu in the import window.</li>
<li>Type in the text that you want. For reference, we will keep it simple such as, <strong>“Hello world.”</strong></li>
<li>You can also adjust the font of your text.</li>
<li>Above the type box, a drop-down option will show you the range of fonts available.</li>
<li>Select the font you desire.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-14.png"
                      alt="type in the text"
                ></p>
<p>Now that you have added the text, it is time to animate it.</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Take-a-snapshot"><a href="#Step3-Take-a-snapshot" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Take a snapshot"></a>Step3 Take a snapshot</h5><p>After typing in the text, you will notice in the main play window that your text still appears in front of your object. Therefore, we want to take it behind the object. To do so, first, you will need to take a snapshot.</p>
<p>Follow the steps mentioned to take a snapshot:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hide the main video. You can see the Eye icon aside from your main video in the edit column on the left side of the timeline.</li>
<li>Click on the Eye icon to hide the main video.</li>
<li>In the <strong>main play</strong> window, you will notice that the screen turns black, which leaves only the text on the screen.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="taking a snapshot"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>In the main play screen, you can notice a small <strong>camera icon</strong>.</li>
<li>This camera icon is used to take snapshots of your screen.</li>
<li>Click on the camera icon to take a snapshot of your screen.</li>
<li>Your snapshot will now be saved in the main import window.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-16.png"
                      alt="snapshot is saved in the import library"
                ></p>
<p>Now that we have taken a snapshot, we will need to import it into the timeline. Scroll below for more.</p>
<h5 id="Step4-Add-the-snapshot"><a href="#Step4-Add-the-snapshot" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Add the snapshot"></a>Step4 Add the snapshot</h5><p>After taking it, your goal is to import it into the timeline. To perform this action, perform the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before adding the snapshot to the timeline, we must delete the main text tile.</li>
<li>Then drag and drop the snapshot from the import library into the timeline above the video.</li>
<li>Make sure that the snapshot is aligned well with the length of the video.</li>
<li>If it is <strong>longer</strong> than the video, drag it from the right to match the length of the video.</li>
<li>If its length is <strong>smaller</strong> than the video, drag it to the right to increase its length.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-17.png"
                      alt="adjust the length of the snapshot"
                ></p>
<p>After adding the snapshot, we will have to change its blending mode.</p>
<h5 id="Step5-Change-the-blending-of-the-snapshot"><a href="#Step5-Change-the-blending-of-the-snapshot" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Change the blending of the snapshot"></a>Step5 Change the blending of the snapshot</h5><p>To create the effect of your text behind the video, you must alter the main text’s blending mode. In this case, it will be the snapshot we took.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Changing the blending mode of the snapshot will allow it to blend with the transparent background and will create the effect of the text behind the object in the video.</p>
<p>Follow the steps mentioned below to change the blending of the snapshot:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> the snapshot.</li>
<li>If you select the compositing tab, the blending options will pop up.</li>
<li>From default, it would be set to <strong>Normal</strong>. Click on the <strong>Normal</strong></li>
<li>It will show a drop-down option.</li>
<li>Scroll down below until you can see an option labeled Then click on <strong>Overlay.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="change the blending mode to overlay"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>And press <strong>OK</strong> in the bottom right corner to confirm your changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>The text can be blended with the background.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>Eye icon</strong> to un-hide the video from the timeline.</li>
<li>Now play the video from the start from the main play screen to see the final changes.</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Adding video to the timelines will allow you to create a workspace to edit your video.</p>
<p>Now let’s move on to how we will add the text tile to our video.</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Add-the-Text-Tile-1"><a href="#Step3-Add-the-Text-Tile-1" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Add the Text Tile"></a>Step3 Add the Text Tile</h5><p>It is time to add the text tile you will animate behind the object. To do that, follow the steps mentioned as such.:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the <strong>Titles</strong> icon on the bar above the import library.</li>
<li>A drop-down option will be available on the left side.</li>
<li>Scroll down to the <strong>Plain text</strong>.</li>
<li>Here, you can see many text tiles to add to your video.</li>
<li>You can choose anyone you like.</li>
<li>The most commonly used tile is the <strong>Basic 6</strong>.</li>
<li>When you add the text tile to the timeline, you must ensure that the text is of equal length to the video.</li>
<li>To do that, drag the right corner of the text tile and drag it to the right to match the length of the video.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h5 id="Step4-Edit-the-Text-Tile-1"><a href="#Step4-Edit-the-Text-Tile-1" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Edit the Text Tile"></a>Step4 Edit the Text Tile</h5><p>After you have added the text tile you desire, you need to type in the text. For this article, we will keep it simple. We will be typing a simple statement such as “<strong>Hello, World.</strong>“</p>
<ul>
<li>Double-click the Text tile to open the settings menu.</li>
<li>After the settings menu is opened, type in the text box on the import window.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will notice changes on the main window that your text has changed.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="edit the text tile"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>After the text appears, you can make the font look as desired.</li>
<li>Look above the text window, and you will see the type of text font selected.</li>
<li>Click on the drop-down option and choose whatever you like.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s move on to animate the text tile.</p>
<h5 id="Step5-Animate-the-text-tile-1"><a href="#Step5-Animate-the-text-tile-1" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Animate the text tile"></a>Step5 Animate the text tile</h5><p>After adding text, it is time to animate it. This animation will decide how your text will appear behind the target object.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, you must open the text settings by <strong>double-clicking</strong> on the text tile in the timeline.</li>
<li>In the settings opened in the import window, you will have to click on the animation tab in the upper left corner, aside from the <strong>Preset</strong></li>
<li>Now scroll down to where you will see the <strong>Right Roll</strong></li>
<li>Click on <strong>Right Roll</strong> and then click on the <strong>OK</strong> in the bottom right corner of the import window.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-6.png"
                      alt="animate the text"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You may notice now that the text appears in front of our object. Don’t worry now! We are getting there. With a few simple steps, we will see the results.</p>
<p>Now let us move on to the more significant part of the editing, masking the object. Again, look ahead to see how you can mask the object!</p>
<h5 id="Step6-Mask-the-Object-1"><a href="#Step6-Mask-the-Object-1" class="headerlink" title="Step6 Mask the Object"></a>Step6 Mask the Object</h5><p>To mask our object, we will need to be technical. We will begin by adding the same footage of the static object on our timeline. Follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drag and drop the static object footage above the timeline text. Make sure the text stays in the middle of the sandwich.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-7.png"
                      alt="add the main video above the text tile"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>We will hide the video in the first track to simplify things. In addition, this will make our editing easier.</li>
<li>We will have to look in the effects library to insert the masking effect.</li>
<li>You can see the <strong>Effects</strong> icon on the bar at the top.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Effects</strong>.</li>
<li>You will see the search bar at the top of the import window.</li>
<li>In the search bar, type in Image mask.</li>
<li>Drag the <strong>Image mask</strong> effect on the video above the text tile.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now the masking effect has been added. But we would have to adjust so that it stays upon our object.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> on the video and the settings option will open up.</li>
<li>Go into the <strong>Effects</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You must select your target object’s mask shape exactly as its shape.</p>
<ul>
<li>We have to mask out a building, so that we will need a vertical rectangle.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-8.png"
                      alt="change the shape of the image mask"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>After you have selected the shape of your object, we will need to convert it to the object’s size so that it only masks the building.</li>
<li>To do that, scroll down below the import window to the settings.</li>
<li>Here you can see the X, Y, and width settings.</li>
<li>First, move the width bar so that it matches the width of the building.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-9.png"
                      alt="change the width of the mask"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Now drag the X bar until the mask is confined to the building. You would have created the mask only limited to the building.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-10.png"
                      alt="change the position of the mask by dragging x"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Once you complete this step, click OK in the bottom right corner.</li>
<li>Now un-hide the original video that you imported in the beginning.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, play the video in the main play window from the beginning.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="final result of the static video"
                ></p>
<p>You have successfully created a text behind the object effect. Now that you know how to add text behind static objects let us move to learn how to add text to a video that has high contrast and a clean background.</p>
<h3 id="Add-text-behind-a-high-contrast-and-clean-background-1"><a href="#Add-text-behind-a-high-contrast-and-clean-background-1" class="headerlink" title="Add text behind a high contrast and clean background"></a>Add text behind a high contrast and clean background</h3><p>Besides the text can be added behind a static object, it can also be added to a clean background with high contrast. But how is it? Let’s dive into it.</p>

                      alt="add the text tile above the video"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Our next step would be to add the text.</li>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> on the text tile. Doing so will open the settings menu in the import window.</li>
<li>Type in the text that you want. For reference, we will keep it simple such as, <strong>“Hello world.”</strong></li>
<li>You can also adjust the font of your text.</li>
<li>Above the type box, a drop-down option will show you the range of fonts available.</li>
<li>Select the font you desire.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="type in the text"
                ></p>
<p>Now that you have added the text, it is time to animate it.</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Take-a-snapshot-1"><a href="#Step3-Take-a-snapshot-1" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Take a snapshot"></a>Step3 Take a snapshot</h5><p>After typing in the text, you will notice in the main play window that your text still appears in front of your object. Therefore, we want to take it behind the object. To do so, first, you will need to take a snapshot.</p>
<p>Follow the steps mentioned to take a snapshot:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hide the main video. You can see the Eye icon aside from your main video in the edit column on the left side of the timeline.</li>
<li>Click on the Eye icon to hide the main video.</li>
<li>In the <strong>main play</strong> window, you will notice that the screen turns black, which leaves only the text on the screen.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="taking a snapshot"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>In the main play screen, you can notice a small <strong>camera icon</strong>.</li>
<li>This camera icon is used to take snapshots of your screen.</li>
<li>Click on the camera icon to take a snapshot of your screen.</li>
<li>Your snapshot will now be saved in the main import window.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="snapshot is saved in the import library"
                ></p>
<p>Now that we have taken a snapshot, we will need to import it into the timeline. Scroll below for more.</p>
<h5 id="Step4-Add-the-snapshot-1"><a href="#Step4-Add-the-snapshot-1" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Add the snapshot"></a>Step4 Add the snapshot</h5><p>After taking it, your goal is to import it into the timeline. To perform this action, perform the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before adding the snapshot to the timeline, we must delete the main text tile.</li>
<li>Then drag and drop the snapshot from the import library into the timeline above the video.</li>
<li>Make sure that the snapshot is aligned well with the length of the video.</li>
<li>If it is <strong>longer</strong> than the video, drag it from the right to match the length of the video.</li>
<li>If its length is <strong>smaller</strong> than the video, drag it to the right to increase its length.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-17.png"
                      alt="adjust the length of the snapshot"
                ></p>
<p>After adding the snapshot, we will have to change its blending mode.</p>
<h5 id="Step5-Change-the-blending-of-the-snapshot-1"><a href="#Step5-Change-the-blending-of-the-snapshot-1" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Change the blending of the snapshot"></a>Step5 Change the blending of the snapshot</h5><p>To create the effect of your text behind the video, you must alter the main text’s blending mode. In this case, it will be the snapshot we took.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Changing the blending mode of the snapshot will allow it to blend with the transparent background and will create the effect of the text behind the object in the video.</p>
<p>Follow the steps mentioned below to change the blending of the snapshot:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> the snapshot.</li>
<li>If you select the compositing tab, the blending options will pop up.</li>
<li>From default, it would be set to <strong>Normal</strong>. Click on the <strong>Normal</strong></li>
<li>It will show a drop-down option.</li>
<li>Scroll down below until you can see an option labeled Then click on <strong>Overlay.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-18.png"
                      alt="change the blending mode to overlay"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>And press <strong>OK</strong> in the bottom right corner to confirm your changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>The text can be blended with the background.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>Eye icon</strong> to un-hide the video from the timeline.</li>
<li>Now play the video from the start from the main play screen to see the final changes.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
