<p>Birthdays come only once a year, and at this time of the year, we want to make our loved ones feel special and loved by praying for them, wishing them well, getting them presents, throwing parties, and other stuff people do to celebrate birthdays. You can also make the best of this celebration by doing something special. A birthday slideshow showing all of the celebrant’s fondest moments sounds like a perfect gift to me. A birthday photo slideshow has all the celebrant’s favorite memories, vacation photos, favorite pets, and interests. It combines several images put together using a free or paid <strong>birthday slide photo creator</strong>. It can be displayed on a computer or Tv screen depending on the creator’s choice.</p>

For a lasting impression on the celebrant, consider adding these when you <strong>create a birthday slideshow.</strong> A birthday slideshow should have the following:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Background music</p>
<p>Lighten up your video with some background music. A slideshow just displaying photos without music isn’t a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Meaningful Quotes and greetings</p>
<p>You can spice up the birthday video by adding greetings, quotes, and well wishes to let the celebrant know you want to them feel fantastic.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Make the video personal</p>
<p>Add a personal touch to the clip by adding things that matter to the celebrant, whether pictures of them taken while performing a hobby or a favorite place. You can also use photos of their achievements from the time of their last birthday to the present one.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Keep it short and simple</p>
<p>You don’t want to drag your audience with too many photos. I think the video would have the most impact when it is short, to the point, and keeps the viewers longing for more.</p>

<p>Birthdays come only once a year, and at this time of the year, we want to make our loved ones feel special and loved by praying for them, wishing them well, getting them presents, throwing parties, and other stuff people do to celebrate birthdays. You can also make the best of this celebration by doing something special. A birthday slideshow showing all of the celebrant’s fondest moments sounds like a perfect gift to me. A birthday photo slideshow has all the celebrant’s favorite memories, vacation photos, favorite pets, and interests.

<p>Birthdays come only once a year, and at this time of the year, we want to make our loved ones feel special and loved by praying for them, wishing them well, getting them presents, throwing parties, and other stuff people do to celebrate birthdays. You can also make the best of this celebration by doing something special. A birthday slideshow showing all of the celebrant’s fondest moments sounds like a perfect gift to me. A birthday photo slideshow has all the celebrant’s favorite memories, vacation photos, favorite pets, and interests. It combines several images put together using a free or paid <strong>birthday slide photo creator</strong>. It can be displayed on a computer or Tv screen depending on the creator’s choice.</p>

But it is not the only thing that makes a fantastic <strong>birthday photo slideshow.</strong> This amazing slideshow doesn’t have to be just photos, and you can also create a <strong>birthday wishes slideshow</strong>. For a lasting impression on the celebrant, consider adding these when you <strong>create a birthday slideshow.</strong> A birthday slideshow should have the following:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Background music</p>
<p>Lighten up your video with some background music. A slideshow just displaying photos without music isn’t a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Meaningful Quotes and greetings</p>
<p>You can spice up the birthday video by adding greetings, quotes, and well wishes to let the celebrant know you want to them feel fantastic.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Make the video personal</p>
<p>Add a personal touch to the clip by adding things that matter to the celebrant, whether pictures of them taken while performing a hobby or a favorite place. You can also use photos of their achievements from the time of their last birthday to the present one.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Keep it short and simple</p>
<p>You don’t want to drag your audience with too many photos. I think the video would have the most impact when it is short, to the point, and keeps the viewers longing for more.</p>

The only limitation it has is that non-designers and newcomers can’t use it without any knowledge of graphic design.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>PicMonkey</strong>: PicMonkey is another great alternative to Canva, just like Visme. It has many features that help both professional and non-professional designers create attractive and wonderful designs very easily and efficiently. It has many exciting features like photo re-toucher, pattern &amp; effects tools, etc., just like Photoshop, but it is relatively easier to use and can be used by anyone who wants to create beautiful and creative graphic designs.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> ****<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>**: Filmora is a video editing software and can be used as an alternative to Canva if you create and edit the videos to medium &amp; advanced levels. It is used to create and edit short videos for social media and ad campaigns very quickly, with many features available in professional software like Adobe Premiere Pro. It is easy-to-use with an intuitive user interface that is very helpful for non-professional and less experienced video editors.</p>

<h2 id="●-Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-→-3"><a href="#●-Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-→-3" class="headerlink" title="● Key Takeaways from This Episode →"></a><strong>●</strong> Key Takeaways from This Episode <strong>→</strong></h2><p><strong>●</strong> It can be concluded that Canva is a fantastic graphic designing tool for all the non-professionals and newcomers in the field of design. It helps people create attractive and creative designs with less effort and less time consumption.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> No doubt, everything has its pros and cons. Similarly, Canva also has certain limitations compared to the other professional graphic designing tools like Photoshop, Illustrator, etc.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> But still, it is continuously updating and removing those limitations. For example- the new <strong>color match tool</strong> is introduced to this platform for easy and convenient graphic designing.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> This <strong>color match tool</strong> (eyedropper tool) was demanded by the designers who use Canva for their graphics and creating attractive social media posts, infographics, video editing, etc.</p>
