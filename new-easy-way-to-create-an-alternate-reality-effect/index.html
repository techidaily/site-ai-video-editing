<h2 id="Preparing-the-footage"><a href="#Preparing-the-footage" class="headerlink" title="Preparing the footage"></a>Preparing the footage</h2><p>There are not many restrictions on preparing the footage for this effect. However, depending on the results you’re aiming for, you might need to consider a few things.</p>
<p>First, a wider view and some camera panning, or tilting will deliver a better result as it provides angle variations. This will later enhance the dynamic of the scene, making it feels even more uncanny.</p>
<p>Then, while you’re at it, you need to also figure out the purpose of the video itself. If you want to upload it to certain platforms where vertical videos are more popular, you will want to work on that as well. When you’re shooting your footage, make sure that you’re taking it at the correct angle that would fit the ratio you’re aiming for.</p>
<p>Last but not least, consider the length of the footage. If you’re planning to make a bumper video, you might want a quick yet comprehensive shot of the objects you want to highlight. You can always trim and adjust the timing later, but it is better to also plan it early.</p>

If you are pondering over the perfect task choice to start your editing journey with Blender, you can begin with making a material transparent in the software.</p>
<p>When beginning to create transparent artworks in Blender, you need to be familiar with the Transparent BSDF node. Here’s a quick explanation:</p>
<p><strong>Transparent BSDF Node</strong></p>
<p>When working with Blender, you get to access a variety of graphic nodes that cater to specific design purposes. Likewise, the transparent BSDF, as the name suggests, is an exclusive transparency creation graphic node that is essential to make materials transparent in Blender. Talking of the specific node function, it is there to facilitate the control of different transparency modes, in cohesion with specific user requirements.</p>
<p>Browse through the following section for a guided tutorial to make a material transparent using Blender:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p>Prepare a suitable BSDF material by selecting any image from your device and applying it to the object in the Blender’s viewport.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p>To start working with the Transparent BSDF node, you first need to insert the same into the node tree amongst the Principle BSDF and the Mix Shader nodes. To do this, you need to select ‘Add’ or press ‘Ctrl + A’, followed by locating the same in the ‘Shader’ submenu. Do not forget to add the ‘Mix Shader’ node, which is again, present in the ‘Shader’ submenu, to the node tree.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p>
<p>Plug in the Transparent BSDF output into the top Shader input of the Mix Shader, while dragging the latter into the connecting link between the Material Output and Principle BSDF nodes. This enables the Mix Shader node to pass through the two output generating nodes. The resultant ‘Transparency Effect’ can be seen on the viewpoint object within a few seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong></p>
<p>Make an additional connection of two fresh nodes into the node tree as follows:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Transparent BSDF output to the Mix Shader input</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Principal BSDF output to the Mix Shader input</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Mix Shader output to the Surface input</p>
<p>This will finally fetch a transparent material output for the selected image object.</p>

If you are pondering over the perfect task choice to start your editing journey with Blender, you can begin with making a material transparent in the software.</p>
<p>When beginning to create transparent artworks in Blender, you need to be familiar with the Transparent BSDF node. Here’s a quick explanation:</p>
<p><strong>Transparent BSDF Node</strong></p>
<p>When working with Blender, you get to access a variety of graphic nodes that cater to specific design purposes. Likewise, the transparent BSDF, as the name suggests, is an exclusive transparency creation graphic node that is essential to make materials transparent in Blender. Talking of the specific node function, it is there to facilitate the control of different transparency modes, in cohesion with specific user requirements.</p>
<p>Browse through the following section for a guided tutorial to make a material transparent using Blender:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p>Prepare a suitable BSDF material by selecting any image from your device and applying it to the object in the Blender’s viewport.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p>To start working with the Transparent BSDF node, you first need to insert the same into the node tree amongst the Principle BSDF and the Mix Shader nodes. To do this, you need to select ‘Add’ or press ‘Ctrl + A’, followed by locating the same in the ‘Shader’ submenu. Do not forget to add the ‘Mix Shader’ node, which is again, present in the ‘Shader’ submenu, to the node tree.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p>
<p>Plug in the Transparent BSDF output into the top Shader input of the Mix Shader, while dragging the latter into the connecting link between the Material Output and Principle BSDF nodes. This enables the Mix Shader node to pass through the two output generating nodes. The resultant ‘Transparency Effect’ can be seen on the viewpoint object within a few seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong></p>
<p>Make an additional connection of two fresh nodes into the node tree as follows:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Transparent BSDF output to the Mix Shader input</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Principal BSDF output to the Mix Shader input</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Mix Shader output to the Surface input</p>
<p>This will finally fetch a transparent material output for the selected image object.</p>

If you are pondering over the perfect task choice to start your editing journey with Blender, you can begin with making a material transparent in the software.</p>
<p>When beginning to create transparent artworks in Blender, you need to be familiar with the Transparent BSDF node. Here’s a quick explanation:</p>
<p><strong>Transparent BSDF Node</strong></p>
<p>When working with Blender, you get to access a variety of graphic nodes that cater to specific design purposes. Likewise, the transparent BSDF, as the name suggests, is an exclusive transparency creation graphic node that is essential to make materials transparent in Blender. Talking of the specific node function, it is there to facilitate the control of different transparency modes, in cohesion with specific user requirements.</p>
<p>Browse through the following section for a guided tutorial to make a material transparent using Blender:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p>Prepare a suitable BSDF material by selecting any image from your device and applying it to the object in the Blender’s viewport.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p>To start working with the Transparent BSDF node, you first need to insert the same into the node tree amongst the Principle BSDF and the Mix Shader nodes. To do this, you need to select ‘Add’ or press ‘Ctrl + A’, followed by locating the same in the ‘Shader’ submenu. Do not forget to add the ‘Mix Shader’ node, which is again, present in the ‘Shader’ submenu, to the node tree.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p>
<p>Plug in the Transparent BSDF output into the top Shader input of the Mix Shader, while dragging the latter into the connecting link between the Material Output and Principle BSDF nodes. This enables the Mix Shader node to pass through the two output generating nodes. The resultant ‘Transparency Effect’ can be seen on the viewpoint object within a few seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong></p>
<p>Make an additional connection of two fresh nodes into the node tree as follows:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Transparent BSDF output to the Mix Shader input</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Principal BSDF output to the Mix Shader input</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Mix Shader output to the Surface input</p>
<p>This will finally fetch a transparent material output for the selected image object.</p>

<p>Once the image reaches the timeline, tap the same to see the ‘Settings’ tab get opened. Navigate through the tab options until you find ‘Chroma Key Settings’. Enable the ‘Chroma Key’ with a right side toggle to see your selected image get transparent with a ‘Green’ color in the background.</p>
<p>An alternative to the above method is to hit the ‘Color Picker’ option to the right of the ‘Select Color’ tab and navigate to a desired section of the image to make it transparent with a single click.</p>

                      alt="Filmora- Image Transparency Adjustments"
                ></p>
<p>If you observe partial transparency in the resultant image background, consider making additional adjustments in ’Chroma Key’ setting parameters like, offset, edge thickness, tolerance, edge feather, etc., to ensure that the image background is totally transparent. When the final artwork makes you happy, tap ‘OK’.</p>

                      alt="Filmora- Additional Chroma Key Settings"
                ></p>
<p>**Step 4: Time to Export!**Your creation is now all set for a media export to your favorite social media handles. Just click on the ‘Export’ tab in the top right of the software timeline and that’s it!</p>
