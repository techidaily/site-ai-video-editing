The online streaming platform contains millions of videos on almost every topic from around the world, ranging from educational content to recipes and music videos.</p>
<p>The Zoom streaming service has also gained tremendous popularity in recent years, particularly owing to the raging pandemic that swept the world off its feet. It is quite a convenient software program that lets you organize online meetings with up to a hundred members or more in the premium version.</p>
<p>Certain moments may arise when you want to <strong>share a YouTube video on Zoom</strong>. Luckily, the Zoom platform offers various methods by which users can do that easily. But why would you want to share a video from YouTube on Zoom in the first place? Let’s shine some light on that.</p>
<p>Let’s assume you are taking an online class via Zoom. You find a YouTube video that you believe can help explain the topic to your students. During the lecture on Zoom, just like viewing a video on a projector or a screen, you can share your chosen YouTube video with the rest of the class easily.</p>
<p>Now let’s say you are organizing a business meeting via Zoom. You have a YouTube video showing a compilation of different forms of marketing strategies that you wish to share with your team. With just a few simple clicks, you can easily share the YouTube video with everyone present in the meeting.</p>
<p>You and your friends are having a group video chat on Zoom. While laughing at something your friend said, you suddenly remember seeing a reaction video meme on YouTube that would exactly fit the situation. You quickly search it up and share it with your friends, who then applaud you for your choice.</p>
<p>These are just some of the scenarios where you might have to share YouTube videos on Zoom. A whole set of different reasons may arise, which can cause you to share a YouTube video with your Zoom attendees. If such an instance arises, you need to learn how to do that quickly and efficiently.</p>

Looking for a guide on how to <strong>share YouTube videos on Zoom</strong> easily?</p>
<p>Below, you can find two different methods using which you can seamlessly share a YouTube video of your choice on Zoom. The methods are accompanied by a step-by-step guide and relevant images, so you don’t get lost along the way.</p>

It is designed in such a way that users can share whatever is being shown on their screens with their audiences, such as PowerPoint presentations, documents, YouTube videos, and more.</p>
<p>The following steps indicate how you can share your video via the screen share option in the Zoom app:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Open Your YouTube Video</strong></p>
<p>To begin with, launch the browser on your computer and go to YouTube’s website. You can now search for the video you want to share with your Zoom attendees.

<p>Step 7: Press Delete key to delete the green screen background selection.</p>
<p>Step 8: Open the replacement image which you want to put in the place of the green screen background that you have just deleted.</p>
<p>Step 9: Select the entire replacement image and copy the replacement. Come back to your photo and paste the replacement image. Make sure that the layer of the replacement image must be placed below the layer of your photo.</p>
