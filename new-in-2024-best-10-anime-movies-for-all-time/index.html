<h3 id="10Neo-Tokyo-3"><a href="#10Neo-Tokyo-3" class="headerlink" title="10Neo-Tokyo"></a>10Neo-Tokyo</h3><p><strong>Major Attractions</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Compiling 3 short stories into a single movie, this one is an experiment of brilliance in the anime world</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The engaging storylines of each of the 3 shorts will never let you have enough of the movie with a desire to stream one more time</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The directors aim to tell the stories in an animated poetic style that suits the theme of the plot.</p>
<p>Introduced to the anime cinema in 1987, Neo-Tokyo was initially addressed as Manie Manie: Labyrinth Tales. The movie is a split-up craft of the biggest names in the anime world and features shots directed by Yoshiaki Kawajiri, Katsuhiro Otomo and Rintaro. The film got its existing name during its re-release in 1989 by Streamline Pictures to avoid a title clash with Otomo’s allied production Akira, that had hit the screens in the same year.</p>
<p>Viewing through the specific shorts in particular, the ‘Labyrinth Labyrinthos’ directed by Rintaro is inspired by German Expressionism in cohesion with the craft of Salvador Dali. The plot follows Sachi, a notorious young girl who, via the dresser’s looking glass, gets drawn into the gloomy space of a hallucinating quirkiness, along with Cicerone, her pet kitten.</p>
<p>As of ‘The Running Man’ directed by Yoshiaki Kawajiri, the latter is an ugly science fiction noir short that draws its inspiration from Blade Runner. The storyteller here is a sports correspondent who gets the privilege to see Jack Hugh’s last race. This legendary sports star of a dangerous running tournament was then reported to have imbibed fatal psionic tendencies.</p>
<p>Reserving the best for the last, here enters ‘Construction Cancellation Order’, the last short directed by Katsuhiro Omoto. The story progresses with the journey of Tsutomu Sugioka, who is sent to a fictitious and remote area in Aloana Republic, a city in South America by his seniors. His job is to shut down Facility 444, a remote construction project of his Japanese company.</p>
<p>Put collectively, Neo-Tokyo is a masterpiece of technical excellence that showcases the bright future of amine movies, provided that they are crafted by the most unique film creators of the anime world.</p>
<p><strong>Hot Comments</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The movie is a fantastic and cohesive alignment of 3 non-connected stories in one frame to represent an integration that is nothing short of magic</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The movie is a gorgeous play of twisted blocks and designs that conveniently takes the shape of a really great anthology flick</p>
