If yes, then it is important to understand the basic concepts of video aspect ratios. Moreover, you can determine the specifications using an aspect ratio editor online.</p>
<p>Every photo, canvas, responsive design, digital video, or frame is rectangular with precise proportions. Outline the aspect ratios to create shapes according to different mediums like computers, TV, movies, or camera screens.</p>
<p>With the help of aspect ratio calculators, you can calculate the image’s value and new size. You can also use it to convert the image size and keep the objects in shape to make them look natural.</p>
<p>The formula to find an aspect ratio is: Width &#x2F; Height</p>
<h3 id="Aspect-Ratio-Calculation-Process"><a href="#Aspect-Ratio-Calculation-Process" class="headerlink" title="Aspect Ratio Calculation Process"></a>Aspect Ratio Calculation Process</h3><p>Calculating the aspect resolution is pretty straightforward. The steps mentioned below will help you to get the correct height for the edited image:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take the original height-for example, 2400 units.</li>
<li>Take the actual width- for example, 3200 units.</li>
<li>Then, divide the height by width- for example, 2400&#x2F;3200&#x3D;0.75.</li>
<li>Multiply the result (quotient) by new expected width- for instance, 0.75*600&#x3D;450.</li>
<li>The resulting figure is a new height.</li>
