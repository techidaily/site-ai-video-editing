## Progressive Solutions to Add VHS Effects to Video with Ease

Good videos with great edits and effects undoubtedly create a last impression. Videos are like windows to the past, allowing us to relive precious moments and memories. Similarly, good-looking videos have this remarkable ability to last forever. Even when it comes to content creation, videos are a great engagement tool. They engage audiences like no other medium can, conveying emotions and messages.

However, **VHS effects** have added more spice to the content creation and the creative work behind it. They give a normal video a distinct character and style, further improving it. By applying **VHS filters**, you can change the mood of your videos entirely. Applying these effects to your videos sometimes becomes difficult. However, there is always a simple solution to apply VHS to your videos.

## Part 1: What is VHS Effect? An Overview

People from the 80s would remember the good old days when they used to watch movies on VHS tapes. In simple terms, the **VHS effect** is a style that tries to recreate the look of VHS recordings. It's a nostalgic-style effect that has gained popularity in recent years. You can apply different filters and techniques to your videos to achieve this effect.

These techniques aim to replicate the features of VHS tapes. The key features of the VHS filters include distortion, noise, and tracking errors. Distortion and noise create flickering lines and static. Furthermore, the tracking errors give the impression of an unstable video signal. These elements make the video appear just like the old VHS tapes from the 80s.

Additionally, color grading plays an important role in creating this effect. VHS tapes had a unique color palette with saturated and slightly shifted colors. You can replicate this effect by adjusting and applying color grading effects.

## Add Fade in Windows Video Editor

Video fades come in two varieties: fade in and fade out. A video or picture may gradually appear from a black, white, or colored backdrop using a technique called a "fade-in." On the other hand, a video or picture may gradually blend into a white, black, or multicolored backdrop using the fade-out technique.

## Part 1: How to Add Fade in Windows Video Editor

To begin with, you'll need top-notch editing software for your movies. We advise you to try Windows Video Editor if you use Windows. It is slick, simple, and enjoyable to use.
