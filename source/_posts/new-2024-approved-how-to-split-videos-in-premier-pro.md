## How To Split Videos in Premier Pro

You might regularly split and cut clips while doing video editing to find the perfect tempo for your video or removes portions of recordings you might not want. When you first begin using Adobe Premiere for video editing, it is highly possible that you will feel overwhelmed by the number of options at your disposal and question how to divide your footage quickly.

Premiere Pro is the most popular video editing program for movies, television, and online. You may edit the footage into polished films and videos with the aid of creative tools and interaction with other apps and services.

## Part 1\. How to split a clip in premiere pro?

### 1\. The Razor tool

The Razor tool in Premiere is the simplest way to split or cut clips. This enables you to separate clips from the project timeline during your chosen clip. This technique is useful for making the first rough cut of your clips, with the sole drawback being that it can be less exact.

**You can use the following steps to split a clip using the Razor tool:**

Step1By pressing **Cmd+I or Ctrl+I** or by choosing File > Import, you can import it into Premiere Pro.

Step2Drag the clip onto the timeline if there is an existing sequence. If not, use the right-click menu to choose **New Sequence From Clip**. The video will now appear as a single block.

Step3Choose the Razor tool from the panel next to the timeline to split the clip.

Step4To split a video clip, click on the section you want to split.

Step5Now that you have two segments from the same video file, you can edit them separately.

### 2\. Current-Time Indicator

A blue triangular indication called the **Current Time Indicator (CTI)** lets you know where you are in the timeline. CTIs are employed in a variety of panels.

**You can follow these steps to split the clip using Current-Time Indicator:**

Step1Select the section of the clip you want to split by moving the Current-Time Indicator there.

Step2Ensure that the video layer you want to split is highlighted on the timeline's left side.

Step3Use the keyboard shortcuts Cmd+K or Ctrl+K to split the clip.

### 3\. Source Panel

Individual clips are played back on the Source Monitor. You prepare clips for a sequence in the Source Monitor. You designate the clip's source tracks, In points, and Out points. In a Timeline panel, you may add clips to a sequence and place clip markers.

**How to split video clips with source panel in premiere pro** **:**

For the clip, you want to split to appear in the Source panel, choose it from the Project panel. Then take these actions.

Step1First, locate the arrow-shaped marker at the start of the clip's time bar in the **Source Panel** to navigate and indicate the In and Out points.

Step2Wherever you want the In and Out indicators to appear, press the **I** or **O** key. I stand for inside, and **O** for outside.

Step3Select Insert from the Source panel's tools once your marks are in place.
