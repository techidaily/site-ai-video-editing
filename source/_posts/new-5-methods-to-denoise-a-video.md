## 5 Methods to Denoise a Video

In today’s world, the quality of digital product such as photos and videos increase day by day, prompting us to create our content crystal clear and keep it that way. Of course, different kinds of effects and filters are great, and something called “noise” is one of them, but sometimes it is actually unwanted and makes our footage less likable. What is noise, or denoising, anyway? Well, instead of clear video, it’s something quite different – the footage looks grainy, sometimes excessively, and makes our eyes hurt, or simply, more difficult to see what’s going on on the screen. And if you didn’t decide to use a noise effect, then from where does it appear?..

Noise means a mix of different variations of brightness or color information in the shot. It is likely to show up when there is a low light, and/or when the video is taken with small sensors such as smartphones and action cameras. It works as follows: if someone tries to compensate for low-light settings with gain and ISO, more noise is produced.

But, as our readers already know, almost nothing is ever impossible to solve. There is a way to get rid of this annoying grain, and it is called, as pretty obvious, denoising. Hence, denoising in image and video production is used as a technique to take footage from grainy to crystal-clear. And, as you may already agree, it improves a viewer’s quality of experience. And how does this happen? - There are varied techniques, and each of them uses different mathematical and statistical models.

What is considered a good noise reduction? The technique is successful when it suppresses noise effectively in uniform regions; preserves edges and other characteristics, such as fine details and textures; and provides a visually natural experience.

and here you will learn 5 ways, as in 5 software to denoise a video. We’ll touch upon the following ones: Final Cut Pro, Adobe After Effects, Adobe Premiere Pro, DaVinci Resolve and Movavi Video Editor. But, we are not limited to these ones, so maybe there is one more you could use? You’ll find out in the article!

* **Final Cut Pro**

Noise that appears as unwanted grain or artifacts in the video image can be removed in Final Cut Pro pretty easily, you just have to follow the little steps for it. Keep in mind that Final Cut Pro is not eligible for PC, this editor is only available for Mac (but Windows users, tune in for the editors functioning on PC’s!)

So, you have your grained footage, which you already chose to denoise, and for which you will need a video reduction effect.

First, you will need to open Final Cut Pro and import abovementioned video. Select this clip in the timeline,

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-1.jpg)

and position the play head in a way that the clip appears in the viewer, that is, on the big screen - for you to see well.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-2.jpg)

Click the Effects button in the top-right corner of the timeline, or, to use the shortcut, press Command & 5.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-3.jpg)

In the Effects browser, select the Basics category in the list of Video effects on the left, then select the Noise Reduction effect. For 360° clips, select the 360° category, then select the 360° Noise Reduction effect.

And you will need to do one of the following:

Drag the effect to the timeline clip you want to apply it to, or double-click the effect thumbnail to apply the effect to the selected clip.

When the effect is applied, Final Cut Pro analyzes the clip for noise, so you might need to wait for a little while the process is complete and only then see the result.

Interesting tip you can remember is that if you are using several effects to your video clip, then adding Noise Reduction as the first effect would guarantee the best results for you. So, Mac users, you can start denoising your videos in Final Cut Pro now!

* **Adobe After Effects**

Adobe After Effects is a digital visual effects, motion graphics, and compositing application… Pretty intense, right? This very software has endless powers, and one of them is, you guessed correctly – denoising the video! So, how are we going to do that in this monster of the industry?

Sometimes what’s annoying about this kind of programs is that you need plugins, so let’s try to find a way to achieve our desired result without using anything external.

So, first of all (as in all cases!) import your video into After Effects. Then, you will need to find Effect in the menu, and find: Noise and Grain. There, you will choose Remove Grain and click on it.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-4.jpg)

On the left side of the program layout, the Effects Control will be opened. Now, you see viewing mode, where you need to change Preview to Final Output.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-5.jpg)

So, this will be the video with Preview checked:

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-6.jpg)

Which will look like this when Final Output is checked:

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-7.jpg)

Somewhat different and looking better, right?..

By the way, you can watch the whole process video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xa8pqSysA90)!

* **Adobe Premiere Pro**

Adobe Premiere Pro is one of the most and sophisticated video editor. So, of course, there is a way to reduce noise in this software as well, and this can be reached using effect called Median.

First of all, you add your footage to the Timeline in Premiere Pro and then go find the Effects Panel, where Median can be found. You need to drag and drop the Median effect to your video clip.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-8.jpg)

The next step is to make sure that adding the effect to the grainiest parts of the clip, which can be done using masks. So, in the Effects Control panel, you’ll need to select the mask shape for your clip – you can either choose rectangle, circle, or pen tool. With the latter you can move the Mask around the screen and resize it to cover the area.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-9.jpg)

And if you Change the Feather setting to 100, the effect will not have a very visible edge and some smoothness will cover for it.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-10.jpg)

You will need to repeat the process with more than one mask, if you would like to have covered all of the grainy area of your shot.

Lastly, you’ll need to adjust the effect settings to reduce the noise.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-11.jpg)

The Median effect doesn’t actually take away the graininess, it just blurs it. You’ll need to experiment with the Radius settings until you are happy with the result.

* **DaVinci Resolve**

When it comes to DaVinci Resolve, the process is somewhat different in the free version of it. So, first of all, off course, you add your footage into the timeline. Then,you are going to find the fusion tab underneath the timeline panel.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-12.jpg)

You will see MediaIn1 and MediaOut1, you click on MediaIn1, which will ensure the scene appears in the first viewer – and MediaOut1 by default is appearing in the second. So, now you stay on MediaIn1, hit shift+spacebar, and find the option which says: Remove Noise (RN) and then click Add, which adds the Remove Noise1 node. On the top right corner you will find Inspector, and if you click on it, you will see all the properties you can modify.

After going only into the second viewer, and in the top bar we can find channel icons. We open it and click on red, which makes the footage black and white for a while. Then, we go back to the Inspector, increase Softness Red and Detail Red.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-13.jpg)

This removes much grain from the red channel. Then we repeat the same for green, as well as for blue channel. Once you finish, you go to the same channel button in the bar and change it to “back to color”. So, the footage will have its colors back and you will see that it has become clearer, compared to the first viewer.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-14.jpg)

You can play around with the Chroma and Luma channels in the Inspector, if that is something you have ever had experience with!

* **Movavi Video Editor**

In Movavi Video Editor, it is pretty straightforward – unlike DaVinci Resolve, of course! So, getting to the point: the first thing you need to do is Entering the Edit Mode. In order to achieve it, you’ll need to click the Edit button next to the file you want to adjust or select Adjustments in the Tools tab.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-15.jpg)

After this, you will be able to select the Noise removal option, and then, move the Noise level slider to reflect the amount of noise you can see in the preview. The more noise you need to remove, the higher the Noise level, and vice versa.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-16.jpg)

When you're finished removing the noise, click Apply, but in case you need to remove noise from several files, select Apply to all files, which ensures the same noise level will be applied on all your files there.

Lastly, of course, Wondershare Filmora X offers the same option as well. The steps are ase follows: You need to go to the Effects panel and type: “Smart Denoise”. Then, right-click on the video and choose Edit Properties.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-17.jpg)

This will make sure you go inside the Smart Denoise, where you can change opacity of the clip, threshold and radius.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-18.jpg)

You should reduce Opacity until you are satisfied with the result. Then, you can use the box next to Smart Denoise in order to see the scene before and after noise and grain removal.

So, that’s it! – We learned how to remove/reduce noise and grain from the videos, using several video editors. So you might as well start making your video clips look better right away!

Noise that appears as unwanted grain or artifacts in the video image can be removed in Final Cut Pro pretty easily, you just have to follow the little steps for it.

After this, you will be able to select the Noise removal option, and then, move the Noise level slider to reflect the amount of noise you can see in the preview. The more noise you need to remove, the higher the Noise level, and vice versa.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-16.jpg)

When you're finished removing the noise, click Apply, but in case you need to remove noise from several files, select Apply to all files, which ensures the same noise level will be applied on all your files there.

Lastly, of course, Wondershare Filmora X offers the same option as well. The steps are ase follows: You need to go to the Effects panel and type: “Smart Denoise”. Then, right-click on the video and choose Edit Properties.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-18.jpg)

You should reduce Opacity until you are satisfied with the result. Then, you can use the box next to Smart Denoise in order to see the scene before and after noise and grain removal.

So, that’s it! – We learned how to remove/reduce noise and grain from the videos, using several video editors. So you might as well start making your video clips look better right away!

Noise that appears as unwanted grain or artifacts in the video image can be removed in Final Cut Pro pretty easily, you just have to follow the little steps for it. Keep in mind that Final Cut Pro is not eligible for PC, this editor is only available for Mac (but Windows users, tune in for the editors functioning on PC’s!)

So, you have your grained footage, which you already chose to denoise, and for which you will need a video reduction effect.

First, you will need to open Final Cut Pro and import abovementioned video. Select this clip in the timeline,

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-1.jpg)

and position the play head in a way that the clip appears in the viewer, that is, on the big screen - for you to see well.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-2.jpg)

Click the Effects button in the top-right corner of the timeline, or, to use the shortcut, press Command & 5.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-3.jpg)

In the Effects browser, select the Basics category in the list of Video effects on the left, then select the Noise Reduction effect. For 360° clips, select the 360° category, then select the 360° Noise Reduction effect.

And you will need to do one of the following:

Drag the effect to the timeline clip you want to apply it to, or double-click the effect thumbnail to apply the effect to the selected clip.

When the effect is applied, Final Cut Pro analyzes the clip for noise, so you might need to wait for a little while the process is complete and only then see the result.

Interesting tip you can remember is that if you are using several effects to your video clip, then adding Noise Reduction as the first effect would guarantee the best results for you. So, Mac users, you can start denoising your videos in Final Cut Pro now!

* **Adobe After Effects**

Adobe After Effects is a digital visual effects, motion graphics, and compositing application… Pretty intense, right? This very software has endless powers, and one of them is, you guessed correctly – denoising the video! So, how are we going to do that in this monster of the industry?

Sometimes what’s annoying about this kind of programs is that you need plugins, so let’s try to find a way to achieve our desired result without using anything external.

So, first of all (as in all cases!) import your video into After Effects. Then, you will need to find Effect in the menu, and find: Noise and Grain. There, you will choose Remove Grain and click on it.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-4.jpg)

On the left side of the program layout, the Effects Control will be opened. Now, you see viewing mode, where you need to change Preview to Final Output.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-5.jpg)

So, this will be the video with Preview checked:

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-6.jpg)

Which will look like this when Final Output is checked:

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-7.jpg)

Somewhat different and looking better, right?..

By the way, you can watch the whole process video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xa8pqSysA90)!

* **Adobe Premiere Pro**

Adobe Premiere Pro is one of the most and sophisticated video editor. So, of course, there is a way to reduce noise in this software as well, and this can be reached using effect called Median.

First of all, you add your footage to the Timeline in Premiere Pro and then go find the Effects Panel, where Median can be found. You need to drag and drop the Median effect to your video clip.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-8.jpg)

The next step is to make sure that adding the effect to the grainiest parts of the clip, which can be done using masks. So, in the Effects Control panel, you’ll need to select the mask shape for your clip – you can either choose rectangle, circle, or pen tool. With the latter you can move the Mask around the screen and resize it to cover the area.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-9.jpg)

And if you Change the Feather setting to 100, the effect will not have a very visible edge and some smoothness will cover for it.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-10.jpg)

You will need to repeat the process with more than one mask, if you would like to have covered all of the grainy area of your shot.

Lastly, you’ll need to adjust the effect settings to reduce the noise.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-11.jpg)

The Median effect doesn’t actually take away the graininess, it just blurs it. You’ll need to experiment with the Radius settings until you are happy with the result.

* **DaVinci Resolve**

When it comes to DaVinci Resolve, the process is somewhat different in the free version of it. So, first of all, off course, you add your footage into the timeline. Then,you are going to find the fusion tab underneath the timeline panel.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-12.jpg)

You will see MediaIn1 and MediaOut1, you click on MediaIn1, which will ensure the scene appears in the first viewer – and MediaOut1 by default is appearing in the second. So, now you stay on MediaIn1, hit shift+spacebar, and find the option which says: Remove Noise (RN) and then click Add, which adds the Remove Noise1 node. On the top right corner you will find Inspector, and if you click on it, you will see all the properties you can modify.

After going only into the second viewer, and in the top bar we can find channel icons. We open it and click on red, which makes the footage black and white for a while. Then, we go back to the Inspector, increase Softness Red and Detail Red.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-13.jpg)

This removes much grain from the red channel. Then we repeat the same for green, as well as for blue channel. Once you finish, you go to the same channel button in the bar and change it to “back to color”. So, the footage will have its colors back and you will see that it has become clearer, compared to the first viewer.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-14.jpg)

You can play around with the Chroma and Luma channels in the Inspector, if that is something you have ever had experience with!

* **Movavi Video Editor**

In Movavi Video Editor, it is pretty straightforward – unlike DaVinci Resolve, of course! So, getting to the point: the first thing you need to do is Entering the Edit Mode. In order to achieve it, you’ll need to click the Edit button next to the file you want to adjust or select Adjustments in the Tools tab.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-15.jpg)

After this, you will be able to select the Noise removal option, and then, move the Noise level slider to reflect the amount of noise you can see in the preview. The more noise you need to remove, the higher the Noise level, and vice versa.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-16.jpg)

When you're finished removing the noise, click Apply, but in case you need to remove noise from several files, select Apply to all files, which ensures the same noise level will be applied on all your files there.

Lastly, of course, Wondershare Filmora X offers the same option as well. The steps are ase follows: You need to go to the Effects panel and type: “Smart Denoise”. Then, right-click on the video and choose Edit Properties.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-17.jpg)

This will make sure you go inside the Smart Denoise, where you can change opacity of the clip, threshold and radius.

![denoise-a-video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/denoise-a-video-18.jpg)

You should reduce Opacity until you are satisfied with the result. Then, you can use the box next to Smart Denoise in order to see the scene before and after noise and grain removal.

So, that’s it! – We learned how to remove/reduce noise and grain from the videos, using several video editors. So you might as well start making your video clips look better right away!

## Control Playback Speed in Premiere Pro

##### Versatile Video Editor - Wondershare Filmora

An easy and powerful editor

Numerous effects to choose from

Detailed tutorials are provided by the official channel

[Try It Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [Try It Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

According to the business, Adobe Premiere Pro is one of the most widely used video editing products on the market today. The option to speed up or slow down individual clips is one of the most important capabilities of Premiere Pro.

![Control playback speed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/1-step-by-step-guide-control-playback-speed-in-premiere-pro.png)

In terms of video editing, Adobe Premiere Pro is one of the most powerful applications on the market, and it's well-known for its versatility. Speeding up movies is one of the program's many features required for the insertion of special effects and transitions. A lot of ways are there for you to pick from while using premiere pro to speed up the film as desired.

![speed up the film as desired](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/2-step-by-step-guide-control-playback-speed-in-premiere-pro.png)

You can't overwrite or replace your media files by doing anything in Premiere Pro, which means that nothing you do will have an effect on your media files. The point remains: a copy of your project and all its media assets should always be kept on hand just in case.

Adobe Premiere Pro is an excellent editing tool in terms of its functionality and capabilities. Still, it has a steep hill to climb that makes it difficult for newbies and users without previous editing experience. To get the most out of Adobe Premiere Pro, one must thoroughly understand the product.

![Adobe Premiere Pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/3-step-by-step-guide-control-playback-speed-in-premiere-pro.png)

No need to worry, folks; as in this article, we will be looking at how we can alter premiere pro speed.

## Fast Forward or Speed up Playback Speed in Premiere Pro

On analog editing systems, the speed of film could permanently be altered; but, because of the limitations of the technology, if you slowed anything down too much, the frame rate at which it was taken may become evident, and the image quality would begin to suffer as a consequence.

Adobe Premiere Pro is a feature-rich and professional video editor designed for the Macintosh platform. It has a variety of editing features built-in. Adobe Premiere Pro lets you change and control the speed at which movies are played back.

Premiere provides three choices for adjusting the tempo of a movie or speeding it up. We'll go over them one by one as we scroll down the page.

![Speed up the film in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/4-step-by-step-guide-control-playback-speed-in-premiere-pro.png)

### Method 1

* Download and Install Adobe Premiere Pro. Launch the application on your system.
* Once you've set up a new project in Adobe Premiere Pro, import the video you want to edit.
* In order to place the video where you want it, drag the necessary video clips into the timeline. In the end, you'll have a new series to call your own.
* Using the right-click menu, you may choose the whole movie or only a portion of it that you wish to edit.
* The popup dialog box will display if you choose Speed/Duration from the context menu list.
* Choose Clip> Speed Duration instead from the program's drop-down menu.
* The Speed field should be raised, and then the OK button should be pressed to accept the change.

### Method 2: Rate Stretch Tool

Adobe Premiere Pro has a Rate Stretch feature that lets you manually alter the movie's tempo by sliding the trim bar along the timeline. To utilize the Rate Stretch tool to speed up a video clip, you must first divide the movie into pieces.

Here's a quick method for altering the video speed so that it fits under the time limit:

* Launch the application on your respective systems.
* Drag and drop the selected video onto the timeline in Premiere Pro.
* Then, choose the Ripple Edit Tool from the toolbar, followed by the Rate Stretch Tool by clicking and holding the Ripple Edit Tool. Click the Rate Stretch button on the timeline's left side to begin a timer.
* You may also use the R key on your keyboard to activate the Rate Stretch Tool, which is a shortcut key.
* Drag the video's start and endpoints to their respective ends on the right and left sides to prolong or reduce the duration. As a consequence, the video speed will be improved. The bigger the period of time the video is dragged inwards, the faster it rises.

### Method 3: Time Remapping Tool

In Adobe Premiere Pro, the time remapping tool is where you go to speed up a selected video section. With a video clip, this function may be utilized to create the illusion of speed and slowness.

* It's time to fire up Adobe Premiere Pro and start fiddling with your footage.
* Simply right-click on it to bring up the context menu, and then choose Show Clip Keyframes from the display list. Afterward, choose Time Remapping from the context menu that opens.
* Click on it to make it go faster. The video will be colored blue, and a horizontal rubber band line will be drawn down its center if this option is selected. One of the video's frame rate lines may be found here.
* A white speed-control track may be seen just below the title bar in the upper part of the video. If you can't see it well when zooming in, you may try again. The rubber band may be dragged higher in Premiere Pro to speed up the video.

The tooltip will show how long it has been since the change happened compared to the original speed. As the movie progresses, so does the speed at which it is shown, and the duration of the video fluctuates as well. The audio remains unaltered and tied to the video when using Time Remapping.

## How to Slow Down A Video in Premiere Pro?

Now, let’s discuss how to slow down a video in premiere pro

### Time stretch

A one-second video clip at 60 frames per second is an example of this situation. When the game is being played at a reasonable speed on any given platform or software, 60 frames will be shown. Because of this, each frame will take twice as long to play at a 0.5X slower pace.

To put it another way, you'd see 30 frames in a second that weren't repeated. A second has been added to the video's duration, which will now be 2 seconds instead of 1\. There will be no deterioration in quality in this situation.

* Create a new project in Premiere Pro on your PC.
* To import a video file, choose Import from the File menu at the top of the screen. After that, drag the video into either the timeline or the project panel, whichever you like.
* Right-clicking and choosing the Duration/Speed option causes the video to begin playing.
* This stage necessitates a decrease in speed from 100% to a lower percentage.

### Using Keyframes

When you attempt to slow down a video by adjusting the frame rate, you are essentially eliminating frames from the video stream. This procedure will allow you to slow down a movie to your desired speed without sacrificing quality.

* After downloading and installing Adobe Premiere Pro, the first step is to launch the program. Later, you'll need to choose a specific video that you'd want to have slowed down.
* After you've chosen it, you may upload it to Premiere Pro. After importing the video, you must drag and drop it into the timeline in Premiere.
* By right-clicking the mouse, choose Modify > Interpret from the drop-down menu.
* You'll need to make some changes to the frame information now. Hit the Assume this frame rate button and input a value that is lower than the original video frame rate.

### Utlizing Time Remapping

The remapping tool is a very common tool for creating slow-motion videos. It may be found in many video editing programs. It gives you the option of selecting a particular section of a video clip and then slowing down the video clip.

* Launching Adobe Premiere Pro is the initial step once it has been downloaded and installed on your computer. A particular video that you'd want slow-motioned will need to be selected later on in the process.
* After dragging the video to the timeline, you'll need to choose the area of the movie that you want to slow down.
* Now you must choose the Key Frames and Speed from your video by clicking on the video's right-click menu.
* Only the "Pen Tool" must be used to lock the specific region you wish to slow down in order to push the Speed Line through the Selection tool to slow down the video during this phase.

## Why Is Premiere Pro Playback Fast?

If this issue arises in your program, you'll notice choppy playback, a character that speaks too rapidly, and audio that skips frames in the narration.

The multimedia editor Premiere Pro is one of the best currently available on the market. In addition to creating YouTube videos, feature films, music videos, and other sorts of content, many professionals turn to it.

It is said that Adobe Premiere Pro suffers from a playback issue. It has the ability to make the video creation process more complicated and demanding than it should be. Let me show you how to fix this easy error in just two simple steps.

* Start the program on your computer's operating system.

* Select Edit from the drop-down menu.

* Look towards preference

* Afterward, choose audio hardware.

* No input should be used as the default input, regardless of what it is currently set to.

* When you click on Playback your film, you will notice that the issue has been rectified.

No need to worry, folks; as in this article, we will be looking at how we can alter premiere pro speed.

## Fast Forward or Speed up Playback Speed in Premiere Pro

On analog editing systems, the speed of film could permanently be altered; but, because of the limitations of the technology, if you slowed anything down too much, the frame rate at which it was taken may become evident, and the image quality would begin to suffer as a consequence.

Adobe Premiere Pro is a feature-rich and professional video editor designed for the Macintosh platform. It has a variety of editing features built-in. Adobe Premiere Pro lets you change and control the speed at which movies are played back.

Premiere provides three choices for adjusting the tempo of a movie or speeding it up. We'll go over them one by one as we scroll down the page.

![Speed up the film in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/4-step-by-step-guide-control-playback-speed-in-premiere-pro.png)

### Method 1

* Download and Install Adobe Premiere Pro. Launch the application on your system.
* Once you've set up a new project in Adobe Premiere Pro, import the video you want to edit.
* In order to place the video where you want it, drag the necessary video clips into the timeline. In the end, you'll have a new series to call your own.
* Using the right-click menu, you may choose the whole movie or only a portion of it that you wish to edit.
* The popup dialog box will display if you choose Speed/Duration from the context menu list.
* Choose Clip> Speed Duration instead from the program's drop-down menu.
* The Speed field should be raised, and then the OK button should be pressed to accept the change.

### Method 2: Rate Stretch Tool

Adobe Premiere Pro has a Rate Stretch feature that lets you manually alter the movie's tempo by sliding the trim bar along the timeline. To utilize the Rate Stretch tool to speed up a video clip, you must first divide the movie into pieces.

Here's a quick method for altering the video speed so that it fits under the time limit:

* Launch the application on your respective systems.
* Drag and drop the selected video onto the timeline in Premiere Pro.
* Then, choose the Ripple Edit Tool from the toolbar, followed by the Rate Stretch Tool by clicking and holding the Ripple Edit Tool. Click the Rate Stretch button on the timeline's left side to begin a timer.
* You may also use the R key on your keyboard to activate the Rate Stretch Tool, which is a shortcut key.
* Drag the video's start and endpoints to their respective ends on the right and left sides to prolong or reduce the duration. As a consequence, the video speed will be improved. The bigger the period of time the video is dragged inwards, the faster it rises.

### Method 3: Time Remapping Tool

In Adobe Premiere Pro, the time remapping tool is where you go to speed up a selected video section. With a video clip, this function may be utilized to create the illusion of speed and slowness.

* It's time to fire up Adobe Premiere Pro and start fiddling with your footage.
* Simply right-click on it to bring up the context menu, and then choose Show Clip Keyframes from the display list. Afterward, choose Time Remapping from the context menu that opens.
* Click on it to make it go faster. The video will be colored blue, and a horizontal rubber band line will be drawn down its center if this option is selected. One of the video's frame rate lines may be found here.
* A white speed-control track may be seen just below the title bar in the upper part of the video. If you can't see it well when zooming in, you may try again. The rubber band may be dragged higher in Premiere Pro to speed up the video.

The tooltip will show how long it has been since the change happened compared to the original speed. As the movie progresses, so does the speed at which it is shown, and the duration of the video fluctuates as well. The audio remains unaltered and tied to the video when using Time Remapping.

## How to Slow Down A Video in Premiere Pro?

Now, let’s discuss how to slow down a video in premiere pro

### Time stretch

A one-second video clip at 60 frames per second is an example of this situation. When the game is being played at a reasonable speed on any given platform or software, 60 frames will be shown. Because of this, each frame will take twice as long to play at a 0.5X slower pace.

To put it another way, you'd see 30 frames in a second that weren't repeated. A second has been added to the video's duration, which will now be 2 seconds instead of 1\. There will be no deterioration in quality in this situation.

* Create a new project in Premiere Pro on your PC.
* To import a video file, choose Import from the File menu at the top of the screen. After that, drag the video into either the timeline or the project panel, whichever you like.
* Right-clicking and choosing the Duration/Speed option causes the video to begin playing.
* This stage necessitates a decrease in speed from 100% to a lower percentage.

* After you've chosen it, you may upload it to Premiere Pro. After importing the video, you must drag and drop it into the timeline in Premiere.
* By right-clicking the mouse, choose Modify > Interpret from the drop-down menu.
* You'll need to make some changes to the frame information now. Hit the Assume this frame rate button and input a value that is lower than the original video frame rate.

### Utlizing Time Remapping

The remapping tool is a very common tool for creating slow-motion videos. It may be found in many video editing programs. It gives you the option of selecting a particular section of a video clip and then slowing down the video clip.

* Launching Adobe Premiere Pro is the initial step once it has been downloaded and installed on your computer. A particular video that you'd want slow-motioned will need to be selected later on in the process.
* After dragging the video to the timeline, you'll need to choose the area of the movie that you want to slow down.
* Now you must choose the Key Frames and Speed from your video by clicking on the video's right-click menu.
* Only the "Pen Tool" must be used to lock the specific region you wish to slow down in order to push the Speed Line through the Selection tool to slow down the video during this phase.

If this issue arises in your program, you'll notice choppy playback, a character that speaks too rapidly, and audio that skips frames in the narration.

The multimedia editor Premiere Pro is one of the best currently available on the market. In addition to creating YouTube videos, feature films, music videos, and other sorts of content, many professionals turn to it.

![Adobe Premiere Pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/3-step-by-step-guide-control-playback-speed-in-premiere-pro.png)

No need to worry, folks; as in this article, we will be looking at how we can alter premiere pro speed.

## Fast Forward or Speed up Playback Speed in Premiere Pro

On analog editing systems, the speed of film could permanently be altered; but, because of the limitations of the technology, if you slowed anything down too much, the frame rate at which it was taken may become evident, and the image quality would begin to suffer as a consequence.

Adobe Premiere Pro is a feature-rich and professional video editor designed for the Macintosh platform. It has a variety of editing features built-in. Adobe Premiere Pro lets you change and control the speed at which movies are played back.

Premiere provides three choices for adjusting the tempo of a movie or speeding it up. We'll go over them one by one as we scroll down the page.

![Speed up the film in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/4-step-by-step-guide-control-playback-speed-in-premiere-pro.png)

### Method 1

* Download and Install Adobe Premiere Pro. Launch the application on your system.
* Once you've set up a new project in Adobe Premiere Pro, import the video you want to edit.
* In order to place the video where you want it, drag the necessary video clips into the timeline. In the end, you'll have a new series to call your own.
* Using the right-click menu, you may choose the whole movie or only a portion of it that you wish to edit.
* The popup dialog box will display if you choose Speed/Duration from the context menu list.
* Choose Clip> Speed Duration instead from the program's drop-down menu.
* The Speed field should be raised, and then the OK button should be pressed to accept the change.

### Method 2: Rate Stretch Tool

Adobe Premiere Pro has a Rate Stretch feature that lets you manually alter the movie's tempo by sliding the trim bar along the timeline. To utilize the Rate Stretch tool to speed up a video clip, you must first divide the movie into pieces.

Here's a quick method for altering the video speed so that it fits under the time limit:

* Launch the application on your respective systems.
* Drag and drop the selected video onto the timeline in Premiere Pro.
* Then, choose the Ripple Edit Tool from the toolbar, followed by the Rate Stretch Tool by clicking and holding the Ripple Edit Tool. Click the Rate Stretch button on the timeline's left side to begin a timer.
* You may also use the R key on your keyboard to activate the Rate Stretch Tool, which is a shortcut key.
* Drag the video's start and endpoints to their respective ends on the right and left sides to prolong or reduce the duration. As a consequence, the video speed will be improved. The bigger the period of time the video is dragged inwards, the faster it rises.

### Method 3: Time Remapping Tool

In Adobe Premiere Pro, the time remapping tool is where you go to speed up a selected video section. With a video clip, this function may be utilized to create the illusion of speed and slowness.

* It's time to fire up Adobe Premiere Pro and start fiddling with your footage.
* Simply right-click on it to bring up the context menu, and then choose Show Clip Keyframes from the display list. Afterward, choose Time Remapping from the context menu that opens.
* Click on it to make it go faster. The video will be colored blue, and a horizontal rubber band line will be drawn down its center if this option is selected. One of the video's frame rate lines may be found here.
* A white speed-control track may be seen just below the title bar in the upper part of the video. If you can't see it well when zooming in, you may try again. The rubber band may be dragged higher in Premiere Pro to speed up the video.

The tooltip will show how long it has been since the change happened compared to the original speed. As the movie progresses, so does the speed at which it is shown, and the duration of the video fluctuates as well. The audio remains unaltered and tied to the video when using Time Remapping.

## How to Slow Down A Video in Premiere Pro?

Now, let’s discuss how to slow down a video in premiere pro

### Time stretch

A one-second video clip at 60 frames per second is an example of this situation. When the game is being played at a reasonable speed on any given platform or software, 60 frames will be shown. Because of this, each frame will take twice as long to play at a 0.5X slower pace.

To put it another way, you'd see 30 frames in a second that weren't repeated. A second has been added to the video's duration, which will now be 2 seconds instead of 1\. There will be no deterioration in quality in this situation.

* Create a new project in Premiere Pro on your PC.
* To import a video file, choose Import from the File menu at the top of the screen. After that, drag the video into either the timeline or the project panel, whichever you like.
* Right-clicking and choosing the Duration/Speed option causes the video to begin playing.
* This stage necessitates a decrease in speed from 100% to a lower percentage.

### Using Keyframes

When you attempt to slow down a video by adjusting the frame rate, you are essentially eliminating frames from the video stream. This procedure will allow you to slow down a movie to your desired speed without sacrificing quality.

* After downloading and installing Adobe Premiere Pro, the first step is to launch the program. Later, you'll need to choose a specific video that you'd want to have slowed down.
* After you've chosen it, you may upload it to Premiere Pro. After importing the video, you must drag and drop it into the timeline in Premiere.
* By right-clicking the mouse, choose Modify > Interpret from the drop-down menu.
* You'll need to make some changes to the frame information now. Hit the Assume this frame rate button and input a value that is lower than the original video frame rate.

### Utlizing Time Remapping

The remapping tool is a very common tool for creating slow-motion videos. It may be found in many video editing programs. It gives you the option of selecting a particular section of a video clip and then slowing down the video clip.

* Launching Adobe Premiere Pro is the initial step once it has been downloaded and installed on your computer. A particular video that you'd want slow-motioned will need to be selected later on in the process.
* After dragging the video to the timeline, you'll need to choose the area of the movie that you want to slow down.
* Now you must choose the Key Frames and Speed from your video by clicking on the video's right-click menu.
* Only the "Pen Tool" must be used to lock the specific region you wish to slow down in order to push the Speed Line through the Selection tool to slow down the video during this phase.

## Part 5 Editing Tips to Improve Your Videos

Apart from trimming, you have to edit different other aspects so that you can make the video engaging and eye-catching. Here are some editing tips you should stick to improve your video content.

**Get The Best Video Editor** \- Editing a video is equally important as shooting a video. Once you have the best video editor, you can rest assured that your editing work is half done. This is because you have all the tools to turn your raw video into stunning video. You can experiment and come up with the best editing work to your own surprise.

**Get The Length Correct** \- In today's world, viewers have very less time to watch videos. Therefore, a lengthy and elaborative video is a bummer. Hence, you should trim the video and keep only the portions that are relevant, engaging, and not boring.

**Start with a Bang** \- The first impression is always the most important, and hence, the intro of your video is extremely crucial to keep the attention of the audiences intact. To make the intro interesting, you should not only focus on the content but also on video effects and animations that are attention-grabbing.

**Smooth Cuts and Soothing Colours** \- When you are cutting from one scene or angle to another, the transition should be smooth so that it does not feel abrupt. Therefore, you should cut scenes when the subjects and objects seem to be static so that the transition is smooth naturally. Play attention to colour and the video editors allow you to enhance the quality by adjusting the colors and picture properties.

**Graphical Objects** \- Use graphical objects and animated texts wherever possible for better explanations. Things can get boring visually when you do not add graphical elements, transitions, and animations appropriately in different places. Similarly, the use of texts and titles makes the video more engaging. Instead of static texts, there are animated texts and titles available with stickers and memes that you can edit your video with.

**Play Attention to Sound** \- Sound is the most neglected part of a video by amateur video creators when one should pay attention to it. The sound effects can keep the audiences hooked to your video and make them not get bored. Certain sound effects refresh the attention of the audiences when it starts to fade, and hence, you should place the sound effects wisely.

**Proper Flow** \- The editing work should be smooth so that the flow of the video is smooth and efficient. It takes time, and hence, you can practice and learn video editing so that your video can stand out instantly after your editing touches. Besides, the editing should be such that the video feels like a story that audiences can invest in and get engaged throughout.

## Part 6 How to Share Your Videos

In order to share videos after trimming them, you need to save the video properly. There are different file formats available for video files. For example, MP4 is the most popular video file format among Windows users. On the contrary, MOV is the most popular video file format. Different file formats have different features such as compression and lossless. According to the file format, the file size varies for the same duration of video.

Therefore, the video trimmer you are using must have different file formats for saving and exporting the editing video files. Some video trimmers have in-built features to share videos on social media platforms and upload on video streaming platforms like YouTube. Depending on your target audiences, you need to adjust the parameters like aspect ratio, video resolution, as well as duration. Besides, you can upload videos on cloud storage and share with anyone as per your requirements.

## Part 5 Editing Tips to Improve Your Videos

Apart from trimming, you have to edit different other aspects so that you can make the video engaging and eye-catching. Here are some editing tips you should stick to improve your video content.

**Get The Best Video Editor** \- Editing a video is equally important as shooting a video. Once you have the best video editor, you can rest assured that your editing work is half done. This is because you have all the tools to turn your raw video into stunning video. You can experiment and come up with the best editing work to your own surprise.

**Get The Length Correct** \- In today's world, viewers have very less time to watch videos. Therefore, a lengthy and elaborative video is a bummer. Hence, you should trim the video and keep only the portions that are relevant, engaging, and not boring.

**Start with a Bang** \- The first impression is always the most important, and hence, the intro of your video is extremely crucial to keep the attention of the audiences intact. To make the intro interesting, you should not only focus on the content but also on video effects and animations that are attention-grabbing.

**Smooth Cuts and Soothing Colours** \- When you are cutting from one scene or angle to another, the transition should be smooth so that it does not feel abrupt. Therefore, you should cut scenes when the subjects and objects seem to be static so that the transition is smooth naturally. Play attention to colour and the video editors allow you to enhance the quality by adjusting the colors and picture properties.

**Graphical Objects** \- Use graphical objects and animated texts wherever possible for better explanations. Things can get boring visually when you do not add graphical elements, transitions, and animations appropriately in different places. Similarly, the use of texts and titles makes the video more engaging. Instead of static texts, there are animated texts and titles available with stickers and memes that you can edit your video with.

**Play Attention to Sound** \- Sound is the most neglected part of a video by amateur video creators when one should pay attention to it. The sound effects can keep the audiences hooked to your video and make them not get bored. Certain sound effects refresh the attention of the audiences when it starts to fade, and hence, you should place the sound effects wisely.

**Proper Flow** \- The editing work should be smooth so that the flow of the video is smooth and efficient. It takes time, and hence, you can practice and learn video editing so that your video can stand out instantly after your editing touches. Besides, the editing should be such that the video feels like a story that audiences can invest in and get engaged throughout.

## Part 6 How to Share Your Videos

In order to share videos after trimming them, you need to save the video properly. There are different file formats available for video files. For example, MP4 is the most popular video file format among Windows users. On the contrary, MOV is the most popular video file format. Different file formats have different features such as compression and lossless. According to the file format, the file size varies for the same duration of video.

Therefore, the video trimmer you are using must have different file formats for saving and exporting the editing video files. Some video trimmers have in-built features to share videos on social media platforms and upload on video streaming platforms like YouTube. Depending on your target audiences, you need to adjust the parameters like aspect ratio, video resolution, as well as duration. Besides, you can upload videos on cloud storage and share with anyone as per your requirements.

## Part 5 Editing Tips to Improve Your Videos

Apart from trimming, you have to edit different other aspects so that you can make the video engaging and eye-catching. Here are some editing tips you should stick to improve your video content.

**Get The Best Video Editor** \- Editing a video is equally important as shooting a video. Once you have the best video editor, you can rest assured that your editing work is half done. This is because you have all the tools to turn your raw video into stunning video. You can experiment and come up with the best editing work to your own surprise.

**Get The Length Correct** \- In today's world, viewers have very less time to watch videos. Therefore, a lengthy and elaborative video is a bummer. Hence, you should trim the video and keep only the portions that are relevant, engaging, and not boring.

**Start with a Bang** \- The first impression is always the most important, and hence, the intro of your video is extremely crucial to keep the attention of the audiences intact. To make the intro interesting, you should not only focus on the content but also on video effects and animations that are attention-grabbing.

**Smooth Cuts and Soothing Colours** \- When you are cutting from one scene or angle to another, the transition should be smooth so that it does not feel abrupt. Therefore, you should cut scenes when the subjects and objects seem to be static so that the transition is smooth naturally. Play attention to colour and the video editors allow you to enhance the quality by adjusting the colors and picture properties.

**Graphical Objects** \- Use graphical objects and animated texts wherever possible for better explanations. Things can get boring visually when you do not add graphical elements, transitions, and animations appropriately in different places. Similarly, the use of texts and titles makes the video more engaging. Instead of static texts, there are animated texts and titles available with stickers and memes that you can edit your video with.

**Play Attention to Sound** \- Sound is the most neglected part of a video by amateur video creators when one should pay attention to it. The sound effects can keep the audiences hooked to your video and make them not get bored. Certain sound effects refresh the attention of the audiences when it starts to fade, and hence, you should place the sound effects wisely.

**Proper Flow** \- The editing work should be smooth so that the flow of the video is smooth and efficient. It takes time, and hence, you can practice and learn video editing so that your video can stand out instantly after your editing touches. Besides, the editing should be such that the video feels like a story that audiences can invest in and get engaged throughout.

## Part 6 How to Share Your Videos

In order to share videos after trimming them, you need to save the video properly. There are different file formats available for video files. For example, MP4 is the most popular video file format among Windows users. On the contrary, MOV is the most popular video file format. Different file formats have different features such as compression and lossless. According to the file format, the file size varies for the same duration of video.

Therefore, the video trimmer you are using must have different file formats for saving and exporting the editing video files. Some video trimmers have in-built features to share videos on social media platforms and upload on video streaming platforms like YouTube. Depending on your target audiences, you need to adjust the parameters like aspect ratio, video resolution, as well as duration. Besides, you can upload videos on cloud storage and share with anyone as per your requirements.

## Part 5 Editing Tips to Improve Your Videos

Apart from trimming, you have to edit different other aspects so that you can make the video engaging and eye-catching. Here are some editing tips you should stick to improve your video content.

**Get The Best Video Editor** \- Editing a video is equally important as shooting a video. Once you have the best video editor, you can rest assured that your editing work is half done. This is because you have all the tools to turn your raw video into stunning video. You can experiment and come up with the best editing work to your own surprise.

**Get The Length Correct** \- In today's world, viewers have very less time to watch videos. Therefore, a lengthy and elaborative video is a bummer. Hence, you should trim the video and keep only the portions that are relevant, engaging, and not boring.

**Start with a Bang** \- The first impression is always the most important, and hence, the intro of your video is extremely crucial to keep the attention of the audiences intact. To make the intro interesting, you should not only focus on the content but also on video effects and animations that are attention-grabbing.

**Smooth Cuts and Soothing Colours** \- When you are cutting from one scene or angle to another, the transition should be smooth so that it does not feel abrupt. Therefore, you should cut scenes when the subjects and objects seem to be static so that the transition is smooth naturally. Play attention to colour and the video editors allow you to enhance the quality by adjusting the colors and picture properties.

**Graphical Objects** \- Use graphical objects and animated texts wherever possible for better explanations. Things can get boring visually when you do not add graphical elements, transitions, and animations appropriately in different places. Similarly, the use of texts and titles makes the video more engaging. Instead of static texts, there are animated texts and titles available with stickers and memes that you can edit your video with.

**Play Attention to Sound** \- Sound is the most neglected part of a video by amateur video creators when one should pay attention to it. The sound effects can keep the audiences hooked to your video and make them not get bored. Certain sound effects refresh the attention of the audiences when it starts to fade, and hence, you should place the sound effects wisely.

**Proper Flow** \- The editing work should be smooth so that the flow of the video is smooth and efficient. It takes time, and hence, you can practice and learn video editing so that your video can stand out instantly after your editing touches. Besides, the editing should be such that the video feels like a story that audiences can invest in and get engaged throughout.

## Part 6 How to Share Your Videos

In order to share videos after trimming them, you need to save the video properly. There are different file formats available for video files. For example, MP4 is the most popular video file format among Windows users. On the contrary, MOV is the most popular video file format. Different file formats have different features such as compression and lossless. According to the file format, the file size varies for the same duration of video.

Therefore, the video trimmer you are using must have different file formats for saving and exporting the editing video files. Some video trimmers have in-built features to share videos on social media platforms and upload on video streaming platforms like YouTube. Depending on your target audiences, you need to adjust the parameters like aspect ratio, video resolution, as well as duration. Besides, you can upload videos on cloud storage and share with anyone as per your requirements.
