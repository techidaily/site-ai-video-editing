#### • To ensure uniformity across different devices

You will use a calibration color lut to ensure a similar video quality across different TV monitors whether it is HD, UHD, or 4K. Similarly, you can use a transformation colour lut to add a cinematic effect to your film to make it appear as if your audience is viewing it in a theatre.

Camera manufacturers use different color luts to diversify their products according to their target markets. For example, you get a different lut color grading from a Sony camera as you would in a Canon.
