## Part 1  Principles for Great GIF Design

Creating GIFs for infotainment or casual information sharing is the current talk of the trend. You might have visibly landed across a heap of tantalizing GIFs in blogs, social media posts, product promotion websites and almost every other domain you can possibly think of. Using GIFs for any type of content promotion is bound to captivate the target audience in impressive multiplicities. Ever wondered what’s the cue behind the mass appeal that GIFs create? Well, an obvious answer is the stunning **GIF design**.

When going for GIF creation and selection, design plays the key role in creating considerable buzz about the information being transmitted. To add impact to your creation, you need to pay considerable attention to its design implications, thus ensuring that the right things get presented in the right way. Outlined below are some amazing principles you can use to enhance your GIF design to the next level:

### 01Ensure Accuracy and Preciseness

The primary concern you need to be attentive about while designing a GIF is its preciseness. Ensure ban exactness of information and confine your creation to the theme and requirement of your creation, like, the message you want to deliver or the impact you want to create through the GIF. Balance your creativity within specific content parameters and avoid getting carried away or overdoing on the beautifying aspect.

As an example, it is visibly not appealing to add a wholesome mix of 15 shades and 20 different elements in a nature-based GIF. You will end up getting too harsh on the viewers’ eyes, confusing them with a hoard of speeding elements and banging colors. You can instead stick to 2 or 3 frames with an intelligent mix of 2 complementary shades.

### 02Maintain Visual Identity

An important aspect to keep in mind while attempting to **design GIF** is, it should visually relate to the underlying content. For instance, if you are intending a brand promotion through your GIF, lay stress on adding elements like, brand definition, product specifications, know-how of your work patterns, etc. ensure that your content flows naturally and has exactness.

Other alternatives are, using your product logo as the GIF background, character representation of your brand or using some explicit product oriented themes. While, you are free to pick anything that suits your preferences and needs, just make sure that using it in your GIF adds value to your brand instead of giving an out of the box feel.

![GIF Design- Visual Identity Principle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/The-only-guide-you%E2%80%99ll-ever-need-to-learn-gif-design-that-get-shared-like-crazy-1.JPG)

### 03Cut Down on Unnecessary Frames

Have you ever encountered a halt in the natural loop of your GIF out of nowhere? While pondering over the underlying cause, it is a common assumption to take this as an animation fallacy, but that’s evidently not the case. The actual culprits behind this glitch are those extra frames that contribute towards nothing but adding weight to an already heavy file.

To set this straight, you should switch to removing any extra frames, while saving a particular one which you may stretch to a desired duration according to the break point of your contents in the GIF. However, take caution to maintain the visual quality of your GIF while you remove those extra frames.

### 04Make Your GIF Accessible

You should always adhere to the concern of accessibility while creating a GIF. The reason being, your content is visibly going to get mass attention across the web and you cannot filter out visitors, make sure your GIF is easily accessible to all kind of users, particularly those with vision limitations, like, epileptic patients or the ones using screen readers.

Focus on describing your GIF content with alt text and using a limited blinking and flashing rate. In case your GIF content is primarily text based, take care to limit the effective color and image movement and adjust the frames rates to avoid constant and quick movement of image frames when adding many clips on a single page.

Pay additional heed to the auto play feature of your GIFs. It can be visibly annoying to be welcomed on a site homepage with GIFs enjoying an auto play session of their own. You can alternatively, incorporate a ‘Click to Play’ option or grant your site visitors the liberty to decide on what is to be played when.

### 05Use Storyboards

When aiming to create visibly appealing GIFs, you need to lay considerable stress on choosing an apt background story. Don’t get misled by the wrong assumption of using any random background, owing to the short play duration of GIFs. An impressive solution to this concern is taking the help of a storyboard to keep track of your GIF’s content flow.

Using a storyboard is quite effective means of being in line with the direction of content movement, rescuing you from the hustle of going off the track. This comes explicitly handy when you are working with a team of creators. The storyboard is there to keep everything at the exact place, thus improving member communications and boosting up the design process.

![GIF Design- Storyboard Usage Principle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/The-only-guide-you%E2%80%99ll-ever-need-to-learn-gif-design-that-get-shared-like-crazy-3.JPG)

### 06Focus on Creating Loops

Consider creating an animated motion loop for your GIF allowing a repeated and comprehensive view of your content. Looping projects a deeper observation of the clip and its contents in a seamless transition. However, creating an infinite motion loop in GIFs is quite tricky, as you need to pay utmost concern to ensure a smooth content flow and chances of even the slightest errors are not entertained.

Any loopholes in placement of your GIF elements will get noticed within a blink and lead to an unsatisfactory user experience. Hence, you need to check each of your content frames separately to eliminate chances of possible errors. If you are a beginner, try working with geometrical animations to get the initial pickup. This will be advantageous in deciding the exact element positions at the start and end of the GIF.

### 07Make Use of Motion Blur

Using the concept of motion blur is pivotal in providing a natural flow and feel to your GIF, which, in an otherwise case would ordinarily appear as a mere collection of static images clubbed together. This would give a wobbling feel with unsteady frame movements to your viewers. The motion blur effect potentially ensures a smooth content flow, and your GIF looks like a short video captured from a camera.

### 08Stick to a Reduced File Size

Creating GIF of within a standard size range is quite difficult, owing to the fact that these are shared across a variety of media platforms, each having a different file size constraint. It is, however, recommended to stick to a file size as low as possible to escape the notch of modifying the same, ener5y time you need to work with the GIF on a different platform.

Listed below are a few ways to limit your GIF to a lower file size:

**●** Restrict your GIF to a frame count under 150, exceeding which, it will get difficult to export the GIF to most of the commonly visited social media and content sharing platforms.

**●** When your GIF is ready to export, adjust its lossy parameter between 5 and 10 to boost the file compression rate. Look for a setting that decreases the effective file size without compromising with the overall **GIF design.**

**●** Restrict to a minimum possible color usage. This will not only intensify the **GIF design**, but also contribute in maintaining a decreased file size. You can instead, focus on playing with animations or adjusting your image frames to longer play durations.

**●** Don’t experiment with multiple background gradients in your GIF. You can select from either a completely opaque, or a totally transparent background. Adding unnecessary gradients will end up giving your GIF a hazy look, along with a visibly large file that will be difficult to export non any platform.

## Part 2  Amazing Examples of Animated Gifs in Web Design

You can alternatively, incorporate a ‘Click to Play’ option or grant your site visitors the liberty to decide on what is to be played when.

01 [8 Principles for Great GIF Design](#Part 1)

02 [6 Amazing Examples of Animated Gifs in Web Design](#Part 2)

03 [Learn How to Create and Add Gifs to Interactive Layouts in Filmora](#Part 3)

## Part 1  Principles for Great GIF Design

Creating GIFs for infotainment or casual information sharing is the current talk of the trend. You might have visibly landed across a heap of tantalizing GIFs in blogs, social media posts, product promotion websites and almost every other domain you can possibly think of. Using GIFs for any type of content promotion is bound to captivate the target audience in impressive multiplicities. Ever wondered what’s the cue behind the mass appeal that GIFs create? Well, an obvious answer is the stunning **GIF design**.

When going for GIF creation and selection, design plays the key role in creating considerable buzz about the information being transmitted. To add impact to your creation, you need to pay considerable attention to its design implications, thus ensuring that the right things get presented in the right way. Outlined below are some amazing principles you can use to enhance your GIF design to the next level:

### 01Ensure Accuracy and Preciseness

The primary concern you need to be attentive about while designing a GIF is its preciseness. Ensure ban exactness of information and confine your creation to the theme and requirement of your creation, like, the message you want to deliver or the impact you want to create through the GIF. Balance your creativity within specific content parameters and avoid getting carried away or overdoing on the beautifying aspect.

As an example, it is visibly not appealing to add a wholesome mix of 15 shades and 20 different elements in a nature-based GIF. You will end up getting too harsh on the viewers’ eyes, confusing them with a hoard of speeding elements and banging colors. You can instead stick to 2 or 3 frames with an intelligent mix of 2 complementary shades.

### 02Maintain Visual Identity

An important aspect to keep in mind while attempting to **design GIF** is, it should visually relate to the underlying content. For instance, if you are intending a brand promotion through your GIF, lay stress on adding elements like, brand definition, product specifications, know-how of your work patterns, etc. ensure that your content flows naturally and has exactness.

Other alternatives are, using your product logo as the GIF background, character representation of your brand or using some explicit product oriented themes. While, you are free to pick anything that suits your preferences and needs, just make sure that using it in your GIF adds value to your brand instead of giving an out of the box feel.

### 03Cut Down on Unnecessary Frames

Have you ever encountered a halt in the natural loop of your GIF out of nowhere? While pondering over the underlying cause, it is a common assumption to take this as an animation fallacy, but that’s evidently not the case. The actual culprits behind this glitch are those extra frames that contribute towards nothing but adding weight to an already heavy file.

To set this straight, you should switch to removing any extra frames, while saving a particular one which you may stretch to a desired duration according to the break point of your contents in the GIF. However, take caution to maintain the visual quality of your GIF while you remove those extra frames.

### 04Make Your GIF Accessible

You should always adhere to the concern of accessibility while creating a GIF. The reason being, your content is visibly going to get mass attention across the web and you cannot filter out visitors, make sure your GIF is easily accessible to all kind of users, particularly those with vision limitations, like, epileptic patients or the ones using screen readers.

Focus on describing your GIF content with alt text and using a limited blinking and flashing rate. In case your GIF content is primarily text based, take care to limit the effective color and image movement and adjust the frames rates to avoid constant and quick movement of image frames when adding many clips on a single page.

Pay additional heed to the auto play feature of your GIFs. It can be visibly annoying to be welcomed on a site homepage with GIFs enjoying an auto play session of their own. You can alternatively, incorporate a ‘Click to Play’ option or grant your site visitors the liberty to decide on what is to be played when.

03 [Learn How to Create and Add Gifs to Interactive Layouts in Filmora](#Part 3)

## Part 1  Principles for Great GIF Design

Creating GIFs for infotainment or casual information sharing is the current talk of the trend. You might have visibly landed across a heap of tantalizing GIFs in blogs, social media posts, product promotion websites and almost every other domain you can possibly think of. Using GIFs for any type of content promotion is bound to captivate the target audience in impressive multiplicities. Ever wondered what’s the cue behind the mass appeal that GIFs create? Well, an obvious answer is the stunning **GIF design**.

When going for GIF creation and selection, design plays the key role in creating considerable buzz about the information being transmitted. To add impact to your creation, you need to pay considerable attention to its design implications, thus ensuring that the right things get presented in the right way. Outlined below are some amazing principles you can use to enhance your GIF design to the next level:

### 01Ensure Accuracy and Preciseness

The primary concern you need to be attentive about while designing a GIF is its preciseness. Ensure ban exactness of information and confine your creation to the theme and requirement of your creation, like, the message you want to deliver or the impact you want to create through the GIF. Balance your creativity within specific content parameters and avoid getting carried away or overdoing on the beautifying aspect.

As an example, it is visibly not appealing to add a wholesome mix of 15 shades and 20 different elements in a nature-based GIF. You will end up getting too harsh on the viewers’ eyes, confusing them with a hoard of speeding elements and banging colors. You can instead stick to 2 or 3 frames with an intelligent mix of 2 complementary shades.

### 02Maintain Visual Identity

An important aspect to keep in mind while attempting to **design GIF** is, it should visually relate to the underlying content. For instance, if you are intending a brand promotion through your GIF, lay stress on adding elements like, brand definition, product specifications, know-how of your work patterns, etc. ensure that your content flows naturally and has exactness.

Other alternatives are, using your product logo as the GIF background, character representation of your brand or using some explicit product oriented themes. While, you are free to pick anything that suits your preferences and needs, just make sure that using it in your GIF adds value to your brand instead of giving an out of the box feel.

![GIF Design- Visual Identity Principle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/The-only-guide-you%E2%80%99ll-ever-need-to-learn-gif-design-that-get-shared-like-crazy-1.JPG)

### 03Cut Down on Unnecessary Frames

Have you ever encountered a halt in the natural loop of your GIF out of nowhere? While pondering over the underlying cause, it is a common assumption to take this as an animation fallacy, but that’s evidently not the case. The actual culprits behind this glitch are those extra frames that contribute towards nothing but adding weight to an already heavy file.

To set this straight, you should switch to removing any extra frames, while saving a particular one which you may stretch to a desired duration according to the break point of your contents in the GIF. However, take caution to maintain the visual quality of your GIF while you remove those extra frames.

### 04Make Your GIF Accessible

You should always adhere to the concern of accessibility while creating a GIF. The reason being, your content is visibly going to get mass attention across the web and you cannot filter out visitors, make sure your GIF is easily accessible to all kind of users, particularly those with vision limitations, like, epileptic patients or the ones using screen readers.

Focus on describing your GIF content with alt text and using a limited blinking and flashing rate. In case your GIF content is primarily text based, take care to limit the effective color and image movement and adjust the frames rates to avoid constant and quick movement of image frames when adding many clips on a single page.

Pay additional heed to the auto play feature of your GIFs. It can be visibly annoying to be welcomed on a site homepage with GIFs enjoying an auto play session of their own. You can alternatively, incorporate a ‘Click to Play’ option or grant your site visitors the liberty to decide on what is to be played when.

![GIF Design- Easy GIF Access Principle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/The-only-guide-you%E2%80%99ll-ever-need-to-learn-gif-design-that-get-shared-like-crazy-2.JPG)

### 05Use Storyboards

When aiming to create visibly appealing GIFs, you need to lay considerable stress on choosing an apt background story. Don’t get misled by the wrong assumption of using any random background, owing to the short play duration of GIFs. An impressive solution to this concern is taking the help of a storyboard to keep track of your GIF’s content flow.

Using a storyboard is quite effective means of being in line with the direction of content movement, rescuing you from the hustle of going off the track. This comes explicitly handy when you are working with a team of creators. The storyboard is there to keep everything at the exact place, thus improving member communications and boosting up the design process.

![GIF Design- Storyboard Usage Principle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/The-only-guide-you%E2%80%99ll-ever-need-to-learn-gif-design-that-get-shared-like-crazy-3.JPG)

### 06Focus on Creating Loops

Consider creating an animated motion loop for your GIF allowing a repeated and comprehensive view of your content. Looping projects a deeper observation of the clip and its contents in a seamless transition. However, creating an infinite motion loop in GIFs is quite tricky, as you need to pay utmost concern to ensure a smooth content flow and chances of even the slightest errors are not entertained.

Any loopholes in placement of your GIF elements will get noticed within a blink and lead to an unsatisfactory user experience. Hence, you need to check each of your content frames separately to eliminate chances of possible errors. If you are a beginner, try working with geometrical animations to get the initial pickup. This will be advantageous in deciding the exact element positions at the start and end of the GIF.

![GIF Design- Loop Creation Principle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/The-only-guide-you%E2%80%99ll-ever-need-to-learn-gif-design-that-get-shared-like-crazy-4.JPG)

### 07Make Use of Motion Blur

Using the concept of motion blur is pivotal in providing a natural flow and feel to your GIF, which, in an otherwise case would ordinarily appear as a mere collection of static images clubbed together. This would give a wobbling feel with unsteady frame movements to your viewers. The motion blur effect potentially ensures a smooth content flow, and your GIF looks like a short video captured from a camera.

![GIF Design- Motion Blur Principle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/The-only-guide-you%E2%80%99ll-ever-need-to-learn-gif-design-that-get-shared-like-crazy-5.JPG)

### 08Stick to a Reduced File Size

Creating GIF of within a standard size range is quite difficult, owing to the fact that these are shared across a variety of media platforms, each having a different file size constraint. It is, however, recommended to stick to a file size as low as possible to escape the notch of modifying the same, ener5y time you need to work with the GIF on a different platform.

Listed below are a few ways to limit your GIF to a lower file size:

**●** Restrict your GIF to a frame count under 150, exceeding which, it will get difficult to export the GIF to most of the commonly visited social media and content sharing platforms.

**●** When your GIF is ready to export, adjust its lossy parameter between 5 and 10 to boost the file compression rate. Look for a setting that decreases the effective file size without compromising with the overall **GIF design.**

**●** Restrict to a minimum possible color usage. This will not only intensify the **GIF design**, but also contribute in maintaining a decreased file size. You can instead, focus on playing with animations or adjusting your image frames to longer play durations.

**●** Don’t experiment with multiple background gradients in your GIF. You can select from either a completely opaque, or a totally transparent background. Adding unnecessary gradients will end up giving your GIF a hazy look, along with a visibly large file that will be difficult to export non any platform.

## Best Tips for Better Event Videography

There is no doubt that if you have an upcoming corporate event, you will want to record it using professional

corporate event video production. This is something that can't be stressed enough. Providing video footage of events is an excellent method to raise people's awareness of your brand, as well as interest in and enthusiasm for the work that your firm does.

Let's start!

![event videography](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/event-videography.jpg)

## 1\. A quality corporate event video represents your business

People who are watching your corporate event video aren't just learning about who your company is and what your company does. They're also learning about your commitment to quality. If your event video looks like it was shot off the cuff by an employee on someone's phone, people may assume you take that kind of approach to your business and service to your customers.

You don't, but it's an easy assumption to make. A professionally shot, high-quality video signals to viewers that your company appreciates quality and seeks it out in everything they do. It also shows your attention to detail and what they can expect when they choose your business to handle their own occasions or services.

## 2\. A professional videographer is capable of editing

Videoing your corporate event is about more than just filming, it's knowing how to cut the event together, how to mix the shots and the sound, and add music and any subtle effects or graphics that will make the video really shine. There is a lot that goes into post-production that an amateur simply cannot replicate.

Editing your video without the benefit of a dedicated studio with years of experience just won't have the same

effect when it comes to amplifying the energy and mission of your event. It also will not show the level of detail that your video could contain if a professional corporate event video production company did it.

## 3\. A professional video is completed on schedule

It can take longer than you anticipate if you opt to handle your corporate or conference videos yourself or

delegate the task to one of your workers. Without a lot of post-production knowledge, it could take a lot of trial and error to put your material together in a way that produces the desired outcome.

If you're trying to summarize an event and demonstrate to stakeholders or customers how effective it was, you might not have time for that. Even though unforeseen issues might always arise, if you and a competent

videographer agree on a finish date, they will be able to deliver. This is crucial if you want to utilize your video

to promote a recent event or for marketing purposes.

## 4\. A skilled videographer avoids interference

A skilled videographer is trained to film an event without getting in the way, so things can keep going as usual.

If you're not used to doing professional videography, you might not realize you're bothering your guests and

messing up the event while you're trying to film it. This can turn people off and hurt your finished product, as

well as the success of your event. If your occasion is streamed online, you don't want the videographer to get in the way or become visible in the frame your live show.

## 5\. A video that is done well tells a story

Companies with experience creating videos do more than just capture actions digitally, they also find the story

in the event they are recording and use their videography skills to tell that story. This storyline is defined in

what they choose to shoot, when they shoot it and how they edit it all together. It's that storyline that is going

to capture the attention from the audience and give your video the desired impact.

It's also going to stir up emotions and passion in your audience, creating momentum in your company and with your customers that will last until your next event. Remember that any video you share with your customers or employees is a video marketing exercise that helps you build brand awareness. Let your corporate event video reflect positively on your business.

## 6\. A videographer has a shot list

It is not enough to simply create a list; you must also put it to good use. The idea that you should plan your shot and then execute your plan is a fundamental element of production. Create a strategy and put it into action since your videographer will be knowing his job to adhere to this concept regardless of whether or not they are aware of it.

Also, get things you may or may not need for editing. It is usually excellent practice to use some B roll audio

and video, in addition to establishing shots, no matter what kind of event you are filming, be it a wedding or a business function. If you anticipate that it will be overly crowded during the event, take your creative shoton a pleasant day that occurs before the main event.

## Conclusion

We sincerely hope that some of these pointers will be of assistance to you as you navigate the area of special

events videos. Whether you are able to employ all of them or not will depend on your client, the event, and

your own workflow; nonetheless, the takeaway from this anecdote is that you should be prepared for the

worst-case scenario and find that you are better equipped to offer the best possible results. There won't be

many situations that you won't be able to manage with grace and professionally if you have the ability to

remain calm, cool, and professional.
