## Part 1\. What Is Camera Tracking

Camera Tracking is a process that determines the movement of a video clip. This information can be used to add certain effects to the video, such as objects that seem to follow the camera or text that appears to be stationary in the frame.

Camera Tracking is a relatively simple process, but it can be time-consuming. However, the results are often worth the effort, as it can add a whole new level of realism to your footage clips.

For example, you have taken a video clip of a zoo and want to add an object to it while making sure it gives a realistic look. This is where the **Camera Tracking** feature can help you make a smooth transition and add the element as if it was there.

## Part 2\. Why Use Camera Tracking?

Now that you know what Camera Tracking is, let's have a look at some benefits of using it:

* Add a 3D object or element to a 2D video clip.
* Embed objects, texts, etc., to a video.
* Stabilize a shaky camera/video clip.
* Create special effects.
* Apply color grading.
* Replace a TV or PC screen with some information.

Thus, if you need some basic compositions or advanced ones, the Camera Tracking feature will help you track your videos, embed anything you want, or create special effects to make your clip different.

## Part 3\. Motion Tracking In After Effects

The Motion Tracking capability is Adobe After Effects' feature that allows you to track the movement of the camera/an object in a video clip and use the data to add effects to objects.

Motion tracking can be used for various effects, like creating realistic text animations or adding special effects to objects in a video.

There are four main types of Motion Tracking in After Effects, each with its own advantages and disadvantages:

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Single Point Tracking

Single Point tracking tracks a single position in a video clip. You can use it for composing a video clip with a single point of focus, and it is suitable for following the movement of an object with right-left or up-down motion.

**Advantage:** Single Point Tracking is perfect for tracking a single position or motion of a single object.

**Disadvantage:** No scale or rotation properties and needs a clear contrast point for effective results.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Two Point Tracking

Two Point Tracking is a feature that allows you to track two points in a footage clip and can be used for scale, motion, and rotation tracking.

**Advantage:** Two Point Tracking can track scale and rotation along with the motion.

**Disadvantage:** It doesn't give effective results with a shaky video clip.

### Four Point Tracking

The Four Point Tracking feature lets you track four different points (corners) in your footage and apply the tracking data to a layer in your composition.

The four points can be placed at the screen's corners in your shot, and new footage is applied to cover the screen.

**Advantage:** Directly pins the data to each corner of the image.

**Disadvantage:** Cannot be used to create a 3D object.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 3D Camera Tracking

With 3D camera tracking, you can track the movement of a camera in a video and place 3D elements in the scene that match the camera's movement. This is a great way to add realism to your graphics and make them look like they're part of the scene.

**Advantage:** 3D Camera Tracking can help you add shapes, texts, or 3D objects to 2D footage.

**Disadvantage:** A bit tricky and needs an expert grip on the tool to use effectively.

## Part 4\. How To Use 3D Camera Tracking In After Effects Of Windows

Here's a simple and quick rundown of how to use 3D camera tracking in After Effects:

##### Step1Import Your Video Footage

**Note:** The dots that appear on your video clips cannot be rendered out, as they are strictly referential.

![the referential dots on the video footage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/the-referential-dots-on-the-video-footage.png)

##### Step2Establish The Tracking Points

You have to select the tracking points and a plane to which it must be tracked. To do this, hover over the tracking point references in the **After Effect compositions window**. Between the three tracking points, a triangle will form, and a red **"target"** will appear to help you better visualize the plane.

Now, you have to find a **tracking point** that lays the red **"target"** parallel to your selected plane. Next, select the triangle that lines up best for your surface. Move the **arrow** away to disable the picker and stop the red **"target."**

## Part 1\. Create a new composition

It's possible that you only want to show the minutes and seconds. Make a mask around the entire area you intend to use in order to quickly remove undesired information.

1\. Create a new Text Layer.

2\. Alt + Click (on a PC) or Option + Click (on a Mac) on the stopwatch in the Source Text to display text options.

3\. Place the expression “timeToCurrentFormat” within the expression box (). You must set your composition frame rate to 60 frames per second in order to make it appear to be a real digital countdown timer.

4\. Everything should be pre-composed, and the composition's tempo should be reversed to make it count down. Right-click the composition and choose Time > Time Reverse Layer to change its pace.

![create new text countdown video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/create-new-text-countdown-video.jpg)

## Part 2\. Using the timecode plugin

To make a countdown timer, you can use the Timecode plugin rather than the "timeToCurrentFormat()" statement. The timer layout will be immediately created when the plugin is added to a New Solid; use the same steps as before to convert it to a countdown timer.

Here is a quick video that demonstrates how simple it is to set up a countdown timer in this manner:

Step1 Ctrl-click (Windows) or Command-click (Mac OS) the time display to cycle through Timecode Base or Frames/Feet + Frames (depending on whether the "Use Feet + Frames" option is checked in the Project Settings). The Timeline panel's upper-left corner, as well as the bottoms of the Layer, Composition, and Footage panels, all indicate the current time. Timeline panel (See.)

Step2 A smaller text version of the option that is not selected in the project settings will be seen underneath. Do the following to limit the display to the Timecode or Frames option that was chosen in the Project Settings:

Step3 Choose After Effects > Preferences > Display (Mac OS) or Edit > Preferences > Display to access the display preferences window (Windows). Remove the check mark next to "Show Timecode and Frames in Timeline Panel" (this option is selected by default).

Step4 Change the time display units by selecting File > Project Settings and then selecting a different choice from the list in the Time Display Style section.

Timecode:

Displays the current time as timecode in the time rulers of the Timeline, Layer, and Footage panels. You have the option of utilizing the timecode from the source media (Use Media Source) or beginning at 00:00:00:00\. To use timecode rather than frames, select the Timecode option from the menu. It is important to take note that there are no options available for changing the frame rate or whether or not to delete frames, as the source timecode is recognized and used instead.

![customize timecode countdown video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/customize-timecode-countdown-video.jpg)

## Part 3\. Source timecode

Support for various file formats for the source timecode QuickTime, DV, AVI, P2, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, H.264, AVCHD, RED, XDCAM EX, XDCAM HD, and WAV image sequence importers are just some of the formats that After Effects is able to read and apply timecode for.

Project panel

The Project panel includes several columns that display the source timecode. These columns are titled as follows: Media Start, Media End, Media Duration, and Tape Name. These are the beginning, ending, and overall length of time for the source. There are columns labeled "In," "Out," and "Duration," which reflect the In and Out points that the user has set in the Footage panel for the footage item or the work area for the composition, respectively. These columns also show the duration of the clip.

Context of the Project

The source timecode feature set can be found in the dialog box that is used to configure the Project. Check out the Options for Time Display Units page for more information.

Box for Configuring Composition Settings

The source timecode feature set is located in the dialog box that is called Composition Settings.

Box for Specifying Preferences

The Import section of the Preferences dialog box is capable of handling source timecode functions.
