### Solution 2: Delete Media Cache Files

In Premiere Pro, the Media cache is a temporary storage space that keeps copies of files. It allows you to access the files faster and cause a good playback. If these media caches use hefty hard disk space, then to enhance playback performance.

To do so, open the Premiere Pro and go to the “Preferences” menu. From the list, select “Media Cache.” Now browse to select the media and tap on the “Delete Unused” next to the “Delete Unused Media Cache Files. After choosing the option to delete cache files, click on “OK and the files will be removed.

### Solution 3: Optimize Rendering for Performance

If **Premiere Pro slow playback** still exists, then use this method to fix it. Set the optimized rendering to fix the performance of playback. Press the "Edit" option from the top toolbar and choose the "Preferences." Then, navigate toward "Memory" and find a pop-up window.

![optimize rendering for performance slow playback](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/resolve-premiere-pro-slow-playback-issue-3.jpg)

### Solution 4: Close Unnecessary Applications

Sometimes, lagging in playback occurs when you work on multiple applications. The system gets burdened and might slow down every process at that time. For a quick and effective solution, you should close the other tabs immediately. Only Adobe Premiere Pro and your file manager can remain open for continuous playback.

![close unnecessary applications, slow playback](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/resolve-premiere-pro-slow-playback-issue-4.jpg)

### Solution 6: Change Playback Resolution

Due to the higher resolution of videos, playback lagging occurs. It has a quick solution: changing the playback resolution to a lower rate. For this purpose, go to "Settings" at the top right and choose the “Dynamic Quality” option. Select a lower resolution, like 1:2 or lower. You should look for options that can reduce resolution from the original resolution of the clip.

![change playback resolution slow playback](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/resolve-premiere-pro-slow-playback-issue-6.jpg)

### Solution 7: Use Proxy Videos in Adobe

Proxy videos are proxy files that are compressed versions of original projects. They help users edit heavy and lengthy videos with any **Premiere Playback slow**. In your project panel, select your video and right-click on it. From the list, choose “Proxy” and explore “Create Proxies.”

Now, pick the "Codec" option from another window and tap "QuickTime." Specify a location for proxies and try to keep them in a new folder with the original media. Lastly, click "OK," and Adobe Media Encoder will instantly produce video proxies.

### Solution 8: Mute FX Effects

The working size of video files gets increased with visual and audio effects. If your videos are still lagging in playbacks, then head to mute those effects to fix this issue. From the playback toolbar, choose the "fx" button. Alternatively, click on the "+" icon at the top right side of Program Monitor. Drag it to the button panel and press the “fx” button to toggle it “Off.”
