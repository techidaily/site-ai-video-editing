## Part 1: How To Perform Slow Motion on Adobe Premiere Pro?

[Adobe Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html) offers an advanced user interface to perform complex functions. It contains a wide range of features supporting non-destructive video editing. Its auto-correct feature lets you adjust the color patterns of the video in a smart way. Moreover, it contains a comparison view to analyze the before and after visual effects. You can also add adjustment layers in the timeline to change many clips at once.

On Premiere Pro, you can also connect third-party plugins for more features. It also supports many professional-grade formats to offer flexibility for video editors. Among other features, it can also apply slow-motion effects to the video. To make **Premiere Pro slow-motion effects**, you can use the following steps:

**Step 1:** On Premiere Pro, upload the video in which you want to create a slow-motion effect. To proceed, drag it to the timeline with your cursor. At the start of the timeline, right-click on the small icon saying FX on the left side. From there, select “Time Remapping” and then “Speed.”

![access speed settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/best-slow-motion-effect-in-premiere-pro-1.jpg)

**Step 2:** Now, add the keyframe where you want to begin and end the slow-motion effect. To do so, press “CTRL + Click” on the timeline. To add a ramp, click on the added keyframes and drag them a little to the right side.
