## Part 4: What's The Alternative to Twitch for Creators?

### 1\. YouTube Gaming

Well, even though YouTube Gaming lacks in-game overlays, it offers other features. The platform offers live gaming broadcasts, channels, chat rooms and more. Here the viewers don't need to subscribe to watch the content.

### 2\. Smashcast

If you are a gaming fan, you must have heard about Hitbox and Azubu. They came together to form Smashcast. This provides the users with perfect JavaScript and HTML integration. If you are a gaming partner, esports team, viewer, organizer or streamer, then this platform will be an excellent option for you. Compared to Twitch, Smashcast offers better quality esports streams.

### 3\. Facebook Gaming

![upload video to twitch](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/upload-video-to-twitch-4.jpg)

Besides, it offers some amazing features, such as different monetization options, interactive live-streaming, simple streaming setup, stream analytics and more.

### 4\. DLive

While YouTube and Twitch have some high bars for monetization, they don't offer sufficient profit to the creators. DLive is here to solve that issue. This platform rewards content creators as well as viewers. It charges a flat fee and takes around 20 percent of total revenue. On the other hand, viewers also get rewards for their engagement.

### 5\. Ustream

Birthdays come only once a year, and at this time of the year, we want to make our loved ones feel special and loved by praying for them, wishing them well, getting them presents, throwing parties, and other stuff people do to celebrate birthdays.

## Part 1 **What You Should Put in A Birthday Slideshow**

A **birthday slideshow** combines several images in a chosen software program. But it is not the only thing that makes a fantastic **birthday photo slideshow.** This amazing slideshow doesn't have to be just photos, and you can also create a **birthday wishes slideshow**. For a lasting impression on the celebrant, consider adding these when you **create a birthday slideshow.** A birthday slideshow should have the following:

**●** Background music

Lighten up your video with some background music. A slideshow just displaying photos without music isn't a good idea.

**●** Meaningful Quotes and greetings

You can spice up the birthday video by adding greetings, quotes, and well wishes to let the celebrant know you want to them feel fantastic.

**●** Make the video personal

Add a personal touch to the clip by adding things that matter to the celebrant, whether pictures of them taken while performing a hobby or a favorite place. You can also use photos of their achievements from the time of their last birthday to the present one.

**●** Keep it short and simple

You don't want to drag your audience with too many photos. I think the video would have the most impact when it is short, to the point, and keeps the viewers longing for more.
