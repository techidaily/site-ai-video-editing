## 5\. Typito Time Lapse Maker

Typito Time Lapse Maker is a tool that allows you to create videos with a timelapse effect. It is easy to use, and the interface is extremely simple. The first step is to select your video source and output format. You can choose from several different video formats, including MP4, MOV, and AVI.

Next, you'll be prompted to select what you want your video to do. You have the option of creating a looping video or not it's up to you! Once you've made your choices, you will be taken to the final step: entering text into the text editor for your video. This is where you can add captions or text overlays to spice up your video's storyline.

Move to steps to create a lapse video online:

##### Step1 Create an account and make a video

Firstly, create an account on Typito and once you are done with the creation of the account click on the "Create Video" button in the middle of the screen. The video creation tool will begin loading, so please be patient!
