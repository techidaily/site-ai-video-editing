* [Bonus Part: Wondershare Filmora – The Perfect Tool to Use Your LUTs](#part4)

## Part 1: An Overview of LUT Generator - The Best Platform for Creating LUTs

LUT Generator is an excellent tool for creating color-grading picture and video presets. This powerful LUT generator-free tool is available on both Windows and Mac. Moreover, you can create LUTs from any photo and video editing application, including Lightroom and Camera Raw. Not only can you create your LUTs, but you can also download presets that are already available.

Furthermore, it offers over 290 cinematic styles LUTs and 50+ LUTs that are optimized for drones and GoPro videos. If you want a surreal look, you can also use 70+ Psychedelia LUTs. This tool allows you to apply third-party effects easily on your photos and videos. Moreover, you can even match the tone of clips from different cameras to give a uniform look.

## Part 2: How to Create LUTs Using LUT Generator Free Download?

If you don't want to apply online LUTs that are available, you can create your own. To do so, you have to download the LUT Generator tool and follow these simple steps to create LUTs.

##### Step1

To create a LUT of your liking, search for the LUT Generator free download on your browser and download the tool.

##### Step2

As you launch it, continue to select the "Generate a HALD" option. This option will let you generate a PNG HALD that you can use for color grading using editing software.

##### Step3

Open the generated PNG HALD into your preferred photo editing application. Apply the desired color correction on the PNG HALD. Save the modified PNG HALD without compression as PNG or at 100% quality in JPG format.

##### Step4

Click the "Convert to CUBE" button in the LUT Generator and select the modified PNG HALD you saved in the previous step.

##### Step5

In Preferences, choose the desired size of the 3D LUT as .CUBE format. You can choose between 25x25x25 or 64x64x64\. After selecting your desired size, your customized LUT will be created in .CUBE format.

## Part 3: How to Create Online LUTs Using Online LUT Creator?

There are two methods to create a LUT online and offline. Previously you've learned to generate LUTs using offline tools. However, you can also create LUTs online without installing any tool. This portion will teach you how to create online LUTs in this step-by-step guide.

##### Step1

Import your photo into Lightroom by dragging and dropping it. You can also import the file by clicking the "File" button and selecting "Import Photos and Video." For best results, ensure that the photo you will edit is still.

![import media to lightroom ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/06/create-luts-with-luts-generator-2.jpg)

##### Step2

Edit your photo inside the “Develop” module in Lightroom with your desired preference and style. Only apply changes affecting the colors, not adjustments like noise reduction, vignette, or grain.

![open develop module and make changes ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/06/create-luts-with-luts-generator-3.jpg)

##### Step3

Download the original PNG from <www.onlinelutcreator.com/lutcreator>. Import it into Lightroom as you did in the first step.

![ download identity png ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/06/create-luts-with-luts-generator-4.jpg)

##### Step4

Right-click on your edited photo in the Develop module. Click "Develop Settings," and select "Copy Settings." After that, a new window will pop up; make sure you have the same things checked as in the screenshot.

![ open develop module and copy settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/06/create-luts-with-luts-generator-5.jpg)

##### Step5

Right-click the original downloaded PNG file in the Develop module. Go to "Develop Settings," and choose "Paste Settings." This will paste the settings from your edited photo onto the original PNG.

![paste settings in original png](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/06/create-luts-with-luts-generator-6.jpg)

##### Step6

Now export the edited PNG by right-clicking on the PNG and selecting "Export." In the Export popup menu, ensure you have the same settings as in the screenshot.

![export edited png](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/06/create-luts-with-luts-generator-7.jpg)

##### Step7

Go back to <www.onlinelutcreator.com/lutcreator> and upload the edited PNG. Generate your LUT and download it. You can now use this LUT to adjust the same color to other videos or photos.
