## Part 1 Why Did AI Portrait Become More and More Popular

![Popular AI Portrait](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/quick-answer-why-did-filmora-ai-portrait-attract-people-5.jpg)

Let‚Äôs start with the basics first! What is **Filmora AI portrait** and why it has gained an immense popularity in the editing community. It‚Äôs basically an add-on effect in Wondershare Filmora X that was introduced with the latest Filmora X version 10.5.

By integrating this add-on into their video, editors can remove/change the background without losing any details of the main subject. So, let‚Äôs say if you don‚Äôt have green screen footage and still want to remove the background without affecting the foreground (a single subject), **Filmora AI portrait** will help you get the job done without any hassle.

Being an AI-powered feature, **Filmora AI portrait** automatically detects the shape and structure of the main subject and separates it from the background. This way even if you don‚Äôt have used a green screen or don‚Äôt know how to apply the Chroma key in your videos, you‚Äôll be able to remove the background from the RAW footage and replace it with a custom background. This will allow you to make your videos more appealing and add a funny element for better engagement. For example, you can add a moving background to uplift the entire storyline to your videos.

**Filmora AI portrait** is a great feature for different types of creators such as gaming streamers, YouTube content creators, and daily vloggers. Regardless of your editing style, by integrating the Filmora AI portrait add-on, you‚Äôll have the liberty to remove unwanted backgrounds from various shots and keep the production quality high.

In addition to removing the background, Filmora AI portrait is also a great tool to design thumbnails for your videos. Also, you can use this feature to apply borders, glitch effects, pixelated, noise, or segmentation video effects to your videos. All these elements will allow you to eliminate dull and low quality things from your videos and make the main characters pop-out in every frame.

Here are a few situations where one can implement the Filmora AI portrait and make the most out of its functions.

**‚óè** If you livestream videos on YouTube, but don‚Äôt have a green screen yet, you can use the AI portrait feature in Filmora to remove the background and make your streaming setup look more elegant and professional.

**‚óè** With the Filmora AI portrait feature, you can also design high-quality and captivating thumbnails for your videos and draw the maximum attention within YouTube‚Äôs rabbithole. Any new viewer is more likely to click on your videos when the thumbnail is engaging.

**‚óè** You can also use Filmora AI portrait effect to remove background from interviews. Usually, when someone shoots an interview, they usually place a green screen behind the person. But, in case you don‚Äôt have green screen footage, you can easily make your interviews look more professional with the **Filmora AI portrait** effect.

**‚óè** Finally, you can also use the Filmora AI portrait feature in regular YouTube vlogs. This would be applicable when there are unnecessary elements in the background of a clip that are ruining the entire frame. In this case by simply erasing the background and replacing it with a custom one, you‚Äôll be able to keep the production quality high and keep the viewers engaged throughout the vlog.

## Part 2 What Scenes Apply to AI Portrait?

![What Scenes Apply to AI Portrait](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/quick-answer-why-did-filmora-ai-portrait-attract-people-6.jpg)

While the AI portrait effect can work for all frames, there are a few situations when it delivers the best results. The designers at Wondershare Filmora claim that AI Portrait works like a charm when the frame has a single subject talking directly to the camera.

When there‚Äôs a single individual or subject in front of the camera, it‚Äôs relatively easier for the AI-algorithm to detect the edges and separate the background with high precision. Moreover, when the main subject is static, you are most likely to witness the best output in terms of background removal. Why? The reason being when there‚Äôs a single static subject, an AI-powered algorithm can precisely mark its edges and achieve relatively better results.

Let‚Äôs understand this with the help of a few examples.

**One-Person Interview**

Going back to the interview example - let‚Äôs say you are interviewing a person who‚Äôs sitting in a chair and talking directly to the camera in front of him. Now, since there isn‚Äôt too much movement on his side, the AI-algorithm will be able to detect his edges and remove the background accordingly. In fact, in such ideal cases, the tool will even be able to detect the hair of the subject with high precision.

**Shot of a Monologue**

Monologues are no longer limited to high-budget Hollywood movies only. They have become a regular part of conventional videos such as daily YouTube vlogs. Monologues boast better authenticity as the entire clip is shot in one go.

Since there are no random cuts, the presenter can easily convey his views to the viewers. But, for a monologue to work, it‚Äôs extremely crucial that it has a high-quality background otherwise it‚Äôll fail to grab the viewer‚Äôs attention. In case you are also stuck with a monologue that has a bad background, you can use **Filmora AI portrait** to remove it and make the primary character of the video pop-up more effectively.

**YouTube Vlogs**

Again, YouTube vlogs are another great example where editors could really benefit from **Filmora‚Äôs AI portrait** effect. For daily vloggers, getting the perfect shot is always a challenge. And, more often than you think, they end up taking shots that have bad backgrounds. But, thanks to Filmora‚Äôs AI portrait effect, one could easily remove background from such shots and use them to convey the storyline more effectively. This won‚Äôt waste your efforts and you‚Äôll be able to use the shot that would have otherwise gone to Trash.

So, these are a few situations where the AI portrait effect in Filmora can do wonders for your video editing process.

## Part 3 What Scenes Do Not Apply to AI Portrait?

![What Scenes Do Not Apply to AI Portrait](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/quick-answer-why-did-filmora-ai-portrait-attract-people-7.jpg)

Now, as we mentioned in the previous part, the **Filmora AI portrait** effect works better in scenarios where there‚Äôs only a single subject in the frame. This means the effect isn‚Äôt applicable in all the situations.

If there is a lot of movement in the frame, the AI-algorithm may fail to detect the edges of the subject(s) and not deliver the expected results. For example if you are working on a vlog where you are moving the camera really fast, the AI effect will struggle to separate the background from the foreground and fail to achieve the desired precision while removing background.

Some of the other situations where you won‚Äôt be able to make the most out of the AI portrait effect include:

**Shots With Multiple Moving Subjects**

If you have a shot of a crowded place where too many people are moving in the frame, it‚Äôll be challenging to detect the background properly. The movement of multiple subjects will interfere with the overall functionality of the algorithm, restricting users from achieving a background-free shot. In such a situation, you‚Äôll either have to use the shot without removing the background or dump into the Trash folder.

**Videos With Special Effects and Filters**

Here‚Äôs the deal; special effects and filters have become an inevitable part of today‚Äôs social media-influenced world. People apply filters and visual effects to make their videos more appealing and grab more likes and comments on Instagram, Facebook, and Snapchat.

But, these filters are often a nightmare for video editors as it‚Äôs pretty challenging to process them in any video editing software. If you have a clip with filters or video effects, you‚Äôll struggle to implement the **Filmora AI portrait** effect properly. In fact, the effect will not work as expected and you‚Äôll be stuck with a shot that would be pretty useless for the entire storyline. So, do not apply unnecessary filters to your videos if you are planning to apply the AI portrait effect in the long run.

**Videos With Backlights**

The lighting setup of any video has a huge influence on how it will look at the end. Just like a human being, even the AI algorithm struggles to detect the background in a video that has poor lighting conditions or bad backlight. In such videos, it‚Äôs challenging for the algorithm to detect the main subject and then identify its edges.

To avoid such scenarios, it would be better to plan your shots in advance and shoot them when there are proper lighting conditions. In case you are going to shoot indoors, you can use a dedicated lighting setup. If anything, this will make it much easier to apply the Filmora AI portrait effect and achieve the best results in terms of background removal.

**Paintings**

Paintings aren‚Äôt like traditional videos. The color scheme is entirely different and it‚Äôs much challenging to identify the background and the foreground. So, if there are any images of paintings that you want to use as a thumbnail, it might get a bit challenging to remove the background. In such a scenario, it would be much better to either choose a different image for the thumbnail and use the painting without removing its background.

So, these are a few scenarios where using the **Filmora AI portrait** won‚Äôt be an effective solution for you. We would recommend to plan your shots in advance so that you don‚Äôt end up with random shots where it‚Äôs challenging to apply the AI portrait effect.

## Part 4 Why Filmora AI Portrait Deserves to Try?

So, let‚Äôs say you no longer need to remove backgrounds from your videos - in this situation, you can directly discontinue your subscription without affecting your regular Filmora subscription.

### 02How to Add AI Portrait Effects?

Now, coming to the real reason why you‚Äôve come this far - the process to use the AI portrait effect in Filmora. To be honest, it‚Äôs a relatively easier process to add the AI portrait effect in Filmora. Even if you are not a Filmora user, you‚Äôll be able to get the job done without any hassle. Let me quickly walk you through the step-by-step procedure of adding the AI portrait effect in Wondershare Filmora.

**Step 1 -** If you are not an existing user of Filmora, start by purchasing its license and install the software on your system to get started. On the other hand, if you‚Äôve been using Filmora for a while, directly move to the next step to proceed further.

**Step 2 -** Now, launch the software and create a new project. You‚Äôll be prompted to Filmora‚Äôs editing panel. At this point, you‚Äôll have to drag the video clip (that you want to edit) to the timeline.

**Step 3 -** Once the video is successfully imported, switch to the "Effects" tab and search for "AI Portrait". You‚Äôll see a "premium" icon next to its name. Double-click on the effect and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the payment procedure.

![ai portrait](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/quick-answer-why-did-filmora-ai-portrait-attract-people-1.jpg)

**Step 4 -** After you have bought the effect, just drag it to the timeline and place it above your video.

![purchase add on](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/quick-answer-why-did-filmora-ai-portrait-attract-people-2.jpg)

**Step 5 -** Based on how long you want to keep this effect, you can elongate or shorten its duration by simply stretching its duration.

![adjust effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/quick-answer-why-did-filmora-ai-portrait-attract-people-3.jpg)

That‚Äôs it; the AI portrait effect will automatically detect and remove the background without requiring you to even lift a finger. After the background is removed, you can tap the "Export" button and choose the desired output format to save the file on your system.

### 03How to Adjust AI Portrait Effects?

Apart from its core ability to remove the background from a video/image, the another advantage of choosing Filmora AI portrait add-on is its fully customization support. Based on your requirements, you can adjust different parameters such as percentage, edge thickness, edge feather, etc. to achieve the desired results in the output.

Let‚Äôs have a closer look at all these parameters to understand their overall functionality more precisely.

**‚óè** **Percentage:** By adjusting the percentage, you can decide how effective you want the AI portrait effect to appear in your videos. If you drag the slider all the way to the end, the background will be removed completely and you might not even recognize the main subject properly. On the other hand, if you keep it at a lower percentage, there will be a little bit of transparency in the background.

**‚óè** **Alpha:** The alpha slider will decide the transparency of the portrait effect itself. You can drag this slider left or right until you have the perfect frame in front of you.

**‚óè** **Edge Thickness:** As the name implies, edge thickness decides how thick the edges of the subject would appear in the video. A smaller percentage would mean thinner edges whereas a higher percentage would mean larger edges.

**‚óè** **Edge Feather:** With Edge feather, you can define the blurriness of the edges themselves. The higher the value of the edge feather, the blurier the edges would appear in your videos.

Now, to access all these features, all you have to do is double-tap on the AI portrait effect within FIlmora‚Äôs timeline. This will automatically prompt you to the editing panel for this particular effect where you‚Äôll be able to manipulate all these parameters and achieve the desired portrait results accordingly.

![edit ai portrait](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/quick-answer-why-did-filmora-ai-portrait-attract-people-4.jpg)

In case you are not happy with your customization, you can also tap the "Restore" button next to each parameter to restore the default value. Once you are happy with the results, just tap the "Ok" button to implement your changes.

### 04Why Did Filmora AI Portrait Attract People?

Apart from attracting editors, what makes **Filmora AI portrait** one of the best video effects that you can apply to your videos to engage viewers. Well, the answer is pretty simple; AI portrait effect makes the background of a video transparent.

It means the editors have the liberty to replace the dull boring background with a custom one and keep the engagement level high. This becomes really useful when you are trying to compile a long documentary and have a few shots with bad backgrounds. Since using such shots directly might affect the production quality of your videos, it would be better to first replace the background using the AI portrait effect.

So, regardless of your editing setup, production goals, or the type of video you want to compile at the end, you can use the AI portrait effect in Wondershare Filmora in different situations and protect the end results from becoming a failure. This will help you maximize the reach of your videos and attract more viewers more effectively.

## Part 5 A Comparison to Other AI Portrait Software

Now, before saying goodbye, we also believe that it would be unfair if we only talk about a single tool and a single effect in this guide. Of course, Filmora‚Äôs AI portrait effect works like a charm in different situations, there are other tools in the market that you can try to achieve similar results. As a video editor, it‚Äôs always great to keep trying new things as it will add variation to your portfolio and make it much easier to attract new clients.

So, here‚Äôs a list of top 5 video editing software that you can use to get similar functionality like the AI portrait effect in Wondershare Filmora.

### 01Adobe Premiere Pro

Adobe Premiere Pro is undoubtedly one of the most popular video editing software with a strong fan base. Many industry leaders including Sam Kolder and Rory Kramer use Premier Pro to compile high-quality Hollywood-style videos for musicians as well as other clients.

Premiere Pro is more of an advanced video editing tool, which means even though it can help you remove background from portraits, you‚Äôll have to do all the work manually. There‚Äôs no predefined add-on or effect that you can apply to the video to erase the background. Instead, you‚Äôll have to manually mark the edges of the subject, erase the background and then, replace it with a different one to achieve the desired results.

In general, Premiere Pro is a great option for skilled editors who want to take things in their own hands to achieve the best results. If you are a beginner, you would be better off with a more user-friendly tool such as Wondershare Filmora.

**Key Features:**

**‚óè** Extreme precision while erasing the background

**‚óè** Achieve the desired results without compromising the quality of the main subject in the portrait

**‚óè** An industry-preferred software

**Pros:**

**‚óè** Existing Premiere Pro users will find it much easier to replicate the AI portrait effect

**‚óè** Complete flexibility over your project

**Cons:**

**‚óè** It can take several hours to precisely remove the background

**‚óè** The entire process will be manual

### 02Final Cut Pro

Like Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro is another famous video editing software that can help you replicate the results of the Filmora AI portrait effect and remove the background from different videos, images, and motion graphics. Keep in mind that Final Cut Pro is only available for macOS, which means if you own a Windows system, you won‚Äôt be able to use the software whatsoever.

Again, the only downside of using Final Cut Pro is the amount of manual effort you‚Äôll have to put in to achieve the expected results. Being a full-scale video editing tool, there aren‚Äôt too many add-ons or predefined video effects.

Instead, you‚Äôll have to rely on conventional methods such as keyframing to remove the background frame by frame and make your videos look professional. On the major side, Final Cut Pro will work in all situations. Even if you have a clip with too many moving objects, you‚Äôll be able to mark the edges frame-by-frame and remove the background without losing any details from the foreground.

**Key Features:**

**‚óè** Timeline-based interface for rapid video editing

**‚óè** While working on complex shots, it can take several hours to remove the background

### 03Unscreen Online

Unscreen is an online video background remover that‚Äôs specifically designed to remove background from videos with a single click. Being an online application, Unscreen is an ideal choice for short videos (up to 20 seconds) because longer-duration videos will likely take forever to upload. If you want to edit a video for Instagram Reels or YouTube shorts, Unscreen Online would be worth the consideration.

It‚Äôll allow you to remove the background with one click and you won‚Äôt even need high-performance software to get the job done. The only drawback of Unscreen online is its lack of video format compatibility. Since it‚Äôs an online application, not all video formats are compatible with Unscreen Online.

Moreover, you can only use the tool to process shorter videos. In general, this is an ideal choice for an average Joe who doesn‚Äôt want to go through the hassle of installing and using a dedicated video editing software. So, if you are a professional, it would be far beneficial to stick to other premium tools like Filmora, Premiere Pro, and Final Cut Pro.

**Key Features:**

**‚óè** You can access Unscreen Online on any device you want

**‚óè** The edge detection is quite precise for videos with a single subject

**‚óè** As compared to other premium options, Unscreen Online is relatively cheaper

**Pros:**

**‚óè** Cross-platform compatibility

**‚óè** Perfect for Instagram content creators

**‚óè** Affordable pricing

**Cons:**

**‚óè** Doesn‚Äôt achieve the expected results for more complex videos having too many subjects

**‚óè** Can‚Äôt process videos having longer durations

### 04MOVAVI Video Editor

MOVAVI is another desktop-based video editing software that offers all the basic functionality one looks for in a video editing tool. The software is compatible with Windows and is an ideal choice for beginners who are just getting started on their video editing journey. You‚Äôll find all the basic features along with a few advanced functions such as background removal. Like Filmora, MOVAVI also has a built-in add-on to remove the background from your clips. However, you might not be able to achieve the same precision, especially when we are talking about more complex frames.

**Key Features:**

**‚óè** An ideal choice for beginners

**‚óè** Compatible with Windows

**‚óè** Can remove background from videos with a single subject

**Pros:**

**‚óè** The user interface is pretty straightforward

**‚óè** It‚Äôs easier to edit the videos, thanks to a timeline-based interface

**Cons:**

**‚óè** For a beginner editing tool, the price is on the higher side

**‚óè** You won‚Äôt be able to remove background from complex shots with multiple subjects in the foreground

### 05Kinemaster

Kinemaster is a video editing tool that‚Äôs only available on mobile devices, Android to be more specific. It boasts a plethora of features that make it one of the most sought-after editing tools among mobile users. Apart from the basic editing features, Kinemaster also has Chroma key and green screen functionality that allow users to remove background from the videos. Though it‚Äôs not as same as a professional-level video editing tool like Filmora Pro, you can still use Kinemaster to erase the background from your green screen footage to achieve the desired portrait look.

**Features:**

**‚óè** Kinemaster is beginner-friendly

**‚óè** Compatible with all Android devices

**Pros:**

**‚óè** Green screen compatibility

**‚óè** Offers advanced features such as chroma key

**‚óè** Idea choice for novice video editors

**Cons:**

**‚óè** It‚Äôs quite challenging to edit longer videos on a phone, making Kinemaster less reliable for large documentary-type videos

But, thanks to Filmora‚Äôs AI portrait effect, one could easily remove background from such shots and use them to convey the storyline more effectively. This won‚Äôt waste your efforts and you‚Äôll be able to use the shot that would have otherwise gone to Trash.

So, these are a few situations where the AI portrait effect in Filmora can do wonders for your video editing process.

## Part 3 What Scenes Do Not Apply to AI Portrait?

![What Scenes Do Not Apply to AI Portrait](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/quick-answer-why-did-filmora-ai-portrait-attract-people-7.jpg)

Now, as we mentioned in the previous part, the **Filmora AI portrait** effect works better in scenarios where there‚Äôs only a single subject in the frame. This means the effect isn‚Äôt applicable in all the situations.

If there is a lot of movement in the frame, the AI-algorithm may fail to detect the edges of the subject(s) and not deliver the expected results. For example if you are working on a vlog where you are moving the camera really fast, the AI effect will struggle to separate the background from the foreground and fail to achieve the desired precision while removing background.

Some of the other situations where you won‚Äôt be able to make the most out of the AI portrait effect include:

**Shots With Multiple Moving Subjects**

If you have a shot of a crowded place where too many people are moving in the frame, it‚Äôll be challenging to detect the background properly. The movement of multiple subjects will interfere with the overall functionality of the algorithm, restricting users from achieving a background-free shot. In such a situation, you‚Äôll either have to use the shot without removing the background or dump into the Trash folder.

**Videos With Special Effects and Filters**

Here‚Äôs the deal; special effects and filters have become an inevitable part of today‚Äôs social media-influenced world. People apply filters and visual effects to make their videos more appealing and grab more likes and comments on Instagram, Facebook, and Snapchat.

But, these filters are often a nightmare for video editors as it‚Äôs pretty challenging to process them in any video editing software. If you have a clip with filters or video effects, you‚Äôll struggle to implement the **Filmora AI portrait** effect properly. In fact, the effect will not work as expected and you‚Äôll be stuck with a shot that would be pretty useless for the entire storyline. So, do not apply unnecessary filters to your videos if you are planning to apply the AI portrait effect in the long run.

**Videos With Backlights**

The lighting setup of any video has a huge influence on how it will look at the end. Just like a human being, even the AI algorithm struggles to detect the background in a video that has poor lighting conditions or bad backlight. In such videos, it‚Äôs challenging for the algorithm to detect the main subject and then identify its edges.

To avoid such scenarios, it would be better to plan your shots in advance and shoot them when there are proper lighting conditions. In case you are going to shoot indoors, you can use a dedicated lighting setup. If anything, this will make it much easier to apply the Filmora AI portrait effect and achieve the best results in terms of background removal.

**Paintings**

Paintings aren‚Äôt like traditional videos. The color scheme is entirely different and it‚Äôs much challenging to identify the background and the foreground. So, if there are any images of paintings that you want to use as a thumbnail, it might get a bit challenging to remove the background. In such a scenario, it would be much better to either choose a different image for the thumbnail and use the painting without removing its background.

So, these are a few scenarios where using the **Filmora AI portrait** won‚Äôt be an effective solution for you. We would recommend to plan your shots in advance so that you don‚Äôt end up with random shots where it‚Äôs challenging to apply the AI portrait effect.

## Part 4 Why Filmora AI Portrait Deserves to Try?

### 02How to Add AI Portrait Effects?

Now, coming to the real reason why you‚Äôve come this far - the process to use the AI portrait effect in Filmora. To be honest, it‚Äôs a relatively easier process to add the AI portrait effect in Filmora. Even if you are not a Filmora user, you‚Äôll be able to get the job done without any hassle. Let me quickly walk you through the step-by-step procedure of adding the AI portrait effect in Wondershare Filmora.

**Step 1 -** If you are not an existing user of Filmora, start by purchasing its license and install the software on your system to get started. On the other hand, if you‚Äôve been using Filmora for a while, directly move to the next step to proceed further.

**Step 2 -** Now, launch the software and create a new project. You‚Äôll be prompted to Filmora‚Äôs editing panel. At this point, you‚Äôll have to drag the video clip (that you want to edit) to the timeline.

**Step 3 -** Once the video is successfully imported, switch to the "Effects" tab and search for "AI Portrait". You‚Äôll see a "premium" icon next to its name. Double-click on the effect and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the payment procedure.

![ai portrait](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/quick-answer-why-did-filmora-ai-portrait-attract-people-1.jpg)

**Step 4 -** After you have bought the effect, just drag it to the timeline and place it above your video.

![purchase add on](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/quick-answer-why-did-filmora-ai-portrait-attract-people-2.jpg)

**Step 5 -** Based on how long you want to keep this effect, you can elongate or shorten its duration by simply stretching its duration.

![adjust effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/quick-answer-why-did-filmora-ai-portrait-attract-people-3.jpg)

That‚Äôs it; the AI portrait effect will automatically detect and remove the background without requiring you to even lift a finger. After the background is removed, you can tap the "Export" button and choose the desired output format to save the file on your system.

### 03How to Adjust AI Portrait Effects?

Apart from its core ability to remove the background from a video/image, the another advantage of choosing Filmora AI portrait add-on is its fully customization support. Based on your requirements, you can adjust different parameters such as percentage, edge thickness, edge feather, etc. to achieve the desired results in the output.

Let‚Äôs have a closer look at all these parameters to understand their overall functionality more precisely.

**‚óè** **Percentage:** By adjusting the percentage, you can decide how effective you want the AI portrait effect to appear in your videos. If you drag the slider all the way to the end, the background will be removed completely and you might not even recognize the main subject properly. On the other hand, if you keep it at a lower percentage, there will be a little bit of transparency in the background.

**‚óè** **Alpha:** The alpha slider will decide the transparency of the portrait effect itself. You can drag this slider left or right until you have the perfect frame in front of you.

**‚óè** **Edge Thickness:** As the name implies, edge thickness decides how thick the edges of the subject would appear in the video. A smaller percentage would mean thinner edges whereas a higher percentage would mean larger edges.

**‚óè** **Edge Feather:** With Edge feather, you can define the blurriness of the edges themselves. The higher the value of the edge feather, the blurier the edges would appear in your videos.

Now, to access all these features, all you have to do is double-tap on the AI portrait effect within FIlmora‚Äôs timeline. This will automatically prompt you to the editing panel for this particular effect where you‚Äôll be able to manipulate all these parameters and achieve the desired portrait results accordingly.

![edit ai portrait](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/quick-answer-why-did-filmora-ai-portrait-attract-people-4.jpg)

In case you are not happy with your customization, you can also tap the "Restore" button next to each parameter to restore the default value. Once you are happy with the results, just tap the "Ok" button to implement your changes.

### 04Why Did Filmora AI Portrait Attract People?

Apart from attracting editors, what makes **Filmora AI portrait** one of the best video effects that you can apply to your videos to engage viewers. Well, the answer is pretty simple; AI portrait effect makes the background of a video transparent.

It means the editors have the liberty to replace the dull boring background with a custom one and keep the engagement level high. This becomes really useful when you are trying to compile a long documentary and have a few shots with bad backgrounds. Since using such shots directly might affect the production quality of your videos, it would be better to first replace the background using the AI portrait effect.

So, regardless of your editing setup, production goals, or the type of video you want to compile at the end, you can use the AI portrait effect in Wondershare Filmora in different situations and protect the end results from becoming a failure. This will help you maximize the reach of your videos and attract more viewers more effectively.

## Part 5 A Comparison to Other AI Portrait Software

Now, before saying goodbye, we also believe that it would be unfair if we only talk about a single tool and a single effect in this guide. Of course, Filmora‚Äôs AI portrait effect works like a charm in different situations, there are other tools in the market that you can try to achieve similar results. As a video editor, it‚Äôs always great to keep trying new things as it will add variation to your portfolio and make it much easier to attract new clients.

So, here‚Äôs a list of top 5 video editing software that you can use to get similar functionality like the AI portrait effect in Wondershare Filmora.

### 01Adobe Premiere Pro

Adobe Premiere Pro is undoubtedly one of the most popular video editing software with a strong fan base. Many industry leaders including Sam Kolder and Rory Kramer use Premier Pro to compile high-quality Hollywood-style videos for musicians as well as other clients.

Premiere Pro is more of an advanced video editing tool, which means even though it can help you remove background from portraits, you‚Äôll have to do all the work manually. There‚Äôs no predefined add-on or effect that you can apply to the video to erase the background. Instead, you‚Äôll have to manually mark the edges of the subject, erase the background and then, replace it with a different one to achieve the desired results.

In general, Premiere Pro is a great option for skilled editors who want to take things in their own hands to achieve the best results. If you are a beginner, you would be better off with a more user-friendly tool such as Wondershare Filmora.

**Key Features:**

**‚óè** Extreme precision while erasing the background

**‚óè** Achieve the desired results without compromising the quality of the main subject in the portrait

**‚óè** An industry-preferred software

**Pros:**

**‚óè** Existing Premiere Pro users will find it much easier to replicate the AI portrait effect

**‚óè** Complete flexibility over your project

**Cons:**

**‚óè** It can take several hours to precisely remove the background

**‚óè** The entire process will be manual

### 02Final Cut Pro

Like Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro is another famous video editing software that can help you replicate the results of the Filmora AI portrait effect and remove the background from different videos, images, and motion graphics. Keep in mind that Final Cut Pro is only available for macOS, which means if you own a Windows system, you won‚Äôt be able to use the software whatsoever.

Again, the only downside of using Final Cut Pro is the amount of manual effort you‚Äôll have to put in to achieve the expected results. Being a full-scale video editing tool, there aren‚Äôt too many add-ons or predefined video effects.

Instead, you‚Äôll have to rely on conventional methods such as keyframing to remove the background frame by frame and make your videos look professional. On the major side, Final Cut Pro will work in all situations. Even if you have a clip with too many moving objects, you‚Äôll be able to mark the edges frame-by-frame and remove the background without losing any details from the foreground.

**Key Features:**

**‚óè** Timeline-based interface for rapid video editing

**‚óè** Exclusive macOS compatibility ensures high performance

**‚óè** Ideal for experienced editors and designers

**Cons:**

**‚óè** Unlike Wondershare Filmora, there aren‚Äôt any ready-to-use add-ons

**‚óè** While working on complex shots, it can take several hours to remove the background

### 03Unscreen Online

Unscreen is an online video background remover that‚Äôs specifically designed to remove background from videos with a single click. Being an online application, Unscreen is an ideal choice for short videos (up to 20 seconds) because longer-duration videos will likely take forever to upload. If you want to edit a video for Instagram Reels or YouTube shorts, Unscreen Online would be worth the consideration.

It‚Äôll allow you to remove the background with one click and you won‚Äôt even need high-performance software to get the job done. The only drawback of Unscreen online is its lack of video format compatibility. Since it‚Äôs an online application, not all video formats are compatible with Unscreen Online.

Moreover, you can only use the tool to process shorter videos. In general, this is an ideal choice for an average Joe who doesn‚Äôt want to go through the hassle of installing and using a dedicated video editing software. So, if you are a professional, it would be far beneficial to stick to other premium tools like Filmora, Premiere Pro, and Final Cut Pro.

**Key Features:**

**‚óè** You can access Unscreen Online on any device you want

**‚óè** The edge detection is quite precise for videos with a single subject

**‚óè** As compared to other premium options, Unscreen Online is relatively cheaper

**Pros:**

**‚óè** Cross-platform compatibility

**‚óè** Perfect for Instagram content creators

**‚óè** Affordable pricing

**Cons:**

**‚óè** Doesn‚Äôt achieve the expected results for more complex videos having too many subjects

**‚óè** Can‚Äôt process videos having longer durations

### 04MOVAVI Video Editor

MOVAVI is another desktop-based video editing software that offers all the basic functionality one looks for in a video editing tool. The software is compatible with Windows and is an ideal choice for beginners who are just getting started on their video editing journey. You‚Äôll find all the basic features along with a few advanced functions such as background removal. Like Filmora, MOVAVI also has a built-in add-on to remove the background from your clips. However, you might not be able to achieve the same precision, especially when we are talking about more complex frames.

**Key Features:**

**‚óè** An ideal choice for beginners

**‚óè** Compatible with Windows

**‚óè** Can remove background from videos with a single subject

**Pros:**

**‚óè** The user interface is pretty straightforward

**‚óè** It‚Äôs easier to edit the videos, thanks to a timeline-based interface

**Cons:**

**‚óè** For a beginner editing tool, the price is on the higher side

**‚óè** You won‚Äôt be able to remove background from complex shots with multiple subjects in the foreground

### 05Kinemaster

Kinemaster is a video editing tool that‚Äôs only available on mobile devices, Android to be more specific. It boasts a plethora of features that make it one of the most sought-after editing tools among mobile users. Apart from the basic editing features, Kinemaster also has Chroma key and green screen functionality that allow users to remove background from the videos. Though it‚Äôs not as same as a professional-level video editing tool like Filmora Pro, you can still use Kinemaster to erase the background from your green screen footage to achieve the desired portrait look.

**Features:**

**‚óè** Kinemaster is beginner-friendly

**‚óè** Compatible with all Android devices

**Pros:**

**‚óè** Green screen compatibility

**‚óè** Offers advanced features such as chroma key

**‚óè** Idea choice for novice video editors

**Cons:**

**‚óè** It‚Äôs quite challenging to edit longer videos on a phone, making Kinemaster less reliable for large documentary-type videos

## Part 1 Why Did AI Portrait Become More and More Popular

![Popular AI Portrait](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/quick-answer-why-did-filmora-ai-portrait-attract-people-5.jpg)

Let‚Äôs start with the basics first! What is **Filmora AI portrait** and why it has gained an immense popularity in the editing community. It‚Äôs basically an add-on effect in Wondershare Filmora X that was introduced with the latest Filmora X version 10.5.

By integrating this add-on into their video, editors can remove/change the background without losing any details of the main subject. So, let‚Äôs say if you don‚Äôt have green screen footage and still want to remove the background without affecting the foreground (a single subject), **Filmora AI portrait** will help you get the job done without any hassle.

Being an AI-powered feature, **Filmora AI portrait** automatically detects the shape and structure of the main subject and separates it from the background. This way even if you don‚Äôt have used a green screen or don‚Äôt know how to apply the Chroma key in your videos, you‚Äôll be able to remove the background from the RAW footage and replace it with a custom background. This will allow you to make your videos more appealing and add a funny element for better engagement. For example, you can add a moving background to uplift the entire storyline to your videos.

**Filmora AI portrait** is a great feature for different types of creators such as gaming streamers, YouTube content creators, and daily vloggers. Regardless of your editing style, by integrating the Filmora AI portrait add-on, you‚Äôll have the liberty to remove unwanted backgrounds from various shots and keep the production quality high.

In addition to removing the background, Filmora AI portrait is also a great tool to design thumbnails for your videos. Also, you can use this feature to apply borders, glitch effects, pixelated, noise, or segmentation video effects to your videos. All these elements will allow you to eliminate dull and low quality things from your videos and make the main characters pop-out in every frame.

Here are a few situations where one can implement the Filmora AI portrait and make the most out of its functions.

**‚óè** If you livestream videos on YouTube, but don‚Äôt have a green screen yet, you can use the AI portrait feature in Filmora to remove the background and make your streaming setup look more elegant and professional.

**‚óè** With the Filmora AI portrait feature, you can also design high-quality and captivating thumbnails for your videos and draw the maximum attention within YouTube‚Äôs rabbithole. Any new viewer is more likely to click on your videos when the thumbnail is engaging.

**‚óè** You can also use Filmora AI portrait effect to remove background from interviews. Usually, when someone shoots an interview, they usually place a green screen behind the person. But, in case you don‚Äôt have green screen footage, you can easily make your interviews look more professional with the **Filmora AI portrait** effect.

**‚óè** Finally, you can also use the Filmora AI portrait feature in regular YouTube vlogs. This would be applicable when there are unnecessary elements in the background of a clip that are ruining the entire frame. In this case by simply erasing the background and replacing it with a custom one, you‚Äôll be able to keep the production quality high and keep the viewers engaged throughout the vlog.

## Part 2 What Scenes Apply to AI Portrait?

![What Scenes Apply to AI Portrait](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/quick-answer-why-did-filmora-ai-portrait-attract-people-6.jpg)

While the AI portrait effect can work for all frames, there are a few situations when it delivers the best results. The designers at Wondershare Filmora claim that AI Portrait works like a charm when the frame has a single subject talking directly to the camera.

When there‚Äôs a single individual or subject in front of the camera, it‚Äôs relatively easier for the AI-algorithm to detect the edges and separate the background with high precision. Moreover, when the main subject is static, you are most likely to witness the best output in terms of background removal. Why? The reason being when there‚Äôs a single static subject, an AI-powered algorithm can precisely mark its edges and achieve relatively better results.

Let‚Äôs understand this with the help of a few examples.

**One-Person Interview**

Going back to the interview example - let‚Äôs say you are interviewing a person who‚Äôs sitting in a chair and talking directly to the camera in front of him. Now, since there isn‚Äôt too much movement on his side, the AI-algorithm will be able to detect his edges and remove the background accordingly. In fact, in such ideal cases, the tool will even be able to detect the hair of the subject with high precision.

**Shot of a Monologue**

Monologues are no longer limited to high-budget Hollywood movies only. They have become a regular part of conventional videos such as daily YouTube vlogs. Monologues boast better authenticity as the entire clip is shot in one go.

Since there are no random cuts, the presenter can easily convey his views to the viewers. But, for a monologue to work, it‚Äôs extremely crucial that it has a high-quality background otherwise it‚Äôll fail to grab the viewer‚Äôs attention. In case you are also stuck with a monologue that has a bad background, you can use **Filmora AI portrait** to remove it and make the primary character of the video pop-up more effectively.

**YouTube Vlogs**

Again, YouTube vlogs are another great example where editors could really benefit from **Filmora‚Äôs AI portrait** effect. For daily vloggers, getting the perfect shot is always a challenge. And, more often than you think, they end up taking shots that have bad backgrounds. But, thanks to Filmora‚Äôs AI portrait effect, one could easily remove background from such shots and use them to convey the storyline more effectively. This won‚Äôt waste your efforts and you‚Äôll be able to use the shot that would have otherwise gone to Trash.

So, these are a few situations where the AI portrait effect in Filmora can do wonders for your video editing process.

## Part 3 What Scenes Do Not Apply to AI Portrait?

![What Scenes Do Not Apply to AI Portrait](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/quick-answer-why-did-filmora-ai-portrait-attract-people-7.jpg)

Now, as we mentioned in the previous part, the **Filmora AI portrait** effect works better in scenarios where there‚Äôs only a single subject in the frame. This means the effect isn‚Äôt applicable in all the situations.

**Videos With Special Effects and Filters**

Here‚Äôs the deal; special effects and filters have become an inevitable part of today‚Äôs social media-influenced world. People apply filters and visual effects to make their videos more appealing and grab more likes and comments on Instagram, Facebook, and Snapchat.

But, these filters are often a nightmare for video editors as it‚Äôs pretty challenging to process them in any video editing software. If you have a clip with filters or video effects, you‚Äôll struggle to implement the **Filmora AI portrait** effect properly. In fact, the effect will not work as expected and you‚Äôll be stuck with a shot that would be pretty useless for the entire storyline.

### 03How to Adjust AI Portrait Effects?

Apart from its core ability to remove the background from a video/image, the another advantage of choosing Filmora AI portrait add-on is its fully customization support. Based on your requirements, you can adjust different parameters such as percentage, edge thickness, edge feather, etc. to achieve the desired results in the output.

Let‚Äôs have a closer look at all these parameters to understand their overall functionality more precisely.

**‚óè** **Percentage:** By adjusting the percentage, you can decide how effective you want the AI portrait effect to appear in your videos. If you drag the slider all the way to the end, the background will be removed completely and you might not even recognize the main subject properly. On the other hand, if you keep it at a lower percentage, there will be a little bit of transparency in the background.

**‚óè** **Alpha:** The alpha slider will decide the transparency of the portrait effect itself. You can drag this slider left or right until you have the perfect frame in front of you.

**‚óè** **Edge Thickness:** As the name implies, edge thickness decides how thick the edges of the subject would appear in the video. A smaller percentage would mean thinner edges whereas a higher percentage would mean larger edges.

**‚óè** **Edge Feather:** With Edge feather, you can define the blurriness of the edges themselves. The higher the value of the edge feather, the blurier the edges would appear in your videos.

Now, to access all these features, all you have to do is double-tap on the AI portrait effect within FIlmora‚Äôs timeline. This will automatically prompt you to the editing panel for this particular effect where you‚Äôll be able to manipulate all these parameters and achieve the desired portrait results accordingly.

## Part 5 A Comparison to Other AI Portrait Software

Of course, Filmora‚Äôs AI portrait effect works like a charm in different situations, there are other tools in the market that you can try to achieve similar results. As a video editor, it‚Äôs always great to keep trying new things as it will add variation to your portfolio and make it much easier to attract new clients.

So, here‚Äôs a list of top 5 video editing software that you can use to get similar functionality like the AI portrait effect in Wondershare Filmora.

### 01Adobe Premiere Pro

Adobe Premiere Pro is undoubtedly one of the most popular video editing software with a strong fan base. Many industry leaders including Sam Kolder and Rory Kramer use Premier Pro to compile high-quality Hollywood-style videos for musicians as well as other clients.

Premiere Pro is more of an advanced video editing tool, which means even though it can help you remove background from portraits, you‚Äôll have to do all the work manually. There‚Äôs no predefined add-on or effect that you can apply to the video to erase the background. Instead, you‚Äôll have to manually mark the edges of the subject, erase the background and then, replace it with a different one to achieve the desired results.

In general, Premiere Pro is a great option for skilled editors who want to take things in their own hands to achieve the best results. If you are a beginner, you would be better off with a more user-friendly tool such as Wondershare Filmora.

**Key Features:**

**‚óè** Extreme precision while erasing the background

**‚óè** Achieve the desired results without compromising the quality of the main subject in the portrait

**‚óè** An industry-preferred software

Keep in mind that Final Cut Pro is only available for macOS, which means if you own a Windows system, you won‚Äôt be able to use the software whatsoever.

Again, the only downside of using Final Cut Pro is the amount of manual effort you‚Äôll have to put in to achieve the expected results. Being a full-scale video editing tool, there aren‚Äôt too many add-ons or predefined video effects.

Instead, you‚Äôll have to rely on conventional methods such as keyframing to remove the background frame by frame and make your videos look professional. On the major side, Final Cut Pro will work in all situations. Even if you have a clip with too many moving objects, you‚Äôll be able to mark the edges frame-by-frame and remove the background without losing any details from the foreground.

**Key Features:**

**‚óè** While working on complex shots, it can take several hours to remove the background

### 03Unscreen Online

Unscreen is an online video background remover that‚Äôs specifically designed to remove background from videos with a single click. Being an online application, Unscreen is an ideal choice for short videos (up to 20 seconds) because longer-duration videos will likely take forever to upload. If you want to edit a video for Instagram Reels or YouTube shorts, Unscreen Online would be worth the consideration.

It‚Äôll allow you to remove the background with one click and you won‚Äôt even need high-performance software to get the job done. The only drawback of Unscreen online is its lack of video format compatibility. Since it‚Äôs an online application, not all video formats are compatible with Unscreen Online.

Moreover, you can only use the tool to process shorter videos. In general, this is an ideal choice for an average Joe who doesn‚Äôt want to go through the hassle of installing and using a dedicated video editing software. So, if you are a professional, it would be far beneficial to stick to other premium tools like Filmora, Premiere Pro, and Final Cut Pro.

**Key Features:**

**‚óè** You can access Unscreen Online on any device you want

**‚óè** The edge detection is quite precise for videos with a single subject

**‚óè** As compared to other premium options, Unscreen Online is relatively cheaper

**Pros:**

**‚óè** Cross-platform compatibility

**‚óè** Perfect for Instagram content creators

**‚óè** Affordable pricing

**Cons:**

**‚óè** Doesn‚Äôt achieve the expected results for more complex videos having too many subjects

**‚óè** Can‚Äôt process videos having longer durations

### 04MOVAVI Video Editor

MOVAVI is another desktop-based video editing software that offers all the basic functionality one looks for in a video editing tool.

**‚óè** An ideal choice for beginners

**‚óè** Compatible with Windows

**‚óè** Can remove background from videos with a single subject

**Pros:**

**‚óè** The user interface is pretty straightforward

**‚óè** It‚Äôs easier to edit the videos, thanks to a timeline-based interface

**Cons:**

**‚óè** For a beginner editing tool, the price is on the higher side

**‚óè** You won‚Äôt be able to remove background from complex shots with multiple subjects in the foreground

### 05Kinemaster

Kinemaster is a video editing tool that‚Äôs only available on mobile devices, Android to be more specific. It boasts a plethora of features that make it one of the most sought-after editing tools among mobile users. Apart from the basic editing features, Kinemaster also has Chroma key and green screen functionality that allow users to remove background from the videos. Though it‚Äôs not as same as a professional-level video editing tool like Filmora Pro, you can still use Kinemaster to erase the background from your green screen footage to achieve the desired portrait look.

**Features:**

**‚óè** Kinemaster is beginner-friendly

**‚óè** Compatible with all Android devices

**Pros:**

**‚óè** Green screen compatibility

## Part 1 Why Did AI Portrait Become More and More Popular

![Popular AI Portrait](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/quick-answer-why-did-filmora-ai-portrait-attract-people-5.jpg)

Let‚Äôs start with the basics first! What is **Filmora AI portrait** and why it has gained an immense popularity in the editing community. It‚Äôs basically an add-on effect in Wondershare Filmora X that was introduced with the latest Filmora X version 10.5.

By integrating this add-on into their video, editors can remove/change the background without losing any details of the main subject. So, let‚Äôs say if you don‚Äôt have green screen footage and still want to remove the background without affecting the foreground (a single subject), **Filmora AI portrait** will help you get the job done without any hassle.

Being an AI-powered feature, **Filmora AI portrait** automatically detects the shape and structure of the main subject and separates it from the background. This way even if you don‚Äôt have used a green screen or don‚Äôt know how to apply the Chroma key in your videos, you‚Äôll be able to remove the background from the RAW footage and replace it with a custom background. This will allow you to make your videos more appealing and add a funny element for better engagement. For example, you can add a moving background to uplift the entire storyline to your videos.

**Filmora AI portrait** is a great feature for different types of creators such as gaming streamers, YouTube content creators, and daily vloggers. Regardless of your editing style, by integrating the Filmora AI portrait add-on, you‚Äôll have the liberty to remove unwanted backgrounds from various shots and keep the production quality high.

In addition to removing the background, Filmora AI portrait is also a great tool to design thumbnails for your videos. Also, you can use this feature to apply borders, glitch effects, pixelated, noise, or segmentation video effects to your videos. All these elements will allow you to eliminate dull and low quality things from your videos and make the main characters pop-out in every frame.

Here are a few situations where one can implement the Filmora AI portrait and make the most out of its functions.

**‚óè** If you livestream videos on YouTube, but don‚Äôt have a green screen yet, you can use the AI portrait feature in Filmora to remove the background and make your streaming setup look more elegant and professional.

**‚óè** With the Filmora AI portrait feature, you can also design high-quality and captivating thumbnails for your videos and draw the maximum attention within YouTube‚Äôs rabbithole. Any new viewer is more likely to click on your videos when the thumbnail is engaging.

**‚óè** You can also use Filmora AI portrait effect to remove background from interviews. Usually, when someone shoots an interview, they usually place a green screen behind the person. But, in case you don‚Äôt have green screen footage, you can easily make your interviews look more professional with the **Filmora AI portrait** effect.

**‚óè** Finally, you can also use the Filmora AI portrait feature in regular YouTube vlogs. This would be applicable when there are unnecessary elements in the background of a clip that are ruining the entire frame. In this case by simply erasing the background and replacing it with a custom one, you‚Äôll be able to keep the production quality high and keep the viewers engaged throughout the vlog.

## Part 2 What Scenes Apply to AI Portrait?

![What Scenes Apply to AI Portrait](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/quick-answer-why-did-filmora-ai-portrait-attract-people-6.jpg)

While the AI portrait effect can work for all frames, there are a few situations when it delivers the best results. The designers at Wondershare Filmora claim that AI Portrait works like a charm when the frame has a single subject talking directly to the camera.

When there‚Äôs a single individual or subject in front of the camera, it‚Äôs relatively easier for the AI-algorithm to detect the edges and separate the background with high precision. Moreover, when the main subject is static, you are most likely to witness the best output in terms of background removal. Why? The reason being when there‚Äôs a single static subject, an AI-powered algorithm can precisely mark its edges and achieve relatively better results.

Let‚Äôs understand this with the help of a few examples.

**One-Person Interview**

Going back to the interview example - let‚Äôs say you are interviewing a person who‚Äôs sitting in a chair and talking directly to the camera in front of him. Now, since there isn‚Äôt too much movement on his side, the AI-algorithm will be able to detect his edges and remove the background accordingly. In fact, in such ideal cases, the tool will even be able to detect the hair of the subject with high precision.

**Shot of a Monologue**

Monologues are no longer limited to high-budget Hollywood movies only. They have become a regular part of conventional videos such as daily YouTube vlogs. Monologues boast better authenticity as the entire clip is shot in one go.

Since there are no random cuts, the presenter can easily convey his views to the viewers. But, for a monologue to work, it‚Äôs extremely crucial that it has a high-quality background otherwise it‚Äôll fail to grab the viewer‚Äôs attention. In case you are also stuck with a monologue that has a bad background, you can use **Filmora AI portrait** to remove it and make the primary character of the video pop-up more effectively.

**YouTube Vlogs**

Again, YouTube vlogs are another great example where editors could really benefit from **Filmora‚Äôs AI portrait** effect. For daily vloggers, getting the perfect shot is always a challenge. And, more often than you think, they end up taking shots that have bad backgrounds. But, thanks to Filmora‚Äôs AI portrait effect, one could easily remove background from such shots and use them to convey the storyline more effectively. This won‚Äôt waste your efforts and you‚Äôll be able to use the shot that would have otherwise gone to Trash.

So, these are a few situations where the AI portrait effect in Filmora can do wonders for your video editing process.

## Part 3 What Scenes Do Not Apply to AI Portrait?

![What Scenes Do Not Apply to AI Portrait](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/quick-answer-why-did-filmora-ai-portrait-attract-people-7.jpg)

Now, as we mentioned in the previous part, the **Filmora AI portrait** effect works better in scenarios where there‚Äôs only a single subject in the frame. This means the effect isn‚Äôt applicable in all the situations.

If there is a lot of movement in the frame, the AI-algorithm may fail to detect the edges of the subject(s) and not deliver the expected results. For example if you are working on a vlog where you are moving the camera really fast, the AI effect will struggle to separate the background from the foreground and fail to achieve the desired precision while removing background.

Some of the other situations where you won‚Äôt be able to make the most out of the AI portrait effect include:

**Shots With Multiple Moving Subjects**

If you have a shot of a crowded place where too many people are moving in the frame, it‚Äôll be challenging to detect the background properly. The movement of multiple subjects will interfere with the overall functionality of the algorithm, restricting users from achieving a background-free shot. In such a situation, you‚Äôll either have to use the shot without removing the background or dump into the Trash folder.

**Videos With Special Effects and Filters**

Here‚Äôs the deal; special effects and filters have become an inevitable part of today‚Äôs social media-influenced world. People apply filters and visual effects to make their videos more appealing and grab more likes and comments on Instagram, Facebook, and Snapchat.

But, these filters are often a nightmare for video editors as it‚Äôs pretty challenging to process them in any video editing software. If you have a clip with filters or video effects, you‚Äôll struggle to implement the **Filmora AI portrait** effect properly. In fact, the effect will not work as expected and you‚Äôll be stuck with a shot that would be pretty useless for the entire storyline. So, do not apply unnecessary filters to your videos if you are planning to apply the AI portrait effect in the long run.

**Videos With Backlights**

The lighting setup of any video has a huge influence on how it will look at the end. Just like a human being, even the AI algorithm struggles to detect the background in a video that has poor lighting conditions or bad backlight. In such videos, it‚Äôs challenging for the algorithm to detect the main subject and then identify its edges.

To avoid such scenarios, it would be better to plan your shots in advance and shoot them when there are proper lighting conditions. In case you are going to shoot indoors, you can use a dedicated lighting setup. If anything, this will make it much easier to apply the Filmora AI portrait effect and achieve the best results in terms of background removal.

**Paintings**

Paintings aren‚Äôt like traditional videos. The color scheme is entirely different and it‚Äôs much challenging to identify the background and the foreground. So, if there are any images of paintings that you want to use as a thumbnail, it might get a bit challenging to remove the background. In such a scenario, it would be much better to either choose a different image for the thumbnail and use the painting without removing its background.

So, these are a few scenarios where using the **Filmora AI portrait** won‚Äôt be an effective solution for you. We would recommend to plan your shots in advance so that you don‚Äôt end up with random shots where it‚Äôs challenging to apply the AI portrait effect.

## Part 4 Why Filmora AI Portrait Deserves to Try?

Keep in mind that Final Cut Pro is only available for macOS, which means if you own a Windows system, you won‚Äôt be able to use the software whatsoever.

Again, the only downside of using Final Cut Pro is the amount of manual effort you‚Äôll have to put in to achieve the expected results. Being a full-scale video editing tool, there aren‚Äôt too many add-ons or predefined video effects.

Instead, you‚Äôll have to rely on conventional methods such as keyframing to remove the background frame by frame and make your videos look professional. On the major side, Final Cut Pro will work in all situations. Even if you have a clip with too many moving objects, you‚Äôll be able to mark the edges frame-by-frame and remove the background without losing any details from the foreground.

**Key Features:**

**‚óè** Timeline-based interface for rapid video editing

**‚óè** Exclusive macOS compatibility ensures high performance

**‚óè** Ideal for experienced editors and designers

**Pros:**

**‚óè** Final Cut Pro has an easy-to-use interface

**‚óè** It‚Äôs easier to process each frame individually

**Cons:**

**‚óè** Unlike Wondershare Filmora, there aren‚Äôt any ready-to-use add-ons

**‚óè** While working on complex shots, it can take several hours to remove the background

### 03Unscreen Online

Unscreen is an online video background remover that‚Äôs specifically designed to remove background from videos with a single click. Being an online application, Unscreen is an ideal choice for short videos (up to 20 seconds) because longer-duration videos will likely take forever to upload. If you want to edit a video for Instagram Reels or YouTube shorts, Unscreen Online would be worth the consideration.

It‚Äôll allow you to remove the background with one click and you won‚Äôt even need high-performance software to get the job done. The only drawback of Unscreen online is its lack of video format compatibility. Since it‚Äôs an online application, not all video formats are compatible with Unscreen Online.

Moreover, you can only use the tool to process shorter videos. In general, this is an ideal choice for an average Joe who doesn‚Äôt want to go through the hassle of installing and using a dedicated video editing software. So, if you are a professional, it would be far beneficial to stick to other premium tools like Filmora, Premiere Pro, and Final Cut Pro.

**Key Features:**

**‚óè** You can access Unscreen Online on any device you want

**‚óè** The edge detection is quite precise for videos with a single subject

**‚óè** As compared to other premium options, Unscreen Online is relatively cheaper

**Pros:**

**‚óè** Cross-platform compatibility

**‚óè** Perfect for Instagram content creators

**‚óè** Affordable pricing

**Cons:**

**‚óè** Doesn‚Äôt achieve the expected results for more complex videos having too many subjects

**‚óè** Can‚Äôt process videos having longer durations

### 04MOVAVI Video Editor

MOVAVI is another desktop-based video editing software that offers all the basic functionality one looks for in a video editing tool. The software is compatible with Windows and is an ideal choice for beginners who are just getting started on their video editing journey. You‚Äôll find all the basic features along with a few advanced functions such as background removal. Like Filmora, MOVAVI also has a built-in add-on to remove the background from your clips. However, you might not be able to achieve the same precision, especially when we are talking about more complex frames.

**‚óè** You won‚Äôt be able to remove background from complex shots with multiple subjects in the foreground

### 05Kinemaster

Kinemaster is a video editing tool that‚Äôs only available on mobile devices, Android to be more specific. It boasts a plethora of features that make it one of the most sought-after editing tools among mobile users. Apart from the basic editing features, Kinemaster also has Chroma key and green screen functionality that allow users to remove background from the videos. Though it‚Äôs not as same as a professional-level video editing tool like Filmora Pro, you can still use Kinemaster to erase the background from your green screen footage to achieve the desired portrait look.

**Features:**

**‚óè** Kinemaster is beginner-friendly

**‚óè** Compatible with all Android devices
