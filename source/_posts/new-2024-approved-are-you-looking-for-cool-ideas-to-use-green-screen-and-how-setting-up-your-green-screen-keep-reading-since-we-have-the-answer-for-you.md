## Part 2: Setting Up The Green Screen

Filming with the green screen is getting easier and easier. Anyone can do it, but before you get started, we will share some do's and don'ts to help you get the best results.

In fact, there are many ways to set up a green screen, but the most cost-efficient way is with a green screen fabric. If you are using a green fabric as a DIY green screen, make sure you steam or iron it out, whether taping it to a wall or hanging it off the rack. Keep in mind the green screen should not leave any wrinkles.

It is because wrinkles will make lighting the green screen a nightmare, and uneven lighting will leave you with shadows and disappointing results. It would help if you also pulled the green screen tight to get a seamless background. The better you do with the setup, the easier it will be the key it out later

## Part 3: Lighting a Green Screen

It doesn't matter how nice your green screen is. You won't get good results if you don't light it properly. When you light a green screen, be aware of these things.

* Make sure there are at least six feet of space between you and your green screen; therefore, you're not casting a shadow that cannot be keyed out later.
* Remember, any shadow on the green screen is bad. The lighting on the screen should be flat, even, and one-dimensional meaning. Please don't place the screen leaning at an angle since they'll make it harder to light evenly.
* Do light yourself and your background separately. It will ensure your subject wouldn't bleed into the green, which will create a halo around them.
* After you key out the green screen and lighting, your subjects should emulate the lighting from your final footage. For example, if you know sunlight is coming from the left light, your subject is from the left direction as well.

## Part 4\. Keying out your green screen

Once your footage is good, go into [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and import it into your timeline, then double-click it to find the chroma key menu. However, don't stop there. Clicking the chroma key button is not enough to guarantee perfectly keyed footage, so play around with the offset tolerance edge thickness and edge feather. Lastly, adjust it to make sure your edit looks as good as possible.

## Part 1 **What You Should Put in A Birthday Slideshow**

A **birthday slideshow** combines several images in a chosen software program. But it is not the only thing that makes a fantastic **birthday photo slideshow.** This amazing slideshow doesn't have to be just photos, and you can also create a **birthday wishes slideshow**. For a lasting impression on the celebrant, consider adding these when you **create a birthday slideshow.** A birthday slideshow should have the following:

**●** Background music

Lighten up your video with some background music. A slideshow just displaying photos without music isn't a good idea.

**●** Meaningful Quotes and greetings

You can spice up the birthday video by adding greetings, quotes, and well wishes to let the celebrant know you want to them feel fantastic.

**●** Make the video personal

Add a personal touch to the clip by adding things that matter to the celebrant, whether pictures of them taken while performing a hobby or a favorite place. You can also use photos of their achievements from the time of their last birthday to the present one.

**●** Keep it short and simple

You don't want to drag your audience with too many photos. I think the video would have the most impact when it is short, to the point, and keeps the viewers longing for more.

## Guide to Synchronizing Your Audio And Videos Properly?

Video quality and engagement are prone to impact badly if your audio is not synchronized with the video. This can happen because of technical issues or frame rate mismatches. In case you somehow get unsynchronized audio in the video, you need to use a reliable video editor to cater to this issue. To help you with this issue, this article will provide the best-in-class video editor named Wondershare Filmora.

The key features and the [smooth and sleek interface](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) show that you will have optimized audio synchronization with videos. Along with the auto beat sync feature, we will also discuss some online alternatives that will assist you in syncing audio while online.

## Part 1: Why Should You Synchronize Your Audio And Videos in Video Editing?

Audio and video synchronization is important for presenting a good quality viewing experience. Here are the main reasons you shouldn’t neglect this in your audio and video.

### Lip Sync and Narrative Flow

Synchronizing audio and video is crucial to maintaining the film's narrative flow. Well-synchronized audio and video offer a very smooth experience to the viewers. If the lips and dialogue flow are not well maintained, it can cause distraction in the storytelling. As a result, the real message won't be conveyed to the viewers.

### Viewer Engagement

Do you wish to ensure that your viewers pay full attention to your video and that your message is well conveyed? Your video quality and sound matter the most for the best experience. When the audio and video are well-synced, the viewers pay attention to the content. They are not distracted due to the bad quality of the video.

### Value of Quality Production

A high-quality video with perfect sound quality and proper syncing builds a good perception. If the video quality is bad or does not have proper sync, it can leave a bad impression. Therefore, to enhance the impact of these emotional and dramatic effects, it is imperative to focus on these core things.

### Professionalism and Quality

To make your viewer experience outstanding, focus on paying attention to details. A good quality video represents your professionalism and the standards of your production. When it is synchronized, the viewer will always see this as a high-quality creation.
