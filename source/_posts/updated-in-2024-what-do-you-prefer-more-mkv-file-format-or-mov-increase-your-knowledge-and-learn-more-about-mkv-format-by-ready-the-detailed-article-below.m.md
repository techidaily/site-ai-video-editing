## Part 5\. Which One Is Better? MKV or MOV?

MKV file format is not as commonly used as MOV because of its poor compatibility when it comes to mobile devices. If we talk about the file size, MKV tends to have a larger file size as compared to other used formats. MOV is a container file format that can store multiple media files of different tracks. Whereas MKV is an envelope format, even supporting to store complete movies with subtitles.

MKV format was developed by Matroska, whereas Apple developed the MOV file format. MKV format is good for storing HD videos, and MOV format is great for saving movies.
