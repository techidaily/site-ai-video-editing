## Part 1: How to Utilize Track Mattes in Adobe After Effects?

[After Effects by Adobe](https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html) is a software application dedicated to visual effects and [motion graphics](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for videos. The tool is commonly used in the post-production process of videos. The wide toolset of After Effects can be useful in filmmaking, video gaming, and TV. After Effects offers everything you need to take your creative inspirations to the next level.

* **Motion Graphics:** After Effects lets users animate characters and backgrounds in videos. You can generate 3-dimensional models from 2D animations. After Effects also supports the animation of logos to bring your elements to life.
* **Rotoscoping:** You can remove elements or drop new ones in your video using After Effects. The Roto Brush Tool can easily separate the background and foreground. You can then replace unwanted objects and replace them with new elements.
* **Motion Tracking:** Tracking the movement of an object is quite simple in After Effects. You can pin any element to a moving object. The smooth dynamics can enhance the overall result of the footage.
* **VFX and Special Effects:** After Effects is the perfect tool to add special effects to your videos. Its VFX tool lets users add magic to the footage. You can make objects disappear, control the weather, stabilize your video, and more.

### Using Track Mattes in After Effects

In Adobe After Effects, a track matte is a layer that defines the transparency of another layer. It acts as a stencil, determining which parts of the underlying layer are visible and which are transparent. Track mattes are used for creating various effects such as text animations, transitions, and seamlessly composing multiple layers. After Effects offers four Track Matte options:

![alpha track matte](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-1.jpg)

* **Alpha Matte:** **Alpha matte in After Effects** allows white areas in the matte layer to become visible while black areas become transparent. Effectively, this helps the underlying layer to show through.
* **Alpha Inverted Matte:** In an alpha inverted matte, black areas in the matte layer are visible, and white areas are transparent. It reverses the transparency values to create unique effects.
* **Luma Matte:** A luma matte uses the brightness values of the matte layer to determine visibility. Bright areas in the matte layer are visible, while dark areas are transparent.
* **Luma Inverted Matte:** The luma inverted matte works opposite to the luma matte. The top layer’s dark areas are visible, while bright areas are transparent.

![luma track matte](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-2.jpg)

You can use any of the **track mattes in After Effects** according to your requirements. Following is a step-by-step guide on how to use track mattes:

##### Step 1

To apply a track matte to your video, you must work with two layers. The top layer acts as the alpha or the luminance layer. The bottom layer acts as the fill. Once you have identified the layers, you can proceed to the next step.

##### Step 2

Go to the "Modes" column and open the dropdown menu next to "Layer List." Here, select the layer you wish to use as the track matte.

![select track matte layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-3.jpg)

##### Step 3

You will see two toggle switches once you select your layer. You can use these switches and the available options to set the transparency for the Track Matte. You can add **alpha matte in After Effects** or other types from here.

![use switches to add track matte](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-4.jpg)

## Part 2: Performing Mask Tracking With Adobe After Effects: Reviewing the Steps

Another remarkable feature that After Effects offers is mask tracking. Using **After Effects mask tracking**, you can automatically animate a mask’s position, shape, or path. This is done to match the movement of an object in a video clip. You can now easily deal with complex or fast-moving footage with this feature. To use **Track Mask in After Effects**, you can follow these steps:

##### Step 1

Import the footage you wish to edit in After Effects. Select the clip you wish to track from the timeline. Then, select the “Pen” tool from the top toolbar or press G on your keyboard. Select the area around the object you wish to mask in the footage.

![use pen tool to mark boundary](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-5.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

##### Step 2

Now, open the layer and right-click on the mask name to select "Track Mask." This will open the mask tracker in the tracker panel at the right. Open the dropdown menu next to the "Method" option. Here, you can find a range of options for tracking methods. Choose the one according to your requirements. If the object isn't moving much, you can choose a simple option such as "Position."

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

##### Step 3

Tap the "Analyze Forward" icon and let the tracker analyze the frames in the clip. Once the process has finished, you can restart your clip and set "Mask Mode" from the timeline to "Subtract." This will remove the selected object from the clip.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

##### Step 4

To fill in the details, go to the "Window" menu from the top and select "Content Aware Fill." Once you see the panel on the screen, set the "Alpha Extension" slider to a number of your choice and click on "Generate Fill Layer."
