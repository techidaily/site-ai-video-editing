## Keyframes Interval: Everything You Need To Know | Filmora

Many people may not understand what the **Keyframe Interval** stands for. However, it is a simple concept for video editors where the encoding settings determine the frequency at which the whole picture is transmitted.

The **Keyframe Interval** is responsible for how often a keyframe is generated within the video. A keyframe, also known as an i-frame, is a single frame that contains all of the necessary information for displaying a video. If the Keyframe Interval is set too high, it could lead to visible compression without compromising the quality of a video.

**Keyframe Interval** is essential in video streaming and recording, but it can be confusing. In this guide, we'll help you understand this concept to enable you to create better animations.

## Part 1\. What Is Keyframe Interval

Keyframe Intervals, also known as "Keyframe Frequency" in Adobe Flash Media Live Encoder (FMLE) and vMix or "GOP size" by some encoders, is the frequency at which keyframes are generated in an animated sequence. This is an important parameter to consider when creating animations, as it can impact the animation's file size, quality, and smoothness.

Keyframe Intervals are the distance in time between two keyframes. For example, if an animation is set to every 2 seconds interval and the frame rate is 30 per second, it means that every 60 frames, a keyframe is created.

![keyframe interval in a video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/keyframe-interval-in-a-video.png)

## Part 2\. How Does Keyframe Interval Work?

Keyframes are important in video and animation because they mark specific points in time that can be used to create a smooth and consistent transition between different states or images. The Keyframe Interval is the amount of time that passes between two keyframes.

In order to create a smooth and consistent transition, the Keyframe Interval must be carefully calculated. In a 60-frame-per-second video, a keyframe is recorded every 5 or 300 frames. Delta frames are "difference" frames that provide an incremental change from the previous frame.

Keyframes are different from delta frames in that a higher keyframe value results in a clearer video with fewer transmission artifacts and vice versa.

The Keyframe Interval can be adjusted to create a faster or slower transition between two keyframes. A shorter Keyframe Interval will create a faster transition, while a longer one will create a slower transition.

For example, if you want your transition to look smoother, use a longer interval, like two seconds. Conversely, a zoom effect over a 0.2-second interval will be quicker.

## Part 3\. A concept closely connected to Keyframe Interval - Bitrates

The relationship between keyframes and bitrates is important to understand when creating video content. Keyframes are the frames in a video that are used to define the start and end points of an encoding process. The bitrate measures how much information is being transferred in a given time from one place to another.

When encoding video, keyframes are used to establish a consistent quality throughout the video. The bitrate is then used to determine how much information can be transferred without affecting the quality of the video. Thus, the higher the video's bitrate, the better the quality.

Your mileage may vary regarding this explanation, as different encoders manage bitrates and keyframes in different ways.

For example, if you're using an encoder like Wirecast, you might notice that broadcasting in a still background with someone talking results in a higher quality video as compared to a moving background. This can be reproduced using the same average bitrate and Keyframe Interval between them.

This happens because the delta frames have to share a lot more information to share in each frame in the video with a moving background. When you have an encoder like Wirecast, it's working to keep your stream at an average bitrate. This can result in reduced quality if there is a lot of extra information in the [delta frames.](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/delta-frame#:~:text=In%20interframe%20video%20coding%2C%20a,%2Dframes%20or%20B%2Dframes.)

## Part 4\. What You Need To Know To Set A Right Keyframe Interval

After understanding the important concepts in video editing, let’s see how to set the keyframe level in our videos appropriately.

Most streaming services will automatically set it for you based on your stream's frame rate and bitrate. However, if you want to set the keyframe gap manually, there are a few things you need to keep in mind.

* Set the frame interval at 2 seconds. Do not increase it from 4 seconds.
* Disable the "auto" keyframe feature.
* To allow for b-frames, use an encoding profile higher than baseline and use IDR-based keyframes.

## Part 5\. How To Change The Keyframe Interval On OBS Studio

Above is the basic knowledge of the keyframe interval. Then, how to apply it to your real video-editing work? In this part, we will choose OBS to show you the application process.

OBS Studio is a powerful yet free and open-source screen recorder and live streaming tool for Windows, macOS, and Linux. One of the most useful features of OBS Studio is its ability to change the keyframe interval on the fly without having to restart your recording or stream.

The process for changing the it in OBS Studio has been made more efficient since the classic version. However, some users may have trouble locating the new setting.

Here's how to change the it on OBS Studio:

Step1 Launch the **OBS Studio** on your PC or laptop.

![launching the obs studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/launching-the-obs-studio.png)

Step2 From the bottom right of the screen, open the **"Settings"** menu.

![obs studio settings menu](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/obs-studio-settings-menu.png)

Step3 On the Settings Window, click **"Output"** and configure the output mode to **"Advanced."**

![setting the output mode to advance in obs studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/setting-the-output-mode-to-advance-in-obs-studio.png)

Step4 Finally, edit the **Keyframe Interval,** set it to **2** seconds, and click **"OK"** to save your changes.

![changing the keyframe interval value on obs studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/changing-the-keyframe-interval-value-on-obs-studio.png)

## Part 6\. Will Keyframe Interval Affect Your Video’s Quality?

When you try to set the keyframe gap by yourself, you may feel confused about the difference a higher or lower interval make to your video. Then, wil-l or how it affects your video’s performance?

In a stream, it determines the balance between smoothness and picture quality. A keyframe is a point that determines how often the entire frame is sent, as opposed to just the differences from the previous frame.

Therefore, if you set the Keyframe Interval higher, your video will be more stable with fewer artifacts but requires more bandwidth and processing power. Conversely, a lower Keyframe Interval value causes more artifacts but is less resource intensive.

A lower Keyframe Interval value will result in lower video quality, while a higher keyframe value will result in higher video quality. However, the optimal Keyframe Interval value can vary depending on the specific case.

For instance, you don't need a higher Keyframe Interval for streaming a live video, but you have to use a higher Key Interval value for recording.

## The Audio You Produce Will Inevitably Be Flawed Throughout the Production Process. So, Learn How Adobe Audition Removes Echo to Sound Better Instead of Throwing It Away

With its various potent tools, Adobe Audition enables audio producers to obtain the absolute best results from their recordings. **Adobe Audition removes echo** and will have something that will assist you in bringing everything back under control so that your audio sounds great, regardless of whether the problem is unruly instruments or rowdy hosts.

When recording audio, there are numerous factors to consider. Some spaces can generate more reverb than others, like a cluttered echo effect due to various factors, including reflective surfaces, distant objects, and large, cavernous spaces. This will allow you to **remove echo auditions** for use in podcasts, movies, and musical compositions.

![adobe audition removes echo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/remove-echo-adobe-audition-1.jpg)

## Part 1: How to Remove Echo with Adobe Audition?

Producers may use various compelling features in Adobe Audition to get the most out of your audio. Whether rogue hosts or instruments, Adobe Audition has a solution to help you regain control and make your audio sound great. We'll demonstrate how to eliminate echo in Adobe Audition in this tutorial. **Adobe Auditions can reduce echo** from your video files in a few steps. Want to learn how?

Well, here are the five prime steps.

##### Step1 Pick Audio

Load the project you are currently working on in Audition, and then choose the audio file with the echo that needs removal. Choose a segment of the waveform that is relatively quiet to eliminate some of the ambient noise that your camera or another nearby device may have caused.

Select "Capture Noise Print" from the contextual menu visible when you right-click on the portion. This will assist the Audition in differentiating the primary audio from any background noise.

##### Step2 Begin Noise Removal

Select the noise that you want to get rid of, and then go to "Effects" > "Noise Reduction / Restoration" > "Noise Reduction (process)." After selecting "Select Entire File," play your audio file again to see whether the background noise got eliminated.

You may also make the gating effect more noticeable by going to the Advanced tab and lowering the Spectral Decay Rate. When satisfied with the adjustments, you may make them permanent by clicking the "Apply" button.

![noise reduction and restoration adobe audition](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/remove-echo-adobe-audition-2.jpg)

##### Step3 Add Effects

Next, choose "Dynamics Processing" from the "Effects" menu after clicking on "Amplitude and Compression."

This will load an effect like compression, which you can then utilize to modify the waveform. You should be able to see a diagonal line that extends from one side of the Dynamics Processing display to the other when you first launch the program. It will affect the echo if you drag on this line so tiny that it bends below the default route. You will need to experiment with the line's location and compare the new audio to the old one until you get a satisfactory result.

##### Step4 Apply Effect

After adjusting the Dynamics Processing settings to your satisfaction, ensure that your complete waveform is chosen before clicking the OK button to apply the effect.

Your audio's amplitude, or loudness, will reduce as a result; however, you may restore the original level by selecting "Effects" > "Amplitude and Compression" > "Normalize" from the menu bar.

![amplitude and compression adobe audition](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/remove-echo-adobe-audition-3.jpg)

##### Step5 Clean Up the Audio

Finally, clean up some of the frequencies the echo has produced since they are murky and irritating.

Select "Effects" followed by "Filter and EQ" and then "Parametric Equalizer" from the menu. You will get access to seven primary frequency bands to work with by default and a low-pass and high-pass band devoted to their respective functions. We need a few bands to eliminate those undesirable frequencies in the middle.

When you hear a harsh sound, start by amplifying one band (and the Q value of that band), then gently proceed across the frequency range until you reach the next band. After that, bring the band below 0 dB so that it may remove some of the roughness.

## Part 2: How to Remove Echo in an Easy and Free Way?

Although a great deal of software is available to eliminate echo, the [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) Video Editor is the one we suggest you use.

Here are some advantages of Getting Rid of Echo and Other Background Audio Noise Using Filmora:

* You may adjust the height of the track for more accurate audio manipulation of waveforms.

A drop-down option will appear when you right-click the video in the timeline. Choose "Audio" from the list. Silence detection, audio modification, audio disconnect, and mute are the four choices you'll see. If you wish to separate the audio from the video, choose "Detach Audio" from the drop-down menu.

![remove background noise from the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/remove-echo-adobe-audition-4.jpg)

## Part 3: Recording Tips: How to Record Without Echo?

Now that you know how to use **Adobe Audition to remove echo** let's share some tips to help you record without an echo.

So, here are a few recording tips.

1. **Keep things quiet**. When recording audio, pay more attention to the peaceful sounds in the background. There may be humming from machines with fans, buzzing from lights, or jingling from your pet's collar. Pay attention to where you are recording and find ways to shut down anything else.
2. **Put your mobile phone in airplane mode**. Phones send out signals when they receive calls or do searches in the background that the recording system can pick up. By putting your phones in "airplane mode," you can stop them from making noises during good takes.
3. **Minimize echo**. Set up your recording space, so your voice stays on the walls only a little and back to your microphone. Use things that soak up the sound instead of reflecting it, like a thick rug or a comforter. You can make your voice echo in post-production if you want it to.
4. **Upgrade your microphone**. The hardware you use will be the most significant limit to what you can record. You can improve your recordings by plugging an external microphone into the microphone jack on your camera or with a professional microphone to record the sound separately.
5. **Adjust your levels**. Before you hit the record button, check to see how loud the sound you want to record is. Adjust your levels (the sensitivity of your microphone) until the sound is between -6 DBS and -12 DBS. This range allows your sound room's source to get louder without the recorded sound getting cut off. Don't worry because you can always increase the editing volume.
6. **Start with a sound cue**. If you're recording separate audio that you'll later sync to your video, start your recording with a short, loud sound like a clap or a high-pitched "beep." Later, while editing, finding the part where your video and the additional audio match will be much easier.
7. **Move toward the sound**. Move your microphone close to the sound you want to record. The closer your microphone is to the sound source, the lower you can set your microphone's sensitivity. If you turn down your levels, sounds you don't want to record will also sound less loud.

## Part 4: FAQs

### 1\. How do you remove echo from recording?

**Removing Echo in Audacity with Noise Gate:** Choose the track you want to work on, go to the Effects menu, and look for the Noise Gate plug-in (scroll down a bit). Check to see that Gate is on Select Function. Use the preview to change the settings. When happy with the effect, click OK to apply it to the whole audio file.

### 2\. How do you remove echo from a microphone?

Lessen the volume of your speakers to get rid of the echo. If your microphone or audio device is close to a wall or other surface that reflects sound but doesn't absorb it, you should move the microphone away from the surface or change its direction. Additionally, you can use **Wondershare Filmora** or **Adobe Audition echo removal** technique.

## Conclusion

Hence, as we saw Adobe Audition is a valuable tool for **removing echo auditions** from audio files. Even if you're starting, it takes little time to improve the quality of your recordings. There are many ways to dig deeper and improve your audio quality if you are more ambitious or your recordings have many echoes.

## Part 3: Recording Tips: How to Record Without Echo?

Now that you know how to use **Adobe Audition to remove echo** let's share some tips to help you record without an echo.

So, here are a few recording tips.

1. **Keep things quiet**. When recording audio, pay more attention to the peaceful sounds in the background. There may be humming from machines with fans, buzzing from lights, or jingling from your pet's collar. Pay attention to where you are recording and find ways to shut down anything else.
2. **Put your mobile phone in airplane mode**. Phones send out signals when they receive calls or do searches in the background that the recording system can pick up. By putting your phones in "airplane mode," you can stop them from making noises during good takes.
3. **Minimize echo**. Set up your recording space, so your voice stays on the walls only a little and back to your microphone. Use things that soak up the sound instead of reflecting it, like a thick rug or a comforter. You can make your voice echo in post-production if you want it to.
4. **Upgrade your microphone**. The hardware you use will be the most significant limit to what you can record. You can improve your recordings by plugging an external microphone into the microphone jack on your camera or with a professional microphone to record the sound separately.
5. **Adjust your levels**. Before you hit the record button, check to see how loud the sound you want to record is. Adjust your levels (the sensitivity of your microphone) until the sound is between -6 DBS and -12 DBS. This range allows your sound room's source to get louder without the recorded sound getting cut off. Don't worry because you can always increase the editing volume.
6. **Start with a sound cue**. If you're recording separate audio that you'll later sync to your video, start your recording with a short, loud sound like a clap or a high-pitched "beep." Later, while editing, finding the part where your video and the additional audio match will be much easier.
7. **Move toward the sound**. Move your microphone close to the sound you want to record. The closer your microphone is to the sound source, the lower you can set your microphone's sensitivity. If you turn down your levels, sounds you don't want to record will also sound less loud.

## Part 4: FAQs

### 1\. How do you remove echo from recording?

**Removing Echo in Audacity with Noise Gate:** Choose the track you want to work on, go to the Effects menu, and look for the Noise Gate plug-in (scroll down a bit). Check to see that Gate is on Select Function. Use the preview to change the settings. When happy with the effect, click OK to apply it to the whole audio file.

### 2\. How do you remove echo from a microphone?

Lessen the volume of your speakers to get rid of the echo. If your microphone or audio device is close to a wall or other surface that reflects sound but doesn't absorb it, you should move the microphone away from the surface or change its direction. Additionally, you can use **Wondershare Filmora** or **Adobe Audition echo removal** technique.

## Conclusion

Hence, as we saw Adobe Audition is a valuable tool for **removing echo auditions** from audio files. Even if you're starting, it takes little time to improve the quality of your recordings. There are many ways to dig deeper and improve your audio quality if you are more ambitious or your recordings have many echoes.

But no matter what you do, **Adobe Audition reduces echo**, and you can look forward to recordings without an echo.
