## How To Quickly Create A Screen Print Effect In Photoshop: Detailed Gui

**Screen printing** is a unique method that uses a mesh to transfer ink onto a surface and is commonly used to print designs onto t-shirts or other garments, such as hoodies, tote bags, and even sneakers.

Nowadays, digital means such as Photoshop or Illustrator are used to create the screen print effect, which is achieved by using a layer mask to cut out a portion of the image and filling it with the color or pattern of your choice. The design is then printed onto fabric using water-based [CMYK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMYK%5Fcolor%5Fmodel) (cyan, magenta, yellow, black) inks with inkjet printers.

Suppose you’ve ever wanted to create the screen print effect in Photoshop to give that artistic look to your pictures and embed them in your clothes or other accessories but don’t know where to start or are not familiar with the process. In that case, this guide can surely help you figure this out quickly!

So without any delay, let’s get on with it!

## How To Use Photoshop To Create The Print Effect

Below we’ve provided a detailed guide using Adobe Photoshop to create the print effect with easy step-by-step instructions.

### What Are The Requirements For Creating the Print Effect In PhotoShop?

Before we discuss the complete process of creating the print effect while using Photoshop, here are the resources you have to arrange.

* **Picture of the object:** We will cut out the object from the original image using the Lasso tool and unsaturate it. However, you have to ensure that the object is clear and easily detectable within the picture.
* **A background image:** You will need a background image to add the object to. For this, you can use a solid background, capture scenery, etc.
* **Fonts**: You can also add fonts to the final image to add your ideas or thoughts, making your final project more eye-catching and engaging.
* **Photoshop latest version:** For this tutorial, we will use the Photoshop CC 2021 version, so make sure to download and install it to your computer immediately!

### What Are The Steps To Create Print Effect in PhotoShop?

Now that you know the necessary resources, the following are the **steps to create the print effect in Photoshop**:

Step1 Launch the[Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html) program on your laptop/desktop and click **“Create New”** on the software dashboard. Next, select the page size, such as **“letter,”** and click **“Open.”**

To add the background image, click **"File"** and select **"Open."** Next, select the file and again click **"Open."**

Step5 Select the object using the **"Move Tool"** and drag it to the background image layer.

From the drop-down menu, choose **"Transform"** and click **"Scale."**

Step6 Click the **“T”** icon from the left-hand side menu and set the font style, color, and size. You can also click the **“3D”** option to convert your text to a three-dimensional form.

![click t icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/adding-text-to-the-canvas-in-photoshop.png)

## Tutorial on How to Create an Intro Using Renderforest

Professional video creators are likely aware that starting a video without a suitable introduction is equivalent to sneaking into someone's house without permission. A good intro is a doorbell to let people know you've arrived.

A strong introduction ensures that more people will view your film. Adults have an attention span of about 12 seconds, according to studies from 2000\. It is now only 8 seconds. You have 8 seconds to entice viewers to watch your video, so don't waste it. A captivating introduction will give your content a professional touch and pique your audience's interest. This task is worthwhile if you want to advertise your videos successfully.

These days, you don't necessarily need to hire a pro to make a film if you need one. The majority of the available tools are free. We'll demonstrate in this lesson how to use Renderforest to create a polished video intro. Our intro maker will let you start strong, whether for a fun birthday video or commercial use.

When you're prepared to begin producing your videos, go to Renderforest, register for an account, or sign in if you already have one.

Check out the vast selection of templates under "**Intros and logos**" in the "**Create Video**" section of the navigation menu. Here, you can select the intro you like most and begin altering it, or use our advanced search filters to locate the specific content you require.

![select intros and logos renderforest](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/select-intros-and-logos-renderforest.jpg)

We'll use the "**Swift Glitch Logo**" template for this tutorial, enabling you to present your logo with glitch effects. This template may produce intro and outro movies for presentations, your YouTube channel, lobby backgrounds, and other uses.

Select your preferred template and click the "**Create now**" button to start.

![swift glitch logo renderforest](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/swift-glitch-logo-renderforest.jpg)

Your logo should now be uploaded with a transparent background (PNG). You can upload it in one of three ways: using an image URL directly from your device or selecting an existing file from your "Media library." If you don't already have one, you may make one right away using our logo maker tool, which is also accessible in the editor.

![edit image for intro video renderforest](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/edit-image-for-intro-video-renderforest.jpg)

Write your company's name, tagline, or other brief words in the text field once you've added your logo. To save the changes, don't forget to click "Save and close."

You can select the overall design of your logo and the preferred font style in the "Style" section.

![select style look for intro renderforest](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/select-style-look-for-intro-renderforest.jpg)

Select your preferred color scheme in the "**Color**" section now. You can choose between two color schemes made by our design team and manually selectable custom colors in this section.

Go to the "**Music**" area to select a song for your intro. You can add one or pick from our "**Music collection**." You can record a voice-over in the editor or upload one for your introduction.

Well done! Let's check out your introduction in the "**Preview**" area now. Click "**Free preview**" to check your video and ensure you like the outcome. Click back and tweak the introduction if you need to make any adjustments.

## Competition to Renderforest

Animoto and PowToon are a couple of the site's main rivals. These are excellent online video editing tools, but Renderforest stands out because it is simple to use and enables even novice users to create, share quickly, and download "broadcast grade videos."

**Renderforest vs PowToon**

One of the most popular Renderforest Video alternatives available is PowToon. It's challenging to decide which of these two platforms is superior because they are the best on the market. What you want as a business owner ultimately determines everything.

PowToon is a similar business that focuses on corporate videos but doesn't provide the extra things Renderforest delivers (logo maker, graphic design, mockups, website builder). Pro customers pay $89 per month ($20 if invoiced annually), which is significantly more expensive than the alternative. Fortunately, they offer a complimentary bundle so you can sample the goods.

PowToon offers many more customizing choices than Renderforest because it is a video-based platform, but it will cost you.

Renderforest is a more cost-effective option if you need a range of services for your small business. PowToon is a better option for more prominent firms seeking a professional video creation platform.

Currently, some internet video services might be pricey and time-consuming to use. Renderforest will be welcomed by many small businesses looking for an economical and user-friendly online video editing platform.

Renderforest combines the top tools under a single subscription bundle in terms of features. In the end, you can manage your website, branding, and marketing visual production for less than $25 per month.

Fortunately, you don't have to believe us. You may experience all the main advantages of Renderforest yourself by giving it a try. Check out the pros and drawbacks list in our Renderforest review if you need more assistance.
