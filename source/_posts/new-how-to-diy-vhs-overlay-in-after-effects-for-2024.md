## How to DIY VHS Overlay in After Effects?

The 90s generation is familiar with Video Home System video. Today, Moviemakers use VHS static overlay to give their videos an antique and vintage look.

The VHS glitch overlay has become increasingly popular as it changes the video's theme, tone, and whole look. Let's see how we can add DIY VHS overlay in after effects-

## Part 1：Step by Step DIY VHS Overlay in After Effects?

The retro "VHS Look" has become relatively trendy in recent years. The memories associated with the popular VHS trend has helped the trend make a comeback. Creating this effect in After Effects may seem to be a complicated process if you have not tried it before. But we have made it easier for you to add VHS overlay in Adobe After Effects. Follow the steps to add it in after effects-

Before you begin, download and install VHS preset if you haven't already. Remember that VHS preset only works with After Effects CC 2018 and up. So, make sure you have the recent version of After Effects or the one not older than the 2018 version.

Step 1: To create a VHS look on your video, drop any video of your choice into the project panel and give it a name, let's say, "VCR static overlay". Set the width and height to 1920 and 1080 px, respectively.

![changing composition settings on after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/changing-composition-settings-on-after-effects.jpg)

Step 2: Right-click on your video and select New Comp from Selection. Drag your video to a new composition and then go to Lumetri Color < Basic Correction. Add some contrast. You can set it to 50 or any other number of your choice. Then bring the white level down to -55.

![getting lumetri color effect to get vhs look](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/using-lumetri-color-effect-to-get-vhs-look.jpg)

Then open the Creative tab. Increase the faded film to 40\. Set sharpening to -70\. Bring vibrance to -30.

Note: Here, I changed the number to get the effect I wanted. You can change the numbers and set the values as per your requirements.

Now, click on the Curves option. Drag down the white curve and then align it with the original curve. Move the green curve up a bit and bring down the blue curve. Then comes the Vignette tab. Open it and set the number to -1.

![changing white green and blue curves on after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/changing-white-green-and-blue-curve-on-after-effects.jpg)

Step 3: Now, we will give our video a subtle RGB spit appearance. For that, we need to use the Channel Blur effect twice. First, go to Effect < Blur & Sharpen < Channel Blur. Set red blurriness to 20\. Turn on the repeat edge pixels. Then change the Blur Dimensions from horizontal and vertical to vertical.

![giving rgb split appearance to video with channel blur](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/giving-rgb-split-appearance-to-video-with-channel-blur.jpg)

Step 4: Again, go to Effect < Blur & Sharpen < Channel Blur. Set blue blurriness to 30\. Repeat the process of checking the repeat edge pixels box. Change the Blue Dimensions from horizontal and vertical to horizontal.

Step 5: Next comes giving the video artificial sharpening look using Unsharp Mask. So, go to Effect < Blur & Sharpen < Unsharp Mask. Under the Unmask Mask menu, set the amount to 100 and the radius to 10.

![using unsharp mask to give you video sharpening look](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/using-unsharp-mask-to-give-your-video-sharpening-look.jpg)

Step 6: To add a font to your video, simply search VHS font on Google. Look for the one you want to use in your video and download it. To give your video that authentic VHS-style look, we suggest downloading free VCR OSD Mono font and installing the font on your system.

Step 7: Go to Layer < New < Solid and choose any color. We chose white. Now, under Effects & Presets, search for a number. Drag it to the white solid. Choose the font VCR OSD Mono. You can change the number to time or date. You can also add time manually. Select the text tool, go to the source text, hold alt, and click on the stopwatch. Write "timeToCurrentFormat() and time will be displayed on the video. Let us say we want to see the date on the video instead of time. So, change the time to date. Drag the date to the bottom right of the video to give it the look of an old VHS tape.

If you are a beginner and want a simple VHS effect, you can follow these easy steps and create the VHS video that will transport you back to the 90s.

## Part 2\. How to Add Effects in Premier Pro

### Add Transition Effects

There are several transition effects in Adobe Premiere Pro, and there are countless ways to customize them to fit your film. It is quite easy to locate transitions and add them. The Effects panel, which is accessible from the very top options bar, contains all the transition options. A panel will show up on the right when you choose this. To include a transition, adhere to these procedures.

* Navigate to the Video Transitions area of the Effects panel.

![transition effects in pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/transition-effects-in-pr.jpg)

* Select the desired transition type from any of the available ones When you wish to employ a transition, press and hold it before dragging it to the start or finish of the clip. Alternately, insert it in between two clips to serve as a transition between the start and finish of each.

![drag and apply transitions pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/drag-and-apply-transitions-pr.jpg)

* In Premiere, there are several possible transitions, and some can be more suitable for your project than others.

### Add Visual Effects

The Essential Graphics panel was added by Adobe to Premiere Pro. Users now have a much different workflow than they had with the few prior title panels. Now that everything is in one panel, you can easily create, animate, and use VFX. Some of the VFX shots were just building miniature towns and adding pieces, while others involved the standard green screen removal and backdrop replacement.

* Simply importing and uploading your video and audio files into Premiere Pro is the first step. The procedure of clicking through is fairly simple. Choose "New Project." Press the Media Browser panel button and find the Ultra Key tool by opening the Effects panel.

![press meida browser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/press-meida-browser.jpg)

* The film clip with the green screen should have the Ultra Key added. Utilizing the matte creation and matte cleaning tools, remove the green screen using the ultra key effect. When softening, be cautious to eliminate any sharp edges. All of this can be adjusted under the Effects Control panel.

![ultra key effect pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/ultra-key-effect-pr.jpg)

* Put your backdrop material behind your green screen clip after you have a clear key. You should now be able to view your backdrop behind the keyed layer.

![view backdrop pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/view-backdrop-pr.jpg)

### Add Text Effects

We must be able to write text since it is such a crucial component of video production. Learning how to add text in Adobe Premiere is quite simple; here's an example:

* Select the type tool from the tool window. To add text, click the backdrop and then type. The segment includes a music titled visuals.

Use the Effect Controls panel if you want to add some simple motion to your text. Motion may be added here. You can make rolling credits at the conclusion of your movie or add a rotating effect to your titles using the Properties window as shown below.

![effects control panel pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/effects-control-panel-pr.jpg)

* To Fine-Tune the Text Effects, go to Window > Effect Controls You can see all of the effects I changed in the Essential Graphics panel using this panel. A graphic layer will instantly reflect and be highlighted in the Effect Controls panel when clicked on in the Essential Graphics panel, and vice versa.

### Add Audio Effects

It's simple to work with audio with Premiere Pro. By selecting Clip > Audio Options > Audio Gain (or by hitting "G" on your keyboard), you may fast change audio levels. By adding keyframes to the audio clips in your sequence, you can also get greater audio control.

* First, equalize the audio. You have thus eliminated your stutters and the buzz from the audio track of your speaker. You may use the Parametric Equalizer effect under Effects > Audio Effects to give your voices a last boost of clarity and flow.

![audio effects panel pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/audio-effects-panel-pr.jpg)

* Click on your clip and choose Effect Controls > Custom Setup > Edit to make more customizations.

![crossfade audio transitions pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/crossfade-audio-transitions-pr.jpg)

They eliminate the need for constant manual adjustment by enabling the user to rapidly and simply apply effects, transitions, and other intricate settings. You may utilize effect presets to give your video clips effects. This is a fantastic way to give your project some flare and originality!

These effects include Transitions, VFX, Audio, Videos as well as Advanced level effects like Green Screen. In addition, to know how to add shake effect in premiere pro, we’ve explained in the upcoming steps.

## Part 2\. How to Add Effects in Premier Pro

### Add Transition Effects

There are several transition effects in Adobe Premiere Pro, and there are countless ways to customize them to fit your film. It is quite easy to locate transitions and add them. The Effects panel, which is accessible from the very top options bar, contains all the transition options. A panel will show up on the right when you choose this. To include a transition, adhere to these procedures.

* Navigate to the Video Transitions area of the Effects panel.

![transition effects in pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/transition-effects-in-pr.jpg)

* Select the desired transition type from any of the available ones When you wish to employ a transition, press and hold it before dragging it to the start or finish of the clip. Alternately, insert it in between two clips to serve as a transition between the start and finish of each.

![drag and apply transitions pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/drag-and-apply-transitions-pr.jpg)

* In Premiere, there are several possible transitions, and some can be more suitable for your project than others.

### Add Visual Effects

The Essential Graphics panel was added by Adobe to Premiere Pro. Users now have a much different workflow than they had with the few prior title panels. Now that everything is in one panel, you can easily create, animate, and use VFX. Some of the VFX shots were just building miniature towns and adding pieces, while others involved the standard green screen removal and backdrop replacement.

* Simply importing and uploading your video and audio files into Premiere Pro is the first step. The procedure of clicking through is fairly simple. Choose "New Project." Press the Media Browser panel button and find the Ultra Key tool by opening the Effects panel.

![press meida browser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/press-meida-browser.jpg)

* The film clip with the green screen should have the Ultra Key added. Utilizing the matte creation and matte cleaning tools, remove the green screen using the ultra key effect. When softening, be cautious to eliminate any sharp edges. All of this can be adjusted under the Effects Control panel.

![ultra key effect pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/ultra-key-effect-pr.jpg)

* Put your backdrop material behind your green screen clip after you have a clear key. You should now be able to view your backdrop behind the keyed layer.

* Select the type tool from the tool window. To add text, click the backdrop and then type. The segment includes a music titled visuals.

A graphic layer will instantly reflect and be highlighted in the Effect Controls panel when clicked on in the Essential Graphics panel, and vice versa.

### Add Audio Effects

It's simple to work with audio with Premiere Pro. By selecting Clip > Audio Options > Audio Gain (or by hitting "G" on your keyboard), you may fast change audio levels. By adding keyframes to the audio clips in your sequence, you can also get greater audio control.

* First, equalize the audio. You have thus eliminated your stutters and the buzz from the audio track of your speaker. You may use the Parametric Equalizer effect under Effects > Audio Effects to give your voices a last boost of clarity and flow.

![audio effects panel pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/audio-effects-panel-pr.jpg)

## How to Change Video Resolution in Filmora

With the vast number of devices available in the market today, storing data and video files has become difficult. Frequently in cases where the devices share different forms of resolution, it makes sharing videos a hassle.

In those situations, changing the resolution of your video can be a great idea. It will also allow you to save storage. In this article, you'll adjust the resolution in just a few clicks by Wondershare Filmora. But before we learn how to change a video's resolution, let's look into what a video resolution is!

## Part 1\. What Is a Video Resolution?

A video resolution, in short, is the quality of the video visible. A video is rendered at a specific rate whenever you watch a movie or go to a cinema. A screen is made up of **tiny pixels** and arranged in an order that determines the resolution of a screen.

Video resolution is rendered in a **vertical** and **horizontal** orientation. Therefore, whenever you play a video on YouTube, the resolution scale is available for you to choose from, i.e., **480p**, **720p**, **1080p,** etc.

In most cases, a resolution is dictated by the full abbreviation. So, for example, a **720p** video is **1280 x 720,** and a **1080p** video is a **1920 x 1080** resolution.

![a video resolution dimensions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-1.png)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** The number written before is the number of horizontal pixels in a video. And the number written after is the vertical pixels in a video.

Before we adjust the resolution of a video, let's look at a comparison between different types of video resolution.

## Part 2\. 7 Different Types of Video Resolution

It has been established that a video resolution is not a constant number and changes according to the screen. Scroll below to look at the different forms of video resolutions available!

### 360p

The full resolution is **480 x 360**. This resolution is a minimal video resolution. On a big screen, **360p** will look blurry. That is why a **360p** resolution is the best for smaller devices such as Mobile phones.

### 480p

The full resolution is **853 x 480**. Although an upgrade from the latter, this resolution is available on many devices. It's mainly used in devices such as smaller **TVs**, **laptops,** and **Desktop** computers. It is also available for Burn-in **DVDs**.

### 720p

The full version of the resolution is **1280 x 720**. This resolution is called **HD**, short for High Definition. **720p** quality looks good almost on every device and is also reasonably available.

Most modern devices, such as **Mobile phones**, **Touch Tablets**, **Laptops,** and **PCs,** are calibrated in **720p** Resolution.

![high definition resolution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-2.png)

### 1080p

The resolution in its complete form is **1920 x 1080**. This resolution is also known as **FHD**, short for **Full High Definition. 1080p** resolution is the quality in which many high-quality devices are constructed. As a result, the screens of these devices have a clear and clean display.

![a youtube video in fhd resolution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-3.png)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** It is usually recommended to share videos on social media in 1080p resolution.

### 1440p

This resolution is also called **QHD (Quad HD**). The length and width of this resolution are **2560 x 1440**. As the name suggests, its quality is quad (four times) than that of a standard **720p** resolution.

The screens of devices constructed in this resolution usually have a high-end purpose. For example, this resolution is commonly used in **Gaming monitors** and **High-end smartphones**.

![a gaming monitor in 1440p resolution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-4.png)

### 2160p

The screens constructed in this resolution are considered among the best available in the market. **2160p (3840 x 2160)** is also known as **UHD**, which is short for **Ultra High Definition**. It is also known as **4K** because it offers four times the power of **1080p** or **FHD** (Full High Definition.)

These screens are usually available for high-end competitive gaming monitors or big screen **LCD** and **LED** Television. In addition, some of the flagship smartphones are also built with **4K** resolution.

![difference between hd fhd and 4k resolution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-5.png)

### 4320p

This resolution is also known as **8K**. The length and width of the pixel arrangement are **7680 x 4320**. The pixels are arranged in these screens to offer sixteen times the average power of a **1080p** (FHD) monitor.

This resolution is only available on several devices, such as commercial TVs and monitors. However, this is the most significant resolution available in the modern market. Therefore, even if your monitor cannot support a larger resolution, you can test whether your PC can render an **8K** resolution.

![difference between a 4k and 8k resolution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-6.png)

## Part 3\. Why Do You Need to Change a Video Resolution?

There are numerous cases where you will want to change the resolution of a video. Some of them are described below.

### Decreasing a Video Resolution

Sometimes, you are trying to upload a video from a smartphone. Or, in general, you want to transfer videos to a smartphone. The resolution of your video can play a significant role in the transfer process.

If your video file has a higher resolution, it will take up more space on your phone. As well as, if your PC has a higher resolution, say a **4K** resolution, and your phone is of **1080p** resolution. You might not be able to play it.

To counter situations like these, you need to change the resolution of your video.

### Increasing a Video Resolution

Similarly, there are instances where you would need to change the resolution of your video to increase it.

A good example would be to burn a low-quality **DVD**. To maintain good quality on a **DVD**, you need to increase its resolution before transfer.

Changing the exact resolution of a video is only possible in some cases because you cannot change the precise pixel of the video it is recorded in. But software like Wondershare Filmora allows you to change the resolution of your video easily.

Now let's move to understanding the steps involved in changing the resolution of a video!

## Part 4\. Steps to Change Video Resolution in Filmora

**Note:** Another thing to remember is that most video formats have defaulted to **1080p**. But there are some formats whose resolutions vary according to their style. A good example is a **3GP** format, which is set to **352 x 488** by default.

**Customize the Resolution**

But if you don't find the resolution stable for your device, you can also change this default resolution in simple steps. In the export window, follow the steps mentioned ahead:

* In the preset tab, go to > **settings**.
* In the video tab, click on the **resolution**.
* In the **drop-down** menu, select the resolution that you desire.

**Exporting a Video to a Specific Device**

Selecting a format for your video can help if you want to change the resolution. But in cases where you want to export a video to a particular mobile device. Such as an **iPhone** or an **iPad**, you can select the device export option.

## Conclusion

Rapid video technology advancement is leading to the development of higher-resolution devices. The greatest resolution in the modern day is the **8K**; soon, everyone will be using 8K devices. So, it is beneficial to learn how to change a video's resolution.

By following the steps mentioned in this article, you can now change the resolution of your video using Filmora.

Before we adjust the resolution of a video, let's look at a comparison between different types of video resolution.

## Part 2\. 7 Different Types of Video Resolution

It has been established that a video resolution is not a constant number and changes according to the screen. Scroll below to look at the different forms of video resolutions available!

### 360p

The full resolution is **480 x 360**. This resolution is a minimal video resolution. On a big screen, **360p** will look blurry. That is why a **360p** resolution is the best for smaller devices such as Mobile phones.

### 480p

The full resolution is **853 x 480**. Although an upgrade from the latter, this resolution is available on many devices. It's mainly used in devices such as smaller **TVs**, **laptops,** and **Desktop** computers. It is also available for Burn-in **DVDs**.

### 720p

The full version of the resolution is **1280 x 720**. This resolution is called **HD**, short for High Definition. **720p** quality looks good almost on every device and is also reasonably available.

Most modern devices, such as **Mobile phones**, **Touch Tablets**, **Laptops,** and **PCs,** are calibrated in **720p** Resolution.

![high definition resolution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-2.png)

### 1080p

The resolution in its complete form is **1920 x 1080**. This resolution is also known as **FHD**, short for **Full High Definition. 1080p** resolution is the quality in which many high-quality devices are constructed. As a result, the screens of these devices have a clear and clean display.

![a youtube video in fhd resolution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-3.png)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** It is usually recommended to share videos on social media in 1080p resolution.

### 1440p

This resolution is also called **QHD (Quad HD**). The length and width of this resolution are **2560 x 1440**. As the name suggests, its quality is quad (four times) than that of a standard **720p** resolution.

The screens of devices constructed in this resolution usually have a high-end purpose. For example, this resolution is commonly used in **Gaming monitors** and **High-end smartphones**.

![a gaming monitor in 1440p resolution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-4.png)

### 2160p

The screens constructed in this resolution are considered among the best available in the market. **2160p (3840 x 2160)** is also known as **UHD**, which is short for **Ultra High Definition**. It is also known as **4K** because it offers four times the power of **1080p** or **FHD** (Full High Definition.)

These screens are usually available for high-end competitive gaming monitors or big screen **LCD** and **LED** Television. In addition, some of the flagship smartphones are also built with **4K** resolution.

![difference between hd fhd and 4k resolution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-5.png)

### 4320p

This resolution is also known as **8K**. The length and width of the pixel arrangement are **7680 x 4320**. The pixels are arranged in these screens to offer sixteen times the average power of a **1080p** (FHD) monitor.

This resolution is only available on several devices, such as commercial TVs and monitors. However, this is the most significant resolution available in the modern market. Therefore, even if your monitor cannot support a larger resolution, you can test whether your PC can render an **8K** resolution.

![difference between a 4k and 8k resolution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-6.png)

## Part 3\. Why Do You Need to Change a Video Resolution?

There are numerous cases where you will want to change the resolution of a video. Some of them are described below.

### Decreasing a Video Resolution

Sometimes, you are trying to upload a video from a smartphone. Or, in general, you want to transfer videos to a smartphone. The resolution of your video can play a significant role in the transfer process.

If your video file has a higher resolution, it will take up more space on your phone. As well as, if your PC has a higher resolution, say a **4K** resolution, and your phone is of **1080p** resolution. You might not be able to play it.

To counter situations like these, you need to change the resolution of your video.

### Increasing a Video Resolution

Similarly, there are instances where you would need to change the resolution of your video to increase it.

A good example would be to burn a low-quality **DVD**. To maintain good quality on a **DVD**, you need to increase its resolution before transfer.

Changing the exact resolution of a video is only possible in some cases because you cannot change the precise pixel of the video it is recorded in. But software like Wondershare Filmora allows you to change the resolution of your video easily.

Now let's move to understanding the steps involved in changing the resolution of a video!
