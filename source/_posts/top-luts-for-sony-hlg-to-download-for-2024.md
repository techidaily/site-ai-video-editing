## Introduction

It will be much fun if you get to assort most of your GIF files and turn them into full-length streaming videos.

Although both AVI and GIF are two commonly used file formats, they are different. First of all, GIF stands for Graphical Interchange Format, and it is an image format that can store several consequent or dis-consequent pictures into an animated file.
