This is to avoid unnecessary errors that will make the process troublesome.

## Part 1: Backup Your Original Video

Making several backups is perhaps the most critical thing you can do for your project. Whether your computer dies suddenly or your editing application crashes, you'll have a point to fall back on if you have a backup.
