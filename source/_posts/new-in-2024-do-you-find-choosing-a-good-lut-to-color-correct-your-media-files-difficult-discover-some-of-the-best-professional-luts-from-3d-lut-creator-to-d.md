**Another way to combine multiple Xvid files into one using Avidemux**

There are many different video formats, and it can be difficult to meet some of them without knowing exactly what they are. For example, Xvid files are Xviden-encoded video file formats that use the Xvid codec, rather than the formats you are used to in everyday life like the MP4 format. This program is used to compress and decompress video to the compression standard MPEG4 ASP, save disk space and file transfer speed, and open this type of file. Many modern DVD and Bluray players can play XVID files. Like a PC, any software program that can decode MPEG4 ASP-encoded video can play XVID files.

 This article describes how to combine multiple Xvid files into one using Avidemux, a free video editor and encoder that supports multiple file types. Merging common video and video in Avidemux is not a big deal, but you can learn how to merge different Xvid files with this editor from the detailed article.

 Therefore, first you need to change some of the settings for the selected video. Frame rate etc. Next, you need to open the first video clip, find and open the menu file option that displays the drop-down menu at the top left of the screen, and select Attach.

**Step 1:**

**Adding Xvid Video to a program in batch**

Before importing an Xvid file, you need to make sure that you have the latest version of Joyoshare Video Joiner installed on your computer. Then it's up to you to upload the Xvid video. There are two options. Touch the Open File icon in the lower left corner, or drag directly in bulk as needed.

 **Step 2**:

 **Finish setting the output format**

When all the Xvid video files are loaded, click Format in the lower right corner of the main screen and select the output format. Formatting can be set in "Fast Mode" or "Encode Mode". The only difference between the two modes is that the former is a lossless mode, which provides a 60x speed solution that stitches multiple Xvid files in their original quality, but the output format must be the same as the source video. The latter is a customizable mockup that allows you to choose any format as the output format and customize the output quality by simply clicking on the gear icon.

**Step 3:**

**Cut Xvid Video File When you have finished setting the**

 output format, tap OK to save and you will be returned to the first interface. You can now crop Xvid videos as needed by simply dragging the timeline.

**Step 4**

**Editing a Xvid file in encode mode**

The Joyoshare Video Joiner is equipped with a video editor that works only in encode mode. Therefore, if you want to combine Xvid files, then click the Edit icon next to the Xvid file you just added to crop, crop, mirror, adjust brightness, watermark, apply effects, subtitles, etc. You can edit the video.

**2 Ways to Merge/Combine Xvid Files on Android using Wave.video (paid software)**

Wave.video allows you to easily combine two or more video clips or images to create longer videos.

To do this, go to https: //wave.video, click the New Video button and select Blank Video.

![combine-several-xvid-files-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/combine-several-xvid-files-7.jpg)

**Another way to combine multiple Xvid files into one using Avidemux**

There are many different video formats, and it can be difficult to meet some of them without knowing exactly what they are. For example, Xvid files are Xviden-encoded video file formats that use the Xvid codec, rather than the formats you are used to in everyday life like the MP4 format. This program is used to compress and decompress video to the compression standard MPEG4 ASP, save disk space and file transfer speed, and open this type of file. Many modern DVD and Bluray players can play XVID files. Like a PC, any software program that can decode MPEG4 ASP-encoded video can play XVID files.

 This article describes how to combine multiple Xvid files into one using Avidemux, a free video editor and encoder that supports multiple file types. Merging common video and video in Avidemux is not a big deal, but you can learn how to merge different Xvid files with this editor from the detailed article.

The latter is a customizable mockup that allows you to choose any format as the output format and customize the output quality by simply clicking on the gear icon.

**Step 3:**

**Cut Xvid Video File When you have finished setting the**

 output format, tap OK to save and you will be returned to the first interface. You can now crop Xvid videos as needed by simply dragging the timeline.

## Does Your Video Shake so Much? Shaking Movement on Your Camera Is Often Inevitable, Especially if You Don’t Use a Camera Stabilizer or a Camera with No Built-In Image Stabilization. As a Result, It Can Make Your Video Look Distracting and Difficult to Watch

Does your video shake so much? Shaking movement on your camera is often inevitable, especially if you don't use a camera stabilizer or a camera with no built-in image stabilization. As a result, it can make your video look distracting and difficult to watch.

But you don't need to worry. You can use a stabilization tool in [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). A stabilization tool is a feature that can help to correct for camera shake and other types of movement. If you are a handheld shooter, you will find this tool extremely helpful.

## Part 1: When do you need to stabilize your video?

Now, let's talk about when you should stabilize your video. If you're shooting something that is moving, like people or animals, you will definitely want to stabilize your video. This will help ensure that the video is smooth and steady.

Another time you may want to stabilize your video is if you're shooting in a low-light situation. It will help to ensure that your video is not too shaky.

Finally, if you're shooting a video that's going to be displayed on a large screen, you may want to stabilize your video. Stabilizing your video will help ensure the output is crisp and clear.

## Part 2: How to stabilize your video with Filmora

Filmora has a stabilization feature that can help to smooth your video and make it look more professional. If you haven't installed Filmora yet, you can download it for free.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

So, should you have a wobble movement in your video, follow these steps to make it smoother in no time:

Step1 Launch Filmora 11 and **create a new project**.

Step2 Import your video to Filmora.

![import your video to filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/stabilization-tool-in-filmora-1.jpg)

Step3 After you import your video to Filmora, the Stabilization must have been off. So, **switch the Stabilization toggle on**, then a loading bar will start going up to analyze the clip.

![switch the stabilization toggle on](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/stabilization-tool-in-filmora-2.jpg)

Step4 Once it finishes analyzing, the smooth level will default to 10\. See the preview whether you like how it turns out.

**Before**

![before finish analyzing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/stabilization-tool-in-filmora-3.gif)

**After**

![after finish analyzing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/stabilization-tool-in-filmora-4.gif)

Please note that the center point of your image will always be the most stable. The more shaky a clip is, the more it will crop into that image.

If you are unsatisfied with the default setting, increasing the Smoothness Level will result in more cropping to the image. On the contrary, if you put the Smoothness Level down to zero, you are no longer cropping into the image, but the result won't be as smooth.

Should the cropping bother you, such as it crops the subject's hair out of the frame, you can adjust it with **Edge Processing**.

If you change it to **None**, you will see the black bars that simulate how it stabilizes the clip. Try to hit play on the preview screen, and then you can see more clearly how the tool keeps the center of the frame to make it stable and less shaky.

As **Reflect** is the default, the **Extend** uses artificial intelligence to extend the pixels, as you are often aware in Photoshop.

Besides the three, there is also the **Tile** option. Each of them would give a different result. You can try and use the one that works best for you.

Step3 After you import your video to Filmora, the Stabilization must have been off. So, **switch the Stabilization toggle on**, then a loading bar will start going up to analyze the clip.

Step4 Once it finishes analyzing, the smooth level will default to 10\. See the preview whether you like how it turns out.

**Before**

**After**

Please note that the center point of your image will always be the most stable. The more shaky a clip is, the more it will crop into that image.

If you are unsatisfied with the default setting, increasing the Smoothness Level will result in more cropping to the image. On the contrary, if you put the Smoothness Level down to zero, you are no longer cropping into the image, but the result won't be as smooth.
