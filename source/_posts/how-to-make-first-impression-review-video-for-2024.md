## Leveraging the Vectorscope for Better Color Correction in Premiere Pro

Our eyes process colors differently. When two people look at the same picture, they may see different shades of colors. In post-production, Vectorscopes help to color grade and make sure you get your images exactly right. This means that you will process the exact color that you want across devices. **Premiere Vectorscope** is a great choice for anyone looking to correct and grade colors. Using Vectorscope Premiere allows you to get quantitative data about your image for a more accurate assessment of colors within the film. In this article, we explore what comprises Premiere Pro Vectorscope and how to use them in video editing.

**Color Correction Editor** An easy-to-use video editor helps you make color correction and color grading experience for videos!

## **Part 1\. Vectorscope: What is It and How to Read**

Vectorscopes provide a great post-production way for color correction. It is video scope that provides greater data about the color properties of an image. Another way to look at it is that a Vectorscope is a circular graph, which monitors the following information of an image. By looking at it, you can measure saturation outward from the center while hue is measured in a circular pattern.

The Vectorscope contains markings indicating the degree of saturation and hue in an image. The distance of the markings from the center indicates how saturated the color is in your image. In simple terms, the further the markings, the more saturated the color. The two main options of Vectorscope are HLS and YUV. The HLS displays the hue, lightness, saturation, and signal information at a glance. On the other hand, the YUV mode contains several color boxes, giving accurate levels of hue and saturation.

![vectorscope](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/demystifying-the-vectorscope-a-comprehensive-guide-for-premiere-pro-color-correction-1.JPG)

Vectorscopes are useful to filmmakers and editors to ensure greater conformity in a film as they transition from one shot to the next. When the camera captures an image with too much saturation, using a Vectorscope helps to reduce the said saturation. This makes Vectorscope a useful feature for color correction and color grading. Color correction involves altering the colors of an image within a film to provide consistency and tone for the film. On the other hand, color grading is more like a supercharged version of color correction. It refers to altering a film so that it matches a tone or theme. Since the two, grading and correction are important, more video editing will use a combination of both.

### **How to Read a Vectorscope**

Learning how to read a Vectorscope will make your video editing fun and easier. The best way is to view the Vectorscope in relation to the color wheel. When using Premiere Vectorscope, the colors are nicely labeled for anyone to understand. You only need to understand the primary colors of saturation and hue to accurately read a Vectorscope.

![reading vectorscope](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/demystifying-the-vectorscope-a-comprehensive-guide-for-premiere-pro-color-correction-2.JPG)

The hue color is the direction to which the marketer points. For instance, a marker pointing toward the boxes labeled “R” indicates that the hue is predominantly red. On the other hand, the saturation correlates to the length of the marker. The image is more saturated when the marker is furthest from the center of the wheel.

Keep note of the two boxes in each main color. The box that is close to the center indicates 75%, and you will normally avoid the marker extending beyond this first box. Any marketer that extends beyond this is known as non-broadcast safe or illegal colors. Although you may need to go beyond the first box in some projects for stylistic reasons, the general rule of thumb is to avoid that.

Without proper calibration, your images may end up looking too red or too blue. They will not look natural at all and will affect the overall quality of your video. Therefore, using the features within the vectorsope will help you color-grade your images to perfection.

## **Part 2\.** **[Vectorscope in Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html): A Brief Guide**

Just like many other video editing software, Adobe Premiere Pro offers Vectorscope to help in post-production. The best way to look at Vectorscope in Premiere Pro is to use the Color Correction workspace. Once you have launched the software, Click Window, followed by Workspace, and then Color Correction. Access the reference monitor directly to deliver the program.

The reference monitor will first display composite video. Clicking on the setting icon allows you to access the panel and choose the video scope you want to use. Now, this is how you use the Vectorscope in Premiere Pro:

### **1\. Reading a Vectorscope on Premiere Pro**

A Vectorscope is similar to a color wheel. It displays colors in the same places as the wheel, with cyan to the bottom right and red to the top left. When you see a dot or line in the Vectorscope, you can tell it is giving you information about the color or chrominance of a shot. Essentially, this information is the hue (specific color) and the saturation (the strength of that hue).

![color wheel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/demystifying-the-vectorscope-a-comprehensive-guide-for-premiere-pro-color-correction-3.JPG)

As you examine the Vectorscope, you get to see how strong a particular color is by the length of the line from the center of the wheel. A longer line indicates that the color is more saturated. However, all Vectorscopes have small color targets. The Vectorscope points are lined with a drop-down used to read the scope. The default is set to 75%, which is a good limit for a typical broadcast system.

![drop-down](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/demystifying-the-vectorscope-a-comprehensive-guide-for-premiere-pro-color-correction-4.JPG)

### **2\. Adjusting Skin Tones**

A commonly used feature of the Premier Pro Vectorscope is the Skin Tone Line. With this feature, you get the line on the scope between the Yellow and the Red sections at about 10.30 or 11 o’clock position.

![skin tones](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/demystifying-the-vectorscope-a-comprehensive-guide-for-premiere-pro-color-correction-5.JPG)

The Vectorscope skin tone line represents the color of blood flowing through the skin. You can use this line to check the accuracy of skin tone color representation regardless of the ethnicity of the person you’re filming. In particular, video images are more accurate

The major problem is figuring out how to look at skin tones in a shot with many other colors. With the skin tons line in Premiere Pro, color correction becomes easy and quick. You only need to use a garbage matte, which is found under video effects then keying. Adjust the points so that they cover the skin of the person on the shot, then look at the Premiere Pro Vectorscope to see your end results.

## How Can Filmora Create an Audio Visualizer Project for a Song? All Steps, From Launching the App to Editing the Text, Are Detailed Here

While editing videos, the ability to edit the audio in the background is one of the key ingredients of successful video making. For this purpose, the Audio Visualizer as a resource on [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is a high-quality option. With this feature, users can typically add audio effects to their video soundtrack with AI technology, aligning the sound properly with the video.

It is possible to choose out of 25 different effects for audio visualization on this software for customized audio effects. You can also drag visual-based effects to the file, which the software mechanism will automatically configure with the sound cohesively.

While this is useful as a functionality, users naturally have concerns about how to handle the Audio Visualization effect to work on video projects and podcasts. Let's learn the main steps for this process in this post, explained stage by stage in detail.

## Launch the App

The first step is downloading and installing the software into your device. For this, go to the official website of Wondershare Filmora 11 and click on the Free Download button at the top of the screen. Depending on your device's operating system, i.e., macOS or Windows, the relevant software installer will download automatically into your device.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

![relevant software installer will download](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-audio-visualizer-in-filmora-easy-1.jpg)

You must click on the installed APK file and double-click the Agree button for the process to continue. After you carry out the instructions that appear, the software will begin installing into your device. Wait for the software to install completely, and then the main homepage will open automatically on your screen.

![the homepage will open automatically](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-audio-visualizer-in-filmora-easy-2.jpg)

Make sure that the software is in the 11.3.0 or higher version. Because the feature for audio visualization will not work on any of the older software versions. So, if you have the Filmora9 software, upgrade it to the Wondershare Filmora 11.

![upgrade to filmora 11](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-audio-visualizer-in-filmora-easy-3.jpg)

## Add the music file

Next, you should click on the "Create New Project" button from the homepage. Then, tap on the "Click here to import media" section when it opens and add the file to the software window from your internal storage.

You can also click on the My Media tab and choose Project Media. Go to All Templates and download the audio track you will make changes to. Then, drag the audio file you have imported down to the editor timeline. Add a stock image from your Stock Media section.

![drag the audio file](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-audio-visualizer-in-filmora-easy-4.jpg)

You can also add another pre-made background cover image that you created beforehand from the device, if available. Drag that to the editor timeline as well above the song clip you moved there and tap on the slider. Pull the slider to fit the full size of the audio length for the background alignment. Right-click on the file, and the editing window will open for basic video editing. Make changes like adjusting the Scale, Position, Opacity, etc. Press OK.

![make changes like adjusting the scale](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-audio-visualizer-in-filmora-easy-5.jpg)

## Add the Audio Visualizer Effects

Next, you should go to the Effects tab. When this window opens, you should tap on the Filmstock tab beside the Default one for advanced features like Audio Visualizer. Click on it next.

When you tap on it, you see a list of different visualizer effects in a collection. Please choose one of them that you prefer and download it.

![tap on the filmstock tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-audio-visualizer-in-filmora-easy-6.jpg)

After that, you must drag the visualizer effect selected from the collection to the editing timeline above the background image you added previously. Again, use the slider on the clip to drag it forward and fit the size of both the music clip and the image.

## Edit the Audio Visualiser

The next step of the process that you must focus on is editing the audio visualizer properly for the song and its background cover. For this, you must double-click on the audio visualizer effect you dropped in the timeline- this will open the editing window for the clip.

Here, make some changes to the quality of the audio visualizer as you prefer. Adjustment options available here include position, scale, Opacity, and Intensity. Drag the sliders for them to adjust the visualizer effect as needed. Change the color of the visualizer as well from here, and then use the slider on the visualizer effect on the timeline to see the effect change. Press the OK button after you are done.

![make changes to the quality of the audio visualizer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-audio-visualizer-in-filmora-easy-7.jpg)

## Add the Portrait Image

Go to the My Media tab next to get the Portrait image into the project. If you previously imported the image to Filmora, drag it to the timeline. Or, you can add it later by clicking on the Import Media button and adding the Portrait photo from your device.

When it is available on the media window, hold, drag, and then drop it above the visualizer. Like in the case of the previous parts, use the slider end of this image in the timeline to drag it and fit the size of the other clips.

![adding the portrait image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-audio-visualizer-in-filmora-easy-8.jpg)

Next, the editing window for that will open. Make changes to the size and placement of the portrait photo, with elements like scale, position, rotation, opacity, etc. Move the photo in the preview window to the section where you want the image to appear. Then, tap the OK button under the window.

![tap the ok button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-audio-visualizer-in-filmora-easy-9.jpg)

## Add the overlapping visualizer effect

After adding the portrait, you can add another audio visualizer effect to the project. For this, again, tap on the Effects tab and choose the Filmstock option. Select Audio Visualizer and click on the circular visualizer effect from the list. Repeat the dragging and dropping step for this effect as well.

On the timeline, you have to adjust the visualizer effect over the portrait photo to match the length of the previous clips. Then, please tap on the portrait photo in the timeline again and adjust its appearance, like reducing the image size to fit the second visualizer effect size.

![reduce size of image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-audio-visualizer-in-filmora-easy-10.jpg)

After fitting the image within the visualizer, click on the Mask tab in the same editor window. Choose the circular shape preset and scroll down to find the adjustment parameters like position, scaling, horizontal/vertical lining, etc. Keep making the changes per your needs, like fitting the image to the same size as the circular visualizer.

Move it to place the image inside the visualizer. After you are done, press the OK button.

## Add a Title

An attractive title is the next element you should add to the project. You have to click on the Titles tab from the top toolbar. Choose the titles option from the drop-down list and move it to the timeline below. As you did with the previous elements you added to the timeline, move the slider onward and fit it with the previous one's length.

Next, you should click on the Title in the timeline you added for the Title editing window to open. Here, you have to tap on the Advanced button.

![tap on the advanced button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-audio-visualizer-in-filmora-easy-11.jpg)

In the next window that opens, tap on the Customize tab and add the song name in the title area. Make other font-related changes as you see fit, like the font size, font style, indentation, color, etc. Tap on the add text icon in this window to get another text field in which you can add the artist's name. Make sure to reduce the size of it to lower than that of the main song title text.

![tap on the add text icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-audio-visualizer-in-filmora-easy-12.jpg)

Following that, you can tap on the shape icon to add a shape to the project by adding the name of the streaming service provider, like Apple Music or Spotify. Choose the Rectangle option, for example, and move it to the side of the screen. Click on the shape editing option and adjust the border size of it to three.

If you want to create a rounded-off edge look to the rectangle shape, tap on the small yellow icon that you will see at its edge. Move it slightly to adjust. Then, type the information into the shape text field, like "Listen on Spotify," and make font and shape size adjustments. After you have completed this step, press the OK button below.

## Check and Export

After making the changes, you will return to the main editor timeline. Press the play button under the preview window to see how the final project looks, and tap on the Export button to download it offline. Make changes to the exporting file after clicking on the Local tab and choosing the file format you will download it as. Then, press Export again.

![press the play button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-audio-visualizer-in-filmora-easy-13.jpg)
