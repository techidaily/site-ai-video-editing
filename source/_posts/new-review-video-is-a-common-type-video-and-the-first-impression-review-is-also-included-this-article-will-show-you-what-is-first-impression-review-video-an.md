* It does not offer exporting in frame rate higher than 60fps.

### 3\. InVideo ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.filmrapp.videoeditor&hl=en&gl=US))

Instead of an **Efectum app download,** discover possibilities with InVideo. This app is an expert in creating aesthetic stop motions, ads, reels, and tutorials. It can speed up and speed down your clips. In addition, you can make a boomerang of shots and add cinematic transitions in clips. From its extensive music library, users can add music or import voiceovers.

![invideo video slow motion app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/reviewing-efectum-app-and-alternatives-7.jpg)

 Pros

* Utilize over 150 stickers, filters, and text templates to level up your projects.
* Record new footage with a built-in 60fps frame rate and 4k resolution.

 Cons

* The best footage stock and other assets are reserved for subscribed users.

### 4\. VN-Video Editor & Maker ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/is/app/vn-video-editor/id1343581380)/[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.frontrow.vlog&hl=en&gl=US))

If searching for an alternative like the **Efectum app, download without the watermark**; use this app. It satisfies the needs of professionals and amateur video editors with high-quality videos. VN’s speed curve is more like Adobe Premiere Pro’s speed ramping. Thus, you can adjust the playback of your video with 6-speed adjustment curves.

![vn video editor and maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/reviewing-efectum-app-and-alternatives-8.jpg)

Another good option in place of the **Efectum app** that you can consider is InShot. This platform offers some AI features such as auto-caption, smart tracking, and AI effects. InShot enables you to make smooth slow-mo with a speed ramping feature and keyframe editing. Plus, you can create multi-layered videos with filters, transitions, and AI effects.

![video editor and maker inshot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/reviewing-efectum-app-and-alternatives-9.jpg)

 Pros

* Make photo collages with AI effects and blend screenshots with AI context recognition.
* Export videos in 4K resolution to YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, and WhatsApp.

 Cons

* Impose a watermark on videos unless you pay to remove it, which annoys many users.

Videos related to earning can get more views and become more viral among people. Any detailed description of any earning app/ small startup ideas can be helpful. The video ideas generator tool can give more suggestions related to such trending topics.

### 10Idea 10: Sports related ideas

A large population is into sports, like football and cricket. People enjoy watching and playing these sports regularly from young to old age. It will be a good idea if you can try videos on sports. Using the **video generator AI,** you can generate animation videos playing cricket and add small clips of old generation cricket players as examples. You may also create small teaching videos on other sports for children. Through animation, giving the latest sports updates worldwide will also be a better idea to get more views for videos.

### 11Idea 11: Current Affairs Related Videos

Current affairs and general knowledge-related videos will be more helpful to people preparing for competitive exams as most people are learning through the internet rather than from books. If you can take a specific subject and give a detailed description of its past and current updates, it can be helpful for many people. And also, while doing such information-related videos, you get a chance to research it, and it will help improve your knowledge of the subject and searching skills.

### 12Idea 12: Gadget And Product Review Ideas

Reportedly, there has been a tremendous increase in new products related to mobiles, laptops, TV, other hardware tools, skin, hair care products, etc. You can take a specific product and create innovative ideas on how to use the product using animations/ cartoons and give a short review of the product. Through this, you can earn as you promote a company product, and people will know about the product. This is beneficial in both ways. If the product is related to electronic gadgets, make a video explaining the product's features and how to use them. If it is hair or skincare related, include the ingredients used, advantages of the product, how to use the product, and any disadvantages, etc. Based on the product you choose, the content of the video should change.
