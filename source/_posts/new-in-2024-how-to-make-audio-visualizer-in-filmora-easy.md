While editing videos, the ability to edit the audio in the background is one of the key ingredients of successful video making. For this purpose, the Audio Visualizer as a resource on [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is a high-quality option. With this feature, users can typically add audio effects to their video soundtrack with AI technology, aligning the sound properly with the video.

While this is useful as a functionality, users naturally have concerns about how to handle the Audio Visualization effect to work on video projects and podcasts. Let's learn the main steps for this process in this post, explained stage by stage in detail.

## Launch the App

The first step is downloading and installing the software into your device.

![upgrade to filmora 11](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-audio-visualizer-in-filmora-easy-3.jpg)

## Add the music file

Next, you should click on the "Create New Project" button from the homepage. Then, tap on the "Click here to import media" section when it opens and add the file to the software window from your internal storage.

You can also click on the My Media tab and choose Project Media. Go to All Templates and download the audio track you will make changes to. Then, drag the audio file you have imported down to the editor timeline. Add a stock image from your Stock Media section.

You can also add another pre-made background cover image that you created beforehand from the device, if available. Drag that to the editor timeline as well above the song clip you moved there and tap on the slider. Pull the slider to fit the full size of the audio length for the background alignment. Right-click on the file, and the editing window will open for basic video editing. Make changes like adjusting the Scale, Position, Opacity, etc. Press OK.

## Add the Audio Visualizer Effects

Next, you should go to the Effects tab. When this window opens, you should tap on the Filmstock tab beside the Default one for advanced features like Audio Visualizer. Click on it next.

When you tap on it, you see a list of different visualizer effects in a collection. Please choose one of them that you prefer and download it.

After that, you must drag the visualizer effect selected from the collection to the editing timeline above the background image you added previously. Again, use the slider on the clip to drag it forward and fit the size of both the music clip and the image.

## Edit the Audio Visualiser

The next step of the process that you must focus on is editing the audio visualizer properly for the song and its background cover. For this, you must double-click on the audio visualizer effect you dropped in the timeline- this will open the editing window for the clip.

Here, make some changes to the quality of the audio visualizer as you prefer. Adjustment options available here include position, scale, Opacity, and Intensity. Drag the sliders for them to adjust the visualizer effect as needed. Change the color of the visualizer as well from here, and then use the slider on the visualizer effect on the timeline to see the effect change. Press the OK button after you are done.

Go to the My Media tab next to get the Portrait image into the project. If you previously imported the image to Filmora, drag it to the timeline. Or, you can add it later by clicking on the Import Media button and adding the Portrait photo from your device.

Color is abundant in our life. Our moods, sensations, and perceptions, as well as our decision-making processes, are all influenced by color. Emotion evokes by color. It affects our perception, eliciting subconscious or conscious responses in the human brain. Color is perhaps the most robust tool at your disposal as a designer because of its influential and communicative nature.

![color combinations for designers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/matching-color-combinations-01.JPG)

Although not everyone is born with a keen sense of color or a natural aptitude for graphic design, there are methods and principles you can employ to select the best **color that matches together** to make a strong impression and achieve your desired effect. Fortunately, we've got you backed up. The ten best **colors that match everything** are listed below to help you create your next design.

#### In this article

01 [What is a color combination?](#Part 1)

02 [Types of color combinations](#Part 2)

03 [Two-color combination vs. Three-color logo combinations](#Part 3)

04 [How to apply color combinations to your designs?](#Part 4)

## Part 1 What is Color Combination?

Color Theory is an art when it comes to playing with colors. It explains how people perceive color and the visual effects of colors mixing, pairing, and contrasting with one another. Designers use a color wheel and considerable collected knowledge about human psychology, society, and more to pick the perfect **colors that match everything**. Color is a crucial, if not the most important, feature of design since it may affect the meaning of the text, how people move across a layout, and how they feel. You may be more intentional in generating graphics that affect you if you understand color theory.

## Part 2 Types of Color Combinations

Learning how different **colors match together** is essential for successful color combinations. Studying the color wheel and color harmonies (what works, what doesn't, and how color communicates) will help you blend colors, establish a stronger brand, and share more effectively with your designers and printers.

**The color wheel contains:?**

**●** Three primary colors (red, yellow, and blue),?

**●** Three secondary colors (purple, green, and orange), and?

**●** Six tertiary colors (colors generated when you mix primary colors), plus (colors created from primary and secondary colors, such as blue-green or red-violet).

![color wheel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/matching-color-combinations-02.JPG)

Draw a line over the core of the wheel to separate the warm colors (reds, oranges, and yellows) from the cool colors (blues, greens, and purples) (blues, greens, purples).

Warm colors are connected with activity, brightness, and vigor, whereas cold colors are associated with tranquility, peace, and serenity. So when you hold that color has a temperature, you can see how its use might influence your message.

On the color wheel, complementary hues are opposites. They may make artwork jump because of the great contrast between the two hues, but overusing them can get tiring.

Analogous hues are next to each other. Therefore, one color will dominate, one will support, and another will accent when developing a similar color scheme.

Triadic hues are energetic and vibrant, evenly dispersed throughout the color wheel. They provide visual contrast and harmony, allowing everything to shine as the overall image comes to life.

You can build a variety of grand color schemes by using the color wheel. Finding the perfect color combination for the right occasion is vital.

On the color wheel, complementary hues are opposites. They may make artwork jump because of the great contrast between the two hues, but overusing them can get tiring.

Analogous hues are next to each other. Therefore, one color will dominate, one will support, and another will accent when developing a similar color scheme.

Triadic hues are energetic and vibrant, evenly dispersed throughout the color wheel. They provide visual contrast and harmony, allowing everything to shine as the overall image comes to life.

![color combinations for designers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/matching-color-combinations-01.JPG)

Although not everyone is born with a keen sense of color or a natural aptitude for graphic design, there are methods and principles you can employ to select the best **color that matches together** to make a strong impression and achieve your desired effect. Fortunately, we've got you backed up. The ten best **colors that match everything** are listed below to help you create your next design.

02 [Types of color combinations](#Part 2)

03 [Two-color combination vs. Three-color logo combinations](#Part 3)

04 [How to apply color combinations to your designs?](#Part 4)

## Part 1 What is Color Combination?

Color Theory is an art when it comes to playing with colors. It explains how people perceive color and the visual effects of colors mixing, pairing, and contrasting with one another. Designers use a color wheel and considerable collected knowledge about human psychology, society, and more to pick the perfect **colors that match everything**. Color is a crucial, if not the most important, feature of design since it may affect the meaning of the text, how people move across a layout, and how they feel. You may be more intentional in generating graphics that affect you if you understand color theory.

## Part 2 Types of Color Combinations

Learning how different **colors match together** is essential for successful color combinations. Studying the color wheel and color harmonies (what works, what doesn't, and how color communicates) will help you blend colors, establish a stronger brand, and share more effectively with your designers and printers.

**The color wheel contains:?**

**●** Three primary colors (red, yellow, and blue),?

**●** Three secondary colors (purple, green, and orange), and?

**●** Six tertiary colors (colors generated when you mix primary colors), plus (colors created from primary and secondary colors, such as blue-green or red-violet).

![color wheel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/matching-color-combinations-02.JPG)

Draw a line over the core of the wheel to separate the warm colors (reds, oranges, and yellows) from the cool colors (blues, greens, and purples) (blues, greens, purples).

Warm colors are connected with activity, brightness, and vigor, whereas cold colors are associated with tranquility, peace, and serenity. So when you hold that color has a temperature, you can see how its use might influence your message.

On the color wheel, complementary hues are opposites. They may make artwork jump because of the great contrast between the two hues, but overusing them can get tiring.

Analogous hues are next to each other. Therefore, one color will dominate, one will support, and another will accent when developing a similar color scheme.

Triadic hues are energetic and vibrant, evenly dispersed throughout the color wheel. They provide visual contrast and harmony, allowing everything to shine as the overall image comes to life.

You can build a variety of grand color schemes by using the color wheel. Finding the perfect color combination for the right occasion is vital.

**●** 10 Matching Color Combination That Works Together
