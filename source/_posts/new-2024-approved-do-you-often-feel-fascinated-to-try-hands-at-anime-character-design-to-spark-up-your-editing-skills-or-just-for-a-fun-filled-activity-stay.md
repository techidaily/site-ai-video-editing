## Part 1 What Attracts You the Most?

Anime characters are the latest trends to improvise graphic design and storytelling in an expressive manner. When designing an anime character, there are a series of aspects to be held into the light. Considering the fact that these elements add spark and engagement into the story being depicted, enough focus should be laid on crafting out the minute details that are essential to infuse liveliness and suitability into the character.

Anime characters are created to foretell a customary tale in a fantasizing manner, depicting all the superficial elements that you may possibly never imagine of coming across in real life. Another aspect is the animation element that happens to be the pivot of anime designing. All these put together on a single palette work to bring out an amazing anime story to life. But that’s not all.

No doubt on the significance of the aforesaid elements in crafting the most perfect anime design, but an essential fact that naturally goes unnoticed is the creator’s own interpretations and thoughts about the specific anime characters that are responsible for delivering a captivating story. Talking of specific character design, the key is to include the exact and accurate details of style, physical features, body language, costumes and other nuances that are crucial factors to comment on how the audience relates and responds to the character.

Respecting the diversity in the realm of **anime design**, each character tends to portray a completely distinguished appeal from the others. As of the likehood factor, while some characters receive a moderate attention, there are others who conveniently succeed in creating a long lasting impact. Moving ahead with our discussion along the same line, let us talk about some of the most loved and stand out anime character designs in what follows next:

### 01My Hero Academia

**Main Attractive Design Features**

**●** Character design has a significant influence of Western comics

**●** Special attention is paid on the hair styling and costume selection of each character

**●** The characters have a unique color crafting for a stand out recognition

### 02Miss Kobayashi’s Dragon Maid

Centered greatly on school level anime creation, the most reflective aspects of Kyoto Animation character designs are present in the quick apparel changes and impressive body language. For instance, a simple flip of the hair can say a lot about a character’s personality of being lazy or active. It is however, interesting to note that Kyoto Animation did not have a significant recognition in character design before the advent of Miss Kobayashi’s Dragon Maid.

The aforesaid anime series opened massive doors for the animation company to try hands at experimenting with the epic cuteness that the latter is known for in today’s times. Be it the character costumes, color patterns, or even a quick shine in the eye, everything works so perfectly to build up a subtle communication among the dragon girls of this series.

The minute detailing works to highlight the differences between the respective personalities of these characters, along with setting each one miles apart from the other in a hoard of aspects.

Talking of the impersonation of the other two flicks, One Piece showcases a vibrant but quite a caricaturized character formation.

Bleach on the other hand, excels on the artwork parameter, but relies much on customarily jumping character designs. Being far ahead of these two, Naruto succeeds to strike a balance between the expanded diversity of character formations, along with establishing an intimate communication between culture, abilities and specific character personalities.

A few classic examples of the expressive character sketches from the series include Konoha’s green vest, the robe-themed costume of the Village Hidden in the Sand, and the mufflers of the Village Hidden by Sound.

### 05Monogatari

**●** The unique dressing style of each character is distinguished enough to clearly differentiate among personalities with a similar profile

Though another member in the list of high school anime series; Monogatari is no way similar to the customary, school centered anime creations. The credit undeniably goes to the exquisite character design of Studio Shaft that solely resolved to craft a unique piece of artwork for the series. An additional factor working in favor of the series is the effective communication between the latter’s student characters.

Regardless of the fact that the series features high school pupils as the main characters, they are gifted with a wide canvas to express their specific characterizations. Be it the body language, or the distinguished costume style, each character has its own space to communicate with the story.

It is impossible to have confusion between 2 characters of the series, or a 3rd one on a parallel space.

Consisting of the most influential members of the Hunter Association, the character assimilation is entirely centered on the animal theme picked by the chairman.

The characters are made to wear some the most oddly pronounced looks, like that of Cheadle, who appears to be a dog. The striking attraction of the character design is however, the non-animal costumes of some characters, who talk better with their attitudes. A few instances include the uncomfortably clean behavior of Pariston, and Ging’s ugly, beggar-like appearance.

The weird and overly pronounced character design draws its inspiration from the dark designs of the Phantom Troop, the Zoldyck’s ghastly stares in casual attire, and the absence of any sort of biological resemblances in the Chimera Ants.

The engaging character design and elegant artwork of the series however, has managed to carve out a space in the viewers’ mind even in the current times.

All the members of Night Raid are given an extremely distinguished appearance; to such an extent that each one seems to have a personality centered shade code.

Some specific character designs require having a particular size preference for the character, like that of it being specifically small or big. In such a case, you can have a better analysis of your character’s height by sketching them out in parallel with an additional character with an average size. It is further advisable to work with a minimum detailing of the different aspects of your character, lest you may end up with a complicated design.

If, at a later stage, the character comes out with a bland appearance, there is always a scope of adding extra details. When you have a host of character sketches portraying specific elements, you can move ahead with selecting the best pieces and combining the same into a single character design.

**Step 3: Develop Your Character Design**

The basic design of an anime character is sufficiently crafted in Step 2\. However, if you wish to spark up your character design with some extra detailing, move ahead with working on the postures of your character. Sketch the front, back and both sides of your character. It is important to note that should not skip drawing any of the side poses unless you a creating a mirrored effect with the character, where both the sides appear exactly same.

You can further, add some additional posture views from different angles. Trying out the anterior, posterior, top and lateral viewing angles can be of great help when designing complex characters with a comprehensive detailing. Experimenting with a diversity of postures and viewing angles aids to fetch an all-round character design that can be used to work with the same character in different motion graphic applications.

To craft your character’s design in even proportion across different formation views, you can attempt to work with a simple, 2-step process. Draw guidelines of a particular body part in a specific view, followed by using these guidelines to sketch out the same body part in a different view. You should significantly realize the fact that the difference in perspectives does not allow the perfect alignment of specific portions of a character design to its counterparts, when looked through different viewing angles.

As in the following figure, you can easily observe the misalignment of the character’s feet on account of being viewed from the front view. You can also notice the sketches to move a bit ahead of the guideline as the character approaches forward in the front view.

**Step 4: Complement Your Design With Perfect Shades**

In the specific case of manga character design, the formations mostly go well with a black and white color arrangement. You can however, add a tint of complementary shades when creating a character design for a cover page. When proceeding to open the color palette for your character design, there are a variety of aspects worth paying attention.

![Creating Your Own Anime Character- Selecting the Perfect Color Scheme](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/10-amazing-anime-character-designs-to-inspire-you-17.JPG)

It is always a smart idea to choose complementary colors that are a perfect mix and match for each other. When picking complementary colors; look for the shades that lie across of each other on the color wheel. Such color arrangements are the preferences of almost any popular anime character you normally come across.

        Shades](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/10-amazing-anime-character-designs-to-inspire-you-18.JPG)

It is of course not necessary to pick your color scheme in perfect cohesion with the color wheel. You are free to select the desired variation of a specific color if the latter corresponds with the elements of your character design. Black and white is the safest choices, as they can go well with almost every color scheme and design specifications.

It would be wise enough to select your shades in line with the overall personality and appeal that your character is aimed at portraying. Colors are often linked with setting a specific mood for your creation. For instance, choosing a shade of blue would imbibe a sense of your character being cool, which picking a red tint on the other hand, adds an effect of warmth to the same.

Understating this with an example, you would generally refrain from adding shades of red in a character design that is centered on ice magic fantasy. Instead, picking a blue tint would work a lot better and complementary for this particular character design.
