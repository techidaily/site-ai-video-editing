The **freeze-frame video editing** effect is a technique used to stop the moving image of a video and hold it still onscreen. This effect aims to pause the world the video is living in and allow the audience to process the scene and gain more context fully. Note that the world around us keeps ongoing, and time never stops. But luckily for us, we can pause film and video with a simple but powerful video effect known as the freeze-frame.

In addition, a freeze-frame can be carried out in a video to showcase a specific frame in your clip by extending the length of Time that frame is displayed. For example, you can decide to freeze a frame to show the video frame where a goal is being scored in a sporting event or use it to showcase a captured reaction or a smile. When a freeze-frame applies to a video clip, the clip automatically splits at the freezing point, and the chosen frame is inserted as an image file (BMP) and displayed on screen for the duration you set. This article will teach how to use the freeze-frame editing service ideally.

## Top 5 Best Video to PPT Converters

Almost three decades after its debut, Microsoft PowerPoint has become a hallmark of professionalism and quality in the presentation software industry. Traditional PPT files produced by PowerPoint have many drawbacks, including the fact that the content of your presentations may be readily edited and reused by others.

The Save to Video option in 2010 and subsequent versions of PowerPoint addresses this problem by allowing users to produce video files that may be readily shared on social media, video sharing sites, or utilized in eLearning courses. The built-in PPT file conversion function in newer versions of PowerPoint has several restrictions that prohibit you from picking the video file type or incorporating embedded media files in the PowerPoint presentation video.

That's why we've compiled a list of the top five video to ppt converter to make the process of turning a PowerPoint presentation into a movie as simple and enjoyable as possible.

However, basic PPT to video file conversion is only available in the free edition of the product.

There is no possibility to convert many files at once.

### 5.Camtasia Studio

![camtasia-studio-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/camtasia-studio-poster.jpg)

**Price: A free trial is offered, and a single-user license is $249.**

There is much more to Camtasia Studio than simply a video to ppt converter in it. An unencumbered trial edition of this video editing program helps you create professional-looking films from PowerPoint presentations. Camtasia Studio's single-user license is a good alternative for those who just need to convert a few presentations for free, but if you're searching for a full-featured video to ppt converter, you should consider purchasing Camtasia.

When using the software's premium edition, you may add multimedia files, such as PowerPoint presentations and webcam footage to your final video project. With Camtasia Studio, you can easily post your films in nearly any video file type on social media.

##### Pros

With Camtasia Studio, adding transitions, callouts, or text effects is a cinch.

Advanced video editing tools are available.

##### Cons

Only 30 days are included in the free trial.

Expensive.

## Conclusions

When looking for the best PowerPoint conversion software, there are a lot of factors to consider. The output quality, the ability to use PowerPoint effects, compatibility with new devices, & one publishing are all key considerations. Get a free trial of iSpring Converter Pro, the number one choice on our list, if you need a dependable video to ppt converter that can handle any amount of slides and animations in your presentation.
