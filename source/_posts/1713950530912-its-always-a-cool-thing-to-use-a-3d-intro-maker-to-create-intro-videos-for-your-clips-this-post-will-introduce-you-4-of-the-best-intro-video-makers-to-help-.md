1. [Adobe After Effects](#part2-1)
2. [Canva](#part2-2)
3. [Promo](#part2-3)
4. [Filmora](#part2-4)

## 1\. What is an intro video?

A video intro is a brief introduction, typically lasting between 5 and 15 seconds, that introduces your video, YouTube channel, or brand. Video intros are becoming increasingly popular. It is often the first occasion on which a viewer will have the chance to interact with the content you produce.

Because of this, it has the power to attract attention from the very beginning and to develop trust in the company or product that you are promoting. It goes without saying that this is one of the most critical factors to consider when trying to attract and connect with your desired audience.

## 2\. What are some good intro makers?

Here you will a list of many great intro makers you can use for free and paid.

### Adobe After Effects

One of the most well-known pieces of software for creating video effects is called Adobe After Effects. It is capable of producing great motion graphics, and as a result, it should have no trouble animating and producing dynamic video intros or 3D intros for your company, brand, or YouTube channel.

![adobe after effects intro maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/after-effects-effects-presets-pane.jpg)

After Effects is utilized by professionals working in the film business to create aesthetically spectacular work for cinema, television, video, and the online. The most significant drawback to After Effects is the fact that it requires an average beginner around eight weeks to learn the program by watching training videos and going through tutorials. In addition, the fee to join Adobe's Creative Cloud Suite membership service is quite high.

### Canva

When you use Canva, you will have instant access to a video introduction creator that is hosted on the web. You get access to a number of different themes, as well as royalty-free photographs and videos, as well as a drag-and-drop editor that you can use to create content that you can then share and post everywhere. In addition to providing, you with intro templates, it also gives you the ability to design your own logo. With a freshly designed logo in hand, now would be the ideal time to produce an introduction film using it.

Canva's mission is to demystify graphic design and make it available to users who are not designers. They also provide a premium edition of Canva, which is ideally suited for teams to collaborate on the creation of designs with the same objective in mind. In addition, Canva Pro is equipped with additional premium features, such as a brand kit and a backdrop remover.

![canva intro maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canva-poster.jpg)

Canva is an easy-to-use website that provides free access to some of its features, which may be used to create great movies. However, some limitations to using Canva include the fact that it only supports a limited number of output formats and there is a possibility that you will experience connectivity troubles while attempting to save and export your video introductions.

When it came to design, I previously relied on a combination of Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, and PicMonkey until I discovered Canva. After some time, we were able to navigate both with ease, but we found that Canva was more difficult to use than PicMonkey. Canva had a steep learning curve and lacked some of the features I was looking for in a design program.

We choose to disregard it. But I decided to give it another shot about two or three years ago, and this time I was impressed enough to switch PicMonkey out for it in my collection of editing tools. Canva had added a large number of features that made the program simpler to use and gave users the ability to accomplish more.

### Promo

Promo has a wonderful look that pops. You may build quick video intros for your social media or YouTube channel by using their intro maker, and then post and share them on your social networks afterwards. Promo.com provides filmmakers and video editors with high-quality professional video clips, royalty-free music, adjustable video templates, bespoke text, and logos, and more through their monthly membership programs. You may utilize Promo to create videos in a variety of orientations and forms, including horizontal, vertical, square, and even banner films.

To summarize, Promo is a video maker that has an impressive design and allows for direct uploads to various social media platforms. The only problem is that their website occasionally becomes unresponsive and sluggish. Because of this, the process of creation can become rather laborious and drawn out.

![promo intro maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/promo-youtube-maker.jpg)

Promo.com is my one-stop-shop for all of my business promotional videos because it offers a variety of video ad templates that I can easily edit on my browser without the need for any program, and they also offer a great selection of stock footage and text overlay options to make the videos look more professional. Promo.com has a lot of awesome templates for a bunch of different categories.

You can finish your introduction in record time thanks to iStock and Shutterstock's vast libraries of high-quality stock films, photos, and music, as well as their ability to create fully adjustable titles and more than 5000 intro themes.

## There Are Many Aspects to Consider when It Comes to Publishing a Video. Safety and Privacy Aspects Are some of Them. If You're Looking to Blur Out a Bystander or Cut Out Profanities From Your Video with Filmora, This Is the Right Article for You

There are many aspects to consider when it comes to publishing a video. Safety and privacy aspects are some of them. If you're looking to blur out a bystander or cut out profanities from your video with Filmora, this is the right article for you.

## Part 1\. How to add a beep sound to a video with Filmora

Filmora's powerful video editing menu includes easy tweaking on audio. You can censor any part of speech you want to exclude from your video with just these simple steps.

Step1 Create a new project and import the video to Filmora.

![import the video to filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/censor-effects-with-filmora-1.jpg)

Step2 Separate the audio component from the video by right-clicking on the video and selecting the Detach Audio option. You can now edit each of them individually.

![detach the audio component](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/censor-effects-with-filmora-2.jpg)

Step3 Mark the part to place the start of the beep using the playhead and click the Split icon on the editor’s toolbar.

![split to separate the target segment](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/censor-effects-with-filmora-3.gif)

Step4 Place the playhead at the end of the censored segment and click Split. Double-click on the segment to open the audio editing menu, then you can remove that part of the audio or lower the volume.

![adjusting the split audio segment](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/censor-effects-with-filmora-4.jpg)

Step5 Click the **Audio>Audio** Effects menu on the upper left corner of the screen. After you find the Beep effect, drag the track to the audio timeline and place it in between the split section. Adjust trimming and volume until the censor is placed correctly.

## Part 2\. How to add mosaic to video with Filmora

Whether you want to hide a passerby's face or your own, or even other types of objects, Wondershare Filmora is ready to take on the task. While its nifty face-off function automatically follows the movement of a marked face, the mosaic effect is the fast and perfect solution for a static object in the video.

Step1 After importing a video to Filmora, tap on the Effects tab and find the Mosaic filter from the gallery.

![find the mosaic effect from the effects library](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/censor-effects-with-filmora-6.jpg)

Step2 Drag the Mosaic filter to the timeline just above the main video track.

![drag the mosaic effect to timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/censor-effects-with-filmora-7.jpg)

Step3 A yellow box will appear in the viewer. You can drag and adjust its size to hide the targetted object. You can also adjust the opacity and intensity of the effect using the adjustment menu, accessible when you double-click the yellow box.

![adjust the mosaic effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/censor-effects-with-filmora-8.jpg)

If the targetted object moves, you can set the automatic tracking before adding the mosaic filter by clicking on the **Motion Tracking**\>**Start Tracking** located above the timeline. Before you place the filter, preview and adjust the tracking frame to ensure tight proof censor.

## Create the Stranger Things Upside Down Effect Video

With stranger things season 4 ending, it seems like great timing to make a stranger things style transition to the Upside Down. In the Netflix series Stranger Things, there is an opposite version of our world called the Upside Down. The Upside Down is dark, creepy, and possibly filled with aliens, monsters, creatures, and other things.

Now, you can also apply the Stranger Things Upside Down Effect to your video! This effect combines camera tricks and video editing within [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to transition from the normal world into the Upside Down.

## How-to Guide

_**1) Preparation**_

To make this effect, you will need two footage shots: one with the camera moving down and one with the camera coming back up.

When shooting for the footage, follow the steps below:

**First shot**

1. Find any item close enough to the ground that we can block our frame with.

![block our frame with item](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-1.jpg)

1. Once you have your talent lined up, rotate your camera while lowering it below the foreground item at a constant speed and leaving the camera there. The key is making sure when you go behind the object, the frame is nothing but black.

![rotate your camera](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-2.gif)

For the next scene, have your actor change positions, or you can change the set around to look like the Upside Down. For instance, adding fake plants and flickering lights.

**Second shot**

Start bringing your camera back up at the same speed and rotate it again in the direction it was moving.

![start bringing your camera back up](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-3.gif)

_**2) Steps**_

After you have all the footage, you can start editing it on Filmora. If you haven't installed it yet, you can download Filmora at their official website at <https://filmora.wondershare.com>.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

Now, launch Filmora on your PC and follow the steps below:

Step1 Take your first clip in the “normal” world and drag it down to a video track on the timeline. Trim the edge of the clip, so it ends on pure black and in a downward motion.

![trim the edge of the clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-4.jpg)

Step2 Drag the second clip (in the Upside Down) onto the video track on the timeline after the first clip. Trim this video, so it begins in pure black and an upward motion.

![trim video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-5.jpg)

Cut the clips to get the timing right since it should be a very fast transition. You can cut in the black frames so they won't be too apparent.

If you don't have a perfectly smooth transition, you can add a dissolve by going to **Transitions > Basic > Dissolve**.

![cut the clips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-6.jpg)

**Color Grading and Effects**

After the transition, you can make the clip look a lot more like the Upside Down from the show with a color grade and Filmora effects. Follow the steps below:

Step1 Double-click on your second clip, then go to **Color > Advanced**. For a quick edit, you can try one of the presets available, such as “cool film.” It will give you the colder blue tones that Stranger Things used for the Upside Down.

![go to color](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-7.jpg)

Step2 You can further edit the color grading in the white balance menu. Drag the slider to the left to get a blue, cold vibe for the Upside Down.

The “cool” or “warm” color grading technically talks about color temperature. A “warmer” look will be more orange, and a “colder” look will be bluer. You can also use the tint slider to fine-tune the look.

![further edit the color grading](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-8.gif)

Step3 Next, move down to the color, lower the brightness and increase contrast. It makes the scene darker and more sinister than the normal world.

![move down to the color](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-9.jpg)

Step4 Finally, go down to the vignette and drag the amount slider a tiny bit to give a Vinnette around your clip.

![go down to the vignette](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-10.jpg)

_**3) Pro Tips**_

You can still make your clip look even more like Upside Down with some Filmora elements.

Go to **Elements > Smoke > Smokescreen 2**. Drag this element on top of your Upside Down clip and trim it, so it starts at the same time the clip leaves the black frame.

![drag this element on top of your upside down clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-11.jpg)

You can adjust the opacity by double-clicking the smoke effect to open the setting.

Finally, go to the **Transition > Basic > Dissolve** to the start of the smoke and adjust it when the smoke gradually appears.

![open the setting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-12.jpg)

## Resources from Filmostock

You can also use filmstock effects to bring our video to the next level. Go to **Elements > Fire > Large Scale 12** and drag it down on top of your clip and the smoke.

![go to elements](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-13.jpg)

Double-click the clip and change the scale of the effect to your needs. Then, go to compositing to change the blending mode to the screen to help the effect blend in more.

![change the scale of the effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-14.jpg)

Now, go to color and open the white balance menu. Drag the two sliders to change the color of the particles to match your clip.

## Want to Speed up Your Video to Shorten Its Duration and Make It More Entertaining? Here Is How to Speed up Videos in Final Cut Pro. Get a Better Alternative to FCP to Speed up Videos

When there are certain boring but necessary parts in your video, you need to speed them up. Similarly, you may need to reduce the duration of the entire video. Speeding up the video is your only option when you do not want to cut any part. You must have also observed that certain videos look funny when you speed them up. To speed up videos, you will need a video editor that does not degrade the video quality.

Final Cut Pro is a popular choice to speed up video without distorting the pitch. Many think that the video quality can degrade when they change the speed of the video clip. This concern can be taken care of when you alter the video speed with Final Cut Pro. Instead of changing the speed of the entire video, you can change the speed of specific parts. We will illustrate how to speed up the video using Final Cut Pro and suggest a better choice than FCP.

![speed up the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-up-video-with-final-cut-pro-1.jpg)

## Part I. Speed Up Video using Final Cut Pro

Final Cut Pro by Apple is one of Mac users' most popular video editors. Many video creators purchase MacBooks for editing their videos in Final Cut Pro. The video editor is suitable for beginners as well as professionals. FCP, as a video editor, is super fast in rendering and processing video while exporting. Here are the steps for the Final Cut Pro speed-up clip.

Step1 Open FCP. Navigate to File>New> and tap Project to start a new project.

![start a new project](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-up-video-with-final-cut-pro-2.jpg)

Step2 Go to File>Import> Media and fetch your video clip. After that, drag/drop the video clip into the timeline.

![clip into the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-up-video-with-final-cut-pro-3.jpg)

Step3 Choose the video clip from the timeline. Click on the Speedometer(Retime) icon at the top of the timeline.

![video clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-up-video-with-final-cut-pro-4.jpg)

Step4 Tap the Speedometer icon, to get the drop-drop menu. For the Final Cut Pro speed-up video, go to Fast and select the speed. You get to choose from 2X to 20X.

![tap the speedometer icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-up-video-with-final-cut-pro-5.jpg)

## Part II. Tips for Speeding Up Video in Final Cut Pro

You have to keep a few points in mind when you speed up videos in Final Cut Pro. This ensures that the video does not get distorted while speeding up a section. Here are some tips to follow to speed up the video in FCP.

**Adjust The Pitch of Sped-Up Clips -**

By default, Final Cut Pro preserves the pitch of the audio even when you change the speed of the video. However, you may want to change the pitch per the video's speed. This is because you might want to make the audio sound funny. You need to turn off the Preserve Pitch option from Retime menu. Once you do that, the pitch of the sped-up clip adjusts itself as per the change in speed.

**Speeding Up Video by Adjusting Frame Rate -**

You can shoot at a low frame rate for the scene you want to speed up. The frame rate should be lower than the overall video project's frame rate.

You can add the scene to your video project on the timeline. Then you need to choose Automatic Speed from Retime menu. This will increase the frame rate from the scene to the video project frame rate. Once the frame rate increases, the video will speed up automatically.

![speed up automatically](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-up-video-with-final-cut-pro-7.jpg)

**Smoothen Out the Sped-Up Video -**

Sometimes, the overall video may look old when you speed up a particular portion. That is why there are two options available on Final Cut Pro. The first option is frame blending which is more suitable for the slow-motion clip.

The second option is the optical flow that smoothens out the sped-up clip. It adds in-between frames by analyzing the directional movement of pixels. You can find the option from Video Quality present in the Retime menu.

## Part III. The Right Final Cut Pro Alternative for Changing Speed - Filmora

Final Cut Pro has a steep learning curve. Unless you have some experience in video editing, you will find the user interface slightly complicated. Besides, Final Cut Pro is only available for Mac users since it is an Apple product.

Many people look for a Final Cut Pro alternative to change the speed of the video. Wondershare Filmora is the best choice over Final Cut Pro to change the speed of video Final Cut Pro.

Step3 Adjust the speed slider to set the desired speed as per your requirements. The duration will change as per the speed you set, and you can set the duration below the speed slider. Just like Final Cut Pro, you can turn on Ripple and Audio Pitch as per your preference.

The speed ramping feature comes with several graphical presets. You can choose from the presets and customize the speed as per your requirements. Check the steps to use speed ramping to change your video speed.

Step1 Drag and drop the video file onto the timeline. Click on the Speed(timer) icon at the top of the timeline.
