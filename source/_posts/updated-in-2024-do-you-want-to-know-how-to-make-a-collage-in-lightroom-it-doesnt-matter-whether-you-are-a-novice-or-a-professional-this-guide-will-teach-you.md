They have gained huge popularity in the last few years as the digital space has grown. You may have already seen social media users posting their photo collages on their timelines. Instagram is far ahead of the competition in this regard. It has played a crucial role in establishing the photo collage as a normal trend.

**For the photographer**

With a photo collage, a photographer can best showcase his talent. It shows that you can do a lot more than your capabilities, like representing stories by blending colors and elements perfectly. This will help you attract your prospects and convert them into your paying customers.

**How do photo collages provide value to the clients?**

A photo collage provides visual value to the clients by enhancing the creative process. It can have a profound effect on the way they perceive your art of photography. In fact, your clients will love to see all their memories collected in an attractive photo collage. There are a lot of people that even love to present collages to their loved ones.

## Part 3 Core Considerations for a Lightroom Collage

The secret to designing an eye-catching **lightroom collage** is to know how to blend all the elements together properly. Professional Lightroom users concentrate on a few key graphic design considerations to keep their photo collage looking its best.In other words, every element should be in the right proportion, such as dimension, alignment, proximity, and theme.

**Balance**

Balance refers to the arrangement of all elements. It includes the division of pictures into equal or different dimensions according to the collage size. Maintaining balance enhances the overall appearance of a photo collage in lightroom. Some lightroom experts prefer symmetrical balance, but you can get better quality collages through asymmetrical balance.

**Alignment**

Don't underestimate the importance of alignment in **Lightroom collage**. How your pictures are aligned can have a drastic effect on their overall look. It provides a definitive structure and delivers a well-finished product to the client.

In graphic design, two kinds of elements exist: edge and centre alignment. These are applied to visual design and text as well.

**Proximity**

Proximity signifies the relationship between various elements on the basis of the distance between them. It follows two basic principles:

**●** Realistic pictures should be put together.

**●** Unrelatable images should be separated.

Moreover, the border width needs to be consistent throughout, irrespective of the number of pictures.

**Theme**

The theme, also known as tone or style, matters when it comes to collage design. Each image must have a similar style, as this idea can personify all the captured memories. It will completely beautify your artistic perspective, but it's not as measurable as others.

**Step 4: Add Photos to the Layout**
