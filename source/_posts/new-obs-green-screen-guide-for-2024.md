## OBS Green Screen Guide

OBS Studio is a free and open-source app for screen-casting and live streaming. Written in C/C++ and built with Qt, OBS Studio provides real-time capture, scene composition, recording, encoding, and broadcasting via the Real Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP).It can stream Videos to any RTMP supporting destination including YouTube, Twitch, Instagram and Facebook.

You only need one green screen software – OBS. The reason why OBS is the most recommended for streaming is because once you have set it up properly, you can do literally anything you can think of with the software (either with or without added plug-ins).

## Chroma Key Settings in OBS

Chroma keying has become incredibly popular nowadays. People use it not just for gaming, but also in Zoom conferences, live interviews, talk shows, etc. Although it may feel complicated at first glance, setting up Chroma Key in OBS Studio is actually incredibly easy.

Have a look at the simple steps you need to take to set up a green screen in OBS:

1. Make sure you have the following equipment prepared: a solid green background, webcam or video camera, lighting, and OBS Studio.
2. Download the latest stable version of OBS Studio from the [official website](https://obsproject.com/) and install the software. Open OBS and let the Auto-Configuration Wizard optimize the software’s settings based on your hardware.
3. Now you can add a video source.
4. Right-click on the video source you’ve created and select Filter.
5. Click the + button under the Effects Filters section and select Chroma Key.
6. Type in a name for this effect layer.
7. After you add a chroma key, OBS will automatically create and adjust the baseline settings for the filter. You can experiment with the sliders and settle when you are satisfied with the result.
8. Make sure you aren’t wearing any green or reflective material. You can double-check the performance on the preview screen.
9. If things are working smoothly, you are all set to start streaming with the green screen on.

Pro tip:

You can follow the instructions above and live stream to multiple platforms at once with Restream. Multistreaming to platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Twitch, and LinkedIn allows you to drastically increase the audience reach and grow your followers.

### How to make OBS green screen settings better

Using green screens for filmmaking isn't the most complicated or difficult thing in the world but it certainly has its pitfalls. If you ask any experienced filmmaker what to look out for when using a green screen, chances are they're going to mention lighting about a billion times and that's for good reason.

### Tips on How to make OBS green screen settings better

* Evenly light your green screen so you can get a good key.
* Watch out for light flares. Use some a matte box or your trusty paw to block out any unwanted light.
* When lighting, try to create as much separation between your subject and the green screen as you can.
* Shutter speed: Minimize motion blur by raising your shutter speed to 1/80 or 1/100
* Aperture: Setting your aperture to f4 or f5.6 will give you slightly more depth of field, which will blur and smooth out your green screen.
* Format: Set your camera to the best recording format it has.
* ISO: Try to avoid high ISOs.

When they know about the colours, it inaugurates a novel hallway of set communicating and knowing about the world around them.

**●** **Offers a way of describing the world**

For the children, this world is an absolutely new place. They have been introduced to this planet quite recently and are exploring and discovering the different aspects. And one of the major aspects of the world is its colour.

So, when they learn about colours, they tend to find a way to describe the environment. It gives them a better understanding of the world and their surrounding as they learn about the colours.
