## How to Film Better in Public - 2024 Guide

Filming in public and different locations can add a new dimension to any video. The possibilities are limitless, from the hustle and bustle of a busy city street to the tranquil beauty of a remote beach.

Suppose you're a new vlogger and want to capture the perfect scene in public. Then this blog is for you. It will explain various tips and tricks to help you create the best videos, regardless of location. So let's start and learn more about how to film better in public!

## Part 1\. What Gear Will You Need to Record a Better Video in Public?

While recording in public, you want to avoid setting and holding unnecessary camera gear. That's why you should keep your gear as low-key as possible. The essential shooting gears that you are going to need are as follows:

### A Good Camera

A good camera is essential to record a video in public because it will provide quality footage. It will also allow you to capture more detail and create more engaging videos. But if you use a phone instead, make sure it is the latest iPhone or other with high pixels camera.

![a dslr camera](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/create-better-film-footage-1.jpg)

### A Tripod

A tripod is essential when recording video in public to ensure that your shots are stable and steady. Without a tripod, your camera can shake and create a distorted, blurry image that can ruin a shot. So having a secure tripod will help you capture professional-looking footage.

![a tripod](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/create-better-film-footage-2.jpg)

### A Microphone

A microphone is essential for recording a video in public because it captures the sound in the environment, allowing the video to be recorded with better-quality audio. Without a microphone, the video would be recorded with distorted sound and would likely be challenging to understand.

![a vlogging microphone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/create-better-film-footage-3.jpg)

Apart from the gear mentioned above, you can also bring an ND filter, extra batteries, and SD cards. Because If the battery runs out or the SD card becomes full, the video recording could be lost. The spare batteries and SD cards help to ensure that the video can be captured uninterrupted. Let's see what we need further.

## Part 2\. What Do You Need to Accomplish With Your Video?

While recording a video in a busy location, you need to accomplish three things with your video to record it better. Which are as follows:

### 1\. Clean Shots

When recording in a busy location, it is essential to try and capture clean shots. It can be done by using a wide-angle lens to get the full shot or zooming in to focus on a particular element.

### 2\. Clean Audio

Getting a clean and clear sound when recording audio in a busy location is essential. A good quality microphone, an audio recorder, or external noise reduction can help minimize background noise and capture the desired audio.

### 3\. Decent Lighting

In a busy location, decent lighting is as important as the other two factors. Look for natural light sources that can provide good light, even illumination. If these are unavailable, consider using portable lighting equipment or lamps to create a more flattering environment.

Now that we know what we need let's see how to make a video.

## Part 3\. How to Get the Best Shot While Filming Outdoor?

Whether you are a vlogger, a YouTuber, or a student filmmaker, shooting a video in a busy area is always a challenge. You must be able to plan and execute your production in a way that minimizes disruption and produces quality footage. By following these instructions, we hope you can make a difference in a shot you record:

##### Step1 Scout the Location

Before recording, visit the location in advance to plan your shots. Take note of potential distractions or noise sources and plan your angles accordingly.

![scouting the location](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/create-better-film-footage-4.png)

##### Step2 Choose the correct shooting time

The best time to record a video in a busy location is when the area is less crowded, such as early in the morning or late at night. Avoiding peak times and holidays is also a good idea.

##### Step3 Choose the right angle

Once you get to the location, you must find the right angle.

**Select Background**

Try to find a background that will best capture the atmosphere of the area and minimize any background noise.

![select the background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/create-better-film-footage-5.png)

**Set the frame**

If your frame is too broad, you will face potential distractions that could interfere with your video, such as people walking in and out of the frame.

![setting the frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/create-better-film-footage-6.png)

**Set your position**

Instead of getting closer to your talent, get further away and zoom in this way, you leave space for other people in the location, and you can still get your shot!

![zoom in the talent](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/create-better-film-footage-7.png)

Try to get your shot and then get out quickly so you don't bother other people trying to get their photos.

## Part 4\. Best Way to Record Audio While Filming Outdoor

Audio is essential to any video production, and recording audio while filming outdoor scenes can be challenging.

Outdoor environments come with more variables to consider, such as wind, traffic noise, and other background noise, that can make capturing clear audio more difficult. Even if you use a high-quality mic, you still have chances of interruption.

If you get any such variable in the video you recorded, you can re-record the audio with the help of **[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).** Let's see how you can do it:

## Make Super Easy Coin Magic With Filmora

Do you want to become a magician in your videos? Now, everyone can look like a magician with the magic of editing. This article will show you how to do a cool coin trick in [Filmora 11](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

## Part 1: What is the filmmaking technique "Cutting on action"

Cutting on action is a technique the editors use to cut in the middle of an action to another shot that matches the first shot's action. Typically, the subject starts an action in one shot and continues the action in another, creating a smooth transition. For example, when you make the coin trick video, you need to cut on the tapping so it can trick the eyes, and the cut won't be noticeable.

![what is filmmaking technique](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/coin-magic-1.jpg)

## Part 2: Things You Need to Prepare for The Coin Magic Trick

1. Glass and two coins

![glass and coins](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/coin-magic-2.jpg)

1. Set the phone on a tripod. Because utilizing a tripod can significantly improve the recording's stability.

![set the phone on a tripod](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/coin-magic-3.jpg)

## Part 3: Start Filming

Step1 Firstly, you must show the coin and the bottom of the glass.

![show the coin and the bottom of the glass](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/coin-magic-4.png)

Step2 After that, you need to hold the coin with the fingers part of one hand and tap down on the coin. Make sure it looks like the coin is going through straight to the glass.

![hold the coin with the fingers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/coin-magic-5.jpg)

Step3 You need someone else to drop the other coin from the top. Meanwhile, you are pretending to tap a coin on the glass. You don't need to worry about someone else hand in the frame. Since you can remove it easily with the masking feature in Filmora.

![drop the other coin from the top](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/coin-magic-6.jpg)

Step4 It would help if you had a second shot for a clean plate of the background. You can record background for 20 seconds.

![record background for 20 seconds](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/coin-magic-7.jpg)

## Part 4: Bring the clips into Filmora 11

Step1 If you have not downloaded Filmora, you can visit filmora.wondershare.com to download Filmora's new version.

![download Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/coin-magic-8.jpg)

Step2 Drag and drop the clip onto the first track of the timeline.Afterward, move the playhead to the right and find the spot where you tapped the coin last time before your friend drops the other coin. Additionally, make sure it is in the middle of the tapping action and cut.

![drag and drop the clip onto the first track](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/coin-magic-9.jpg)

Step3 Then move the playhead to the right and find the spot where your friend drops the coin while you tap without the coin in your hand. Make sure it is in the middle of the tapping action, and the position of your hand roughly matches that in the last cut and make a cut.

![move the playhead to the right](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/coin-magic-10.jpg)

Step4 Now you need to delete the middle part and play it back. Indeed, cutting on action is the key to creating the illusion that the action is continued without editing.

![delete the middle part](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/coin-magic-11.jpg)

Step5 Next, you must remove your friend's hand in the frame with the Filmora masking feature. Afterwards. drag and drop the clean plate video onto the second track of the timeline.

![remove your friend's hand in the frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/coin-magic-12.jpg)

Step6 Next, double-click the clip to open the setting video. Find the Mask Section and select the single line.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/coin-magic-13.jpg)

Step7 Here you can see the mask is applied.First, adjust the angle and position of the mask to only show the top part of the frame. Then you have to change the Blur Strength to add more blur to the edge of the mask.

![adjust the angle and position of the mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/coin-magic-14.jpg)

Step8 With the mask finalized, unhide the first video track and adjust the length of the clip on the timeline. Finally, playback the video and see how it looks.
