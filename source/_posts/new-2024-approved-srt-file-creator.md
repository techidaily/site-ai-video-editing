## Part 2: How to Edit Time-lapse Video on a Computer

Time-lapse video is a type of video that allows you to see a huge amount of change in a very short time. You can see it on all social media websites such as YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram. It can be used to make all kinds of videos, from simple scenes of nature to complex events. The first time-lapse video was made in France in 1872 by Léon Bouly.

There are a lot of steps to make a time-lapse video on a computer.

Step1 You need to download the free software that comes with the camera. You can find it on the manufacturer's website or through a search engine.

Step2 You'll want to plug in your phone's charging cable and plug it in so that it can stay charged while filming.

Step3 You'll need to find somewhere quiet where you can set up your camera and tripod. If possible, try to do this outside so that there's no worry about getting dust or dirt on your lens.

Step4 Set up your phone so that it will record once every hour for an hour straight. This will give you enough time for each frame of video before switching over to the next one after an hour has passed.

Step5 Start recording!

**Why we should make a time-lapse video on a computer?**

Time lapses are also useful for showing how something changes over time. For example, if you want to show how an environment changes from day to night, or how a plant grows from seedlings into mature plants after being watered and nourished by sunlight, these videos would be perfect for demonstrating this change in real-time.

You can also create time-lapse videos that show the growth of plants or flowers over time. You could use this method to demonstrate how plants grow from seedlings into fully grown trees or bushes. You could even try creating a time-lapse video showing the growth of a weed from the seedling stage into full bloom with its seeds spread out across the ground below it!

You can make your videos more fun and engaging. By recording multiple angles at the same time, you can capture all the exciting moments, like when something unexpected happens. Or when something amazing turns out to be a total disaster in real life. You can easily share with friends and family members who might not be able to come to see you in person.

On the contrary, MP4 is supported by all the video players available for both Windows and Mac users; along with that, every online tool also supports MP4 format for video editing.

![what is wmv format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/guide-about-wmv-format-1.jpg)

WMV format files support the encryption for the use with Digital Rights Management (DRM) systems, protecting the content from copywriting and any unlawful production. The WMV file may contain animation, high-definition videos, TV episodes, or video clips.

WMV compresses large files for better data transmission over a network while maintaining quality standards. It is specifically designed to run on all Windows devices.

However, from June 01, 2021, Google changed its policies of using the app, and now the tool offers limited storage. If more space is needed, the users must subscribe to a paid plan.

**2\. Accessibility**

Google Photos can be accessed from a web browser, Google Drive desktop program, and smartphone app. While you can make only minor changes to the videos such as editing date, time, and location when accessing Google Photos via a web browser, the smartphone app allows you to edit the clips comparatively more sophisticatedly.

**3\. Deletion**

The files that are stored in Google Photos remain there for an indefinite duration, of course until the entire space is completely consumed. When you delete something, it is moved to the Trash and stays there for another 60 days, after which it is automatically deleted from the Cloud forever.

## Part 2: How to Stabilize Videos with Google Photos on Android and iPhone?

## Part 1: What is Google Photos and How Does It Work?

Google Photos is an app that can be obtained from Play Store or App Store to be installed on an Android-based smartphone or iPhone or iPad respectively.

The program can store photos and videos from your phone, and ensures that those media files are well-backed up so they can be recovered easily if/when lost due to some mishaps. Furthermore, the tool even lets you edit, customize, and share your photos and videos with ease.

**1\. History and Current Policies**

Earlier, Google Photos used to offer unlimited storage to the users where they can save as many photos as they want, as long as the images were saved in ‘high-quality’ resolution. However, from June 01, 2021, Google changed its policies of using the app, and now the tool offers limited storage. If more space is needed, the users must subscribe to a paid plan.

**2\. Accessibility**

Google Photos can be accessed from a web browser, Google Drive desktop program, and smartphone app. While you can make only minor changes to the videos such as editing date, time, and location when accessing Google Photos via a web browser, the smartphone app allows you to edit the clips comparatively more sophisticatedly.

**3\. Deletion**
