![buying wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-use-mouse-only-with-filmora-team-2.gif)

## Create a Music Video Without a Keyboard

Let us get started! Whether you have a real mouseless experience or want to take it as a challenge, let's get the things clear first.

* We need to create a **20 seconds** music video.
* We will only be using the footage from the **stock library**.
* We will be using music from the **Wondershare** Filmora **library**.
* We will have 5 minutes to **review** the footage and the music available.
* And most importantly, we don’t have a **keyboard**.

Step 1\. Review your footage

Our first and most crucial step will be to use our imagination and creativity. So get those neurons firing, and let us go!

![reviewing the footage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-use-mouse-only-with-filmora-team-3.gif)

* Head to the **stock media** folder on the bar mentioned above, the Wondershare Filmora.
* Or you can simply look towards the left window, where you will find the sample **videos tab.**
* Click on the sample videos tab, and a new **window** will appear on the library screen.
* Here you will find almost more than **20 videos.**
* So apart from using the actual recorded footage, we will work our way with what we have from **default**.
* For the music, we would be scrolling in the **stock audio library.**
* Click on the **audio tab** above and start **scrolling**.
* You will also find some categories in the **left window**.
* Choose the category of your choice and **listen** to the audio.

Do whatever suit you best. Keep in mind you only have 5 minutes.

Step 2\. Pick music for your clips

Suppose you have found audio that speaks your vibe. The next step would be to find a video that tallies that audio. Let us suppose we have audio that is of the hip-hop genre. Let that creativity shine now!

![drone shot of rooftops](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-use-mouse-only-with-filmora-team-4.gif)

If you like to add a more **classical vibe**, pick a classical song or audio from the audio library.

* After picking the song, move on to the sample videos tab and search for videos that match a **classic vibe.**
* Now random **close-up shots** of a piano, cinematic footage of a big **orchestra**, or simple landscapes with minimalistic movement while focusing on a single object, consider the example below.

![still shot of a bench](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-use-mouse-only-with-filmora-team-5.gif)

Now that a scenario is constructed, our next step is to arrange these clips in the Wondershare Filmora timeline.

Step 3\. Download the clips and audio

**You have 15 minutes to create the music video. Start the timer!** Once you have selected a sample video and audio that matches your scenario, you can **download** them from the bottom right icon on the thumbnail. Only if you still need to download them.

Step 4\. Insert the audio into the timeline

* The first step is to drag the audio to the **timeline**.
* Now play the **audio** from the start. If you can work with the audio as a whole, then it's perfect.

If you want your audio to **start** at a certain point. You have to follow the below-mentioned steps. It is as simple as that!

![splitting the audio on wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-use-mouse-only-with-filmora-team-6.gif)

* **Add** your audio to the timeline.
* Then move the **timer** or the slider where you want your audio to start.
* **Right-click** on the audio file. Select split.
* Your audio file will split into two parts.
* Delete the prior file and drag the file ahead to the start of the timeline.

The next step is to add the videos to the timeline.

Step 5\. Add the video to the timeline

When you have your audio in the timeline, your next step is adding the video. After you have trimmed or split your audio to your wish, follow the below steps.

![adding sample videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-use-mouse-only-with-filmora-team-7.gif)

* **Click** and **drag** to drop the video clips where you want the video to start.
* **Play** the audio first is a good feature for where you want your video to insert.
* Then adjust the **timeline** slider on that point.
* Simply drag your video and drop it into the timeline.

## How to Change Video Resolution in Filmora

With the vast number of devices available in the market today, storing data and video files has become difficult. Frequently in cases where the devices share different forms of resolution, it makes sharing videos a hassle.

In those situations, changing the resolution of your video can be a great idea. It will also allow you to save storage. In this article, you'll adjust the resolution in just a few clicks by Wondershare Filmora. But before we learn how to change a video's resolution, let's look into what a video resolution is!

## Part 1\. What Is a Video Resolution?

A video resolution, in short, is the quality of the video visible. A video is rendered at a specific rate whenever you watch a movie or go to a cinema. A screen is made up of **tiny pixels** and arranged in an order that determines the resolution of a screen.

Video resolution is rendered in a **vertical** and **horizontal** orientation. Therefore, whenever you play a video on YouTube, the resolution scale is available for you to choose from, i.e., **480p**, **720p**, **1080p,** etc.

In most cases, a resolution is dictated by the full abbreviation. So, for example, a **720p** video is **1280 x 720,** and a **1080p** video is a **1920 x 1080** resolution.

![a video resolution dimensions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-1.png)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** The number written before is the number of horizontal pixels in a video. And the number written after is the vertical pixels in a video.

Before we adjust the resolution of a video, let's look at a comparison between different types of video resolution.

## Part 2\. 7 Different Types of Video Resolution

It has been established that a video resolution is not a constant number and changes according to the screen. Scroll below to look at the different forms of video resolutions available!

### 360p

The full resolution is **480 x 360**. This resolution is a minimal video resolution. On a big screen, **360p** will look blurry. That is why a **360p** resolution is the best for smaller devices such as Mobile phones.

### 480p

The full resolution is **853 x 480**. Although an upgrade from the latter, this resolution is available on many devices. It's mainly used in devices such as smaller **TVs**, **laptops,** and **Desktop** computers. It is also available for Burn-in **DVDs**.

### 720p

The full version of the resolution is **1280 x 720**. This resolution is called **HD**, short for High Definition. **720p** quality looks good almost on every device and is also reasonably available.

Most modern devices, such as **Mobile phones**, **Touch Tablets**, **Laptops,** and **PCs,** are calibrated in **720p** Resolution.

![high definition resolution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-2.png)

### 1080p

The resolution in its complete form is **1920 x 1080**. This resolution is also known as **FHD**, short for **Full High Definition. 1080p** resolution is the quality in which many high-quality devices are constructed. As a result, the screens of these devices have a clear and clean display.

![a youtube video in fhd resolution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-3.png)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** It is usually recommended to share videos on social media in 1080p resolution.

### 1440p

This resolution is also called **QHD (Quad HD**). The length and width of this resolution are **2560 x 1440**. As the name suggests, its quality is quad (four times) than that of a standard **720p** resolution.

The screens of devices constructed in this resolution usually have a high-end purpose. For example, this resolution is commonly used in **Gaming monitors** and **High-end smartphones**.

![a gaming monitor in 1440p resolution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-4.png)

### 2160p

The screens constructed in this resolution are considered among the best available in the market. **2160p (3840 x 2160)** is also known as **UHD**, which is short for **Ultra High Definition**. It is also known as **4K** because it offers four times the power of **1080p** or **FHD** (Full High Definition.)

These screens are usually available for high-end competitive gaming monitors or big screen **LCD** and **LED** Television. In addition, some of the flagship smartphones are also built with **4K** resolution.

![difference between hd fhd and 4k resolution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-5.png)

### 4320p

This resolution is also known as **8K**. The length and width of the pixel arrangement are **7680 x 4320**. The pixels are arranged in these screens to offer sixteen times the average power of a **1080p** (FHD) monitor.

This resolution is only available on several devices, such as commercial TVs and monitors. However, this is the most significant resolution available in the modern market. Therefore, even if your monitor cannot support a larger resolution, you can test whether your PC can render an **8K** resolution.

![difference between a 4k and 8k resolution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-6.png)

## Part 3\. Why Do You Need to Change a Video Resolution?

There are numerous cases where you will want to change the resolution of a video. Some of them are described below.

### Decreasing a Video Resolution

Sometimes, you are trying to upload a video from a smartphone. Or, in general, you want to transfer videos to a smartphone. The resolution of your video can play a significant role in the transfer process.

If your video file has a higher resolution, it will take up more space on your phone. As well as, if your PC has a higher resolution, say a **4K** resolution, and your phone is of **1080p** resolution. You might not be able to play it.

To counter situations like these, you need to change the resolution of your video.

### Increasing a Video Resolution

Similarly, there are instances where you would need to change the resolution of your video to increase it.

A good example would be to burn a low-quality **DVD**. To maintain good quality on a **DVD**, you need to increase its resolution before transfer.

Changing the exact resolution of a video is only possible in some cases because you cannot change the precise pixel of the video it is recorded in. But software like Wondershare Filmora allows you to change the resolution of your video easily.

Now let's move to understanding the steps involved in changing the resolution of a video!

## Part 4\. Steps to Change Video Resolution in Filmora

To change the resolution of a video, you would need a basic video editor. This video editor needs to support the features that enable you to adjust a video resolution. In this case, Filmora is the best option.

![wondershare filmora previewing a video's resolution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-9.png)

Now that we have our clips imported, it is time to add them to the timeline below!

##### Step3 Add The Video Clips to Timeline

To add Video clips to the timeline, go through the steps as guided:

* Hold Right click to drag and select the **video clips** in the import window.
* Release Right-click when in the **timeline**.

![wondershare filmora importing clips to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-10.png)

##### Step4 Export Your Video

You can export into video formats in two ways with Filmora. It can be either selecting a format for your video. Or you can also choose to export your video to a particular device.

**Video Format Resolution**

Wondershare Filmora is a fantastic software that allows you to access a variety of formats for your videos. These export formats include **MP4**, **WMV**, **F4V**, **MOV**, **TS**, **3GP**, and more. To select a format for your video, follow the steps as guided:

* Click on **Export**.

![wondershare filmora selecting video format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-11.png)

Exporting a video in a specific format not only allows you to change the format of a video but also allows you to change the resolution simultaneously.

**Default Resolution Settings**

Some formats have a built-in resolution. Whenever you choose a specific format for a video, the resolution of the video will be shifted to the resolution of that format, i.e., **TS** has a default **1080p** resolution.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Another thing to remember is that most video formats have defaulted to **1080p**. But there are some formats whose resolutions vary according to their style. A good example is a **3GP** format, which is set to **352 x 488** by default.

**Customize the Resolution**

But if you don't find the resolution stable for your device, you can also change this default resolution in simple steps. In the export window, follow the steps mentioned ahead:

* In the preset tab, go to > **settings**.
* In the video tab, click on the **resolution**.
* In the **drop-down** menu, select the resolution that you desire.

You can also select a custom resolution by these steps:

* In the **drop-down** menu, click on **Custom**.
* Here, you can change the height and width according to your wish.

![wondershare filmora setting a custom resolution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-12.png)

**Exporting a Video to a Specific Device**

Selecting a format for your video can help if you want to change the resolution. But in cases where you want to export a video to a particular mobile device. Such as an **iPhone** or an **iPad**, you can select the device export option.

In the device export option, you can select a custom device. Filmora allows you to choose from a wide variety of machines available when you choose a custom device; the resolution will be set to optimal for that particular device.

**Select a Folder to Export Your Video**

## Part 3\. Why Do You Need to Change a Video Resolution?

There are numerous cases where you will want to change the resolution of a video. Some of them are described below.

### Decreasing a Video Resolution

Sometimes, you are trying to upload a video from a smartphone. Or, in general, you want to transfer videos to a smartphone. The resolution of your video can play a significant role in the transfer process.

If your video file has a higher resolution, it will take up more space on your phone. As well as, if your PC has a higher resolution, say a **4K** resolution, and your phone is of **1080p** resolution. You might not be able to play it.

To counter situations like these, you need to change the resolution of your video.

### Increasing a Video Resolution

Similarly, there are instances where you would need to change the resolution of your video to increase it.

A good example would be to burn a low-quality **DVD**. To maintain good quality on a **DVD**, you need to increase its resolution before transfer.

Changing the exact resolution of a video is only possible in some cases because you cannot change the precise pixel of the video it is recorded in. But software like Wondershare Filmora allows you to change the resolution of your video easily.

Exporting a video in a specific format not only allows you to change the format of a video but also allows you to change the resolution simultaneously.

**Default Resolution Settings**

Some formats have a built-in resolution. Whenever you choose a specific format for a video, the resolution of the video will be shifted to the resolution of that format, i.e., **TS** has a default **1080p** resolution.

But if you don't find the resolution stable for your device, you can also change this default resolution in simple steps. In the export window, follow the steps mentioned ahead:
