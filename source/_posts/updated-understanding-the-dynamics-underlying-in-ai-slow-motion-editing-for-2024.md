### 3\. AI Auto Enhancement

Many **slow-motion AI** creators have a built-in auto enhancement feature or effect. They incorporate this function to minimize the negative elements. They increase sharpness for clarity and light settings for visual appeal. While slowing down footage, these enhancements act as a helping hand.

### 4\. Time Remapping Option

In **slow-motion AI** video editors, users have the option to manipulate time at different frames. It is a video editing technique that gives you control over pacing and timing. This helps you bring precision to your slow-mo videos through detailed settings. You can manipulate video frames and speed better with this option.
