## Part 1: How Does AI Improve Slow Motion Video Editing?

AI can enhance the quality of content and the mechanism of crafting **slow-mo AI** video. It not only contributes to task achievement but also improves various aspects. Find out about the influence that AI has in achieving a perfect slow-mo effect below:

### 1\. Frame Interpolation

If you create an **AI slow-motion** video, the slow motion is often abrupt. To resolve this problem and bring smoothness to slow-mo, AI frame interpolation can help. Users must activate this function, and AI will handle all the technicalities. The AI adds extra frames to your video to ensure a smooth, slow motion.

### 2\. Minimizing Artifacts

When you convert a video into slow motion, certain changes take place. It introduces artifacts such as motion blur or unwanted distortions. They decline the quality of content, and the view becomes distorted. Reducing these factors magnifies the slow-motion effect and brings perfection to it.

### 3\. AI Auto Enhancement

Many **slow-motion AI** creators have a built-in auto enhancement feature or effect. They incorporate this function to minimize the negative elements. They increase sharpness for clarity and light settings for visual appeal. While slowing down footage, these enhancements act as a helping hand.

### 5\. Automated Noise Cancellation

Just when you think the AI is done for the day, it comes up with another feature. Another significance of AI in slow-motion video creation is reducing noise. Advanced AI algorithms are designed to assist in providing high-quality audio. It is because the audio track quality often declines during a slow-mo.
