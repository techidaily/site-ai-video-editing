[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

##### Step2 Import your clips and add them to the timeline

Open Filmora and create a new project. Import your clip into the media library. Add your clips to the first video layer on the timeline.

![import your video clip and add it to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-6.png)

##### Step3 Apply color correction to the footage

Before we start our edit, let's color correct our footage, so the corrected color is already applied when we take the screenshots.

![apply color correction to your clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-7.jpg)

##### Step4 Find your first action frame

Next, scrub through the clip to find your first action frame. **For example,** in this video, this is our first action frame.

![select the first action frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-8.png)

##### Step5 Take a screenshot of the action frame

Let's head to the camera icon under the preview screen and click the icon. It will take a screenshot of the current frame that the playhead is on the timeline.

![take a screenshot of the action frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-9.gif)

Make sure to keep the playhead the same after you've taken the snapshot. You can find your screenshot in the media tab.

##### Step6 Add the screenshot to timeline

Let's drag your screenshot onto video layer 2 and align it on the right side of the playhead. Then extend the screenshot so it lasts as long as your central clip.

![extend the screenshot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-10.png)

##### Step7 Apply masks to the screenshot

Now, double-click on the screenshot. It will open the "Video" menu, then go into the "Mask" menu. Choose a mask shape and edit it so that it only covers where your subject is in the screenshot. **For example,** we choose the **"**Circle" mask shape in this video.

![choose your mask shape](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-11.png)

If you need help seeing what you're masking, hide the main video layer and edit your mask like this.

![hide the main video layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-12.gif)

Move the playhead forward and clean up your "mask." Next, Increase the blur to soften the edges. But not too much because it may become visible on your subject.

![editing of the mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-13.png)

##### Step8 Hide the first screenshot

Let's layer a couple more action frames! First, hide the first screenshot so it doesn't appear in your new screenshot.

![hide the first screenshot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-14.png)

##### Step9 Select your second action frame

Then, pick a new frame.

![select a new frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-15.png)

* Click the camera icon.
* Drag the screenshot at the new playhead spot.
* Extend the clip.

![repeat the steps](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-16.png)

* Double-click to mask this frame.
* And play it back to make sure it looks good.
* It would help if you did this a couple more times until you have several frames.

Please have a look at the final product and how it looks!

## Top 5 Best Video to PPT Converters You Should Know

Almost three decades after its debut, Microsoft PowerPoint has become a hallmark of professionalism and quality in the presentation software industry. Traditional PPT files produced by PowerPoint have many drawbacks, including the fact that the content of your presentations may be readily edited and reused by others.

The Save to Video option in 2010 and subsequent versions of PowerPoint addresses this problem by allowing users to produce video files that may be readily shared on social media, video sharing sites, or utilized in eLearning courses. The built-in PPT file conversion function in newer versions of PowerPoint has several restrictions that prohibit you from picking the video file type or incorporating embedded media files in the PowerPoint presentation video.

That's why we've compiled a list of the top five video to ppt converter to make the process of turning a PowerPoint presentation into a movie as simple and enjoyable as possible.

## OBS Green Screen Guide

OBS Studio is a free and open-source app for screen-casting and live streaming. Written in C/C++ and built with Qt, OBS Studio provides real-time capture, scene composition, recording, encoding, and broadcasting via the Real Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP).It can stream Videos to any RTMP supporting destination including YouTube, Twitch, Instagram and Facebook.

You only need one green screen software – OBS. The reason why OBS is the most recommended for streaming is because once you have set it up properly, you can do literally anything you can think of with the software (either with or without added plug-ins).

## Chroma Key Settings in OBS

Chroma keying has become incredibly popular nowadays. People use it not just for gaming, but also in Zoom conferences, live interviews, talk shows, etc. Although it may feel complicated at first glance, setting up Chroma Key in OBS Studio is actually incredibly easy.

Have a look at the simple steps you need to take to set up a green screen in OBS:

1. Make sure you have the following equipment prepared: a solid green background, webcam or video camera, lighting, and OBS Studio.
2. Download the latest stable version of OBS Studio from the [official website](https://obsproject.com/) and install the software. Open OBS and let the Auto-Configuration Wizard optimize the software’s settings based on your hardware.
3. Now you can add a video source.
4. Right-click on the video source you’ve created and select Filter.
5. Click the + button under the Effects Filters section and select Chroma Key.
6. Type in a name for this effect layer.
7. After you add a chroma key, OBS will automatically create and adjust the baseline settings for the filter. You can experiment with the sliders and settle when you are satisfied with the result.
8. Make sure you aren’t wearing any green or reflective material. You can double-check the performance on the preview screen.
9. If things are working smoothly, you are all set to start streaming with the green screen on.

Pro tip:

You can follow the instructions above and live stream to multiple platforms at once with Restream. Multistreaming to platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Twitch, and LinkedIn allows you to drastically increase the audience reach and grow your followers.

### How to make OBS green screen settings better

Using green screens for filmmaking isn't the most complicated or difficult thing in the world but it certainly has its pitfalls. If you ask any experienced filmmaker what to look out for when using a green screen, chances are they're going to mention lighting about a billion times and that's for good reason.

### Tips on How to make OBS green screen settings better

* Evenly light your green screen so you can get a good key.
* Watch out for light flares. Use some a matte box or your trusty paw to block out any unwanted light.
* When lighting, try to create as much separation between your subject and the green screen as you can.
* Shutter speed: Minimize motion blur by raising your shutter speed to 1/80 or 1/100
* Aperture: Setting your aperture to f4 or f5.6 will give you slightly more depth of field, which will blur and smooth out your green screen.
* Format: Set your camera to the best recording format it has.
* ISO: Try to avoid high ISOs.
