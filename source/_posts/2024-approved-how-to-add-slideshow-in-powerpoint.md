## How To Fade Audio In Kinemaster

If you have been looking for video and audio editing tools then you have probably heard of Kinemaster. It is a great video editing app that allows users to edit all aspects of the video including any audio or music that may accompany the video. It has a lot of very useful features and the user interface is fairly easy to use.

One of the things that you can do with Kinemaster is to fade out audio, a useful feature that can help the ending of any video appear more authentic. In this article, we will be looking at how you can use Kinemaster to fade audio.

## Kinemaster Fade Audio Steps

The following steps show you how you can easily fade audio in Kinemaster;

Step1If you don't have Kinemaster already, start by downloading and installing the video editor on your computer.

Step2Open Kinemaster on your computer and then click on the “New Project” icon to start. Select the aspect ratio that you would like to use. If you are not sure, we recommend choosing the “16:9” aspect ratio.

![add new project kinemaster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/add-new-project-kinemaster.jpg)

Step3In the next window, click on “Media” to select the clip you would like to add to the Kinemaster project that you have just created.

![click media kinemaster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/click-media-kinemaster.jpg)

Step4To fade in and fade out the audio in the project, click on the gear icon from the options to the left of the screen.

![click gear icon kinemaster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/click-gear-icon-kinemaster.jpg)

Step5Select the “Audio” tab on the next screen and then turn on the switch next to “Audio Fade-in (Start of Project)” and “Audio Fade-out (End of Project).” This will add a fade-in and fade-out effect at the beginning of the audio and at the end of it.

![audio fade effect kinemaster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/audio-fade-effect-kinemaster.jpg)

Step6You can then easily set the duration of the “Audio fade-in” and “Audio fade-out” by dragging the slider below each option. We recommend setting the duration to just a few seconds.

![customize audio fade kinemaster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/customize-audio-fade-kinemaster.jpg)

Don't forget to save the project when you're done.

## Kinemaster Alternative to Edit Audio

Kinemaster is a good way to edit both audio and video on your computer, but the following options are just as good;

### 1\. VideoShop

VideoShop is a simple to use and highly effective program that you can use to create and edit videos on your computer. The interface makes it easy to import any video project that you have into the program and the wealth of very useful features can help you edit the video in various ways.

For example, you can change the speed of the video, add transitions at various points in the video, add and remove text, add and remove music and so much more. Although there is a free trial version, you will only be able to access some of the more useful features when you purchase the premium version.

The Pro version of VideoShop goes for $3.99 a month, but you can get lifetime access to the program for only $39.99\. One thing that VideoShop has over Kinemaster is that it is very easy to use, even beginner users find video editing a breeze with this tool.

![videoshop app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/videoshop-app.jpg)

### 2\. Filmora

If you are looking for a simple way to edit videos on Android or iOS devices, Filmora is one of the best options in the market. This mobile version of the very popular [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) video editor is just as easy to use as its parent program. You can use it to create video projects from scratch or upload a video and make changes to it.

It offers you a lot of choices when it comes to editing features including trimming sections of the video, adding filters, adding music, adding or removing text, and even changing the canvas or the background of the video. Advanced options such as changing the speed of the video are also available.

One of the things that we love about Filmora is that you don't even have to create an account to use it or remove the watermark added to the completed video project, watching a video ad can be enough. But this option is only available once every 24 hours, meaning that you can only remove a watermark on the free version once a day. Filmora is available for both iOS and Android and the yearly premium plan will cost you just $19.90.

![filmorago app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/filmorago-app.jpg)

### 3\. Quik

Quik is a video editing program created by GoPro for the purpose of editing GoPro videos, but that doesn't mean that you will not be able to use it to edit other types of videos. You can use Quik to create a new project or edit an existing video and gives users a lot of different options when it comes to video editing.

## Can I Brighten A Dark Video?

This is a common question that comes up among video editors, so I thought I'd answer it here. The quick answer is yes.

A lot of times, you'll get a video file that was shot in low light, and it will make your subject look dark and underexposed. Video brightness is an important feature that is easy to adjust. However, if your video is too dark to start off with, it may be difficult to brighten it in a way that doesn't look unnatural.

There are several ways you can brighten a dark video. For example, you can use color correction or add more light to the scene before you film. If you already have a dark video, then you'll need to adjust the contrast and brightness of your video during post-production. You can easily do this by using video editing software but keep in mind that too much brightness or too much contrast can result in poor video quality. So, you have to keep everything in balance.

## How to Brighten Video in Adobe Premiere Pro?
