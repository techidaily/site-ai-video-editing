## Plan and develop initial ideas

The first and essential step in creating a music video is planning. This is where you will lay the foundation of your music video. You need to figure out what your video is about and what you want to convey to the audience. It involves a concept or theme for the video, research, and reference material. You can also explore different ideas to make your video unique and engaging.

![graphical text of initial ideas](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/graphical-text-of-initial-ideas.jpg)

##### Step1Research and gather information

You can begin by researching and gathering information from other music videos. This will help you to know what has been done before and what is currently popular. You can also figure out how you can do it differently.

##### Step2Brainstorm and concept development

Once you understand the current trends and styles in the music video. It's time to start brainstorming ideas. You can do it alone or with the help of your team. But remember that you have to think out of the box to make it creative.

##### Step3Consider the lyrics and message

In the planning stage, it is also important to consider the lyrics and message of the song. It would be best if you plan according to the feel and vibe of the song. It will help you to create a concept tied to the song and will help enhance its meaning.

##### Step4Experiment and find the right direction

Once you have a general concept, it's time to develop it further. You can do it by creating rough sketches or storyboards. You can also film test footage to see how the concept will look on screen.

##### Step5Effort and attention to detail

Remember, this step is the foundation of your music video. So, take your time and don't rush through it. By putting in effort and attention to detail, you'll be able to create a visually stunning and closely tied to the song's music video.

## Choose a style for your music video

While creating ideas for the music video, it's also important to consider the style of the music video. There are two main styles of music videos:

![types of music video style](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/types-of-music-video-style.jpg)

### 1.Performance-style music video

If you want to showcase energy and charisma in your music video, go for a performance-style music video. This video style focuses on you and your band performing live in front of an audience. You can shoot a video in a single take with minimal cuts or feature different angles and shots. The key is to capture the raw energy and emotion of the performance.

### 2.Narrative-style music video

A narrative-style music video tells a story or conveys a message along with the music. The story can be a visual representation of the lyrics or a multi-layered narrative. You can choose this style to convey a deeper message or story.

You can shoot this video in different locations and can include different scenes. The main motive is to create a video that emotionally connects with the audience.

Once you have an idea of what you want your music video to be about, you can put together a treatment to show the artist what your initial plan for the music video is.

![treatment of the plan](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/treatment-of-the-plan.jpg)

Once you are done with the style and concept of the video, the next step is storyboarding! It allows you to break down your music video visually and highlight key visual moments.

## Part I. What are the Scenarios When You Need to Speed Up Video?

There are several scenarios when speeding up a video becomes a necessity. Here are the most probable ones that you can relate to.

**Boring But Necessary Parts** \- There could be some sections in a long video that are necessary but boring to watch. You can't bore your viewers and let them leave your video midway. Hence, you can speed up those sections to pass them away quickly.

**Funny Videos** \- The subject's actions in the video look very funny when you speed them up. Therefore, if you make funny videos to entertain your viewers, speeding up certain sections of your video with funny audio in the background should be a regular thing.

**Short Videos** \- Short-duration videos are extremely popular on social media platforms.

Step4 Click on the Change button when you are happy with the result.

### Method 2\. Speed Ramping Option

Speed ramping is a process where you can vary the speed of your video unevenly. It means you can speed up some portions while slowing down others. This is achieved through retime controls that let you edit the video clips in sections using speed points. Here are the steps to illustrate the process.

Step1 Right-click the video clip on your timeline. From the menu, select the Retime Controls option.

Step2 Move the play head where you want to change the speed. Click the arrow next to 100% and select the Add Speed Point option. Similarly, move the play head to another point and add a new speed point.

Step3 Click on the arrow next to 100% to change the speed between two-speed points. Go to the Change Speed option and select from the preset. Based on your preset speed selection, the video's speed within the speed points will change.
