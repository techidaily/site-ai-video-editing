03 [Learn How to Create and Add Gifs to Interactive Layouts in Filmora](#Part 3)

## Part 1  Principles for Great GIF Design

Creating GIFs for infotainment or casual information sharing is the current talk of the trend. You might have visibly landed across a heap of tantalizing GIFs in blogs, social media posts, product promotion websites and almost every other domain you can possibly think of. Using GIFs for any type of content promotion is bound to captivate the target audience in impressive multiplicities. Ever wondered what’s the cue behind the mass appeal that GIFs create? Well, an obvious answer is the stunning **GIF design**.

When going for GIF creation and selection, design plays the key role in creating considerable buzz about the information being transmitted. To add impact to your creation, you need to pay considerable attention to its design implications, thus ensuring that the right things get presented in the right way. Outlined below are some amazing principles you can use to enhance your GIF design to the next level:

### 01Ensure Accuracy and Preciseness

The primary concern you need to be attentive about while designing a GIF is its preciseness. Ensure ban exactness of information and confine your creation to the theme and requirement of your creation, like, the message you want to deliver or the impact you want to create through the GIF. Balance your creativity within specific content parameters and avoid getting carried away or overdoing on the beautifying aspect.

As an example, it is visibly not appealing to add a wholesome mix of 15 shades and 20 different elements in a nature-based GIF. You will end up getting too harsh on the viewers’ eyes, confusing them with a hoard of speeding elements and banging colors. You can instead stick to 2 or 3 frames with an intelligent mix of 2 complementary shades.

### 02Maintain Visual Identity

An important aspect to keep in mind while attempting to **design GIF** is, it should visually relate to the underlying content. For instance, if you are intending a brand promotion through your GIF, lay stress on adding elements like, brand definition, product specifications, know-how of your work patterns, etc. ensure that your content flows naturally and has exactness.

Other alternatives are, using your product logo as the GIF background, character representation of your brand or using some explicit product oriented themes. While, you are free to pick anything that suits your preferences and needs, just make sure that using it in your GIF adds value to your brand instead of giving an out of the box feel.

![GIF Design- Visual Identity Principle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/The-only-guide-you%E2%80%99ll-ever-need-to-learn-gif-design-that-get-shared-like-crazy-1.JPG)

### 03Cut Down on Unnecessary Frames

Have you ever encountered a halt in the natural loop of your GIF out of nowhere? While pondering over the underlying cause, it is a common assumption to take this as an animation fallacy, but that’s evidently not the case. The actual culprits behind this glitch are those extra frames that contribute towards nothing but adding weight to an already heavy file.

To set this straight, you should switch to removing any extra frames, while saving a particular one which you may stretch to a desired duration according to the break point of your contents in the GIF. However, take caution to maintain the visual quality of your GIF while you remove those extra frames.

### 04Make Your GIF Accessible

You should always adhere to the concern of accessibility while creating a GIF. The reason being, your content is visibly going to get mass attention across the web and you cannot filter out visitors, make sure your GIF is easily accessible to all kind of users, particularly those with vision limitations, like, epileptic patients or the ones using screen readers.

Focus on describing your GIF content with alt text and using a limited blinking and flashing rate. In case your GIF content is primarily text based, take care to limit the effective color and image movement and adjust the frames rates to avoid constant and quick movement of image frames when adding many clips on a single page.

Pay additional heed to the auto play feature of your GIFs. It can be visibly annoying to be welcomed on a site homepage with GIFs enjoying an auto play session of their own. You can alternatively, incorporate a ‘Click to Play’ option or grant your site visitors the liberty to decide on what is to be played when.

![GIF Design- Easy GIF Access Principle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/The-only-guide-you%E2%80%99ll-ever-need-to-learn-gif-design-that-get-shared-like-crazy-2.JPG)

### 05Use Storyboards

When aiming to create visibly appealing GIFs, you need to lay considerable stress on choosing an apt background story. Don’t get misled by the wrong assumption of using any random background, owing to the short play duration of GIFs. An impressive solution to this concern is taking the help of a storyboard to keep track of your GIF’s content flow.

Using a storyboard is quite effective means of being in line with the direction of content movement, rescuing you from the hustle of going off the track. This comes explicitly handy when you are working with a team of creators. The storyboard is there to keep everything at the exact place, thus improving member communications and boosting up the design process.

![GIF Design- Storyboard Usage Principle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/The-only-guide-you%E2%80%99ll-ever-need-to-learn-gif-design-that-get-shared-like-crazy-3.JPG)

### 06Focus on Creating Loops

Consider creating an animated motion loop for your GIF allowing a repeated and comprehensive view of your content. Looping projects a deeper observation of the clip and its contents in a seamless transition. However, creating an infinite motion loop in GIFs is quite tricky, as you need to pay utmost concern to ensure a smooth content flow and chances of even the slightest errors are not entertained.

Any loopholes in placement of your GIF elements will get noticed within a blink and lead to an unsatisfactory user experience. Hence, you need to check each of your content frames separately to eliminate chances of possible errors. If you are a beginner, try working with geometrical animations to get the initial pickup. This will be advantageous in deciding the exact element positions at the start and end of the GIF.

### 07Make Use of Motion Blur

Using the concept of motion blur is pivotal in providing a natural flow and feel to your GIF, which, in an otherwise case would ordinarily appear as a mere collection of static images clubbed together. This would give a wobbling feel with unsteady frame movements to your viewers. The motion blur effect potentially ensures a smooth content flow, and your GIF looks like a short video captured from a camera.

![GIF Design- Motion Blur Principle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/The-only-guide-you%E2%80%99ll-ever-need-to-learn-gif-design-that-get-shared-like-crazy-5.JPG)

### 08Stick to a Reduced File Size

Creating GIF of within a standard size range is quite difficult, owing to the fact that these are shared across a variety of media platforms, each having a different file size constraint. It is, however, recommended to stick to a file size as low as possible to escape the notch of modifying the same, ener5y time you need to work with the GIF on a different platform.

Listed below are a few ways to limit your GIF to a lower file size:

**●** Restrict your GIF to a frame count under 150, exceeding which, it will get difficult to export the GIF to most of the commonly visited social media and content sharing platforms.

**●** When your GIF is ready to export, adjust its lossy parameter between 5 and 10 to boost the file compression rate. Look for a setting that decreases the effective file size without compromising with the overall **GIF design.**

**●** Restrict to a minimum possible color usage. This will not only intensify the **GIF design**, but also contribute in maintaining a decreased file size. You can instead, focus on playing with animations or adjusting your image frames to longer play durations.

**●** Don’t experiment with multiple background gradients in your GIF. You can select from either a completely opaque, or a totally transparent background. Adding unnecessary gradients will end up giving your GIF a hazy look, along with a visibly large file that will be difficult to export non any platform.

## Part 2  Amazing Examples of Animated Gifs in Web Design

## Part 1  Principles for Great GIF Design

Creating GIFs for infotainment or casual information sharing is the current talk of the trend. You might have visibly landed across a heap of tantalizing GIFs in blogs, social media posts, product promotion websites and almost every other domain you can possibly think of. Using GIFs for any type of content promotion is bound to captivate the target audience in impressive multiplicities. Ever wondered what’s the cue behind the mass appeal that GIFs create? Well, an obvious answer is the stunning **GIF design**.

When going for GIF creation and selection, design plays the key role in creating considerable buzz about the information being transmitted. To add impact to your creation, you need to pay considerable attention to its design implications, thus ensuring that the right things get presented in the right way. Outlined below are some amazing principles you can use to enhance your GIF design to the next level:

### 01Ensure Accuracy and Preciseness

The primary concern you need to be attentive about while designing a GIF is its preciseness. Ensure ban exactness of information and confine your creation to the theme and requirement of your creation, like, the message you want to deliver or the impact you want to create through the GIF. Balance your creativity within specific content parameters and avoid getting carried away or overdoing on the beautifying aspect.

As an example, it is visibly not appealing to add a wholesome mix of 15 shades and 20 different elements in a nature-based GIF. You will end up getting too harsh on the viewers’ eyes, confusing them with a hoard of speeding elements and banging colors. You can instead stick to 2 or 3 frames with an intelligent mix of 2 complementary shades.

### 02Maintain Visual Identity

An important aspect to keep in mind while attempting to **design GIF** is, it should visually relate to the underlying content. For instance, if you are intending a brand promotion through your GIF, lay stress on adding elements like, brand definition, product specifications, know-how of your work patterns, etc. ensure that your content flows naturally and has exactness.

Other alternatives are, using your product logo as the GIF background, character representation of your brand or using some explicit product oriented themes. While, you are free to pick anything that suits your preferences and needs, just make sure that using it in your GIF adds value to your brand instead of giving an out of the box feel.

![GIF Design- Visual Identity Principle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/The-only-guide-you%E2%80%99ll-ever-need-to-learn-gif-design-that-get-shared-like-crazy-1.JPG)

### 03Cut Down on Unnecessary Frames

Have you ever encountered a halt in the natural loop of your GIF out of nowhere? While pondering over the underlying cause, it is a common assumption to take this as an animation fallacy, but that’s evidently not the case. The actual culprits behind this glitch are those extra frames that contribute towards nothing but adding weight to an already heavy file.

To set this straight, you should switch to removing any extra frames, while saving a particular one which you may stretch to a desired duration according to the break point of your contents in the GIF. However, take caution to maintain the visual quality of your GIF while you remove those extra frames.

### 04Make Your GIF Accessible

You should always adhere to the concern of accessibility while creating a GIF. The reason being, your content is visibly going to get mass attention across the web and you cannot filter out visitors, make sure your GIF is easily accessible to all kind of users, particularly those with vision limitations, like, epileptic patients or the ones using screen readers.

Focus on describing your GIF content with alt text and using a limited blinking and flashing rate. In case your GIF content is primarily text based, take care to limit the effective color and image movement and adjust the frames rates to avoid constant and quick movement of image frames when adding many clips on a single page.

Pay additional heed to the auto play feature of your GIFs. It can be visibly annoying to be welcomed on a site homepage with GIFs enjoying an auto play session of their own. You can alternatively, incorporate a ‘Click to Play’ option or grant your site visitors the liberty to decide on what is to be played when.

### 05Use Storyboards

When aiming to create visibly appealing GIFs, you need to lay considerable stress on choosing an apt background story. Don’t get misled by the wrong assumption of using any random background, owing to the short play duration of GIFs. An impressive solution to this concern is taking the help of a storyboard to keep track of your GIF’s content flow.

### 06Focus on Creating Loops

Consider creating an animated motion loop for your GIF allowing a repeated and comprehensive view of your content. Looping projects a deeper observation of the clip and its contents in a seamless transition. However, creating an infinite motion loop in GIFs is quite tricky, as you need to pay utmost concern to ensure a smooth content flow and chances of even the slightest errors are not entertained.

Hence, you need to check each of your content frames separately to eliminate chances of possible errors. If you are a beginner, try working with geometrical animations to get the initial pickup. This will be advantageous in deciding the exact element positions at the start and end of the GIF.

### 07Make Use of Motion Blur

The Only Guide You’ll Ever Need to Learn GIF Design That Get Shared Like Crazy

#### In this article

01 [8 Principles for Great GIF Design](#Part 1)

02 [6 Amazing Examples of Animated Gifs in Web Design](#Part 2)

03 [Learn How to Create and Add Gifs to Interactive Layouts in Filmora](#Part 3)

## Part 1  Principles for Great GIF Design

Creating GIFs for infotainment or casual information sharing is the current talk of the trend. You might have visibly landed across a heap of tantalizing GIFs in blogs, social media posts, product promotion websites and almost every other domain you can possibly think of. Using GIFs for any type of content promotion is bound to captivate the target audience in impressive multiplicities. Ever wondered what’s the cue behind the mass appeal that GIFs create? Well, an obvious answer is the stunning **GIF design**.

When going for GIF creation and selection, design plays the key role in creating considerable buzz about the information being transmitted. To add impact to your creation, you need to pay considerable attention to its design implications, thus ensuring that the right things get presented in the right way. Outlined below are some amazing principles you can use to enhance your GIF design to the next level:

### 01Ensure Accuracy and Preciseness

The primary concern you need to be attentive about while designing a GIF is its preciseness. Ensure ban exactness of information and confine your creation to the theme and requirement of your creation, like, the message you want to deliver or the impact you want to create through the GIF. Balance your creativity within specific content parameters and avoid getting carried away or overdoing on the beautifying aspect.

As an example, it is visibly not appealing to add a wholesome mix of 15 shades and 20 different elements in a nature-based GIF. You will end up getting too harsh on the viewers’ eyes, confusing them with a hoard of speeding elements and banging colors. You can instead stick to 2 or 3 frames with an intelligent mix of 2 complementary shades.

### 02Maintain Visual Identity

An important aspect to keep in mind while attempting to **design GIF** is, it should visually relate to the underlying content. For instance, if you are intending a brand promotion through your GIF, lay stress on adding elements like, brand definition, product specifications, know-how of your work patterns, etc. ensure that your content flows naturally and has exactness.

Other alternatives are, using your product logo as the GIF background, character representation of your brand or using some explicit product oriented themes. While, you are free to pick anything that suits your preferences and needs, just make sure that using it in your GIF adds value to your brand instead of giving an out of the box feel.

![GIF Design- Visual Identity Principle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/The-only-guide-you%E2%80%99ll-ever-need-to-learn-gif-design-that-get-shared-like-crazy-1.JPG)

### 03Cut Down on Unnecessary Frames

Have you ever encountered a halt in the natural loop of your GIF out of nowhere? While pondering over the underlying cause, it is a common assumption to take this as an animation fallacy, but that’s evidently not the case. The actual culprits behind this glitch are those extra frames that contribute towards nothing but adding weight to an already heavy file.

To set this straight, you should switch to removing any extra frames, while saving a particular one which you may stretch to a desired duration according to the break point of your contents in the GIF. However, take caution to maintain the visual quality of your GIF while you remove those extra frames.

### 04Make Your GIF Accessible

You should always adhere to the concern of accessibility while creating a GIF. The reason being, your content is visibly going to get mass attention across the web and you cannot filter out visitors, make sure your GIF is easily accessible to all kind of users, particularly those with vision limitations, like, epileptic patients or the ones using screen readers.

Focus on describing your GIF content with alt text and using a limited blinking and flashing rate. In case your GIF content is primarily text based, take care to limit the effective color and image movement and adjust the frames rates to avoid constant and quick movement of image frames when adding many clips on a single page.

Pay additional heed to the auto play feature of your GIFs. It can be visibly annoying to be welcomed on a site homepage with GIFs enjoying an auto play session of their own. You can alternatively, incorporate a ‘Click to Play’ option or grant your site visitors the liberty to decide on what is to be played when.

![GIF Design- Easy GIF Access Principle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/The-only-guide-you%E2%80%99ll-ever-need-to-learn-gif-design-that-get-shared-like-crazy-2.JPG)

### 05Use Storyboards

When aiming to create visibly appealing GIFs, you need to lay considerable stress on choosing an apt background story. Don’t get misled by the wrong assumption of using any random background, owing to the short play duration of GIFs. An impressive solution to this concern is taking the help of a storyboard to keep track of your GIF’s content flow.

Using a storyboard is quite effective means of being in line with the direction of content movement, rescuing you from the hustle of going off the track. This comes explicitly handy when you are working with a team of creators. The storyboard is there to keep everything at the exact place, thus improving member communications and boosting up the design process.

![GIF Design- Storyboard Usage Principle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/The-only-guide-you%E2%80%99ll-ever-need-to-learn-gif-design-that-get-shared-like-crazy-3.JPG)

### 06Focus on Creating Loops

Consider creating an animated motion loop for your GIF allowing a repeated and comprehensive view of your content. Looping projects a deeper observation of the clip and its contents in a seamless transition. However, creating an infinite motion loop in GIFs is quite tricky, as you need to pay utmost concern to ensure a smooth content flow and chances of even the slightest errors are not entertained.

Any loopholes in placement of your GIF elements will get noticed within a blink and lead to an unsatisfactory user experience. Hence, you need to check each of your content frames separately to eliminate chances of possible errors. If you are a beginner, try working with geometrical animations to get the initial pickup. This will be advantageous in deciding the exact element positions at the start and end of the GIF.

![GIF Design- Loop Creation Principle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/The-only-guide-you%E2%80%99ll-ever-need-to-learn-gif-design-that-get-shared-like-crazy-4.JPG)

### 07Make Use of Motion Blur

Using the concept of motion blur is pivotal in providing a natural flow and feel to your GIF, which, in an otherwise case would ordinarily appear as a mere collection of static images clubbed together. This would give a wobbling feel with unsteady frame movements to your viewers. The motion blur effect potentially ensures a smooth content flow, and your GIF looks like a short video captured from a camera.

![GIF Design- Motion Blur Principle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/The-only-guide-you%E2%80%99ll-ever-need-to-learn-gif-design-that-get-shared-like-crazy-5.JPG)

### 08Stick to a Reduced File Size

Creating GIF of within a standard size range is quite difficult, owing to the fact that these are shared across a variety of media platforms, each having a different file size constraint. It is, however, recommended to stick to a file size as low as possible to escape the notch of modifying the same, ener5y time you need to work with the GIF on a different platform.

Listed below are a few ways to limit your GIF to a lower file size:

**●** Restrict your GIF to a frame count under 150, exceeding which, it will get difficult to export the GIF to most of the commonly visited social media and content sharing platforms.

**●** When your GIF is ready to export, adjust its lossy parameter between 5 and 10 to boost the file compression rate. Look for a setting that decreases the effective file size without compromising with the overall **GIF design.**

**●** Restrict to a minimum possible color usage. This will not only intensify the **GIF design**, but also contribute in maintaining a decreased file size. You can instead, focus on playing with animations or adjusting your image frames to longer play durations.

**●** Don’t experiment with multiple background gradients in your GIF. You can select from either a completely opaque, or a totally transparent background. Adding unnecessary gradients will end up giving your GIF a hazy look, along with a visibly large file that will be difficult to export non any platform.

## Part 2  Amazing Examples of Animated Gifs in Web Design

GIFs are an effective means of adding appeal to brand promotions and achieving improved market buildup by delivering just the right content in the most captivating and interesting ways. You can use them as creative web design tools to add spark to your product sites, which can potentially boost the market value and reach of your product by multiplying the number of visitors to your site.
