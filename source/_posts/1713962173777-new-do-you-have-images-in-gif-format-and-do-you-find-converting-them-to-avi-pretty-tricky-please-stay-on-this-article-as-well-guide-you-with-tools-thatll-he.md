## Part 1 **What's Video Ideas Generator and How to Use This Tool to Get More Views**

It's not enough to create a YouTube channel and post some video that does not have informative content. Sometimes, even though the video has informative content, the content might not be attractive to the viewers for various reasons, like the content might be routine and does not have more reach, likes, or shares. Along with good content, we also need new and creative ideas to get more viewers. Thus, we have some tools to provide unique and innovative ideas based on the niche you choose.

Videos Idea Generator is a tool that gives ideas for YouTube videos, and it works based on AI technology (Neural Networks). This tool will be more beneficial for the content creators to get more **AI video ideas**. Naturally, you might be out of ideas for your channel, or sometimes it takes more time to get an idea, or it could be a routine idea that does not sound interesting to the viewers. In such cases, **an AI video idea generator** is more helpful in suggesting new and innovative ideas for the content creators based on their interesting topics.

Some of the advantages of a video idea generator are:

### 01Idea 1: Know your Interest

Before starting a YouTube channel or posting a video, know your area of interest first. Once you get clarity on the area of interest, it's easy to pick a topic from that and create an innovative video. Try to be more specific in the topic you choose. Also, have clarity on the section of audience you want to target.

For example, if your topic is more related to children, add more animations of animals/ cartoons that interest children. If you choose a related topic, do not add more animations that might confuse the audience. Add more reference links so that they can refer to those and be more particular on the specific topic you are trying to explain through the video.

Available for both Android and iOS devices, Adobe Spark is a video editing tool that has numerous tools to add and edit texts on videos. You can use the professionally designed templates that you have access to when using Adobe Spark to create stunning animation titles. And since it easily integrates with other apps on the device, sharing the videos is very easy.

Quik is an app that is dedicated to text animations and therefore one of the best solutions when you want to add and edit texts on videos. It is available for both iOS and Android and although the free version of the app is slightly limited, its basic editing features are still better than what you find on other more expensive solutions.

### Hyper-type Animated Text Videos

Rating: 4.5/5

Link: <https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hype-type-animated-text-videos>

This app gives you two options when it comes to animating the text on your video; auto-motion and typography. It focuses on just adding and editing text on a video and as such may not have any of the other video editing features you will find on some of the other apps. But if your goal is to create an interactive animated video title, Hyper-type Animated Text Videos is a great solution.

### Vimeo

Rating: 4.5/5

Link: <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vimeo.android.videoapp&hl=en&gl=US>

Also available for both iOS and Android devices, Vimeo can also be a handy solution for the creation and editing of animated titles for videos. It has a lot of features to edit not just the text in videos, but also all other elements including audio. You even get a wide selection of royalty-free music that you can add to the video and motion stickers to make your title stand out even more. But the free version of Vimeo will add a watermark to the video.
