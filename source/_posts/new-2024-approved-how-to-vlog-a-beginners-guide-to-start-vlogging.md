### 3\. Include a Comedy Touch

People love comedy! They die for looking content that can make them laugh and make their day good. Your vlog video should be a distributed combination of different niches and types that can be targeted across different points as per the requirement of the audience. You will always understand the point where you wish to add a particular style of interaction. Adding a comedy touch will make your viewers laugh, which is a win-win for your vlog channel.

The topic or concept that has been presented needs to be addressed perfectly in vlogs to cater to the requirements.
