###### ▷ When Would the Cut Happen

The cut would happen when the first shot has ended and is followed by the second shot. Repeating that will have an impact on how the viewer sees the movie and follows the story.

### B. Adding Music and Sound Effect

###### ▷ Sound Effects

Depending on what kind of movie it is, sound effects can make a huge difference in the viewing experience. No matter if it’s an explosion, an extra wind sound, a door crackle, or laughing people in the background.

There are built-in effects and features to ease the editing process for you. In addition, you can do custom settings in it and save them as presets. One of its many specifications is that it is an elite background remover and replacement. It enables a seamless addition of the sky in the background. We have mentioned the step-by-step procedure of **After Effects replace Sky** below:

### Procedure 1: Removing Video Background

**Step 1:** After bringing your video to the timeline, navigate towards the top search bar at the left. In the Effects Control option, search for the "Extractor" effect and add it. Then, change the "Channel" of this effect to your "Blue" or "Luminance." Change the position of both sliders there to remove and feather the background.

![enable extract effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/replace-sky-background-in-after-effects-1.jpg)

**Step 2:** To avoid removing parts other than the sky, duplicate this video to the timeline. From the bottom video, eliminate the extractor effect. Navigate towards the top toolbar and select the "Mask" option. Create a mask around the ground at the bottom of the video. In the timeline, click the "Mask Path" option to create the mask throughout the video.

![enable pen tool to draw mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/replace-sky-background-in-after-effects-2.jpg)

![activate 3d tracking for mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/replace-sky-background-in-after-effects-5.jpg)

### Procedure 3: Replacing the Sky

**Step 1:** Import the video of your sky and bring it to the timeline. Bring the sky in the back of your footage and change it to a 3D layer. Afterward, change the "Position" of your sky from the timeline. We recommend you set the values as far away as possible for realistic effect.

![adjust the position of sky](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/replace-sky-background-in-after-effects-7.jpg)

**Step 2:** Once you have set the sky's position, navigate towards the timeline panel again. From there, change the "Scale" of the background to set according to your footage. Afterward, see if the sky needs any flipping. This is because you must align the bright parts of the sky with the bright parts of the ground.

## Part 1: What Are the Benefits of Having Video Background Replacers?

Along with enhancing the creative element in videos, background replacers help with more. Users can integrate them for both personal and professional uses. The following section will give a sneak peek at the advantages of background removers:

### 1\. Privacy and Concealment

Video background removers extract the real surroundings, which addresses privacy concerns. In addition, they conceal any mess or imperfections in your background.

### 2\. Maintains Professional Appearance

They help you set up professional backgrounds for Zoom meetings or Google Classrooms. In this way, they maintain the professional element of your videos.

### 3\. Marketing Consistency

When it comes to marketing, they help choose a reliable background for the brand. The background becomes the identity of the brand and maintains its consistency.

### 4\. Creative Expression in Movies

In the media industry, backgrounds like the sky help express the emotion of an actor or a mass. If there is anger, the sky will turn red; if there is peace, it will have a calm outlook.

### 5\. Audience Engagement and Focus

A well-aligned background increases the audience's focus on the theme of the video. This is because irrelevant backgrounds can catch the audience's interest and distract them.
