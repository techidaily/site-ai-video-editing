Step4The next step is to add color to the scene. To do that, right-click on the layer and choose “New > Solid.” Select the gold color and click “OK.” Do the same with the second layer.

Step5Now you want to blend both colors by choosing a blending mode. Hold the “Shift” key and “hyphen” or “=” sign on the keyboard and choose “Overlay.”

Step6To make the color stronger, go to “Layer > Solid Settings” and choose a color.

Step7Go back to “Comp 3.” Right-click on it and select “New > Light” to add a new point of light.

Step8Go back to the project panel to click on “Comp 4” to add the environment. Right-click on the Comp 4 layer and make it an environment layer.

Step9In the options that appear, set “Appears in Reflections” to “Only” and you can then increase and decrease the color saturation until you have the desired result.

## Part 5 Use stock images to pep up your text collage

The text is the additional elements of the collage to make them look more interesting while the images and photos remain as the main content. So, no matter how interesting your text and its design are, if the images in the collages are not interesting, the collage will be of no good.

So, if you do not have interesting pictures matching your theme in high quality, no need to worry as there are several tools that can help you use their stock images for creating a collage or other purposes.
