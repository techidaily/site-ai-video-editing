## What’re the Best Alternatives to Pexels?

Sites like Pexels provide you with royalty-free images to include in your messages to further their impact. Although Pexels is a great resource for royalty-free photos and animations, it is not without its limitations. Here is a list of Pexels alternatives for you to consider when creating content. It includes reasons why the sites are suitable alternatives and brief guides on how to get started on them.

## Part1: What are the best alternatives to Pexels?

There are several factors to consider when selecting a suitable image resource for your messaging. For example, you may consider a site favorable to another because of its intuitive user interface, or you may consider another because it has no pesky advertisements. Taking this into consideration, here is a list of the three best Pexels alternatives worth checking out for your next project.

### No.1 Unsplash

![unsplash](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/pexels-alternatives-1.jpg)

Unsplash is a stock photo-sharing website run by Getty Images. According to recent reports, the site hosts over 265,000 photographers contributing to a library of over 3.5 million photos. Initially, all photos were under a creative commons license zero, meaning you could distribute the photos without restriction. However, following lobbying from some creators, all photos are now under the Unsplash license.

This means you can still copy, modify, share, and download images for free. However, under the new licensing terms, you cannot use unedited copies of the images for commercial purposes such as T-Shirt printing or branding and using the photos on a similar or competing service.

Most Unsplash users praise it for the following features:

* The library contains tons of high-resolution photos.
* You can access the site through your web browser or the app available on Android and iOS devices.
* There are no download limits to the photos, and everything is free.
* Unsplash is a plugin for various content editing software such as Filmora 11, Adobe XD, and Figma.

Despite all the positives, here are a few improvements to make Unsplash even better.

* The website lacks a free HD video library, which would be a great addition for aspiring content creators.
* In addition, the search algorithm is not as accurate, and you may struggle to find suitable images for your subject matter.

### No.2 Shutterstock

Another Pexels alternative to consider is Shutterstock. It is an online resource where individuals and businesses can access high-quality, licensed photos, videos, illustrations, vectors, and music for their content creation.

![shutterstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/pexels-alternatives-2.jpg)

Unlike Unsplash above, you need to create an account to access Shutterstock services. In addition, the website offers different pricing models for each user, depending on your unique requirements. For example, you can subscribe to an image-only subscription that allows you ten image downloads monthly for $29\. Alternatively, you can purchase the Mix and Match subscription that offers you 25 credits monthly to download different media from the site.

Currently, the website boasts a collection of over 200 million royalty-free images and over 10 million video clips. In addition, the company also offers a percentage-based compensation model to contributors, with first-timers earning up to 15% of content sales. Furthermore, the site continues to populate its library through the acquisition of different companies in a similar space. Some of its notable acquisitions include Turbosquid, Bigstock, Rex Features, and BEImages.

### No.3 Filmstock \[Editor's Choices\]

![filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/pexels-alternatives-3.jpg)

Filmstock is an online library of different editing resources for filmmakers. Some of the resources you can obtain are effects, elements, titles, and audio. In addition, Filmstock is the most recent version of the formerly known Filmora Effects Store.

Filmstock currently offers its services in three categories. They are:

* A Free package that allows you unlimited downloads of media effects and resources under a royalty-free license. However, any resource you download from the site comes with a Filmora tag.
* The Standard subscription will cost you $9.99 per month and includes free technical support as an additional feature to those available in the free package.
* Finally, the Premium subscription gives you access to the premium library that contains an exclusive selection of the contributors' commercial work. The package will cost you $32.99 monthly and also includes all the features in the previous subscription models.

Kindly note that you must register for a Filmstock or Wondershare account to use the service. In addition, you will need to purchase a separate license to use the service with Filmora Video Editing software.

### No.4 Getty Images

![getty images](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/pexels-alternatives-4.jpg)

Getty Images is an online supplier of media resources for media, creative, and corporate clients. It boasts a resource library of over 477 million entries. Access to the site requires you to create a user account. In addition, some of the prints you will find on the site will require you to make a purchase, depending on the size and quality.

### No.5 iStock

iStock is an online library of creative resources, including music, videos, illustrations, and images. In addition, the site offers access to its exclusive stock-image library through different subscription models. Some of the platforms appealing features include the following:

* An AI-powered search engine that provides more accurate results than Pexels.
* Preset templates for easier creation of videos and social media posts.

### No.6 Flickr

![flickr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/pexels-alternatives-6.jpg)

Flickr is another alternative to Pexels worth considering. This is because it offers you free and paid access to one of the internet's largest creative libraries. In addition, you can select from several licenses, including creative commons and U.S. Government works licenses for your assets, something other similar sites lack in their offering.

### No.7 Pixabay

![pixabay](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/pexels-alternatives-7.jpg)

Pixabay gives you access to over 1 million creative assets in different categories, including videos, music, and sound effects. In addition, the site offers its content under the creative commons zero licenses, meaning you can use all stock photos without fear of backlash. Although the site's search function requires work on its accuracy, the numerous categories make it easier to pinpoint your desired image.

### No.8 Adobe Stock

![adobe stock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/pexels-alternatives-8.jpg)

Another site like Pexels is Adobe Stock, where you can access millions of creative assets for your content. Depending on your licensing options, the site offers free and paid access to its services.

### No.9 Vista Create

### No.10 LibreStock

![librestock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/pexels-alternatives-10.jpg)

Unlike the ones above, LIbreStock is an aggregator site that combines stock photo databases in a single platform. As such, it is arguably the largest provider of royalty-free images on the web. In addition, it automatically filters out poor-quality images, guaranteeing you excellence each time.

Most LibreStock users name the website's search function as its best feature. This is because it also utilizes search tags when scanning through different databases. As such, you can easily find unique stock photos for your creation, regardless of how outrageous the search tag is. Finally, LibreStock provides its content under the creative commons zero licenses, meaning you can use the assets for personal and commercial work.

### No.11 StockSnap

![stocksnap](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/pexels-alternatives-11.jpg)

StockSnap operates similarly to Pexels, as it also offers a variety of free stock photos and images. However, a few tweaks to how you receive these creative assets make it slightly better. For example, StockSnap allows you to download ten free images from Shutterstock if what you need is unavailable in their library.

In addition, the platform also displays the most recent additions to their library in the top search results. As such, you are guaranteed to receive unique pictures without significant overuse.

## Part2: FAQs

## Detailed Tutorial to Rotate Videos in Cyberlink PowerDirector

Video Editing is a craft that is highly dependent on various characteristics of your video. But the way one presents it or goes about filming clips also has a profound effect on the end product. And as you may know, not every aspect of a video production activity always goes without hiccups. But editing can come in clutch as it can easily solve minor problems like skewed footage that was shot at the wrong angle or is upside down (an issue that can happen while using mobile phones).

Thus, with this article, we will be looking at steps to rotate a video in Cyberlink PowerDirector to help you when required. We have also mentioned the steps you will need to follow in Wondershare Filmora.

**_Note:_** _We documented the steps in this guide with PowerDirector 365 and WonderShare Filmora X._

## Steps to Rotate Videos with CyberLink PowerDirector

Put yourself in a situation where you've just finished filming a project with your smartphone but end up realizing that the footage isn't in the right orientation by default. While the error has an easy fix on most smartphones, you can also perform this action with video editing tools.

Also, while this form of rotating might be the most basic implementation of the feature, you can often use the feature to add a dynamic nature to your video with Keyframes.

**Definition:** Keyframes in Video Editing is a software feature that allows an editor to set start and endpoints (denoted by In and Out Markers), presenting the opportunity to custom clip properties between the two positions. The set changes occur gradually as the playhead continues moving through the clip. Properties that can undergo modification with this method are zoom, rotation, colors, positions, etc.

The process of rotating clips is fairly straightforward; once you have PowerDirector 365 open, follow the steps listed below.

_If you do not have CyberLink PowerDirector 365, download the software by visiting_ [_Cyberlink's official website_](https://www.cyberlink.com/products/powerdirector-video-editing-software/features%5Fen%5FUS.html)_._

**Step 1:** Create a new video project in Cyberlink PowerDirector 365 and choose Full Mode.

![rotate-videos-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/rotate-videos-powerdirector-1.jpeg)

**Note:** Full Mode in Cyberlink PowerDirector 365 will provide users access to a full-featured video editing tool similar in function to Wondershare Filmora. The other option available is Ad Designer.

**Step 2:** Now, import media onto the Timeline from the Media Library.

For this guide, we used the pre-existing stock footage in Cyberlink PowerDirector.

![rotate-videos-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/rotate-videos-powerdirector-2.jpeg)

**Step 3:** Now, click on the video file on the Timeline; this will activate the video in the Preview Window. And it will provide you with access to the rotation circle, allowing you to change the orientation of the source file.

![rotate-videos-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/rotate-videos-powerdirector-3.jpeg)

**EXTRA**

Rotation added in the PiP Designer will function as a keyframe-based rotation action. Right-click on the video in the preview window, choose Edit and then Modify to access this menu.

![rotate-videos-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/rotate-videos-powerdirector-4.jpeg)

Following this, you can click on the Motion Tab, go into Rotation Settings, and modify the angle with greater precision. In the Preview Window, you will now be able to see the rotating video.

![rotate-videos-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/rotate-videos-powerdirector-5.jpeg)

## **An Easier Way to Crop Video with Wondershare Filmora**

Though Cyberlink PowerDirector 365 is a powerful video editing tool, we felt its menus were not as simple to navigate. Accessing the rotate function while available in the forefront, the use of PiP Designer didn't feel intuitive.

In Wondershare [Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) , rotating footage only happens via the Edit Option, and this straightforward approach felt simple. As for those who want to use Keyframes, the integration of this feature right above the Timeline is an appreciated convenience.

This emphasis on quick accessibility is present with almost every function in Filmora, and we believe this to be a significant advantage. The use of modern and unique iconography also increases familiarity, an aspect that will always be welcoming to new and budding creators.

_If you do not already have Wondershare Filmora, you can download the software by visiting the official website._

To help you learn how to use the rotate function and show you an example of the easy accessibility in Filmora, here is how you can use the feature to get the output you desire.

For macOS 10.14 or later

Once you have a new project open in Filmora, follow the steps listed below.

**Step 1:** Import a Media File to edit into your Video Project.

![rotate-videos-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/rotate-videos-powerdirector-6.jpeg)

**Step 2:** Drag the video clip onto the Timeline and then select it with a mouse click to activate further interactions.

![rotate-videos-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/rotate-videos-powerdirector-7.jpeg)

**Step 3:** Choose the Edit Option (marked in Red).

This will bring up the Edit Window in the left-top corner of your screen.

![rotate-videos-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/rotate-videos-powerdirector-8.jpeg)

**Step 4:** Click on the Transform Menu and use the Rotation Slider to edit the orientation.

![rotate-videos-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/rotate-videos-powerdirector-9.jpeg)

Having read this stretch of the guide, we believe you may have noticed how Filmora is more user-friendly and accessible due to its menu layout.

**BONUS**

Click on the Keyframe Button (marked in Green) to access the Keyframe Menu that allows you to set points between which a decided amount of rotation can happen.

![rotate-videos-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/rotate-videos-powerdirector-10.jpeg)

## The Bottom Line

This marks the end of our guide on how to rotate video in PowerDirector 365 and Wondershare Filmora X. Now, while both software are high-capable tools, we feel the keyframe-based working on rotation in Filmora is a lot more intuitive and easy to use. The ability to only have number-based rotation within the edit menu is also a positive, as rotating with a swivel like in PowerDirector isn't always the most accurate.

And lastly, the modern iconography-based design of Wondershare Filmora is a factor to keep in mind, as this increases usability manifolds.

Having read this stretch of the guide, we believe you may have noticed how Filmora is more user-friendly and accessible due to its menu layout.

**BONUS**

Click on the Keyframe Button (marked in Green) to access the Keyframe Menu that allows you to set points between which a decided amount of rotation can happen.

## The Bottom Line

This marks the end of our guide on how to rotate video in PowerDirector 365 and Wondershare Filmora X. Now, while both software are high-capable tools, we feel the keyframe-based working on rotation in Filmora is a lot more intuitive and easy to use. The ability to only have number-based rotation within the edit menu is also a positive, as rotating with a swivel like in PowerDirector isn't always the most accurate.

And lastly, the modern iconography-based design of Wondershare Filmora is a factor to keep in mind, as this increases usability manifolds.
