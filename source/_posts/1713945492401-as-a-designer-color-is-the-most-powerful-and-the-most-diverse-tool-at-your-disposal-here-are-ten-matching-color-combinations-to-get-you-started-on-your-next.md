## Part 1 What is Color Combination?

Color Theory is an art when it comes to playing with colors. It explains how people perceive color and the visual effects of colors mixing, pairing, and contrasting with one another. Designers use a color wheel and considerable collected knowledge about human psychology, society, and more to pick the perfect **colors that match everything**. Color is a crucial, if not the most important, feature of design since it may affect the meaning of the text, how people move across a layout, and how they feel. You may be more intentional in generating graphics that affect you if you understand color theory.

## Part 2 Types of Color Combinations

Learning how different **colors match together** is essential for successful color combinations. Studying the color wheel and color harmonies (what works, what doesn't, and how color communicates) will help you blend colors, establish a stronger brand, and share more effectively with your designers and printers.

**The color wheel contains:?**

**●** Three primary colors (red, yellow, and blue),?

**●** Three secondary colors (purple, green, and orange), and?

**●** Six tertiary colors (colors generated when you mix primary colors), plus (colors created from primary and secondary colors, such as blue-green or red-violet).

![color wheel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/matching-color-combinations-02.JPG)

Draw a line over the core of the wheel to separate the warm colors (reds, oranges, and yellows) from the cool colors (blues, greens, and purples) (blues, greens, purples).

Warm colors are connected with activity, brightness, and vigor, whereas cold colors are associated with tranquility, peace, and serenity. So when you hold that color has a temperature, you can see how its use might influence your message.

On the color wheel, complementary hues are opposites. They may make artwork jump because of the great contrast between the two hues, but overusing them can get tiring.

Analogous hues are next to each other. Therefore, one color will dominate, one will support, and another will accent when developing a similar color scheme.

Triadic hues are energetic and vibrant, evenly dispersed throughout the color wheel. They provide visual contrast and harmony, allowing everything to shine as the overall image comes to life.

You can build a variety of grand color schemes by using the color wheel. Finding the perfect color combination for the right occasion is vital.

## Part 1 What is Color Combination?

Color Theory is an art when it comes to playing with colors. It explains how people perceive color and the visual effects of colors mixing, pairing, and contrasting with one another. Designers use a color wheel and considerable collected knowledge about human psychology, society, and more to pick the perfect **colors that match everything**. Color is a crucial, if not the most important, feature of design since it may affect the meaning of the text, how people move across a layout, and how they feel. You may be more intentional in generating graphics that affect you if you understand color theory.

## Part 2 Types of Color Combinations

Learning how different **colors match together** is essential for successful color combinations. Studying the color wheel and color harmonies (what works, what doesn't, and how color communicates) will help you blend colors, establish a stronger brand, and share more effectively with your designers and printers.

**The color wheel contains:?**

**●** Three primary colors (red, yellow, and blue),?

**●** Three secondary colors (purple, green, and orange), and?

**●** Six tertiary colors (colors generated when you mix primary colors), plus (colors created from primary and secondary colors, such as blue-green or red-violet).

![color wheel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/matching-color-combinations-02.JPG)

Draw a line over the core of the wheel to separate the warm colors (reds, oranges, and yellows) from the cool colors (blues, greens, and purples) (blues, greens, purples).

Warm colors are connected with activity, brightness, and vigor, whereas cold colors are associated with tranquility, peace, and serenity. So when you hold that color has a temperature, you can see how its use might influence your message.

On the color wheel, complementary hues are opposites. They may make artwork jump because of the great contrast between the two hues, but overusing them can get tiring.

Analogous hues are next to each other. Therefore, one color will dominate, one will support, and another will accent when developing a similar color scheme.

Triadic hues are energetic and vibrant, evenly dispersed throughout the color wheel. They provide visual contrast and harmony, allowing everything to shine as the overall image comes to life.

You can build a variety of grand color schemes by using the color wheel. Finding the perfect color combination for the right occasion is vital.

A few years back, we had no choice but to watch glitchy movies on rusty VCR devices. Nowadays, retro video effects are very popular in TV movies and even games. You can use these effects in many ways, like making fake vintage footage or emulating a glitching computer.

Filmmakers frequently employ glitching in their videos to give the impression that a character has been affected by a technical abnormality, is having a flashback, or is being watched by someone else via a digital camera system. Something happens when the person or image flashes, often without their knowledge. In addition, you can apply the glitch effect to a composition to evoke a feeling of dramatic irony.

## Part 3: Tutorial to Chromatic Aberration Effect

Chromatic aberration refers to how old lenses tend to split colors. This effect is very common in Old media like VHS or LaserDisc.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

Step1 Once you have your clip on the timeline, select your clip and click on Edit. Now choose Duplicate to create two more copies.

![select your clip and click on edit](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/glitch_effect_5.jpg)

Step2 Put the new copies on the layer above the others and make sure everything is lined up exactly. To create the glitch effect, separate the color channels on your Clips into the primary colors red, green, and blue.

![put the new copies on the layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/glitch_effect_6.jpg)

Step3 Double-click on the top clip.

![double-click on the top clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/glitch_effect_7.jpg)

Go to Color and open the White Balance option to make this layer completely red. Next, drag both Temperature and Tint sliders to a hundred.

![open the white balance option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/glitch_effect_8.jpg)

Step4 Now click the little eye icon on the timeline to hide the top layer and move on to the middle layer.

Step5 Double-click on your middle clip and go to Color, then select White Balance and set your Temperature to -100 and your Tint to 100.

![go to color](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/glitch_effect_9.jpg)

Step6 Finally, hide this layer just like before. Repeat the same steps for the last clip but make this clip the blue layer by leaving the Temperature at zero and setting the Tint to -100.

![setting the tint to -100](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/glitch_effect_10.jpg)

Step7 Double-click the clip in the top layer, click the Video Tab, and open the Compositing options. Set the Blending Mode of this top layer to Soft Light.

![click the video tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/glitch_effect_11.jpg)

Now click on the clip in your preview window and move the image over by pressing the left Arrow key on your keyboard a few times. Once you're happy with the top clip, hide that layer by clicking the eye icon.

![click on the clip in your preview window](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/glitch_effect_12.jpg)

Step8 To make the middle layer visible, double-click the clip in your mid layer and set the Blending Mode of this layer to Screen.

![double-click the clip in your mid layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/glitch_effect_13.jpg)

Now click on your clip in the preview window and press the Right key as many times as you did before. Finally, make all the layers visible by clicking the eye icon.

![press the right key](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/glitch_effect_14.jpg)

**Vignette**

A vignette is a dark border that fades around the frame's edges in Filmora. You can easily add a vignette effect to your video by using these steps:

Step1 First, click the Effects Tab and type in Vignette.

Step2 Next, drag the Vignette Radius effect to a layer above your previous three layers.

Step3 Now adjust the length to match the other clips.

**VHS static effects**

A VHS effect is a grainy distortion that resembles an old analog video cassette recording. To apply the VHS static effects:

Step1 Click the Effects tab.

Step2 Search for the VHS static and drag it to a new layer above everything else.

Step3 Extend one of the effects to match the length of your previous clips.

**VCR Distortion**

VCR Distortion effect will make your video look highly glitched. To apply this effect:

Step1 Click on the Effects tab.

Step2 Search for VCR Distortion, then drag and drop this effect over your previous layer.

## Part 5: Tips to Create Awesome Glitch Effects

1. One of the best ways to use the VCR Distortion effect is to cut it short and intersperse it around your video in random parts.
2. The glitch Distortion effect is very intense, so we recommend cutting this effect very short and dropping it at random parts of your video.
3. You can also use these effects as a sneaky way to hide Cuts in your video.

## Summary

You can use glitch effects created or inspired by faulty video equipment as a powerful storytelling tool. These effects can help you change the tone of the entire video by adding a specific visual aesthetic and making the narrative simpler to convey and more approachable for the audience.

We recommend using Filmora 11 for adding built-in glitch effects. You can also use this app to create custom glitch effects within a few minutes.
