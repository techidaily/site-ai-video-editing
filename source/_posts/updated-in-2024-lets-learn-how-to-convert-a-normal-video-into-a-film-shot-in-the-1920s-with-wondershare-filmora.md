M31 LUT (Teal & Orange Lut) is one of the most used LUTs in Hollywood and other cinematic industries. This LUT help to get your video the cinematic colors of teal and orange. The contrast between the two colors teal and orange is clear, but there are also other colors present in nature. For example, human skin is mostly composed of the colors yellow, red, and brown. Because blue is the complement of these colors, teal is their contrast color.
