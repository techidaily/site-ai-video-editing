These colors can also merge more smoothly with the rest of the image. In this article, we will discuss how to use it and other amazing LUTs in your videos. So let's begin!

## Part 1\. What is M31 LUT (Teal & Orange LUT)?

M31 LUT (Teal & Orange Lut) is one of the most used LUTs in Hollywood and other cinematic industries. This LUT help to get your video the cinematic colors of teal and orange. The contrast between the two colors teal and orange is clear, but there are also other colors present in nature. For example, human skin is mostly composed of the colors yellow, red, and brown. Because blue is the complement of these colors, teal is their contrast color.

Other quality features are Color Remapping, Skin Toning, Saturation, etc. In other words, it helps your videos look like popular Hollywood films as they also use this same LUT in their movies. Its popularity in Hollywood films may be due to a number of factors, but one of the most crucial ones is that it gives the scene a cohesive mood by allowing disparate aspects to mirror one another and emphasize the overall qualities of the scene.
