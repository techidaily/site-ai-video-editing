## How to Change Frame Rate in Premiere Pro

The video's frame rate is an important aspect of it. Too high of a frame rate makes the video seem unnatural. On the other hand, too low can make some videos choppy. You can fix that by changing the frame rate using a video editor. And we are here to help you learn how to do that. Here's **how to change the frame rate in Premiere Pro.**

The frame rate sometimes makes or breaks the video. So it is important to get this setting right. Suppose you made a mistake and recorded your video in the wrong setting. You can follow this guide to solve your problem.

![check frame rate in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-frame-rate-premiere.JPG)

## How To Check Video Frame Rate in Premiere Pro

Before we teach you how to change a video's frame rate in Premiere Pro, let's first make sure you know how to check. Maybe you don't need to modify the video because it is already in the correct setting.

So how do you do that in Premiere Pro?

1. Import the video to Adobe Premiere Pro.
2. Check the "Media" window. Next to the video file name is its frame rate. It is written in the format x.00 fps. FPS stands for "frames per second," which is used interchangeably with the term frame rate.

![check video frame rate in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/check-frame-rate-premiere-pro.jpg)

## Reasons for Changing Frame Rate

Suppose you have an action-packed video. It would not look great at 30 fps - it will look too choppy. That will give your audience a rotten viewing experience. By increasing the frames, you can make the motion more fluid and smoother.

Increasing the frames per second also results in better slow-motion videos. A 30 fps one would not look good with this effect because it does not show smooth motion. Thus, we recommend making the video at least 60 fps.

However, a higher frame rate does not always mean better videos. It can result in what they call the "soap opera effect." It means the video shows too many details. That makes the videos seem "unnatural" or less cinematic.

High frame rates make videos look more realistic since there is less stuttering and motion blur between frames. That's great. But for older audiences - the ones used to watching videos at 24 fps, it can be off-putting. So it's also important to consider your target audience when deciding the right frame rate for your video.

With these reasons in mind, you may want to change your video's frame rate.

## How To Change FPS in Premiere Pro

Let's dilly-dally no more. Here's a quick guide on how to change fps in Adobe Premiere Pro. This program gives you two different ways to change fps. One is changing the frame rate of a sequence; the other is changing the frame rate of the video clip. We will teach you how to do both.

### l Change the Frame Rate of a Sequence

Suppose you want to keep the frame rate of most of the video the same. Only some parts need adjusting. You can change the frame rate of the sequences that need changing instead. Here are the steps to follow to achieve this:

1. Open your project in Adobe Premiere Pro.
2. In the Project panel, select the sequence whose frame rate you want to change. Right-click on that sequence.
3. Choose "Sequence Settings" from the menu that appears.

![sequence settings in adobe premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-frame-rate-sequence-3.JPG)

1. Click the drop-down menu for "Timebase."
2. Select the frame rate you want the sequence to be in.

![changing video sequence frame rate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-frame-rate-sequence-5.JPG)

1. Click "OK."

### l Change the Frame Rate of a Video Clip

Here are the steps you should follow if you want to change the frame rate of an entire video clip.

1. Import your video clip to Premiere Pro and drag it to the timeline.
2. Go to the "Effects" tab. It's in the options at the bottom left of the screen.

![effects tab in adobe premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-frame-rate-clip-2.JPG)

1. Select "Video Effects" > "Time" > "Posterize Time."

![posterize time video effect option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-frame-rate-clip-3.JPG)

1. Drag and drop the Posterize Time effect to the clip whose frame rate you want to change.
2. Click "Effect Controls" at the top left of the screen.
3. Select the small "arrow" button next to the "Frame Rate" text under "Posterize Time."
4. Change the frame rate to your preferred setting. For example, type "60" to make the video 60 fps.

![changing video clip frame rate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-frame-rate-clip-7.JPG)

1. Click "Sequence" > "Render Selection."

And that's it! That is how you change a video clip's frame rate in Adobe Premiere Pro.

## How To Make 120 FPS Videos With Premiere Pro

Videos that are 120 fps are very popular now. If you are a gaming content creator on YouTube, you probably record videos at this frame rate. You'd want to edit that footage and export it at the same frame rate.

Adobe Premiere Pro allows you to do that. But it's a little bit of a hidden feature. When creating a sequence, you may notice that the highest the frame rate can go is 60 frames per second. That's obviously not the number that we want. Don't worry. There is a workaround. The best thing is that it's super easy.

Follow these steps to change your video to 120 fps:

1. Import your 120 fps video to Adobe Premiere Pro.
2. Select your footage. Drag it to your timeline or the tab where the text says, "Drop media here to create sequence."

![dragging video to premiere pro timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-frame-rate-120-fps-2.JPG)

1. Select the timeline panel. Click "Sequence" > "Sequence Settings."
2. Check the "Timebase" section. It should say "119.88 frames/second," 120 fps when rounded off.

![checking if the fps is 120](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-frame-rate-120-fps-4.JPG)

1. Edit the video as needed and render it. The output should stay at 120 fps.

## How To Change Video From 30 FPS to 60 FPS in Premiere Pro

Do you have a video recorded at 30 frames per second, and do you want it at 60? Here's a simple solution to that. Follow these steps in Adobe Premiere Pro to double the video's frame rate.

1. Open Adobe Premiere Pro. Click "File" > "New" > "Sequence."

![creating new sequence in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-frame-rate-60-fps-1.JPG)

1. Click "AVCHD" > "1080p" > "AVCHD 1080p60" > "OK."

![avchd 1080p 60 option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-frame-rate-60-fps-2.JPG)

1. Import your 30 fps video into Adobe Premiere Pro.
2. Drag the video into the timeline.
3. Click "Keep existing settings."

![keeping the settings when importing video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-frame-rate-60-fps-5.JPG)
