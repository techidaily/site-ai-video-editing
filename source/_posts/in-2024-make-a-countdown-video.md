## Make A Countdown Video

Have you ever wanted to use Adobe After Effects to recreate a countdown timer for a rocket launch or simply create a suspenseful moment in a video by displaying how the time runs out? This tutorial will show you how. It is imperative that you become familiar with the process of creating a countdown in After Effects.

In this article, we will demonstrate how to use Adobe After Effects to put together a countdown video. This procedure is a straightforward one, and it will handle expressions as well as plugins. Stay here and read on to find out more about the various methods in which we might accomplish this goal!

Let's begin!

## Part 1\. Create a new composition

It's possible that you only want to show the minutes and seconds. Make a mask around the entire area you intend to use in order to quickly remove undesired information.

1\. Create a new Text Layer.

2\. Alt + Click (on a PC) or Option + Click (on a Mac) on the stopwatch in the Source Text to display text options.

3\. Place the expression “timeToCurrentFormat” within the expression box (). You must set your composition frame rate to 60 frames per second in order to make it appear to be a real digital countdown timer.

4\. Everything should be pre-composed, and the composition's tempo should be reversed to make it count down. Right-click the composition and choose Time > Time Reverse Layer to change its pace.

## Part 2\. Using the timecode plugin

To make a countdown timer, you can use the Timecode plugin rather than the "timeToCurrentFormat()" statement. The timer layout will be immediately created when the plugin is added to a New Solid; use the same steps as before to convert it to a countdown timer.

Here is a quick video that demonstrates how simple it is to set up a countdown timer in this manner:

Step1 Ctrl-click (Windows) or Command-click (Mac OS) the time display to cycle through Timecode Base or Frames/Feet + Frames (depending on whether the "Use Feet + Frames" option is checked in the Project Settings). The Timeline panel's upper-left corner, as well as the bottoms of the Layer, Composition, and Footage panels, all indicate the current time. Timeline panel (See.)

Step2 A smaller text version of the option that is not selected in the project settings will be seen underneath. Do the following to limit the display to the Timecode or Frames option that was chosen in the Project Settings:

Step3 Choose After Effects > Preferences > Display (Mac OS) or Edit > Preferences > Display to access the display preferences window (Windows). Remove the check mark next to "Show Timecode and Frames in Timeline Panel" (this option is selected by default).

Step4 Change the time display units by selecting File > Project Settings and then selecting a different choice from the list in the Time Display Style section.

Timecode:

Displays the current time as timecode in the time rulers of the Timeline, Layer, and Footage panels. You have the option of utilizing the timecode from the source media (Use Media Source) or beginning at 00:00:00:00\. To use timecode rather than frames, select the Timecode option from the menu. It is important to take note that there are no options available for changing the frame rate or whether or not to delete frames, as the source timecode is recognized and used instead.

![customize timecode countdown video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/customize-timecode-countdown-video.jpg)

## Part 3\. Source timecode

Support for various file formats for the source timecode QuickTime, DV, AVI, P2, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, H.264, AVCHD, RED, XDCAM EX, XDCAM HD, and WAV image sequence importers are just some of the formats that After Effects is able to read and apply timecode for.

Project panel

The Project panel includes several columns that display the source timecode. These columns are titled as follows: Media Start, Media End, Media Duration, and Tape Name. These are the beginning, ending, and overall length of time for the source. There are columns labeled "In," "Out," and "Duration," which reflect the In and Out points that the user has set in the Footage panel for the footage item or the work area for the composition, respectively. These columns also show the duration of the clip.

Context of the Project

The source timecode feature set can be found in the dialog box that is used to configure the Project. Check out the Options for Time Display Units page for more information.

Box for Configuring Composition Settings

The source timecode feature set is located in the dialog box that is called Composition Settings.

Box for Specifying Preferences

The Import section of the Preferences dialog box is capable of handling source timecode functions.

## What If Quicktime Player Speed up With No Sound?

No sound may be heard when the video is played back if it was encoded in a format that QuickTime cannot understand. Verifying your QuickTime installation is the most obvious way to find out whether it has decoded all of the video files. Let’s investigate the issue to its root.

### Updating Your Quicktime to the Latest Version

The user must carefully study the QuickTime player. For some reason, your QuickTime behaviour is out of whack.

People often neglect to keep their QuickTime software up-to-date, which results in problems with video playback, such as no sound or stuttering, among many other things. To fix this issue, just download and install the most latest release of QuickTime player.

### Examine the System and Driver

Faulty speakers, audio issues in the system, and update failures will ultimately cause media playback difficulties.

To find the root cause, you should first check internally to see whether your speakers are working correctly. Speaking straight to Siri and hearing her reaction is the fastest and most straightforward option.

Another reason you may be hearing no sound on QuickTime is because of a recent system update. Apple, as we all know, often releases new operating systems, and you must keep track of the most current versions of updates in order to keep your system running effectively.

You just need to ensure that your machine is running the most recent version. As a result, your system will resume regular functioning, and QuickTime will be immediately fixed and restored.

### Inspect if the File is Corrupted or not

Checking the file to see whether it has been corrupted is a good idea regardless of whether QuickTime and your system are up and running. To make matters worse, the lack of sound in QuickTime will be the consequence of a corrupted video file.

Try opening the file in a different programme or player to see if the issue may be resolved. If this is the case, your source video file is either destroyed or corrupted. You may wish to consider regaining access to the file in this situation. The likelihood of your file being corrupted by malware or a virus is relatively high. Remember to be patient if this does happen to you.

It is necessary to use third-party repair programmes to successfully fix the file. Consequently, using third-party software to recover and restore the source file should be considered if you are in a situation where the source file is crucial and do not have a backup. As we'll see, there are a number of options available, including Filmora.

## How to Play Videos at 2X Speed with Sound in Quicktime?

The user must carefully study the QuickTime player. For some reason, your QuickTime behaviour is out of whack.

### Examine the System and Driver

Faulty speakers, audio issues in the system, and update failures will ultimately cause media playback difficulties.

To find the root cause, you should first check internally to see whether your speakers are working correctly. Speaking straight to Siri and hearing her reaction is the fastest and most straightforward option.

You just need to ensure that your machine is running the most recent version. As a result, your system will resume regular functioning, and QuickTime will be immediately fixed and restored.

### Inspect if the File is Corrupted or not

Checking the file to see whether it has been corrupted is a good idea regardless of whether QuickTime and your system are up and running. To make matters worse, the lack of sound in QuickTime will be the consequence of a corrupted video file.

Try opening the file in a different programme or player to see if the issue may be resolved. If this is the case, your source video file is either destroyed or corrupted. You may wish to consider regaining access to the file in this situation. The likelihood of your file being corrupted by malware or a virus is relatively high. Remember to be patient if this does happen to you.

It is necessary to use third-party repair programmes to successfully fix the file. Consequently, using third-party software to recover and restore the source file should be considered if you are in a situation where the source file is crucial and do not have a backup. As we'll see, there are a number of options available, including Filmora.
