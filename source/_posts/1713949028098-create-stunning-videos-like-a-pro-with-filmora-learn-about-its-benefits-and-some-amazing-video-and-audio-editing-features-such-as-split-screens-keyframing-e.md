**●** External factors i.e. the overall audience or market

**●** Performance i.e. the success rate of video

**●** Personalization i.e. the history and preferences of viewers

### 02How YouTube Determines Its Homepage Algorithm

You might have found a large array of videos when you type Youtube.com or open the app. YouTube shows these videos thinking that person might be interested in watching any video from the list.

## M31 LUT (Teal and Orange LUT) Free Download

Today's article will be fascinating for all those who want to shoot their films at home and become a filmmaker. As upon **M31, LUT (teal and orange)** is one of the most used LUTs in various films. It was first introduced in Hollywood, and there are many movies that use this style for color correction, such as the well-known _Transformers_, _Star Trek_, _Mad Max_, and _Wonder Woman_. The spectator can rapidly comprehend the information in the image and quickly tell the topic from the backdrop thanks to the two contrasting hues of teal and orange, which are more common in nature. These colors can also merge more smoothly with the rest of the image. In this article, we will discuss how to use it and other amazing LUTs in your videos. So let's begin!

## Part 1\. What is M31 LUT (Teal & Orange LUT)?

M31 LUT (Teal & Orange Lut) is one of the most used LUTs in Hollywood and other cinematic industries. This LUT help to get your video the cinematic colors of teal and orange. The contrast between the two colors teal and orange is clear, but there are also other colors present in nature. For example, human skin is mostly composed of the colors yellow, red, and brown. Because blue is the complement of these colors, teal is their contrast color.

Other quality features are Color Remapping, Skin Toning, Saturation, etc. In other words, it helps your videos look like popular Hollywood films as they also use this same LUT in their movies. Its popularity in Hollywood films may be due to a number of factors, but one of the most crucial ones is that it gives the scene a cohesive mood by allowing disparate aspects to mirror one another and emphasize the overall qualities of the scene.
