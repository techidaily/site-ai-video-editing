## Discover the Essential Steps for Editing a Music Video in This Guide. Learn About Aspect Ratio and the First Cut Process to Create a Visually Captivating Video

Are you planning to edit your music video? Do you need on out how to edit your first music video draft? Editing a music video is a creative task but can be challenging.

One of the key elements of this process is selecting the aspect ratio and making the first cut. In this blog, we will explore these steps in detail, providing important tips and tricks. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced editor, get ready to take your music video to the next level. Let's get started.

## Which software will you need?

As we have a lot of software in the market, we must select the right software for high-quality editing. [**Wondershare Filmora**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is an amazing video editing software. It offers a ton of video editing tools. You can add special effects, transitions, and more to make your music video captivating.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

**Note:** Before you start editing your project, make sure that you have a backup. You can copy the project to an external USB or hard drive for a backup.

## Adjust the aspect ratio

The aspect ratio is known as the size of the video frame. For example, the most common aspect ratios are 16:9 and 4:3\. The first number represents the width, and the second represents the height.

You should always ask your cinematographer about the aspect ratio. There are chances when cameras won't shoot at the intended aspect ratio they were framed for. In that case, you'll need to crop or letterbox them when editing.

![some common aspect ratios](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/some-common-aspect-ratios.jpg)

### How to find the width/height of the frame?

Most of the frames that are being shot on the camera are 3424 pixels wide, which is a little under 4k. If you have a measurement of one side of the frame, you can find the other by using some math. Let's suppose your frame is 3424 pixels wide. You can use this formula to find the height.

**Formula:** 3424 pixels wide **x** 1 high / 2.35 wide (or whatever your aspect ratio)

![1st step of the formula](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/1st-step-of-the-formula.jpg)

Now you can cancel out the width from the multiplier and the denominator.

\= 3424 pixels wide **x** 1 high / 2.35 wide

![2nd step of the formula](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/2nd-step-of-the-formula.jpg)

Now you are left with the equation:

\= 3424 pixels high / 2.35

After solving this equation, you will get the answer which is: 1457 pixels high. Let's adjust it on the music video as well, follow the steps given below:

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

##### Step1Open the aspect ratio setting tab

Open your music video project in [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and click on the screen icon, as shown in the picture.

![clicking on the screen icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/clicking-on-the-screen-icon.jpg)

Then select the **Change Project Aspect Ratio**.

![clicking on the change project aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/clicking-on-the-change-project-aspect-ratio.jpg)

##### Step2Add values

Now set the project **Width to 3424** pixels and its **Height to 1457** pixels. You can also adjust the frame rate by selecting the one in which you shot the video. Then click **OK**.

![changing the width and the height](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/changing-the-width-and-the-height.jpg)

## Assembly

The next step is assembly. You will arrange the shots, clips, and elements in this process and get everything in order. It can be daunting and inspiring for you, as it's a blank canvas you are going to start with. Before editing, you can also get some guidance from your art director.

If your music video has shots of the band performing, drop them off first and sync them with the audio. On the contrary, if you are doing a narrative style, you can arrange the shots according to the story you want to portray.

![graphical text of assembly](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/graphical-text-of-assembly.jpg)

##### Step1Drop the media

You can start by dragging and dropping the music onto the audio timeline. Then you can add the shots of your music video.

![dropping the media onto the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/dropping-the-media-onto-the-timeline.jpg)

##### Step2Arrange the shots

Arrange the shots according to the storyboard you created and sync them with the audio.

![arranging the shots in order](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/arranging-the-shots-in-order.gif)

##### Step3Add the title

Once you arrange all shots in order, you can add the title of your music video. Click on the **Titles**, then choose your desired style and add the name of your music video in the title box. You can also change the text's size, font, and color.

![adding the title of the music video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/adding-the-title-of-the-music-video.jpg)

##### Step4Flip the clip

One last thing is, if you shot any scene in mirror-image format, you can flip it. Click on the clip you want to flip and select the flip icon in the video properties.

![flipping the clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/flipping-the-clip.jpg)

## Send your first draft

The first draft is the video in which you added audio and re-ordered the shots. You decided on the pace and flow of the video to create a basic structure. You made changes to make it interesting and captivating.

Before you put too much effort into editing your video, send it to your director, producer, or client for review. It will help ensure that any big changes can be made before you invest too much time in the edit.

For first drafts, you don't need anything fancy. A lower-resolution and more compressed file can make sending it to a director or client much easier. You can also add a timer on the music video, so the person reviewing it can give you accurate timing on where he wants any revision.

### How to add the timer in the music video?

1. Click on **Effects** and search for **Timecode** in the search bar.
2. Choose the timer style you like and drop it onto the new timeline.
3. Extend the timer to the end of the video.
4. Adjust the position and add the duration of your music video.

![adding timer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/adding-timer.gif)

Now you are all set to export the first draft of your music video. You can also adjust the video format on the export option, but MP4 is recommended.

## Conclusion

We hope this blog has helped you edit the initials of your music video. By adjusting the aspect ratio to fit the desired screen size and properly planning the first cut, you can lay a solid foundation for the rest of the editing process.

These two steps can greatly impact the overall look and feel of the final product. Remember to communicate with your director, producer, or client throughout the process to ensure that the final product meets their expectations.

AI is a powerful tool in many ways to improve the gaming experience. It can make **artificial intelligence in computer games** more believable and add replayability and immersion to games, and we can expect to see even more impressive applications in the future.

In simple terms, AI is a set of algorithms that allow a computer to learn and improve from experience. Although you can apply it in many ways, **artificial intelligence in video games** is usually helpful to create more intelligent and more believable non-player characters (NPCs).

For example, an AI system might be helpful to determine how an NPC reacts to the player's actions. If the player tries to steal from an NPC, the AI might make the NPC angry and more likely to attack the player. Alternatively, if the player is friendly to an NPC, the **AI game playing** might make the NPC more likely to help the player in future interactions.

## Part 2 **Why Does AI in Gaming Matter?**

One of the most vital aspects of **AI in video games** is that it can make games more believable and immersive for players.

AI is also becoming increasingly important for creating procedural content. This is where the game generates content on its own, rather than relying on pre-made assets. For example, a game might use procedural generation to create random dungeons or quests that the player can explore. This can add a lot of replayability to a game, as the player never knows what they will encounter next.

In the past, developers brought in AI primarily for simple things like making certain NPCs (non-player characters) move and act realistically. But now, **artificial intelligence in video games** is being used for much more complex tasks like generating procedural content and creating believable human-like behavior. This results in a new generation of **AI game playing** that are more immersive and playable.

The gaming world is ever-changing, with developers looking to create innovative ways to immerse players into their digital worlds. One such technology that has begun to sweep is **AI in the game industry**.

AI is a powerful tool in many ways to improve the gaming experience. It can make **artificial intelligence in computer games** more believable and add replayability and immersion to games, and we can expect to see even more impressive applications in the future.

#### In this article

01 [What Is AI in Gaming?](#Part 1)

02 [Why Does AI in Gaming Matter?](#Part 2)

03 [How AI Will Completely Change Video Games](#Part 3)

04 [8 Games with Incredible Artificial Intelligence](#Part 4)

05 [What AI Video Games Assets Do Filmora Have?](#Part 5)

## Part 1 **What Is AI in Gaming?**

In simple terms, AI is a set of algorithms that allow a computer to learn and improve from experience. Although you can apply it in many ways, **artificial intelligence in video games** is usually helpful to create more intelligent and more believable non-player characters (NPCs).

For example, an AI system might be helpful to determine how an NPC reacts to the player's actions. If the player tries to steal from an NPC, the AI might make the NPC angry and more likely to attack the player. Alternatively, if the player is friendly to an NPC, the **AI game playing** might make the NPC more likely to help the player in future interactions.

## Part 2 **Why Does AI in Gaming Matter?**

One of the most vital aspects of **AI in video games** is that it can make games more believable and immersive for players. When games can convincingly simulate human-like behavior, it can be a much more enjoyable experience for gamers. AI can make NPCs seem more lifelike and make the game world feel more believable.

AI is also becoming increasingly important for creating procedural content. This is where the game generates content on its own, rather than relying on pre-made assets. For example, a game might use procedural generation to create random dungeons or quests that the player can explore. This can add a lot of replayability to a game, as the player never knows what they will encounter next.

## Part 3 **How AI Will Completely Change Video Games**

It is not a secret that AI is changing the world as we know it. With its ability to enable computers to learn and improve from experience, AI is paving the way for a future where machines can handle more complex tasks. And nowhere is this more apparent than in the world of video gaming.

In the past, developers brought in AI primarily for simple things like making certain NPCs (non-player characters) move and act realistically. But now, **artificial intelligence in video games** is being used for much more complex tasks like generating procedural content and creating believable human-like behavior. This results in a new generation of **AI game playing** that are more immersive and playable.

## Part 4   **Games with Incredible Artificial Intelligence**

Now, we will look into eight video games that signify why we need the **best ai in video games.**

### 01**Fallout 4**

One of the most attractive examples of **AI in video gaming** is Fallout 4\. This post-apocalyptic RPG features some of the most believable NPCs ever seen in a game.

![Fallout 4](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/ai-video-games-act-1.jpg)

### 02**The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt**

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is one more great example of an **AI video game**. This open-world RPG features a vast array of believable NPCs, each with unique personality traits and motivations. The AI is also used to generate procedural content, resulting in a different game world every time you play.

### 04**Minecraft**

## Time Lapse Video Is Very Interesting and Creative, Which Usually Attracts More Attention. This Article Will Show You How to Make a Time Lapse Video with Adobe After Effects

Time-Lapse movies are great for a variety of projects; you can use them as establishing shots in sitcoms, corporate marketing videos, and they can make lovely backgrounds for animated slideshows. A time-lapse video is essentially a series of photographs taken at regular intervals to depict how the environment changes gradually over a shorter period of time. In this article, we'll demonstrate how you may quickly and easily build an After Effects time-lapse effect.

With that said, let's start!

## Step 1\. Create a new composition

Calculating your composition length to accommodate the frame rate and number of images is the first step in generating a time-lapse video.

1. Verify the number of images you have for your Sequence.
2. New Composition Creation. Selecting a frame rate: A time lapse film produced at 30 frames per second will flow smoothly, but you can select any frame rate you like.
3. To determine the duration of your composition, divide the number of photographs you have by the frame rate you've chosen. For instance, if you use 600 photos at 30 frames per second, your composition will last 20 seconds.

## Step 2\. Import your images

You are prepared to make a time-lapse sequence if all of your photographs are saved to the same folder and are in the same order. If you are working directly from your Camera, you will likely have Camera Raw files, although this procedure works with PNG and JPEG sequences.

1. Press Command/Control I on your keyboard or select File > Import. Find the folder holding your image sequence.
2. To begin, select the first picture in the sequence. If all of your images have accurate names, After Effects will be able to identify a sequence of images.
3. Make sure the Force Alphabetical Order and Camera Raw Sequence checkboxes are selected. Your Time-Lapse Sequence will display in the Project Browser Panel after you click Import.
4. Once you've watched how it plays, you can adjust the Frame Rate by right-clicking the Sequence in the Project Browser and selecting Interpret Footage > Main.
5. To update your time-lapse, modify the Frame Rate setting and click OK.

![import images into after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/import-images-into-after-effects.jpg)

## Step 3\. Create movements

1. After Effects' Time-Lapse Sequence can be used just like any other standalone clip. This implies that you may give your time-lapse clip movement by adding Keyframes and Effects.
2. Place your Playhead at the beginning of the clip after choosing the Image Sequence. Make a keyframe for the scale or position.
3. To generate a second Keyframe for the value of your choice, move to the end of the clip. Make any necessary Clip modifications.
4. Right-click on the timeline, choose New > Adjustment Layer, then add your effects to the Adjustment Layer to add effects like noise and grain.

## Step 4\. Create slow motion from a video

You can import your video after you've shot it to prepare it for editing. The same steps, including naming your photos in order, must be taken for the Time Lapse sequence. It may be advantageous to entirely rename both your Image Sequence and Performer clip.

1. Drag the finished Time Lapse sequence to your Timeline after completing it as previously explained.
2. Over the Time Lapse, add the Performer Clip to the Timeline.
3. Choose Time>Time Stretch by performing a right-click on the performer clip.
4. You can alter the Stretch Factor or Duration in the dialogue box. When you alter one parameter, the other will reflect the new Stretch Factor or Duration for you.

## Step 5\. Make an overlay

You can alter the Stretch Factor or Duration in the dialogue box. When you alter one parameter, the other will reflect the new Stretch Factor or Duration for you.

1. Find Luma Key in the Effect Control Panel and drag it to your clip.
2. Change the Key Type setting in the Effect Control Panel to Key Out Brighter.
3. The Threshold, Tolerance, and Edge settings should be adjusted until only the silhouette is visible.
4. Use the Pen or Mask Tool to create a circle around the parts you want to delete if you discover any corners of your clip that are still visible.
5. Add any Effects, such as Light Leaks, to your Adjustment Layer by choosing "Right-click > New > Adjustment layer."

![make an overlay after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/make-an-overlay-after-effects.jpg)

After Effects CC must be opened, a new project must be created, the Import File menu option must be selected, and the appropriate folder containing the altered still images must be located and selected before the time-lapse photos can be turned into a film. You need to make sure that the JPEG Series box is checked, as well as the Force Alphabetical Order box.

Once you have clicked on the first image in the sequence. The time-lapse video that you uploaded appears in the project library. After performing a right-click on the filename, select "New Comp from Selection" from the context menu.

## Step 6\. Exporting your video

After getting our sequence to perform some kind of slow, understated animation so that it appears as though the camera is moving dramatically, we will need to export a video file. Go to File > Export > Add to Render Queue, then open the Render Queue dialog box by going to Window > Render Queue. From there, you can choose the Output Module and change the settings in the options dialog box. Finally, choose the Output To option and select the location on your computer where you would like to save the video clip that we are currently rendering and exporting.

![add to render queue after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/add-to-render-queue-after-effects.jpg)

## Conclusion

No matter how you make your time lapse videos, After Effects has a ton of features you can use to modify and enhance the way they look. Now that you are familiar with the fundamentals, you can play with the Frame Rates and Composition options.
