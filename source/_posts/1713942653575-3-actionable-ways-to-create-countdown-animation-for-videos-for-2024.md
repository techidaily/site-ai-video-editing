### 01Step 1: Identify the desired color/hue

Eyeball the color and choose a match closest to the color you want, but this method is likely to match existing paint in a noticeable area. In addition, it is a perfectly acceptable option when you want to choose a closer color.

### 03Step 3: Paint store

if you want to match a pale yellow, bright blue, or stormy sky grey furniture or wall. All you need is to head to your favorite paint store and gather up a selection of paint chips close to the hue you are trying to match. After that, bring the trip home and hang them on the surface which color you want to duplicate, then observe multiple lights using lamp light and daylight, whichever chip matches most closely.

All you need is to head to your favorite paint store and gather up a selection of paint chips close to the hue you are trying to match. After that, bring the trip home and hang them on the surface which color you want to duplicate, then observe multiple lights using lamp light and daylight, whichever chip matches most closely.

## **Alternative Way to Edit FlV Video on Windows**

### **1\.** **VSDC**

VSDC is a free video editor along with a lot of advanced features. Cut, combine, trim, crop, and other editing capabilities are available to help you polish your FLV films.

Although it may not look logical, learning the editing capabilities hidden within modular boxes is simple. One noteworthy aspect of VSDC is its ability to produce good visual effects using many trendy video effects, transitions, and filters.

It not only creates excellent FLV videos, but it also supports a wide range of media conversion, allowing you to convert FLV files to various formats and export them without a watermark.

Therefore, follow the below mentioned steps to edit FLV video using VSDC:

Step 1: Install the software on the Windows. Open the application and import the video.

![edit flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-5.jpg)

Step 2: Use cutting and splitting tools to edit the video.

The first icon is a picture of a pair of scissors, which is a cutting tool. It's very useful when you need to cut the beginning or end of a film. Place the cursor exactly where you want to cut, then select "Trim start" or "Trim finish" from the dropdown cutting menu (the small triangle next to the scissors icon).

 ![edit flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-6.jpg)

Cropping is also simple. If you have too much additional space around the scene object recorded, just choose the file you want to trim and select the cropping icon from the "Cutting and Splitting" option. A new window will appear, allowing you to select the region of the scene that should stay.

![edit flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-7.jpg)

Step 3: Apply effects and transitions.

To use one, first select the video file you wish to edit, then go to the Video effects tab and select the effect you want to use. On the timeline, a new tab will appear, containing all of the effects done to the selected object. You can alter the effect's duration and position in time by dragging it with the mouse there. The properties pane on the right-hand side can be used to change other parameters.

Transitions follow the same rule. Place your cursor where you want the transition to begin, then choose a transition from the Video effects dropdown menu and manually adjust the duration.

![edit flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-8.jpg)

Step 4: Save changes and export video.

Make sure your movie appears exactly how you want it to before exporting it. If the video appears choppy, use the red preview button and lower the preview quality. When the PC's resources are insufficient to process the video in real time, lagging can occur. Keep in mind that it has no bearing on the outcome. When you're finished, navigate to the Export project tab and select an export format.

![edit flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-9.jpg)

### **2\.** **Adobe Premiere Pro:**

Professional video editors use Premiere Pro to make everything from YouTube videos to Hollywood films like Mank, a 2021 Oscar candidate. It's also widely utilized in the workflows of designers, animators, and VFX artists, and we can see why after lengthy testing.

We found the software's UI to be simple to use, and it increased our productivity by separating things into various workspaces, such as editing, effects, and audio. When we tested it on both Mac and PC, we discovered that each workspace helps handle a specific activity while minimizing distraction.

Edit the FLV video with Adobe Premiere Pro using the following steps:

Step 1: Import the video and create initial sequence.

![edit flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-10.jpg)

## **Alternative Way to Edit FlV Video on Mac**

### **1\.** **Blender:**

Under the GNU General Public License, Blender is a free, open-source 3D content production program that runs on all major operating systems. Blender is one of the greatest video editors for both Windows and Mac, with advanced features such as modifier-based modeling tools, powerful character animation capabilities, a node-based material, etc.

Because it is developed for professionals, it is tough to use as a beginner. However, it is unrestricted in its use and distribution. In addition, color options are changeable and versatile in the UI.

 In contrast, this free video editor is perfect for semi-pros or those who want to enhance their video editing skills. However, you'll need a lot of time and effort to learn it.

Step 1: Open the application.

![edit flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-14.jpg)

### **2\.** **Final Cut Pro:**

When it comes to video editing software, Apple's Final Cut Pro is one of the industry standards. As a result, it's widely utilized in the television and film industries - at least among Mac users. However, one of the truly convincing reasons to choose it over Premiere Pro is because it is subscription-free: you only pay once.

The software's Magnetic Timeline, grouping tools, a vast selection of effects, solid organizational capabilities, and simple ways to add and edit audio make it a favorite among professional video editors. 360° video, HDR, and powerful color correcting tools are among the other capabilities. It's a strong software with a lot of features.

Follow the steps to edit FLV video using Final Cut Pro:

Step 1: Create Project.

To make a movie in Final Cut Pro, you must first establish a project, which keeps track of your editing selections and the media you utilize.

The first icon is a picture of a pair of scissors, which is a cutting tool. It's very useful when you need to cut the beginning or end of a film. Place the cursor exactly where you want to cut, then select "Trim start" or "Trim finish" from the dropdown cutting menu (the small triangle next to the scissors icon).

### **1\.** **VSDC**

VSDC is a free video editor along with a lot of advanced features. Cut, combine, trim, crop, and other editing capabilities are available to help you polish your FLV films.

Step 1: Install the software on the Windows. Open the application and import the video.

![edit flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-5.jpg)

Step 2: Use cutting and splitting tools to edit the video.

The first icon is a picture of a pair of scissors, which is a cutting tool. It's very useful when you need to cut the beginning or end of a film. Place the cursor exactly where you want to cut, then select "Trim start" or "Trim finish" from the dropdown cutting menu (the small triangle next to the scissors icon).

 ![edit flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-6.jpg)

Cropping is also simple. If you have too much additional space around the scene object recorded, just choose the file you want to trim and select the cropping icon from the "Cutting and Splitting" option. A new window will appear, allowing you to select the region of the scene that should stay.

![edit flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-7.jpg)

Step 3: Apply effects and transitions.

To use one, first select the video file you wish to edit, then go to the Video effects tab and select the effect you want to use. On the timeline, a new tab will appear, containing all of the effects done to the selected object. You can alter the effect's duration and position in time by dragging it with the mouse there. The properties pane on the right-hand side can be used to change other parameters.

Transitions follow the same rule. Place your cursor where you want the transition to begin, then choose a transition from the Video effects dropdown menu and manually adjust the duration.

When the PC's resources are insufficient to process the video in real time, lagging can occur. Keep in mind that it has no bearing on the outcome. When you're finished, navigate to the Export project tab and select an export format.

Professional video editors use Premiere Pro to make everything from YouTube videos to Hollywood films like Mank, a 2021 Oscar candidate. It's also widely utilized in the workflows of designers, animators, and VFX artists, and we can see why after lengthy testing.

## The Frames per Second Can Enhance or Hamper Your Ability to Enjoy Watching a Video on YouTube. This Article Will Define Frame Rates and Help You Choose the Best FPS

YouTube has become one of the to go to social media platforms for internet use because it provides entertainment for people who want to get entertained, learn or catch up with their favorite personalities. This platform has also given content creators a space to showcase their talents, educate the masses or simply have a good time when playing their games.

However, being a content creator on YouTube entails more than just posting a video weekly. You ought to ensure you get the frame rate in the video right. Failure to choose the correct frame rate will affect how your audience enjoys the video, increasing the chances that you lose subscribers.

Without further ado, let's discuss the best fps for YouTube.

![best fps for youtube videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-fps.JPG)

## How Does FPS Affect Viewing YouTube Videos?

Before we dive into how FPS affects your viewing experience on YouTube and determine the best frame rate for YouTube, let's define what it is. FPS is short for frames per second and is the number of still images appearing on display in one second. The more frames per second you have in your video, the clearer your video will become. The vice versa is also true.

To further simplify this definition, we will use the example of a flipbook. An animator usually draws an image on each page of the book. When they flip the pages in rapid succession, the images appear to be in motion. Suppose the animator used fewer pages to make their flipbook.

![flipbook animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/flipbook.gif)

The animation would not be as smooth and crisp as if they had used more pages, each with a different still image contributing to the final motion.

The human brain can easily differentiate between 12 distinct images. However, when the photos exceed 18 and move rapidly, the brain is tricked into believing that the pictures are in motion. A frame rate lower than 24FPS will make your YouTube video look choppy and unnatural, as if it lags in real time.

Ideally, 24fps is the best fps for YouTube videos featuring mundane activities that we see in daily life. However, if you want to pack more information into your video and make the motion a bit smoother, then 30fps is the best video frame rate for YouTube.

Perhaps you post fast-paced content about gaming and other live-action videos. You are better off choosing 60FPS, which makes high-speed scenes look more fluid and helps you capture double the information.

## What Is the Recommended & Highest Frame Rate for YouTube Videos?

Unfortunately, there is no correct answer when it comes to the best video frame rate for YouTube videos. The controversy still continues, and everyone seems to have their own opinion.

According to [Thomas Edison](https://techland.time.com/2012/12/06/riddles-in-the-dark-the-hobbits-48-frames-per-second-explained/), anything less than 46FPS for motion pictures will strain the eyes and give an unpleasant viewing experience. At the time, filmmakers and videographers were adamant about sticking to between 22-26PFS for their videos, provided the audio adaptability remained at 35mm.

Different frame rates are used for various displays, genres, and mediums. For instance, 1-16FPS was common in silent-era movies and stop-motion movies. However, this frame rate is neither universally accepted nor widespread in the world today.

An excellent example of a frame rate that produces larger-than-life videos with exceptional detail is 24fps. However, the NTSC confirms that it is, in fact, 23.97 frames per second when you consider issues to do with color and hue.

Another universally acceptable frame rate is 30fps, which is widespread in television. Videographers also use it to make slow-motion segments in sports videos or other fast-paced content. The sweet 60fps makes any motion look smooth as butter and significantly reduces any blur in your videos. This frame rate is also characterized by super fine details you can easily miss with 24 and 30fps. It is also the highest fps video on YouTube.

120fps is synonymous with grandeur, with its monumental footage suitable for slow-motion scenes. Lastly, anything above 120fps works great with ultra-slow-motion videos. Of course, we are talking 240fps, which is rare but not uncommon. However, you would need a high-speed capture camera, which we believe doesn't come cheap.

To sum it all up, 24fps is the recommended frame rate for YouTube. You can go higher than the baseline and use 30fps or higher if you make videos with lots of motion, like gaming videos. Most of the time, a higher frame rate is a personal choice rather than a necessity. However, we understand you want to give your viewers a pleasant experience while watching your content.

## What Is the Best Frame Rate for YouTube Videos?

If you want to record a video for your YouTube channel, you might wonder what is the best fps for YouTube videos. You are better off sticking between 24fps and 60fps. The platform has only recently added 8K support for videos, which is a plus for many content creators. Below is a list of frame rates for the most popular genres on YouTube.

![frame rate for youtube videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-video-frame-rate.jpg)

* Podcasts and talk shows - 30 FPS
* Gaming videos - 60 FPS
* Makeup tutorials - 60 FPS
* Educational videos - 24- 30 FPS
* Health and fitness - 24-30 FPS
* Sports - 40-60 FPS

Remember that the list above is not exhaustive and doesn't cover all types of content on the platform. We can't also guarantee that there is a "best" frame rate for your YouTube video. We suggest you heed our suggestion and practice to determine the best frame rate for YouTube videos.

We couldn't fail to mention that your frame rate should match the content uploading and decoding. Since the interlaced content may experience performance issues on YouTube, it would help if you deinterlaced it.

## How To Check FPS on YouTube Video?

Below is a simple guide on how to check fps on YouTube videos.

Step1 Open any video on YouTube and right-click on it. A pop-up window will appear. Select "Stats for nerds."

![stats for nerds in youtube](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-stats-for-nerds.jpg)

Step2 Narrow down on the "Current/Optimal Res" tab. The first set of figures before the forward slash represents the current resolution, while the figures after the forward slash represent the optimal resolution for the video. For instance, the figure in the picture below indicates that the resolution is 1280\*720, and the frame rate is 30FPS. The figures repeat themselves, meaning that the video is at the optimal resolution.
