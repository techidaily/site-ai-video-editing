Artificial Intelligence is the replacement of human processes by machines and computer systems. It can replicate intelligent human behaviors, including facial expression recognition, problem-solving, and learning.

**AI video interviewing**, an increasingly popular assessment tool driven by artificial intelligence, is being incorporated by many large companies that receive thousands of job applications. AI electronically analyses many aspects of a video interview, including the candidate's body language, facial expressions, word choices, and tone of voice. It can also track eye movements to determine whether candidates are looking at resources around them.

With the introduction of artificial intelligence, many tech companies and individuals have taken a likeness of it and have grown to utilize it to carry out tasks. Reconsider your position as applicants get selected by assessing their performance in the **AI-based video interview** against a large inventory of facial and linguistic information.

02 [How to Ace an AI Video Interview](#Part 2)

03 [Role of AI in a Video Interview](#Part 3)

04 [Role of AI in Video Making](#Part 4)

## Part 1 **How AI is being used in a job interview.**

In most cases, **an AI video interview** is the initial stage in the hiring process, in place of or in addition to a typical cover letter and CV. It functions similarly to a face-to-face interview. Candidates get a series of job-specific interview questions, after which they have to record their responses on video with their smartphone or computer.

You'll have a few minutes to answer each question as a candidate before going on to the next. Each exam takes about 20 minutes to complete and can be in any location convenient for you, whether in your living room, a quiet coffee shop nook, or somewhere else.

Each interview follows the same format, ensuring a similar experience for all individuals seeking that particular position.

The algorithm (also known as an assessment model) will assist the recruiter in making a more informed judgment if AI is in the process. It accomplishes this by identifying which candidates are most likely to succeed in the post based on data sets that predict job performance.

## Part 2 **How to Ace an AI video interview.**

Planning ahead of time might make you feel less anxious and appear more confident, at ease, and relaxed. Here are some ideas for using artificial intelligence in video interviews.

It would help if you first determined whether you are going for an **AI-based video interview,** i.e., if you get an invite to a pre-recorded video interview via a platform. Massive firms are now using this type of interview to interview many possible employees without bias.

### 01**Prepare for the interview differently.**

![Prepare for the
        Interview Differently](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-1.jpg)

When in an **AI interview**, you need to prepare differently. It's not the same as a human-to-human interview. There will be no feedback from the person at the other end of the interview. Research the use of **AI in interviews** to know how it works. Remember to research the company in question as well.

### 02**Go straight to the point.**

![Go Straight to
        the Point](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-2.jpg)

Remember that you're having an interview with a robot and not a human, so skip the small talk and hit the nail on the head. It is better to state your point clearly and straight to the end.

### 03**Find a suitable environment for your interview.**

![Find a Suitable Environment](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-3.jpg)

Most **artificial intelligence video interviews** take place through your webcam in the comfort of your home. So, it's essential to use an appropriate background. Your interview background should be clear of objects and distractions. It should also have enough lighting and be free from background noises since AI algorithms are designed to scan your environment and make deductions about you.

### 04**Dress well for your interview.**

![Dress well](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-4.jpg)

There won't be a human at the other end of the camera, so there's no need to dress up, right? That's wrong. You still need to dress well when attending a formal human job interview. Wear business casuals with plain colored clothes.

Another reason you want to dress professionally is that it can increase your self-confidence, making you relaxed and feel good about yourself.

### 05**Practice before the interview.**

![Practice Before the Interview](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-5.jpeg)

To ace an **AI interview**, practice in front of a friend or mirror in advance of your interview. You can do a mock interview or record yourself to identify likely mistakes and correct them. Practice by recording yourself and then replaying the video to see where you are making mistakes and need improvement.

### 06**Share your real-world experiences and provide proof.**

![Share Real World Experience](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-6.jpg)

Use real-world experiences to showcase your skills when responding to questions during an **AI interview**. To determine and ensure candidates' suitability, AI looks for specific soft skills like communication, the ability to take the initiative, and lots more. So, talk about them, use a practical example to illustrate your skills, and generally talk about your interview experience.

### 07**Smiling**

![Smiling](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-7.jpg)

Wear a pleasant smile as you answer. It is easy to forget to smile when focusing so hard on the questions, but remember to relax and act natural. Facial expressions such as smiling are criteria that **artificial intelligence interviewers** watch for. Remember to smile, nod, and Use Gestures During Your Interview to show that you are attentive.

### 08**Maintain eye contact and a neutral voice tone.**

![Maintain Eye
        Contact and Neutral Voice Tone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-8.jpeg)

During an **AI video interview**, maintain eye contact with the camera and gaze squarely into your webcam. Ensure your camera is at eye level, so you don't have to strain to see into it. Avoid looking away all of the time; this can give the impression of being distracted and unfocused. Speak neutrally or brightly. Remember that the AI analyzes your speech tone and mannerisms. As a result, speaking in clear tones can help you succeed.

### 09**Maintain proper body posture and even talking speed**

![Maintain Proper Body Posture and talk speed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-9.jpg)

You emphasize more confidence when you sit up straight, Sit with an open posture, avoid crossed arms or legs, keep your chin towards your stomach, and do not hunch your shoulders or recline on the chair. Appear in control, natural, and ready to handle any question. Try to keep your talking speed at a conversational rate, and avoid talking too fast or too slow because it might come off as you being nervous or unsure of yourself.

### 10**Make use of keywords**

![Make Use of Keywords](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-10.jpg)

The use of keywords is essential in any job application process. Meanwhile, AI algorithms pick out keywords in a candidate's response during an interview. Stand out during an **AI interview** by using phrases that explain what you can contribute, echoing the exact language of the job posting. Before the **AI-based video interview**, carefully go through the job description and note what keywords the company uses to describe the role on the company website or job posting page. Be sure to use their words specifically.

## Part 3 **Role of AI in a video interview**

![AI in Job interview](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-11.jpg)

AI electronically analyzes many features of a video interview. It asks all candidates the same pre-determined questions and then explores how they answered them. Some AI models grade candidates' responses. Many significant companies use **AI video interviews** or algorithm-based interviewing. Candidates are compared to previous success stories to select the best candidate for the job. The software analyzes the applicant's performance to the last job for applicants deemed suitable for the position. It compares the inputs to the company's ideal candidate profile and ranks you accordingly. The AI interviewer will most likely use speech analytics software to break down the candidate's speech into parts and deduce numerous interpretations. It then uses semantic analytics to determine grammatical proficiency. It also indicates your emotional condition based on the time of your voice.

## Part 4 **Role of AI in video making**

In video production, artificial intelligence has proven faster and more efficient than humans. It's also more cost-effective and time-saving than hiring a video editor. It allows you to edit more films in a shorter amount of time. It streamlines your job by taking care of most of the burden, making video editing simple even for beginners. AI makes suggestions that the user may not consider, making video production more accessible and engaging. Automating color correction and scene recognition in films improves the visual experience and aids in the formulation of personalized messaging.

AI electronically analyzes many features of a video interview. It asks all candidates the same pre-determined questions and then explores how they answered them. Some AI models grade candidates' responses. Many significant companies use **AI video interviews** or algorithm-based interviewing. Candidates are compared to previous success stories to select the best candidate for the job. The software analyzes the applicant's performance to the last job for applicants deemed suitable for the position. It compares the inputs to the company's ideal candidate profile and ranks you accordingly. The AI interviewer will most likely use speech analytics software to break down the candidate's speech into parts and deduce numerous interpretations. It then uses semantic analytics to determine grammatical proficiency. It also indicates your emotional condition based on the time of your voice.

03 [Role of AI in a Video Interview](#Part 3)

04 [Role of AI in Video Making](#Part 4)

## Part 1 **How AI is being used in a job interview.**

In most cases, **an AI video interview** is the initial stage in the hiring process, in place of or in addition to a typical cover letter and CV. It functions similarly to a face-to-face interview. Candidates get a series of job-specific interview questions, after which they have to record their responses on video with their smartphone or computer.

You'll have a few minutes to answer each question as a candidate before going on to the next. Each exam takes about 20 minutes to complete and can be in any location convenient for you, whether in your living room, a quiet coffee shop nook, or somewhere else.

Each interview follows the same format, ensuring a similar experience for all individuals seeking that particular position.

The algorithm (also known as an assessment model) will assist the recruiter in making a more informed judgment if AI is in the process. It accomplishes this by identifying which candidates are most likely to succeed in the post based on data sets that predict job performance.

## Part 2 **How to Ace an AI video interview.**

Planning ahead of time might make you feel less anxious and appear more confident, at ease, and relaxed. Here are some ideas for using artificial intelligence in video interviews.

It would help if you first determined whether you are going for an **AI-based video interview,** i.e., if you get an invite to a pre-recorded video interview via a platform. Massive firms are now using this type of interview to interview many possible employees without bias.

### 01**Prepare for the interview differently.**

![Prepare for the
        Interview Differently](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-1.jpg)

When in an **AI interview**, you need to prepare differently. It's not the same as a human-to-human interview. There will be no feedback from the person at the other end of the interview. Research the use of **AI in interviews** to know how it works. Remember to research the company in question as well.

### 02**Go straight to the point.**

![Go Straight to
        the Point](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-2.jpg)

Remember that you're having an interview with a robot and not a human, so skip the small talk and hit the nail on the head. It is better to state your point clearly and straight to the end.

### 03**Find a suitable environment for your interview.**

![Find a Suitable Environment](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-3.jpg)

Most **artificial intelligence video interviews** take place through your webcam in the comfort of your home. So, it's essential to use an appropriate background. Your interview background should be clear of objects and distractions. It should also have enough lighting and be free from background noises since AI algorithms are designed to scan your environment and make deductions about you.

### 04**Dress well for your interview.**

![Dress well](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-4.jpg)

There won't be a human at the other end of the camera, so there's no need to dress up, right? That's wrong. You still need to dress well when attending a formal human job interview. Wear business casuals with plain colored clothes.

Another reason you want to dress professionally is that it can increase your self-confidence, making you relaxed and feel good about yourself.

### 05**Practice before the interview.**

![Practice Before the Interview](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-5.jpeg)

To ace an **AI interview**, practice in front of a friend or mirror in advance of your interview. You can do a mock interview or record yourself to identify likely mistakes and correct them. Practice by recording yourself and then replaying the video to see where you are making mistakes and need improvement.

### 06**Share your real-world experiences and provide proof.**

![Share Real World Experience](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-6.jpg)

Use real-world experiences to showcase your skills when responding to questions during an **AI interview**. To determine and ensure candidates' suitability, AI looks for specific soft skills like communication, the ability to take the initiative, and lots more. So, talk about them, use a practical example to illustrate your skills, and generally talk about your interview experience.

### 07**Smiling**

![Smiling](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-7.jpg)

Wear a pleasant smile as you answer. It is easy to forget to smile when focusing so hard on the questions, but remember to relax and act natural. Facial expressions such as smiling are criteria that **artificial intelligence interviewers** watch for. Remember to smile, nod, and Use Gestures During Your Interview to show that you are attentive.

### 08**Maintain eye contact and a neutral voice tone.**

![Maintain Eye
        Contact and Neutral Voice Tone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-8.jpeg)

During an **AI video interview**, maintain eye contact with the camera and gaze squarely into your webcam. Ensure your camera is at eye level, so you don't have to strain to see into it. Avoid looking away all of the time; this can give the impression of being distracted and unfocused. Speak neutrally or brightly. Remember that the AI analyzes your speech tone and mannerisms. As a result, speaking in clear tones can help you succeed.

### 09**Maintain proper body posture and even talking speed**

![Maintain Proper Body Posture and talk speed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-9.jpg)

Ensure to carry yourself the same way as you would in an in-person human interview because a human interviewer will watch your interview at some point. You emphasize more confidence when you sit up straight, Sit with an open posture, avoid crossed arms or legs, keep your chin towards your stomach, and do not hunch your shoulders or recline on the chair. Appear in control, natural, and ready to handle any question. Try to keep your talking speed at a conversational rate, and avoid talking too fast or too slow because it might come off as you being nervous or unsure of yourself.

### 10**Make use of keywords**

![Make Use of Keywords](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-10.jpg)

The use of keywords is essential in any job application process. Meanwhile, AI algorithms pick out keywords in a candidate's response during an interview. Stand out during an **AI interview** by using phrases that explain what you can contribute, echoing the exact language of the job posting. Before the **AI-based video interview**, carefully go through the job description and note what keywords the company uses to describe the role on the company website or job posting page. Be sure to use their words specifically.

## How To Add Text In After Effects

In almost every video you come across, you will see text added to the video in different parts. There are various reasons why adding text to videos becomes a necessity. First of all, you can highlight the underlying message or key points in your video. Along with audio and video, the viewers will have another cue point in the form of text that they can retain in their memory for longer. You add animated texts to video to make the video interesting to watch and break the monotony of visual cues only.

Besides, you may have to want credits and add intro as well as outro to your video where adding text is almost a necessity. Text can help your viewer get the context of your video and make sense of the content. After Effects is a popular video editor thanks to its visual effects, text animation animations, and instant video enhancement tools. We will illustrate the different ways of adding text in After Effects in simple steps.

## Part 1\. Add Text in After Effects with Horizontal Type Tool

Once you have imported your video clip into the Timeline, there are several ways you can add text to your video. First of all, you can right-click on the Timeline and select New> Text to create an empty text layer and add any text you want. Similarly, you can go to Layer> New> Text option to do the same. But the easiest way of adding text in After Effects is by using Horizontal Type Tool. Here are the steps on how you can add text in AE with the type tool.

Step1Once you have imported your video into the Timeline, click on Horizontal Type Tool located in the top bar to add any text. You can press Ctrl+T(Windows) or Command+H(Mac) to get it instantly.

![horizontal type tool ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/horizontal-type-tool-ae.jpg)

Step2Click on the video where you want to place the text and type your desired text there. After you are done adding your text, press Enter key in Num pad to exit out of the text field in the video.

![add text field ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/add-text-field-ae.jpg)

Step3This will automatically create a text layer on Timeline. You can now move the text and place it anywhere you want. You can also modify the text style and add animation which we will illustrate in the next section.

## Part 2\. Use the Character Panel to Edit Text in AE

When you select Type tool and add your desired text, you get a default style for the text. It is most likely that you have to modify the text style such as changing color, font, and size to fit in your video seamlessly. That is when you have to visit the Character Panel. Character Panel is where you get to edit the font of the text you have typed, increase or decrease the font size, change the font color, and much more. Apart from that, you can increase the spacing between lines when your text is a paragraph instead of a few words. Here are the steps to use Character Panel to edit text in AE.

Step1Once you have typed your text using Horizontal Type tool on the video, click on the text.

Step2Go to Character panel located in the right side of the screen. If it is minimized, click on the panel to expand it.

![character panel after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/character-panel-after-effects.jpg)

Step3The first option in the panel is the font of the text. By the side of the font is the text color. You can use the color picker tool to choose any color as per your preference.

![choose font color ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/choose-font-color-ae.jpg)

Step4Below the font, you can select the font style such as regular, bold, italics, and likewise. The subsequent part is to change the font size and adjust vertical spacing between lines and horizontal spacing between characters.

![select font style ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/select-font-style-ae.jpg)

Step5The next section deals with Stroke option as well as fill the text option. You can fill the background of the text with any desired color.

![stroke option after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/stroke-option-after-effects.jpg)

## Part 3\. Add Animated Text to Video with Animation Presets

Now that you have added a static text and set the text format as per your preference, it is time to animate the text. A static text in a video does not look appealing, and animated texts make the video eye-catching instantly. You can use text animation presets in After Effects to add animated text to video. Here are the steps to add animated text to video with animation presets and effects.

Step1Click on the text on your video that you want to animate. Go to Effects and Presets panel located on the right side.

![effects and presets after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/effects-and-presets-after-effects.jpg)

Step2Under Effects and Presets panel, Click on Text option. This will open all the different categories of animation presets available that you can apply to the text on your video.

![text option under effects presets](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/text-option-under-effects-presets.jpg)

Step3Select any desired animation that you want to apply to the text and drag and drop the animation on the text in the composition window. Play the video and watch the applied animation on the text.

![apply text effects ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/apply-text-effects-ae.jpg)

## Part 4\. Alternative Way to Add Text to Videos

![import media files](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/get-started-with-filmora-02.png)

Step3Drag and drop the video file from Project Media folder into the Timeline. If you have multiple video clips, you need to arrange them sequentially on the Timeline.

Step4To add text to your video, go to Titles located at the top bar. Check the left panel where you can see different categories of text effects. Select any desired text effect and drop into the Timeline. Make sure that the text layer is above the video layer on Timeline. You can shift the text layer on Timeline to place it where you want it to appear. You can also stretch the duration of the text effect as per your requirements.

![drag title timeline filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/drag-title-timeline-filmora.jpg)

Step5You can edit the text effect by double clicking on the text layer on Timeline. Under Preset tab, you can change the text, font type and size, text color and much more. For further customization, you can click on Advanced button. At last, click on OK button to save the edits done.
