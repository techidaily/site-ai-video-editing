Video editing involves rearranging and upscaling video content for improved quality. Meanwhile, video editing can consume a lot of time and resources. For video editing, you need to have expertise in using the software. The ideal solution is using **Filmic Tone LUTs for free download**. These LUTs can extend the quality of your videos in a hassle-free environment. This article will discuss important Filmic Pro LUTs.

* [Part 2: Discussing Some Practical Uses of LUTs in Video Editing](#part2)
* [Part 3: Best Filmic Pro LUTs To Use](#part3)
* [Part 4: Getting To Know Wondershare Filmora and Its Use in LUTs](#part4)

## Part 1: How Can LUTs Benefit Video Editors?

Video editors are professionals that are tasked to edit and customize videos. Their main objective is to enhance video quality with necessary manual upscaling. Making things more accessible, find how LUTs can benefit these professionals:

* Increased Efficiency: With LUTs, video editors can optimize their workflows with ready-made filters. So they don’t need to spend hours on video editing. By applying filters, video colors are upgraded.
* Consistent Grading: During manual editing, multiple frames are left out during color correction. With LUTs, the colors are applied in a consistent way in all frames. This way, you will experience effective color enhancement.
* Professional Quality: The quality of applied LUTs is amazing. After all, LUTs provide dedicated filter presets to optimize color saturation and brightness. With professional color grading, experience a top-quality video.
* Creative Colors: LUTs are ideal for adding premium yet stylish color schemas into videos. The color gradients are creative as well as sleek and luxurious. You will not regret using creative color presets in LUTs.

## Part 2: Discussing Some Practical Uses of LUTs in Video Editing

LUTs, also known as look-up tables, are unique video editing tools. They use mathematical instructions to map input color values into output color values. This way, consistent color gradings are applied across video content. In video editing, LUTs can be used for a variety of practical uses:

### 1\. Special Effects

By using LUTs, you can add special effects to your videos. This includes different effects, including dreamy, moody, or surreal. The videos will look more professional and enchanting with attractive looks. So you don’t need to pursue video editing in a deep way.

### 2\. HDR Display

With LUTs, users can add a dynamic touch of HDR display to the videos. After all, they can convert SDR footage to HDR footage using special filter presets. This allows for different color contrasts within the video.

### 3\. Color Enhancement

Enhancing color schemas is easier and more convenient using LUTs. These editing tools can adjust color contrast, balance, and saturation. Hence, your video is upscaled with an improved color display for vintage or cinematic looks.

### 4\. Match Footages
