## Part 1: How to Make a Countdown timer in After Effects

Developed by Adobe, After Effects is one of the most widely used animation software that is used for creating and editing videos using a wide range of functions supported by the application. Among other functions, After Effects facilitates adding a countdown timer to your videos and this task can be done in multiple ways.

Listed below are these different methods.

### Method 1\. Adding Countdown Timer in After Effects using Expression

Step1 Launch the software and then choose to Create a new Text Layer.

![after effects text layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/complete-tutorial-on-after-effects-countdown-timer-adding-01.jpg)

Step2 Open the text options and click on Alt + Click on your PC (For the Mac -Option + Click) on the stopwatch of the Source Text.

Step3 Next, you need to insert the expression - timeToCurrentFormat() inside the expression area.

Step4 Now, set the composition frame rate to 60fps which will make it look like an actual countdown timer.

Step5 Now count it down, pre-compose everything and then reverse the speed of the composition.

Composition speed can be reversed, right-click on the same, go to Time and then choose Time Reverse Layer.

![after effects expressions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/complete-tutorial-on-after-effects-countdown-timer-adding-02.jpg)

Above are the steps for **timer expression after effects** process.

### Method 2\. Adding Countdown Timer in After Effects using the Timecode plugin

In this method, you can use the Timecode plugin instead of using the “**timeToCurrentFormat()**” expression.

While using this **after effects timer** method, you would need to add a plugin to the New Solid that will create a timer layout automatically.

Next, follow the process as in the previous steps, and a countdown timer can be added.

### Method 3\. Creating a simple Countdown in After Effects

Step1 First of all, launch the software and then create a Text Layer.

Step2 Next, open the text options using Alt + Click for PC and Option + Click for Mac at the stopwatch of Source Text.

Step3 Next, at the expression area insert the expression- Math. Floor(-time) +10\. Here in the place of 10, you can choose any number desired and this will be the starting countdown value.

Above we have learned 3 ways by which After Effects can be used for adding a countdown timer. Though these are workable methods, at times you may have issues with them and thus an alternate tool may be needed.
