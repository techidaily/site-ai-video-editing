## Part 1: Some Important Deliverables to Ensure While Recording Videos in Slow Motion

Capture fleeting moments in the slow-motion mode of the camera to emphasize details. It’s the only way to highlight important aspects of sports and action scenes. Recording in slow motion is not difficult when you will learn [**how to record slow-motion video**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Before learning, let's understand important aspects you should look at while recording.

* **Frame Rate:** For slow-motion video, choosing the right frame rate is crucial. A higher framerate, such as 120fps and 240fps, allows smoother playback. So, before recording, ensure that your camera supports a good framerate.
* **Resolution:** Maintaining high-resolution videos is important to get good quality. Usually, slow-motion footage uses 4K and HD (High Definition) resolution. Having a high video resolution means providing clarity in details in videos.
* **Shutter Speed:** It refers to the speed at which the camera closes and controls exposure. Adjust the shutter speed to faster mode to capture every crisp in slow motion. It will prevent motion blur and help in freezing fast-moving objects.
* **Audio Consideration:** You should know that recording slow motion will affect the original audio. Meanwhile, some cameras preserve the original sound. So, be prepared and test your camera's audio speed to ease the editing process.
* **Focus and Stability:** Minimize your camera shake and enable a stabilizer or tripod. Stable footage is essential to enhance the video quality. Moreover, try to keep your main subject in camera focus. In this regard, you can use manual focus control if necessary.
* **Editing Software Compatibility:** Another thing that you must consider is tool compatibility. It's better to check it before recording so you will not regret it later. Check your editing tools are supporting the file format of the recorded slow-motion video.
* **Storage Space:** The **“**No More Storage” sign is a nightmare when you have recorded a perfect shot. Slow-motion videos consume large storage because of high resolution and frame rate. Thus, consider this aspect before recording to avoid inconvenience and arrange storage media.

## Part 3: Making Recorded Video in Slow Motion Using the Right Tools

Now, you are pretty much familiar with [**how to record slow-motion video**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) using smartphones. A phenomenon that arises here is, can we slow down the normally recorded video? The simple answer is yes. There are many editing apps designed for this purpose. [Adobe Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html) is one such editing app to slow down the pre-recorded videos.

##### Step 1

Access your Adobe Premiere Pro application and import a video in the timeline. Identify the frame rate of your video clip for a non-choppy playback.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

##### Step 2

The frame rate will tell you how much you need to slow down the video. To do so, use this “(Timeline Frame Rate ÷ Footage Frame Rate) x 100” formula. Before moving, analyze the slow motion you can add in your clip as per their frame rate.

![calculate frame rate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/recording-video-in-slow-motion-6.jpg)

##### Step 3

After making calculations, right-click on your footage in the timeline. Select the "Speed/Duration" option from the list and get a small pop-up screen. There, type any number; suppose you type 40% in the box given next to the "Speed." Finally, click on the "OK” and press the Space bar to get a preview.
