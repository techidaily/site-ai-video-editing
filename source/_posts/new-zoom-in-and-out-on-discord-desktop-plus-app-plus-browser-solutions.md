Time-lapse is a specialized type of shot that can be achieved in-camera, through editing, or a combination of both. Time-lapse is a technique where frames are shot much slower than a normal rate (e.g., 24 frames per minute instead of per second).

Professional time-lapses are a series of raw photos even though they are sometimes perceived as videos. In a nutshell, a time-lapse is a short video that processes by revealing the evolution of a series of events, invisible to the eye.

The simplest and most useful formula is time per frame (TPF), multiplied by frames per second (FPS), multiplied by 60 seconds. Using this formula will tell you how long to record to end up with your desired time lapse length or “recording time” (RT). TPF x FPS x 60 = RT

**Upload your files**

Upload your photos and arrange them in the order you want. In most of the slideshow makers, you will get the option of sliding pictures and rearranging them. You can also insert text on pictures after this step.

**Apply effects, filters and transitions**

Your basic slideshow is ready. Now apply effects, filters and transitions to make your slideshow beautiful. The theme itself comes with the effects sometimes; for example; if you choose holiday theme, romance or party, the theme will come with effects and filters accordingly. But you can customize it as per your choice and apply filters and effects according to your preference. Then check transition library and apply the one that attract you.

In some products watermark can be removed by cracking the product while in others, watermark can be removed with the help of online watermark remover. The procedure of removing watermark depends totally upon the slideshow maker you choose.

**Export and save video**

Your slideshow is completely ready to be shared with your friends.
