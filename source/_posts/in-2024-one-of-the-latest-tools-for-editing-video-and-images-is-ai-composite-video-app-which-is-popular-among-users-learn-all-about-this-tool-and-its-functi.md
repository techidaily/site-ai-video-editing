## Part 2 How to Convert Slides to Digital - Step-by-Step Guide

Here, we will discuss step-by-step ways to turn the old slides into digital images. So, let’s begin:

**Step 1: Resolution**

The very first step for **converting slides to digital photos** is measuring and fixing the resolution of the slides. The technical measurement of image resolution is DPI (dot per inch). It helps you to predict the sharpness or clarity of the final image. The overall measurement depends on the size of the slide and the type of converter or scanner you are using. For example,

A 35 mm slide scanned at 10 MP will give you the images of size 13"\*9".

Step 2: Dust and Scratch Removal

If you have slides that have been wrapped in a box and remained untouched for so long, they might require cleaning. Such slides may develop mold buildup, age-related blemishes, or scratches. They need a cleaning process before using them to convert into slides. A lint-free cloth and an anti-static film cleaner are the best combinations to gently clean the slides and make them fresh.

Step 3: Color Correction and Restoration

Color correction and restoration is another important step when you are dealing with converting old slides into digital images. In order to correct the fading and color shift, you can use the built-in scanning software. You can also use other software for such purposes.

Wondershare Filmora is the best tool which can be used for the color correction of old slides. It is a handy tool with a variety of features. Filmora offers a number of options when it comes to color correction and grading. These options include color histogram, white balance, 3D LUT (3D Lookup table), color and light, HSL, vignette, etc.

Step 4: Using the Best Scanner cum Digital Converter

The next step is choosing the best quality scanner according to the requirement. 35 mm is the most common size of the slides. But, it does come with other uncommon formats too such as 110, 126, 120, 127, etc. You will come to know about the actual size when the image is mounted on the cardboard. Therefore, it is essential to select a quality and versatile scanner which can convert slides of any size effectively.
