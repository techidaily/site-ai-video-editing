### 1\. Snapchat Cache

One of the main reasons that the Snapchat camera zoomed-in error occurs is due to cache data. As Snapchat contains our pictures and videos with added filters, the storage or cache data gets occupied as a result. So, due to this reason, the app struggles with storing more data and starts showing malfunctions like a zoomed in camera.

### 2\. Device Incompatibility

In some situations, there are possibilities that your device does not support Snapchat due to incompatible issues. It can happen due to internal bugs in your device, which is why your Snapchat camera does not work appropriately.

### 3\. Internal Issue with Snapchat

If your device does not contain bugs, then surely there must be an internal issue with your Snapchat app. This situation mostly occurs when you download additional filters and effects on Snapchat through third-party tools. Consequently, Snapchat starts displaying small bugs during the usage of its camera.

### 4\. Camera Settings

Sometimes, you are not properly aware of your camera settings in the device and app. If the camera settings of your device are adjusted in a certain way, it may affect the camera settings of the Snapchat app.

**Steps to resize FLV videos with Filmora Video Editor:**

1. **Launch Filmora and open a new project**

Run the Wondershare Filmora application on Windows or Mac after installing it. Then you should automatically be inside a new project. If not, you can manually open a new project by going to **_File_** on the top left corner and then clicking on ‘**_New Project_**’.

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-1.jpg)

1. **Import the FLV video and add it to timeline**

Click on ‘**_Import Media Files_**’ and import the flv video into project media from your computer’s file explorer. Then add the video to the timeline by dragging it inside the timeline.

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-2.jpg)

1. **Edit and perform desired modifications (Optional)**

If you are just looking to resize the FLV video file, then you can skip this step and move to step no. 4\. Otherwise, you can do various editings on the video like cropping, muting, trimming, animating, etc. before resizing the video. Filmora provides a wide range of features for editing and adding effects to the video.

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-3.jpg)

1. **Resize the video by changing the aspect ratio**

Aspect ratio defines the shape of your video like if you want the video to be horizontal, vertical, square, or custom. Generally, the term ‘**resizing video**’ refers to changing the aspect ratio of the video. For that, go to the **_File_** and then to the **_Project Settings_**_._ Then on the Aspect Ratio box, select the one that you prefer or you can try custom scaling. You can choose your preferred resolution of the project too while you’re at it.

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-4.jpg)

1. **Resize the video by cropping**

When you change the aspect ratio of the project, some parts of your flv video might not fit or it might be shrunk small to fit. So you need to resize the flv video by cropping so that you can crop and focus on the part of the video you like. To crop the video, select the flv video clip in the timeline and click on the crop icon in the timeline toolbar. Now choose the ratio you want to crop and select the part you’d like to keep. Then click OK and your flv video will be resized.

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-5.jpg)

1. **Adjust the file size of the video through export settings**

After you’ve cropped and resized the Flv video, you need to export it by clicking the **_Export_** button on the top center part. There are different settings available for exporting the video. Click on the **_Settings_** button near the resolution and you’ll be shown some detailed preferences for exporting. Every setting here like frame rate, resolution, bitrate, etc. can affect the size of the output video.

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-6.jpg)

1. **Resize the video by changing the aspect ratio**

Aspect ratio defines the shape of your video like if you want the video to be horizontal, vertical, square, or custom.

For that, go to the **_File_** and then to the **_Project Settings_**_._ Then on the Aspect Ratio box, select the one that you prefer or you can try custom scaling. You can choose your preferred resolution of the project too while you’re at it.

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-4.jpg)

1. **Resize the video by cropping**

To crop the video, select the flv video clip in the timeline and click on the crop icon in the timeline toolbar. Now choose the ratio you want to crop and select the part you’d like to keep. Then click OK and your flv video will be resized.

## Part 1: What Makes a Perfect Slow-Motion Video?

An ideal **FCP slow-motion** video requires careful attention to technical details and aesthetics. Below are some essential things to think about bringing perfection in slow-motion videos:

* **Resolution**: A slow-motion video with visual appeal and a high resolution is crucial. This is especially vital if you intend to crop or zoom in on the video while editing.
* **Storytelling:** Make sure the slow-motion clip supports the idea you're attempting to portray. Your scenes will have more impact if you tell them with a thoughtful narrative.
* **Editing:** Try different speeds when editing your clip to achieve the best impact. Consider including sound effects or music to accompany the slow-motion images.
* **Timing:** Select the appropriate times to record in slow motion. You shouldn't slow down your entire video. Instead, you can apply the effect to draw attention to acts or feelings.
* **Frame Rate:** Slow-motion videos are usually shot at a greater frame rate. Frame rates of 60, 120, 240, or even higher are common as they make the video look smoother.
* **Shutter Speed:** For precise and sharp results, use a fast shutter speed camera. This lessens the likelihood of motion blur in every slow-motion frame.
