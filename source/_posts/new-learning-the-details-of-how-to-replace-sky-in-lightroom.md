![move the playhead on the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-falling-text-effect-in-filmora-6.gif)

## Repeat for the next letters

After you are done with this editing process for the first letter, hold the default title in the library and drag and drop it into Track 2 on the timeline. Adjust the starting point for this layer to frame five from the beginning, and move the file to that starting point. In the end, cut the title length at the same position as layer one was, at 3.15 seconds.

Follow the process explained in the previous section for the first letter, i.e., moving the playhead at specific frames and changing the Y-axis and Rotation value multiple times.

After editing the second letter in the title, repeat the process of holding and dragging the default title to Track 3 in the timeline and adjusting starting position at the 10th frame.
