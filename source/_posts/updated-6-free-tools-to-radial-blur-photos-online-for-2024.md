## Mastering OpenCV Object Tracking: A Comprehensive Guide for Beginners and Experts

**OpenCV Tracking** is a popular method used for tracking objects in a video in real-time. OpenCV is a powerful library used for image processing and computer vision applications.

From real-time video analysis to Augmented Reality, OpenCV Tracking has a wide range of uses and can help both private and public sectors to detect and track the desired object in an image or video.

In this comprehensive guide, we’ll explore **OpenCV Tracking** and its pre-built trackers**.** We will use the OpenCV library and Python to implement this Object Tracking application.

2. [The Pre-Built Algorithms OpenCV Offers For Object Tracking](#part5-2)  
3. [Implementation In Python And OpenCV](#part5-3)

## Part 1\. What Is Object Tracking?

Object Tracking determines the location of an object in a video and can be used for a variety of purposes, including surveillance, security, traffic control, digital forensics, anomaly detection, gesture recognition, visual surveillance, human-computer interaction, augmented reality, and robot vision.

Even though it may seem easy for an average person, object tracking is quite complex for computers because they have to analyze a set of frames and estimate the object’s trajectory based on numbers instead of images.

Because of how complicated it is, Object Tracking is considered one of the most difficult tasks in computer vision. Even though it's a challenge, it's not impossible to accomplish.

And there are two levels of Object Tracking that you should learn about:

### 1\. SOT & MOT

1. **Single Object Tracking (SOT):** SOT is a tracking algorithm that creates advanced appearance models and/or motion models to manage difficult issues like out-of-plane rotations, illumination variations, or scale changes.
2. **Multiple Object Tracking (MOT):** MOT tracks every part of a video and is mainly concerned with mid-level tasks and serves as a foundation for high-level tasks.

### 2\. The Difference Between Tracking And Detection

After knowing what Object Tracking is, there is another concept you should also be aware of - Object Detection.

The Object Tracking and Object Detection are two important methods in computer vision. Object Tracking tracks the position of a given object in an image in real-time, while Object Detection identifies and localizes objects in an image or video. That is the difference.

## Part 2\. Types Of Object Tracking

### Image Tracking

Image tracking allows users to interact with digital content more naturally and helps users move and interact with digital objects in the same manner as they will with real-world physical objects.

Image tracking can be used in various augmented reality (AR) applications, such as AR gaming, shopping, and navigation. Moreover, you can also use it for educational purposes, such as teaching anatomy or providing instructions for a difficult task.

### Video Tracking

Video tracking is the process of tracking objects in a video sequence and can be used for various applications, such as detecting and counting objects in a scene, understanding their motions, and recognizing activities.

## Part 3\. What Are The Difficulties Of Object Tracking?

As what has been mentioned above, the use of object tracking is versatile. However, there are some challenges associated with Object Tracking, such as:

**Background Clutter:** The background can impact extracting an object's features. If the background is more densely populated, detecting or tracking the object of interest can be more difficult.

**Occlusion:** This is a phenomenon where the object being tracked is affected by the background or foreground. This causes the tracking algorithm to get confused due to multiple objects coming close together, hence, losing track of the object.

**Varying spatial scales:** Varying spatial scales refer to the target object being of a different size or shape, which can confuse the algorithm, leading to errors.

**Training and Tracking Speed:** If the object is moving too fast or is too small, it can be difficult to track. Therefore, the tracking module has to be designed to track, identify, and localize objects in a matter of seconds.

## Part 4\. Stages Of The Object Tracking Process

After the introduction of object tracking technically, let’s learn about its mechanism of it from two sides: periods of the working process and the way it tracks.

### 1\. Stages Of The Object Tracking Process

Following are the stages of the Object Tracking process:

**Target Initialization**

Target initialization is the first step in Object Tracking and involves defining the targets or objects of interest and drawing a bounding box around them in the initial frame. After that, the tracker has to detect the position of the object in the frame while drawing the bounding box.

**Appearance Modeling**

Appearance modeling is important for understanding how an object will look under different circumstances. If the object being tracked changes appearance due to different lighting, angle, or speed, the tracking algorithm may lose its information and the object itself. Therefore, it has to be conducted to let the algorithm detect the changes and distortion.

**Motion Estimation**

Motion estimation entails the capacity of the model to anticipate an object's future position with precision.

**Target Positioning**

Motion estimation is a process of approximating the most likely region where an object could be present. After the object's location is approximated, a visual model can be used to determine the target's location more accurately.

### 2\. Methods Of Object Tracking

Here’re some methods of Object Tracking:

**OpenCV-Based Object Tracking**

**OpenCV Object Tracking** method is widely used because it offers several built-in functions designed specifically for this purpose, such as GOTURN, MIL, MediandFlow, and CSRT. The tracker type you select will depend on your specific application design. Each tracker has its pros and cons, so there is not a single type of tracker ideal for all applications.

**MDNet**

Multi-Domain Convolutional Neural Network Tracker is a convolutional neural-based visual tracker and has won the VOT2015 challenge. Moreover, it is composed of domain-specific layers, branches, and multiple shared layers.

The MDNetT tracker is a deep neural network that is trained on numerous Object Tracking datasets. The tracker is designed to work in multiple domains, including video, text, and images.

**DeepSort**

DeepSort algorithm can track objects in real-time and uses YOLO v3 to compute the bounding boxes around the objects in a frame.

DeepSort uses Kalman filter from Simple Online and Realtime Tracking algorithm and an identification model, ReID to interlink bounding boxes and object tracks.

**ROLO**

ROLO is a novel Object Tracking method that uses recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to learn object-specific Spatio-temporal representations. This method works with YOLO, an object detection algorithm, and an LTSM for determining the trajectory of an object.

## Part 5\. The powerful backup: OpenCV

We have demonstrated how powerful OpenCV Tracking is and how it works. However, do you wonder what OpenCV is? How it supports the tracking goals being achieved? In this part, we will focus on OpenCV and help you better understand the the underlying mechanisms.

### 1\. What Is OpenCV?

OpenCV is a powerful library that allows you to perform image processing, deep learning, machine learning, and computer vision tasks on live video feeds. Moreover, it can be used to detect objects, track their movements, and recognize faces.

It can help process the data that have videos and images and has been used in various applications, such as object recognition and detection, autonomous cars, robots, medical image analysis, automated surveillance, and anomaly detection.

### 2\. The Pre-Built Algorithms OpenCV Offers For Object Tracking

There are 8 pre-built algorithms that OpenCV offers for Objects Tracking. All of them have their uniquility and here we will present their pros and cons for your better understadning.

## Part 1\. What Is Object Tracking?

Object Tracking determines the location of an object in a video and can be used for a variety of purposes, including surveillance, security, traffic control, digital forensics, anomaly detection, gesture recognition, visual surveillance, human-computer interaction, augmented reality, and robot vision.

Even though it may seem easy for an average person, object tracking is quite complex for computers because they have to analyze a set of frames and estimate the object’s trajectory based on numbers instead of images.

Because of how complicated it is, Object Tracking is considered one of the most difficult tasks in computer vision. Even though it's a challenge, it's not impossible to accomplish.

And there are two levels of Object Tracking that you should learn about:

### 1\. SOT & MOT

1. **Single Object Tracking (SOT):** SOT is a tracking algorithm that creates advanced appearance models and/or motion models to manage difficult issues like out-of-plane rotations, illumination variations, or scale changes.
2. **Multiple Object Tracking (MOT):** MOT tracks every part of a video and is mainly concerned with mid-level tasks and serves as a foundation for high-level tasks.

### 2\. The Difference Between Tracking And Detection

After knowing what Object Tracking is, there is another concept you should also be aware of - Object Detection.

The Object Tracking and Object Detection are two important methods in computer vision. Object Tracking tracks the position of a given object in an image in real-time, while Object Detection identifies and localizes objects in an image or video. That is the difference.

## Part 2\. Types Of Object Tracking

### Image Tracking

Image tracking allows users to interact with digital content more naturally and helps users move and interact with digital objects in the same manner as they will with real-world physical objects.

Image tracking can be used in various augmented reality (AR) applications, such as AR gaming, shopping, and navigation. Moreover, you can also use it for educational purposes, such as teaching anatomy or providing instructions for a difficult task.

### Video Tracking

Video tracking is the process of tracking objects in a video sequence and can be used for various applications, such as detecting and counting objects in a scene, understanding their motions, and recognizing activities.

## Part 3\. What Are The Difficulties Of Object Tracking?

As what has been mentioned above, the use of object tracking is versatile. However, there are some challenges associated with Object Tracking, such as:

**Background Clutter:** The background can impact extracting an object's features. If the background is more densely populated, detecting or tracking the object of interest can be more difficult.

**Occlusion:** This is a phenomenon where the object being tracked is affected by the background or foreground. This causes the tracking algorithm to get confused due to multiple objects coming close together, hence, losing track of the object.

**Varying spatial scales:** Varying spatial scales refer to the target object being of a different size or shape, which can confuse the algorithm, leading to errors.

**Training and Tracking Speed:** If the object is moving too fast or is too small, it can be difficult to track. Therefore, the tracking module has to be designed to track, identify, and localize objects in a matter of seconds.

## Part 4\. Stages Of The Object Tracking Process

After the introduction of object tracking technically, let’s learn about its mechanism of it from two sides: periods of the working process and the way it tracks.

### 1\. Stages Of The Object Tracking Process

Following are the stages of the Object Tracking process:

**Target Initialization**

Target initialization is the first step in Object Tracking and involves defining the targets or objects of interest and drawing a bounding box around them in the initial frame. After that, the tracker has to detect the position of the object in the frame while drawing the bounding box.

**Appearance Modeling**

Appearance modeling is important for understanding how an object will look under different circumstances. If the object being tracked changes appearance due to different lighting, angle, or speed, the tracking algorithm may lose its information and the object itself. Therefore, it has to be conducted to let the algorithm detect the changes and distortion.

**Motion Estimation**

Motion estimation entails the capacity of the model to anticipate an object's future position with precision.

**Target Positioning**

Motion estimation is a process of approximating the most likely region where an object could be present. After the object's location is approximated, a visual model can be used to determine the target's location more accurately.

### 2\. Methods Of Object Tracking

Here’re some methods of Object Tracking:

**OpenCV-Based Object Tracking**

**OpenCV Object Tracking** method is widely used because it offers several built-in functions designed specifically for this purpose, such as GOTURN, MIL, MediandFlow, and CSRT. The tracker type you select will depend on your specific application design. Each tracker has its pros and cons, so there is not a single type of tracker ideal for all applications.

**MDNet**

Multi-Domain Convolutional Neural Network Tracker is a convolutional neural-based visual tracker and has won the VOT2015 challenge. Moreover, it is composed of domain-specific layers, branches, and multiple shared layers.

The MDNetT tracker is a deep neural network that is trained on numerous Object Tracking datasets. The tracker is designed to work in multiple domains, including video, text, and images.

**DeepSort**

DeepSort algorithm can track objects in real-time and uses YOLO v3 to compute the bounding boxes around the objects in a frame.

DeepSort uses Kalman filter from Simple Online and Realtime Tracking algorithm and an identification model, ReID to interlink bounding boxes and object tracks.

**ROLO**

ROLO is a novel Object Tracking method that uses recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to learn object-specific Spatio-temporal representations. This method works with YOLO, an object detection algorithm, and an LTSM for determining the trajectory of an object.

## Part 5\. The powerful backup: OpenCV

We have demonstrated how powerful OpenCV Tracking is and how it works. However, do you wonder what OpenCV is? How it supports the tracking goals being achieved? In this part, we will focus on OpenCV and help you better understand the the underlying mechanisms.

### 1\. What Is OpenCV?

OpenCV is a powerful library that allows you to perform image processing, deep learning, machine learning, and computer vision tasks on live video feeds. Moreover, it can be used to detect objects, track their movements, and recognize faces.

It can help process the data that have videos and images and has been used in various applications, such as object recognition and detection, autonomous cars, robots, medical image analysis, automated surveillance, and anomaly detection.

### 2\. The Pre-Built Algorithms OpenCV Offers For Object Tracking

There are 8 pre-built algorithms that OpenCV offers for Objects Tracking. All of them have their uniquility and here we will present their pros and cons for your better understadning.

| **Tracker**            | **Pros**                                                            | **Cons**                                                            |

##### Step1Ready or set up your studio

A studio can be a corner of a room or if you have an extra space, you can dedicate an entire room to be your filming studio. Then get your camera or smart phone set up on a stable table with your cellphone stand to make it sturdy and make sure you have a suitable lighting. Dark video is not useful to anyone specially for something as detailed as applying a makeup.

![run filmora on computer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/run-filmora-on-computer.jpg)

##### Step2Create an outline

It may be helpful to create an outline or a script of your video beforehand so that you remember to do all the things your intent to do in your tutorial. This can also help you stay on track during filming so that you are remembering to demonstrate every part of your tutorial. Making a makeup tutorial video need also a step-by-step process so that you don't forget anything that you will put or show in the video, you need to make a note or an outline for you to remember all because it so hustles to go back and record what you missed.

##### Step3Prepare Your Makeup

Before recording, prepare your makeup and make sure you use clean brushes. Set up the makeup you intent to use on the table or on you vanity near your filming setup. Lay out all you makeup and products that you want to use in this video. Have your makeup in front of you so that they are easily accessible during filming.

![prepare makeup for video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/prepare-makeup-for-video.jpg)

Make sure to have this thing in front of you before filming

* Skin and Eye Primer
* Moisturizer
* Foundation and Concealer
* Loose or Setting Powder
* Eyebrows Pencil or powder
* Contouring Palette
* Eyeshadow Palette
* Highlight powder
* Lipstick
* Setting Spray

##### Step4Concentrate and Film

Usually before filming I pray for guidance and knowledge. This is essential to me I do it before filming so that I can be guided and finish what I'm doing properly and less struggle.

If you are done the you can now start filming. Used your script to start talking to the camera, remember to be happy mood while doing this tutorial. Make your viewers feel good while watching you and don't forget to tell them what product you are using. Also leave some comment to where they can buy the product you are using on your video.

![concentrate and film makeup video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/concentrate-and-film-makeup-video.jpg)

##### Step5Edit and Upload

This is the last step for making a makeup video. Edit your video properly and make your video creative to attract more viewers. Cut the unwanted clips especially the part where you're just talking. Because sometime viewers get bored if they only see you talking. Create a nice animation or transition to make your video stands out.

![edit and upload makeup video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/edit-and-upload-makeup-video.jpg)

Then upload your finish video to your Youtube channel, make sure to public and promote your video so that more viewers will see how great you are in making this kind of videos. Remember to share your video to all your social media account to have more viewers and subscribers, don't be shy to tell also your family and friends that you made a video so they can see the finished product of your hard work video tutorial and ask them to leave comment and suggestion if you have anything else to change or fix in making video, because for us content creator people's feedback is very important so we can do better next time.

## The Bottom Line

Now that you already knew the gear that you need to start setting up your studio for your makeup video and you also knew the step-by-step process, you are now ready to film a makeup video. But remember this you can't just put makeup on your face style your hair and end the video. As a beauty vlogger, you're an entertainer, so open dialogue is essential when filming. Ask your audience what they want to see, more importantly always remember to ask for feedback because for us content creator viewers feedback is very important so we can do better next time.If you've just started this inspiring journey of becoming a beauty Youtuber then hopefully these tips on how to create a makeup video will helped.

## **Wrapping Things Up**

People's viewing experiences are greatly influenced by the audio accompanying a video. No matter how wonderful or perfect a video clip is, if the audio playing while watching it is terrible, it may be a very frustrating experience. So, we've gone over a few different software options for removing audio from a video file and replacing it with another audio in a couple of moments.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **How to Insert Audio to Video Clip in Da Vinci Resolve?**

There may be times that your video may require the addition of music, background audio, or wooshing sounds.

To begin, open Resolve and import your audio clip:

1. Navigate to the "Edit" page.
2. Select the tab "Media Pool."
3. Right-click and choose "Import Media" or push "Ctrl + i."
4. Pick your audio clip and browse to your location.
5. Select "Open."

The audio clip is now imported into the "Media Pool." After that, you'll need to figure out which part of the audio track you'll use.

Double-click the audio clip to play it. In the "Source Viewer," it will appear.

Set the needed audio parts in (press I) and out (press O). Alternatively, if you need the entire soundtrack, there's no need to set in and out.

Drag & drop the audio track (from the media pool) underneath the video you want to use. It will then add the sound file with the selected portion of the audio. You can now modify the audio to match the visual.

### **How to Link Your Audio and Video in DaVinci Resolve?**

It's best to link the soundtrack (music, sound effect, or background music) to the relevant video once you've adjusted the audio file.

Here's how to connect audio and video in a timeline:

1. Press "Ctrl" or "Cmd" to toggle both the video and audio.
2. Right-click and choose "Link Clips." You may also use the shortcuts “Ctrl + Alt + L" or "Option + Command + L."
3. The sound and visual are now both connected.

Thus, you can rest guaranteed that the audio will follow your movie wherever it goes. There will be no issues with out-of-sync!

### **How Do You Link Many Audio and Video Files Together in DaVinci Resolve?**

Several video and audio segments can be linked together to form a single one. You can rearrange them anywhere in the timeline, and they will not be out of sync.

This is how you connect many clips:

1. By holding down the "Ctrl" or "Cmd" key, you can choose all the video and audio clips you want.
2. Right-click and choose "Link Clips." You may also use the shortcut keys "Ctrl + Alt + L" or "Option + Command + L".
3. Now, all your video or audio files are linked together.

### **Is Any Music Available to Use for Editing?**

Understanding copyright law can be complicated. It's best to use free music for video editing if you don't want to be accused of copyright violation.

Additionally, you can purchase two licenses to avoid copyright concerns. The producer controls the synchronization license, and the master license to use the song recording is managed by the publishing company.

If you don't want to go into legal trouble, the only thing you need to remember is never to utilize any illegal video.

### **Is There Any Free Music in DaVinci Resolve?**

DaVinci Resolve does not include any free music; however, it does include royalty-free sound effects noise. To get started, you can download and install the available sound package.

### **What Software Provides Free Music?**

The Audio Collection in Wondershare Filmora has over 50 royalty-free audio tracks for videos, with more to come.

For video production, you can acquire free background music.

In addition, Filmora has 25 sound effects, including animal sounds, video game sounds, and beeps. With Filmora, you may use more advanced editing features like keyframing, background noise elimination, cut, trim, crop, PIP effects, green-screen effects, and more to add free-choice music to your film.

Filmora will enhance the appeal of your video by giving free background music. You may also tweak the background sound, such as speeding up and slowing down, fade-in and fade-out.

![unlink-audio-video-davinci-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/unlink-audio-video-davinci-1.jpg)

1. All you have to do with DaVinci Resolve is tap on the chain link in the toolbar above to delete audio from any clip. Alternatively, you may just press down the "ctrl + shift + I" keys to connect and unlink the audio from your clip. Inspect the equalizer after that, and you're done.

![unlink-audio-video-davinci-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/unlink-audio-video-davinci-2.jpg)

1. You can now export the footage on your computer once you've finished editing and are pleased with the progress.
