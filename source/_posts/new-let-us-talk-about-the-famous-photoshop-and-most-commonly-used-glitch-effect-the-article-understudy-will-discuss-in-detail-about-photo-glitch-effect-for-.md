Step 1: The process starts by importing the image to Photoshop on which you plan to add the photo glitch effect. Then you should always convert the image from colorful to black and white.

Step 3: Now, it's time to add the first glitch element. For that, hold the ‘Shift’ key and move the image by using the left/right cursor keys on the keyboard. This will offset the image layer from the original.

Step 4: You can now select the ‘Mark’ tool from the left side. Make a rectangle anywhere on the image with the Mark tool and then switch back to the ‘Move’ tool. Then again, nudge the rectangular portion left or right to offset it. You can repeat this process multiple times on different areas of the image.
