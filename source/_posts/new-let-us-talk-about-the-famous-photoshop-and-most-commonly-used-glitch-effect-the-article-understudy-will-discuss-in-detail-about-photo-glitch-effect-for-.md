The jagged lines, the colorful pixels, frozen visuals, and also the distorted colors, everything perfectly blends to make a glitch effect. Usually, this is how all the glitch templates are, but if you get an opportunity to customize your image glitch effect and make your special effect, what will you do?

Step 1: The process starts by importing the image to Photoshop on which you plan to add the photo glitch effect. Then you should always convert the image from colorful to black and white. This could be done quickly by going into the 'Image' menu from the menu bar. Next, go for the 'Adjustments' option and select 'Desaturate.'

Step 3: Now, it's time to add the first glitch element. For that, hold the ‘Shift’ key and move the image by using the left/right cursor keys on the keyboard. This will offset the image layer from the original.

Step 4: You can now select the ‘Mark’ tool from the left side. Make a rectangle anywhere on the image with the Mark tool and then switch back to the ‘Move’ tool. Then again, nudge the rectangular portion left or right to offset it. You can repeat this process multiple times on different areas of the image.
