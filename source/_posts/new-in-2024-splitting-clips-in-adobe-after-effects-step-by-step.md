## How To Make a Video Podcast

Starting a video podcast can be quite intimidating, but the truth is; having the proper knowledge will help you do things more correctly.

As we all know, knowledge is the key to success. So, for you to navigate your way around the video podcasting industry easily, you need to consume enough information that will enable you to make fewer wrong decisions.

To help you out, we took our time to do more research on how to record video podcasts, and in this post, we will share all you need to know to record a video podcast that stands out.

## Part 1\. But first: why record with a video?

If you've done a little research, you'll notice many podcasters switched to recording with videos instead of audio. Did they decide to start doing that so we could see their faces? Well, the answer is NO. But before we discuss more on that, you should know what a video podcast is and its types.

You guessed right. A video podcast is a podcast with video. The video element could be a static image or a video recording of the podcast host and the guest. A video podcast will help you do the following;

**1\. Enhance the visual content**

Research shows that humans learn more from what they visualize than what is heard. Yes, this is because 30% of the human brain comprises neurons dedicated to visual processing, and just 3% is dedicated to hearing. Besides, videos are always more engaging compared to audio. So why not combine both to boost your podcast performance?

**2\. Level up the personality and relatability**

Most people have more belief in what they see than what is heard. So, video podcasts allow audiences to easily see your expression and understand your passion for the subject you discuss. It also builds a deeper level of connections between you and them. Also, it helps to add to the originality of your podcast and your brand as a whole.

**3\. Make the content more accessible**

Your podcast show becomes more accessible when it's in the video. You won't be limited to just uploading it on podcast platforms but also on social media as a short TikTok trailer, Instagram post, YouTube video, etc. Doing this will get your content in front of a wide range of audience, thus prompting more people to engage with your podcast.

## Part 2\. Get your gear set up

The first step to starting a video podcast is getting your gear set up. We recommend you start with the following podcast equipment:

* A camera (if recording a video podcast)
* Microphone(s)
* Headphone(s)
* Memory cards
* Tripods
* Computers
* Recording software or a digital audio workstation

Let's dig deeper into each of these. We've compiled the best podcast equipment for beginners and pros alike based on our extensive research.

However, if this is impossible because you have a small space, good lighting should spice things up. Godox SL -150 is one perfect choice that you can opt for.

### 2\. Make your background interesting

Your background shouldn't just be left alone. It would be best to put up some fascinating stuff that will blend with the podcast's theme and make the video look more admirable. For example, if your podcast discusses relationships, you should have a background that suits the topic.

So, after you finish putting up an exciting background, take a few minutes to inspect the lighting, the elements, and lots more. Then, ensure it's clean and tidy.

## Part 3\. Build your set

Besides having a good quality camera and other podcast gear mentioned above, it's also crucial to make your set look gorgeous. It makes your video podcast look more professional. Below are ideas for some techniques you can employ.

### 1\. Depth & lighting

To make a professional-looking video podcast, you need to add as much depth as possible. So yes, there should be enough distance between you and the background (don't be too close or too far). However, if this is impossible because you have a small space, good lighting should spice things up. Godox SL -150 is one perfect choice that you can opt for.

### 2\. Make your background interesting

Your background shouldn't just be left alone. It would be best to put up some fascinating stuff that will blend with the podcast's theme and make the video look more admirable. For example, if your podcast discusses relationships, you should have a background that suits the topic.

### 3\. Declutter

It's never a good idea to leave unnecessary items in the background because that makes it look messy. Also, it may compromise everything you've done to spice it up. So, after you finish putting up an exciting background, take a few minutes to inspect the lighting, the elements, and lots more. Then, ensure it's clean and tidy.

* **Intro and Outro Music**
* **Create a Cover Art**
* **Ideas to record the first podcast**
