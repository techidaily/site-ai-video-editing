![drag clip to timeline in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/drag-clip-to-timeline-in-filmora.png)

Step 5

Take a snapshot of this frame.

![take snapshot in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/take-snapshot-in-filmora.png)

Step 6

Split the footage and delete the part on the right side of the Playhead.

![split footage in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/split-footage-in-filmora.png)

Step 7

Without moving the Playhead, simply drag the snapshot you took earlier. Right-click on the snapshot in the timeline and click on “**Duration”.** Then, set the duration to **1 second**. Finally, click “**OK**”.

![change snapshot duration filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-snapshot-duration-filmora.png)

Step 8

Open your browser and go to the [Picsart photo effects editor](https://picsart.com/photo-effects/photo-to-cartoon). Upload the same snapshot we made in Filmora and apply the “Comic” preset on it. Then, download the photo and import it back into Filmora.

![comic preset picsart](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/comic-preset-picsart.png)

Step 9

Drag the snapshot with the Comic preset to the Timeline and set its duration to 1 second as well.

Step 10

Repeat the same process with the second clip. Take a snapshot, add the Comic effect, and import it back into Filmora. But this time, align the clips as follows: Add the snapshot with the comic preset first, then the snapshot without any effects, and then the video. It should look like this.

![second clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/second-clip.png)

Step 11

Go to the Transitions tab and drag the “Color Distance” transition between the first and second snapshot on your Timeline. Then, right-click on the transition box in the timeline and select “**Edit Properties**”. From there, change the duration of the transition to 1 second and click “**OK**”.

![transition in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/transition-in-filmora.png)

![push transition in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/push-transition-in-filmora.png)

Step 13

![evaporate transition filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/evaporate-transition-filmora.png)

## Guide to Synchronizing Your Audio And Videos Properly?

Video quality and engagement are prone to impact badly if your audio is not synchronized with the video. This can happen because of technical issues or frame rate mismatches. In case you somehow get unsynchronized audio in the video, you need to use a reliable video editor to cater to this issue. To help you with this issue, this article will provide the best-in-class video editor named Wondershare Filmora.

Along with the auto beat sync feature, we will also discuss some online alternatives that will assist you in syncing audio while online.

## Part 1: Why Should You Synchronize Your Audio And Videos in Video Editing?

Audio and video synchronization is important for presenting a good quality viewing experience. Here are the main reasons you shouldn’t neglect this in your audio and video.

### Lip Sync and Narrative Flow

Synchronizing audio and video is crucial to maintaining the film's narrative flow. Well-synchronized audio and video offer a very smooth experience to the viewers. If the lips and dialogue flow are not well maintained, it can cause distraction in the storytelling. As a result, the real message won't be conveyed to the viewers.

### Viewer Engagement

Do you wish to ensure that your viewers pay full attention to your video and that your message is well conveyed? Your video quality and sound matter the most for the best experience. When the audio and video are well-synced, the viewers pay attention to the content. They are not distracted due to the bad quality of the video.

### Value of Quality Production

A high-quality video with perfect sound quality and proper syncing builds a good perception. If the video quality is bad or does not have proper sync, it can leave a bad impression. Therefore, to enhance the impact of these emotional and dramatic effects, it is imperative to focus on these core things.

### Professionalism and Quality

To make your viewer experience outstanding, focus on paying attention to details. A good quality video represents your professionalism and the standards of your production. When it is synchronized, the viewer will always see this as a high-quality creation.
