Text-to-speech (TTS) is a type of assistive technology that reads digital text aloud. It’s sometimes called “read aloud” technology. This technology has evolved to the point of being inculcated or introduced directly to some video editing applications without having to visit a separate text-to-speech application or software for support. This article therefore aims at discussing ten video makers that have inbuilt the text-to-speech feature.

CAMTASIA

![text-to-speech-video-maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/text-to-speech-video-maker-2.jpg)

## FEATURES

FEATURES

After reviewing both versions (Android and iOS) of CapCut, we found that the app is indeed easy to use and includes a ton of attractive features designed for TikTok users. Would we recommend it to you? Yes, definitely, but with some caveats.

* Split function: This is similar to trimming where you have to separate the clip in order to define your desired part of the clip. Your clip can be further extended after splitting, so it’s just a process of simple trimming in editing.
* Video overlay: This feature helps you place a video on another video. Those who do this often are those who have reaction channels, online teachers and gamers. This feature helps the viewers to simultaneously comprehend explanations the main video content alongside the reaction or explanation.
* Speed control: This feature aids speed ramping. You can slow down your video and increase the speed just as you want. One thing to have in mind is when you plan to edit such a video, you have to shoot in a high resolution and high frame rate like 30-60fps so as to avoid the amateurish look.
* Reverse video: The reverse feature helps you to rewind your clip to create the effect you have pictured in your mind while shooting.
* Music library: CapCut comes with an impressive collection of royalty-free music and sound effects that can really make a huge difference to your videos. The tracks have a high quality and you can effortlessly insert them into your video to create the feel you desire.
* Filters: Choose from various filters to soften or sharpen your videos and make them more professional-looking. There are color-based and season-based filters, as well as a range of beautification tools to enhance video quality. Filters can also be used effectively if you have multiple clips that have color variations or different contrast and brightness levels. Since you can't edit most of these in CapCut, you can avoid having to use a desktop editor by choosing the right filters and applying them to all your clips to bring some uniformity.
* Effects: There’s a collection of effects you can select from to appeal to the visual cravings of your audience. This will add colour to your content as it makes your viewers involved in the video. These effects include split-screen, retro, comic, party, dreamy, and so on. These effects will make your video look fresh and professionally edited.
* Stickers and text: Stickers could be fun to use due to their expressive nature. Your choice as a content creator will go a long way in determining the fascination of your content. CapCut has therefore had you covered when it comes to adding fun features to your content to make it more interactive and exciting. Stickers and texts are therefore engaging tools you can employ to drive the fantasy of your audience.

FEATURES

After reviewing both versions (Android and iOS) of CapCut, we found that the app is indeed easy to use and includes a ton of attractive features designed for TikTok users. Would we recommend it to you? Yes, definitely, but with some caveats.

* Split function: This is similar to trimming where you have to separate the clip in order to define your desired part of the clip. Your clip can be further extended after splitting, so it’s just a process of simple trimming in editing.

* Speed control: This feature aids speed ramping. You can slow down your video and increase the speed just as you want. One thing to have in mind is when you plan to edit such a video, you have to shoot in a high resolution and high frame rate like 30-60fps so as to avoid the amateurish look.

There are color-based and season-based filters, as well as a range of beautification tools to enhance video quality. Filters can also be used effectively if you have multiple clips that have color variations or different contrast and brightness levels. Since you can't edit most of these in CapCut, you can avoid having to use a desktop editor by choosing the right filters and applying them to all your clips to bring some uniformity.
* Effects: There’s a collection of effects you can select from to appeal to the visual cravings of your audience. This will add colour to your content as it makes your viewers involved in the video. These effects include split-screen, retro, comic, party, dreamy, and so on. These effects will make your video look fresh and professionally edited.
* Stickers and text: Stickers could be fun to use due to their expressive nature. Your choice as a content creator will go a long way in determining the fascination of your content. CapCut has therefore had you covered when it comes to adding fun features to your content to make it more interactive and exciting.

FEATURES

After reviewing both versions (Android and iOS) of CapCut, we found that the app is indeed easy to use and includes a ton of attractive features designed for TikTok users. Would we recommend it to you? Yes, definitely, but with some caveats.

* Split function: This is similar to trimming where you have to separate the clip in order to define your desired part of the clip. Your clip can be further extended after splitting, so it’s just a process of simple trimming in editing.
* Video overlay: This feature helps you place a video on another video. Those who do this often are those who have reaction channels, online teachers and gamers. This feature helps the viewers to simultaneously comprehend explanations the main video content alongside the reaction or explanation.
* Speed control: This feature aids speed ramping. You can slow down your video and increase the speed just as you want. One thing to have in mind is when you plan to edit such a video, you have to shoot in a high resolution and high frame rate like 30-60fps so as to avoid the amateurish look.
* Reverse video: The reverse feature helps you to rewind your clip to create the effect you have pictured in your mind while shooting.
* Music library: CapCut comes with an impressive collection of royalty-free music and sound effects that can really make a huge difference to your videos. The tracks have a high quality and you can effortlessly insert them into your video to create the feel you desire.

There are color-based and season-based filters, as well as a range of beautification tools to enhance video quality. Filters can also be used effectively if you have multiple clips that have color variations or different contrast and brightness levels. Since you can't edit most of these in CapCut, you can avoid having to use a desktop editor by choosing the right filters and applying them to all your clips to bring some uniformity.
* Effects: There’s a collection of effects you can select from to appeal to the visual cravings of your audience. This will add colour to your content as it makes your viewers involved in the video. These effects include split-screen, retro, comic, party, dreamy, and so on. These effects will make your video look fresh and professionally edited.
* Stickers and text: Stickers could be fun to use due to their expressive nature. Your choice as a content creator will go a long way in determining the fascination of your content. CapCut has therefore had you covered when it comes to adding fun features to your content to make it more interactive and exciting.

Text-to-speech (TTS) is a type of assistive technology that reads digital text aloud. It’s sometimes called “read aloud” technology. This technology has evolved to the point of being inculcated or introduced directly to some video editing applications without having to visit a separate text-to-speech application or software for support. This article therefore aims at discussing ten video makers that have inbuilt the text-to-speech feature.

Machine learning is used to match each scene with media files that are relevant to your content. The length of each scene is basically dependent on the amount of text to display, and the text position is intelligently placed according to the scene composition to make sure everything is in order.

After reviewing both versions (Android and iOS) of CapCut, we found that the app is indeed easy to use and includes a ton of attractive features designed for TikTok users. Would we recommend it to you? Yes, definitely, but with some caveats.

* Split function: This is similar to trimming where you have to separate the clip in order to define your desired part of the clip. Your clip can be further extended after splitting, so it’s just a process of simple trimming in editing.
* Video overlay: This feature helps you place a video on another video. Those who do this often are those who have reaction channels, online teachers and gamers. This feature helps the viewers to simultaneously comprehend explanations the main video content alongside the reaction or explanation.
* Speed control: This feature aids speed ramping. You can slow down your video and increase the speed just as you want. One thing to have in mind is when you plan to edit such a video, you have to shoot in a high resolution and high frame rate like 30-60fps so as to avoid the amateurish look.
* Reverse video: The reverse feature helps you to rewind your clip to create the effect you have pictured in your mind while shooting.
* Music library: CapCut comes with an impressive collection of royalty-free music and sound effects that can really make a huge difference to your videos. The tracks have a high quality and you can effortlessly insert them into your video to create the feel you desire.
* Filters: Choose from various filters to soften or sharpen your videos and make them more professional-looking. There are color-based and season-based filters, as well as a range of beautification tools to enhance video quality. Filters can also be used effectively if you have multiple clips that have color variations or different contrast and brightness levels. Since you can't edit most of these in CapCut, you can avoid having to use a desktop editor by choosing the right filters and applying them to all your clips to bring some uniformity.
* Effects: There’s a collection of effects you can select from to appeal to the visual cravings of your audience. This will add colour to your content as it makes your viewers involved in the video. These effects include split-screen, retro, comic, party, dreamy, and so on. These effects will make your video look fresh and professionally edited.
* Stickers and text: Stickers could be fun to use due to their expressive nature. Your choice as a content creator will go a long way in determining the fascination of your content. CapCut has therefore had you covered when it comes to adding fun features to your content to make it more interactive and exciting.

## Easy Guide to Overlay Videos in Premiere Pro

In order to make it simple to combine the shot's components into a sequence, video overlays are pieces of film that are often recorded in a dark studio. Using image overlays on a video production is fairly frequent. However, adding pictures to every video you export might be tiresome and time-consuming if you have several films to send. For instance, an overlay video in Premiere Pro might be preferred by you rather than a manual addition of the overlay media.

There is a quick and easy method to know how to overlay a video on a video in Premiere Pro and we’ve got it covered. However, depending on the kind of element, there may be some color blending that affects the components themselves. Overlays may be filmed on either a green screen or a blue screen. Snow components photographed against a green screen may have a green hue shift, necessitating further color grading before the footage might be used.

## Part 1\. How to Overlay Video in Premiere Pro

Videos sometimes need a splash of color to elevate them. With the built-in color effects in Adobe Premiere Pro, you can apply overlays to any video, whether you want to add a little drama to a clip or a splash of color to a social media post. We'll demonstrate how to overlay videos in this article. To liven up your intros, make your outros stand out, and spruce up your summer social media posts, add a gradient video overlay effect. Adobe Premiere Pro and gorgeous video clips are all you need.

**Steps to Overlay Video in Premiere Pro**

##### Step1Activate Premiere Pro

To build a new sequence, start a new project in Premiere, import your footage, then drag your clip onto the timeline. The clip's parameters will be reflected in the sequence.

![activitate premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/activitate-premiere-pro.jpg)

##### Step2Select Overlay Effect

Secondly, choose the Effects workspace (located near the top of your window). This will guarantee that the tools we need are accessible. Alternately, you may go to Window > Workspaces > Effects.

![select overlay effects pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/select-overlay-effects-pr.jpg)

##### Step3Create a layer of adjustments

Go to File > New > Adjustment Layer to begin. Make sure your Project panel is chosen if the option is not accessible. Your clip and sequence will show up in your Project panel with the adjustment layer. Add the timeline with the adjustment layer selected.

![create a layer adjustment pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/create-a-layer-adjustment-pr.jpg)

##### Step4Create the Video Overlay

Transitions, generators, audio effects, and video effects are all included under the Effects panel. We'll begin by selecting the 4-Color Gradient from the "Generate" folder, which contains generators for patterns and gradients, to produce the video overlay effect. Right-click on the adjustment layer in the timeline and drag the appropriate effect there.

![create the video overlay pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/create-the-video-overlay-pr.jpg)

##### Step5Change the Effect Control

In the Effect Controls panel, you may manage and adjust effects. You may change the default effect settings for each element in your timeline, such as size and opacity, under the Effect Controls panel along with any additional effects you've added. To access an item's effect controls, click on it in the timeline.

![change effects control pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/change-effects-control-pr.jpg)

By selecting the ‘Show all properties’ next to the adjustment layer in your timeline, you can get a before-and-after comparison. Increase the value by selecting "blend with original." To change the effect's strength, move this up and down.

##### Step6Save the Project

Try switching the linear mode to radial. You can make a color transition for circles by doing this. You will be able to highlight various things with color after this transition. The circle's starting point may be animated to follow a certain item in the scene.

![save the project pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/save-the-project-pr.jpg)

To the right of the Presets drop-down menu, choose the Auto Save button. Check the Save Effects Settings box when the Choose a Name dialog box appears. Future exports made with this preset will automatically take into account any Image Overlay settings you've configured.

## Part 2\. Premiere Pro Easy Alternative to Overlay Video \[[Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)\]

Any professional video editor may be interested in it since it offers the strength, complexity, and adaptability they need. Users need to be well-versed in a variety of editing techniques in order to use the tools properly.

## 3 In-Camera Transitions Tricks To Make Videos Like a Pro

You must have seen it in videos when a scene changes to another place or time. How is it possible? Video transitions are a post-production technique that connects two different shots together. And it makes the whole video goes smooth and fluent.

Hopping directly from one clip to the next looks pretty queer. It disturbs the whole dynamics and charm of the video. To avoid this, we use video transitions. This makes the video appear much smoother and more linked.

You may think it is not easy, but after reading this article, you will know how simple it is. All you need is a camera and a few skills. In this article, we will focus on different in-camera transitions and let you know how to edit in a powerful video editor [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

## Whip Your Camera

You may have noticed that when an object moves quickly, the camera creates a blurred image of the object. We call it motion blur. The idea with this transition is to cut and paste your shots together by whipping your camera at the end of your first shot and at the beginning of your second one. This effect depends on two aspects. The first is by the speedy motion of the object out of the frame, and the second is by the camera's movement.

**Here is a stepwise guide for you to try**

1. Plan your shots, where and in what direction you will make the whip.
2. Then take the first shot and whip the camera at the end of the shot in the direction the object is moving.
3. For the next shot, whip the camera into the action and complete the shot.
4. Import both shots in your editing tool and find the point of blur in both.
5. Cut and paste them to add a blurring effect to your video.

You can whip your camera in any direction you want. Make sure the movement is fast enough to create a motion blur.

The result would be a smooth transition from the first shot to the second, as in this clip:

## Fill The Frame

In this in-camera transition technique, you must fill the frame with an object or subject. Compose the shot with the main subject filling the frame from edge to edge. In this way, those who view the video immediately know what you want them to see.

Here is step-by-step guidance for this transition

1. Plan the two shots you are going to take.
2. Find a subject or an action that will fill the frame during recording.
3. In the first shot, please make the subject move toward the frame so that it fills the frame.
4. The second shot will take place at another time or place.
5. To record the second shot, cover the frame with an object and then reveal the shot.
6. Import both shots into [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).
7. Cut the two shots to the point where the frame is filled and paste these shots together.

## Match Cut

In a video, a match cut transitions from one shot to another. During this, the composition of the two shots is matched by action, subject, and subject matter. The goal is to make a visual match between two situations that don't have a direct link. Here are the steps to creating a match-cut transition in your videos.

1. Plan the shot you are going to take.
2. Record the action in the first shot, for example, clapping your hands.
3. Go to another place or scene to record the second shot.
4. Repeat the same action in the second shot.
5. Import both camera shots to [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).
6. Cut one shot to another when the action is at its peak.

This way, you can smoothly transition from one place or scene to another. There is a video attached below for a better understanding of the steps.
