## 2\. Best Green Screen Video Editor to Use

Even while OBS Studio is stable and has a large variety of capabilities and tools, it may be better suitable for game recording. A program that is more comprehensive and supports video editing and chroma keying tools. This program features an easy-to-use interface and a lot more functions. You may also download films and distribute them immediately on social media or email. It provides more than simply a live streaming green screen software tool like OBS Studio. This program is more of a professional-grade green screen recorder and video editor, for both Mac and Windows platforms. Here we propose Filmora. It is a strong and excellent green screen video producer and editor with a professional touch to the animation video creating quality. Studio-quality movement used to be something only large businesses could accomplish. Today, due to Filmora, they're easy, inexpensive, and enjoyable to produce.

Filmora features a well-designed user interface, a decent balance of control and would provide you high-quality output every time. It is better ideal for professional videographers and those who are online content creators due to its distinctive and professional appearing productions. It can handle all the contemporary video formats, including video editing and output for HD and 4K. It offers a broad selection of easy-to-use capabilities that may assist you to produce lesson films, editing action camera footage and building viral movies like those used on social networking websites, and more. If you have various shades of green, you may chroma key a source many times, each time specifying a distinct shade of green. Without any correction, merely putting on the Chroma Key filter will probably look quite horrible. But happily, there is a variety of options where you may fine-tune the chroma key removal. So, with Filmora, it is better appropriate for short films and it is giving you the most value for its pricing.

## Conclusion

The usage of chroma keying has been increasingly popular in recent years, with various uses of this video effect employed for live streaming. Chroma keying is used to erase the backdrop of a video clip which is then composited over another scene or picture. The most apparent usage of this technology is for weather broadcasts when the presenter is composited over the top of a weather radar picture. In more recent times we’re seeing video game broadcasters chroma keying themselves into their live feeds. There are various sites to explore for streaming backdrops. Most come as overlay packages with distinct themes. A good location to look is Filmora. Else, if you want to add a new backdrop to your broadcast, you may simply add a new picture source to your scene in OBS. So, check out what best fits you and opt for the one.
