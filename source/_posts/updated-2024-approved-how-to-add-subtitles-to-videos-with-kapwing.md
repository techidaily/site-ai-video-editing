### Can I publish videos to my VSCO profile or save them to my studio?

Videos you edit in VSCO can either be published to VSCO or saved to your Camera Roll/Gallery.

You must edit a video before exporting it by tapping "Next" in the top right corner of the screen to save it to your Camera Roll or Gallery.

Tap the + Import icon in your Studio, select the "Videos" section to find your video, and then tap "Post" in the bottom right corner to upload it to VSCO.

## Conclusion

VSCO was one of the first **video editing** applications to feature non-destructive editing. Now VSCO Video also has a companion iPad app that you can use to edit while you're on-the-go as well.

The app connects to your mobile device using the Adobe Creative Cloud and allows you to edit in real-time while simultaneously sharing your progress with friends and other members of the VSCO community.
