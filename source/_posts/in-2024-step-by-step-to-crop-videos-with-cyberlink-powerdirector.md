## Step by Step to Crop Videos with CyberLink PowerDirector

Video Editing is an art form dependent on various elements and factors that are part of your video; this means people, items, or objects in the background can often make or break the viewing experience.

Can you imagine having shot a scene with impeccable attention to detail, but a small uncontrollable action leaves a portion of an unwanted cable or equipment in the frame? Bummer, right? But luckily, due to the power of video editing software, it is not hard to deal with such problems.

A way to work with such clips is to use the crop function while editing, as it can help emphasize or detract attention from a particular part of any video project.

**Author's Note:** While filming, try to capture footage in the highest resolution allowed by the available camera hardware; this will give you more room to play with while using the crop function.

To preface, CyberLink PowerDirector is a free video editing tool capable of accomplishing this and providing a professional touch to your video projects. And like other competing software, the program not only allows you to crop into clips but also uses keyframes to modify aspects like panning and zoom. So to help you perform this action, in this article, we list the steps you will need for cropping into video clips with PowerDirector. As an added bonus, we have also included the method to perform the same actions in WonderShare Filmora.

**_Note:_** _We documented the steps in this guide with PowerDirector 365 and WonderShare Filmora X._

## How to Crop Videos with CyberLink PowerDirector?

The idea of cropping into clips has always been an easy action to perform; once you have PowerDirector 365 open, follow the steps listed below.

_If you do not already have CyberLink PowerDirector 365, download the software by visiting_ [_Cyberlink's official website_](https://www.cyberlink.com/products/powerdirector-video-editing-software/features%5Fen%5FIN.html)_._

**Step 1:** Create a new video project in Cyberlink PowerDirector 365 by choosing Full Mode.

![crop-video-in-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-in-powerdirector-1.jpeg)

**Note:** Full Mode in Cyberlink PowerDirector 365 provides access to a full-featured video editing tool, similar to Wondershare Filmora. The other available options cater to distinct video types.

**Step 2:** Import media onto the Timeline from the Media Library; in this guide, we have gone ahead and used the pre-existing stock footage.

![crop-video-in-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-in-powerdirector-2.jpeg)

**Step 3:** Now, click on the video file on the Timeline; this will activate the video toolbar giving you access to the various controls built into PowerDirector 365\. Hover over the tools open, following which you need to click on the Crop, Zoom, and Pan option.

![crop-video-in-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-in-powerdirector-3.jpeg)

**Step 4:** Pick either corner of the frame visible around the video and set the area you want the clip to focus upon; following this, click Save.

![crop-video-in-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-in-powerdirector-4.jpeg)

This action will crop the video clip according to your desired size.

**Tip**:

The activation of Keyframes while cropping will allow you to create an effect that slowly zooms into the footage. To do this, set Keyframe Point 1 at a specific time (say the fifth second) and at one zoom level (say zero) and create Keyframe Point 2 at another time (fifteenth second) and a different zoom level (say fifty). So, between the fifth second and fifteenth second, the zoom will steadily increase and raise emphasis on an object. You can also add an element of position to this action if you want the focus to be on something not in the center of the screen.

**Definition:** Keyframes while Video Editing is a software-based feature that allows you to set In and Out Points, giving clips between the two positions different properties that change as the playhead continues to move. These properties can be increased zoom, rotation, different colors, or even a gradual pan.

We recommend experimenting with this feature if you want to bring a more dynamic feeling to your video project.

## **An Easier Way to Crop Video with Wondershare Filmora**
