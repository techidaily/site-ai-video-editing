## OBS Green Screen Guide

OBS Studio is a free and open-source app for screen-casting and live streaming. Written in C/C++ and built with Qt, OBS Studio provides real-time capture, scene composition, recording, encoding, and broadcasting via the Real Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP).It can stream Videos to any RTMP supporting destination including YouTube, Twitch, Instagram and Facebook.

You only need one green screen software – OBS. The reason why OBS is the most recommended for streaming is because once you have set it up properly, you can do literally anything you can think of with the software (either with or without added plug-ins).

## Chroma Key Settings in OBS

Chroma keying has become incredibly popular nowadays. People use it not just for gaming, but also in Zoom conferences, live interviews, talk shows, etc. Although it may feel complicated at first glance, setting up Chroma Key in OBS Studio is actually incredibly easy.

Have a look at the simple steps you need to take to set up a green screen in OBS:

1. Make sure you have the following equipment prepared: a solid green background, webcam or video camera, lighting, and OBS Studio.
2. Download the latest stable version of OBS Studio from the [official website](https://obsproject.com/) and install the software. Open OBS and let the Auto-Configuration Wizard optimize the software’s settings based on your hardware.
3. Now you can add a video source.
4. Right-click on the video source you’ve created and select Filter.
5. Click the + button under the Effects Filters section and select Chroma Key.
6. Type in a name for this effect layer.
7. After you add a chroma key, OBS will automatically create and adjust the baseline settings for the filter. You can experiment with the sliders and settle when you are satisfied with the result.
8. Make sure you aren’t wearing any green or reflective material. You can double-check the performance on the preview screen.
9. If things are working smoothly, you are all set to start streaming with the green screen on.

Pro tip:

You can follow the instructions above and live stream to multiple platforms at once with Restream. Multistreaming to platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Twitch, and LinkedIn allows you to drastically increase the audience reach and grow your followers.

### How to make OBS green screen settings better

Using green screens for filmmaking isn't the most complicated or difficult thing in the world but it certainly has its pitfalls. If you ask any experienced filmmaker what to look out for when using a green screen, chances are they're going to mention lighting about a billion times and that's for good reason.

### Tips on How to make OBS green screen settings better

* Evenly light your green screen so you can get a good key.
* Watch out for light flares. Use some a matte box or your trusty paw to block out any unwanted light.
* When lighting, try to create as much separation between your subject and the green screen as you can.
* Shutter speed: Minimize motion blur by raising your shutter speed to 1/80 or 1/100
* Aperture: Setting your aperture to f4 or f5.6 will give you slightly more depth of field, which will blur and smooth out your green screen.
* Format: Set your camera to the best recording format it has.
* ISO: Try to avoid high ISOs.

A wedding is one of the exciting parts that will happen in your life. It’s not that easy to plan a wedding, there’s a lot to be consider like wedding dress, food, venue, videographer etc. Everyone wants the best for their wedding and this includes videos that will record and capture important aspects of the event for years to come.

It’s probably hard to fast-forward your imagination ahead to see what you’ll be like in a decade, but if you and your spouse have your own children, as they grow it can be very special to be able to share your special memories with them, while you can certainly describe the flower archway where you exchange vows and tell them about the wedding care adorned with fresh flowers, your words can’t compare to the joy you’ll feel when you can show all of this first hand through your wedding video.

In this article will talk about how much does wedding videographer cost, how important to have your wedding day covered by the professional videographer and tips on how to save money in planning a wedding, because in your wedding day you want every moment that happens on that day will be captured.

## How much a wedding videographer costs

Hiring a photographer for your wedding day is likely a given, but you might be wondering about the cost to hire a videographer and if it’s worth the extra expense.

Keep in mind that the average cost of a wedding videographer will largely depend on where you live, how many hours of coverage you want the videographer to capture, and how experienced the professional is. The longer they

’ve been in the business, the more likely the cost will increase.

It is recommended that you start with a standard package and customised it from there to make sure all your bases are covered. You can often get a better bargain this way.

Peak wedding season may also affect the cost some vendors, making coverage from June through December a bit pricier and harder to secure. The range can often run between $1000 and $1,500

Nationwide or as much as $12,500 for a luxury shoot that turns you into a celebrity wedding coverage.

![wedding coverage image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/wedding-coverage-image.jpg)

### What include in the packages

Videographers, like wedding photographers, will have a variety of wedding packages for you to choose from.

Here’s what you can expect to see in a basic package

* Three-to-five-minute highlight video
* A 20–30-minute full wedding video with wedding ceremony and speeches
* Two cinematographers
* An assistant to the videographer

### There are also extra. Some videographer offers extras such as

* **Drone footage**– Drones are popular, especially at destination weddings. They have the ability to film hundreds of feet in the air which also makes your wedding video more unique. The extra equipment needed for this can cost you anywhere from $1,000 to $3,000
* **Travel**– Just because you’re getting married in a far-off place doesn’t mean you can’t have your dream videographer. Just be prepared to pay for their travel. You will likely pay for their accommodations, meals, and travel
* **Extra edits**– Videographers spend hours editing your final wedding video, so if you request any additional edits, it’s likely going to cost you
* **Filming before and after the wedding**– Whether your wedding is a weekend long affair or you host a brunch for your friends and family the day of the wedding, filming these moments is going to be additional cost. Discuss plans with your videographer as soon as possible so they can check their availability and they can give you a total for a wedding budget
* **Tipping**– tips are always welcomed even if they’re not expected. Your videographer puts in a lot of time and effort into capturing the beauty of the day, so any gesture of your appreciation will be welcomed.

And know what additional time can cost as much as $200-$500 per half hour, which pays for the videographer’s and assistant time, time spent editing additional footage, and video cards.

These included highlights and wedding videos will be professionally edited and they will also be set to music and delivered to you either via USB or through an online platform.

Typical videography prices also depend on the package you choose during the wedding planning process. Of course, you’re paying for a certain number of hours of coverage on your wedding day, but the post production editing process is even more time consuming and costly. While most videographers will produce an edited wedding movie, some may offer multiple clips at different lengths, like a wedding trailer for social media and a longer cinematic feature. Others might also be willing to give you the raw footage for your own personal use. Be sure to read your contract before making any final decisions so you know exactly what to get after the wedding day.

This one might sound strange. But the most experienced wedding videographer’s typically charge more than the going market rate. Price is a good way to tell who is the longest standing wedding videographer in an area. As the adage goes...you get what you pay for

## Tips on saving money on wedding videographer

While you would need a professional videographer for your wedding and this does cost quite a penny, there are a few tips you could employ in saving on videography costs.

**Time**

As mentioned before, the more time the videographer spends at your event the more it would cost. Therefore, if you are looking to minimize the average cost of a wedding videographer, you could have him stay for only the most important aspects of the wedding. You could skip the pre-wedding prep part and also the last part of the reception. Because everyone now has mobile phone and can tag you what they captured on your social media. You can also use a hashtag where your friends can tag all of your wedding photo captured by them.

**No extras**

Such extras as cinematic effects, drone footage, personalised packaging and extra coppies of the finished product all add up in cost. Leaving extras out will go a long way uncutting costs.

**No editing**

Since post-production is the most time-consuming aspect, accepting the raw footage instead of an edited one would definitely cost less. You could choose to do the editing much later if desired.

You can also do your own editing, it’s also different from the feeling of editing your own wedding footage, because you can actually see the raw footage and personalised the editing.
