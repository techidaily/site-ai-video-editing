## Wedding Videography Checklist

### 1\. Get to know the couple

As a wedding videographer, it's important to get to know the couple you're working with. This will help you better capture the essence of their wedding day. Spend time talking to them, learn about their relationship, and find out what is important to them. By doing this, you'll be able to create a video that truly reflects who they are as a couple.

### 2\. Understand your videography style and skill level

Wedding videography can be done in a variety of styles, depending on your skill level and interests. Some videographers prefer to stay in the background and capture everything as it happens, while others like to get more involved, interviewing the couple and capturing special moments. It's important to understand what style you feel comfortable working in, and what the couple is looking for in a video.

If you're just starting out, it might be a good idea to stick to a more traditional style of videography. This will help you get the hang of things and build your skills before trying something more adventurous. However, if you have a lot of experience and are confident in your abilities, you may want to try something more creative. Be sure to discuss your ideas with the couple beforehand and make sure they're on board with what you want to do.

### 3\. Check with the venue to see where you can set up equipment

Check with the venue to see where you can set up equipment. Some venues may have restrictions on where you can set up your gear. If this is the case, be sure to work out a plan with the venue beforehand so that there are no surprises on the day of the wedding.

### 4\. Find out what equipment is needed

To be a successful wedding videographer, you'll need some basic equipment. This includes a good-quality video camera, tripod, microphone, and lighting. It's also a good idea to have some editing software on hand in case you need to do any post-production work. Be sure to discuss your needs with the couple ahead of time and make sure they're comfortable with what you plan on bringing along to the wedding.

### 5\. Get insurance for yourself and your gear

If you're going to be a wedding videographer, it's important to have insurance for yourself and your gear. This will help protect you in the event of an accident or damage to your equipment. There are a number of companies that offer insurance specifically for photographers and videographers, so be sure to shop around and find the best deal for you.

### 6\. Ask for a shot list from the couple in advance

This will help you know what specific shots they are hoping to get on their wedding day. Be sure to discuss the shot list with the couple and make sure you're both on the same page.

### 7\. Alert guests of their wedding video presence

Some couples may want to keep their wedding video a surprise, while others will want to let their guests know in advance that they'll be filmed. If the latter is the case, it's important to alert guests of your presence so that they're not caught off guard by the cameras. Be sure to discuss this with the couple beforehand and come up with a plan that everyone is comfortable with.

### 8\. Recruit an assistant videographer if you need one

If you're going to be filming the wedding by yourself, it's important to make sure you have all the necessary gear. However, if you're not comfortable doing this or feel like you might need some help, consider recruiting an assistant videographer. This person can help carry gear, set up equipment, and make sure everything is running smoothly on the day of the wedding.

### 9\. Have some backups on hand, just in case

Wedding videography is a big responsibility, and things can sometimes go wrong. Be sure to have some backups on hand, just in case. This includes extra batteries, memory cards, and cables. It's better to be safe than sorry, and having these backups will give you peace of mind knowing that you're prepared for anything.

### 10\. Arrive early to set up and test your equipment

This will help ensure that everything is working properly and that you're familiar with your surroundings. It's also a good idea to do a sound check to make sure the audio is coming through clearly. Be sure to allow yourself plenty of time to set up and test your equipment before the wedding begins.

### 11\. Capture both the big and small moments

While it's important to capture the big moments, such as the ceremony and speeches, don't forget about the smaller ones as well. These can often be just as special, if not more so. Be sure to keep your camera rolling throughout the entire event so that you don't miss a thing.

### 12\. Have fun

Wedding videography can be a lot of work, but it's also a lot of fun. Be sure to enjoy yourself and have a good time while you're working. This will come through in your final product and the couple will be sure to appreciate it.

## Don't Confuse Color Grading With Color Correction

The first way to fully appreciate color grading is by differentiating it from its closest term—color correction. Many people use both of them interchangeably, and that's wrong. Although color grading and color correction are post-production processes that enhance image colors, they perform different roles.

Here's how to differentiate color grading from color correction:

| Differentiating Factor          | Color Grading ;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Color Correction                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Definition                      | Color grading is a process that enhances an image's color by stylizing or giving it a cinematic appearance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Color correction is a process that adjusts color mistakes in an image by giving it a consistent appearance. This process balances colors by adjusting whites and blacks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Purpose                         | The primary aim of color grading an image is to evoke specific emotions in the viewers. Color grading leverages the emotional and psychological effects of colors to manipulate the viewers' moods. You can use color grading to give your images different tones or themes like fear, femininity, youthfulness, passion, anger, sadness, etc.                                                               | Unlike color grading, the color correction does very little in setting the tone or mood that an image carries. Instead, it corrects specific mistakes in the image to make it look as natural to the human eyes as possible. Generally, camera lenses and the human eyes view pictures differently. Color correction changes a photo's look to make it more appealing to humans than the camera. It makes black colors appear darker and adds more white to whites to create the desired effect. |
| Stage in the production process | Color grading typically comes after color correction in the post-production process. That's because the effects of color grading are more appealing on a color-corrected picture.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Color correction comes before color grading. This process does the major work of balancing colors and correcting errors.

| Example                         | One of the most obvious examples of color grading is in motion pictures. For example, Sci-Fi movies typically have a very saturated blue color. However, you will notice a little redder in romantic movies. Note that filmmakers can use different color grades in movies to draw attention to specific details or represent changes in the storyline. Color grading produces the same effects in pictures. | Color correction is most prominent in documentaries to make pictures and videos look more real to the human eye.

## Terms and Tools Used In Color Grading

These are the most common terminologies photo editors use when color grading an image:

#### ● Hue

Hue is the general name for describing pure color. That means it defines color without alluding to its brightness, vividness, etc. It describes a color's position in the color wheel.

#### ● Saturation

When a photo editor talks about saturation, they refer to the hue concentration that defines a specific color. Saturation describes color shades and focuses on how colorful they are. Examples of colors with zero saturation are white, black, and grey.

#### ● Luminance

Luminous describes how bright, well-lighted or dark a color is. Highlights, mids, and shadows can influence luminance.

![color grading photography - luminance](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/color-grading-photography-3.jpg)

#### ● Additive Color

Additive colors are non-primary colors. However, they typically result from mixing primary colors (blue, red, green).

#### ● Color Cast

Color cast means that the image's coloring doesn't look as natural as it should be. This usually happens when different light sources get mixed.

#### ● Temperature

Temperature defines how cool or warm a color is. Cool temperatures typically describe blues and purples, while orange and red represent the warmth.

#### ● White Balance

White balance helps to make your photos look more natural by correcting color cast issues. After using white balance, the result is that the whites in your pictures would look exactly like the human eye will perceive it. White balance adjusts your image's color cast to make them look warmer or cooler.

#### ● Brightness and Contrast

Brightness and contrast are essential in color grading and are among the most used photo editing tools. Different sliders control brightness and contrast during editing. It's important to note that your image's brightness will affect the contrast and vice-versa. That's why they usually appear together, even if they refer to different tools.

#### ● The Three-Way Color Corrector

Many photographers refer to the three-way corrector as the color correction's workhorse. That's because this tool adjusts hue, saturation, brightness, and contrast in a single interface. The three-way corrector performs the job of three tools in one interface. Using the three-way corrector ensures that you work faster than usual.

#### ● The Fast Color Corrector

The fast color corrector is like the three-way corrector. However, there are many limitations with the number of potential looks you can achieve with this tool. The fast color corrector primarily focuses on adjusting tint and saturation. Its major advantage over the three-way corrector is its user-friendliness and simplicity.

#### ● Curves

While using curves is pretty complicated, the tool offers impressive functionality that you can't refuse. Curves are very powerful and precise. Their main function is to overhaul or remove your image's brightness altogether to give it a distinctive look.

#### ● The Unsharp Mask and Sharpening Tools

With the unsharp mask and sharpening tools, you can give your picture's edges a sharp illusion by modifying the contrast. This is typically useful for images that you shoot in dark conditions.

Sharp pictures are always a lovely sight. However, these tools can't correct pictures taken out of focus. To get the best results from these tools. Then you can start moving them back till you get your desired sharpness.

The first step in color grading is deciding how warm or cool you want your image to look. Then, modify the white balance to suit your desired warmth or coolness.

● Step 2:  
After adjusting the white balance, the next step is to adjust saturation or hue.

● Step 3:  
The next step is to focus on the histogram. A histogram is a common feature in many photo editing software that informs you of your image's tonal values. The goal in this stage is to ensure equal color distribution. Keep adjusting your image till the colors are even.

● Step 4:  
Work on your highlights and shadows by modifying the green, red, and blue curves. Also, adjust your vibrancy setting for a good effect.

● Step 5:

## Don't Confuse Color Grading With Color Correction

The first way to fully appreciate color grading is by differentiating it from its closest term—color correction. Many people use both of them interchangeably, and that's wrong. Although color grading and color correction are post-production processes that enhance image colors, they perform different roles.

Here's how to differentiate color grading from color correction:

| Differentiating Factor          | Color Grading ;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Color Correction                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Definition                      | Color grading is a process that enhances an image's color by stylizing or giving it a cinematic appearance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Color correction is a process that adjusts color mistakes in an image by giving it a consistent appearance. This process balances colors by adjusting whites and blacks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Purpose                         | The primary aim of color grading an image is to evoke specific emotions in the viewers. Color grading leverages the emotional and psychological effects of colors to manipulate the viewers' moods. You can use color grading to give your images different tones or themes like fear, femininity, youthfulness, passion, anger, sadness, etc.                                                               | Unlike color grading, the color correction does very little in setting the tone or mood that an image carries. Instead, it corrects specific mistakes in the image to make it look as natural to the human eyes as possible. Generally, camera lenses and the human eyes view pictures differently. Color correction changes a photo's look to make it more appealing to humans than the camera. It makes black colors appear darker and adds more white to whites to create the desired effect. |
| Stage in the production process | Color grading typically comes after color correction in the post-production process. That's because the effects of color grading are more appealing on a color-corrected picture.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Color correction comes before color grading.

| Definition                      | Color grading is a process that enhances an image's color by stylizing or giving it a cinematic appearance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Color correction is a process that adjusts color mistakes in an image by giving it a consistent appearance. This process balances colors by adjusting whites and blacks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Purpose                         | The primary aim of color grading an image is to evoke specific emotions in the viewers. Color grading leverages the emotional and psychological effects of colors to manipulate the viewers' moods. You can use color grading to give your images different tones or themes like fear, femininity, youthfulness, passion, anger, sadness, etc.                                                               | Unlike color grading, the color correction does very little in setting the tone or mood that an image carries. Instead, it corrects specific mistakes in the image to make it look as natural to the human eyes as possible. Generally, camera lenses and the human eyes view pictures differently. Color correction changes a photo's look to make it more appealing to humans than the camera. It makes black colors appear darker and adds more white to whites to create the desired effect. |
| Stage in the production process | Color grading typically comes after color correction in the post-production process. That's because the effects of color grading are more appealing on a color-corrected picture.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Color correction comes before color grading. This process does the major work of balancing colors and correcting errors. Color grading only fine-tunes what color correction has done, giving it a professional finish.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Example                         | One of the most obvious examples of color grading is in motion pictures. For example, Sci-Fi movies typically have a very saturated blue color. However, you will notice a little redder in romantic movies. Note that filmmakers can use different color grades in movies to draw attention to specific details or represent changes in the storyline. Color grading produces the same effects in pictures. | Color correction is most prominent in documentaries to make pictures and videos look more real to the human eye. Other times, color corrections just adjust one color to merge the rest of the image or video.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

## Terms and Tools Used In Color Grading

These are the most common terminologies photo editors use when color grading an image:

#### ● Hue

Hue is the general name for describing pure color. That means it defines color without alluding to its brightness, vividness, etc. It describes a color's position in the color wheel.

#### ● Saturation

When a photo editor talks about saturation, they refer to the hue concentration that defines a specific color. Saturation describes color shades and focuses on how colorful they are. Examples of colors with zero saturation are white, black, and grey.

![color grading photography - saturation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/color-grading-photography-2.jpg)

#### ● Luminance

Luminous describes how bright, well-lighted or dark a color is. Highlights, mids, and shadows can influence luminance.

![color grading photography - luminance](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/color-grading-photography-3.jpg)

#### ● Additive Color

Additive colors are non-primary colors. However, they typically result from mixing primary colors (blue, red, green).

#### ● Color Cast

Color cast means that the image's coloring doesn't look as natural as it should be. This usually happens when different light sources get mixed.

#### ● Temperature

Temperature defines how cool or warm a color is. Cool temperatures typically describe blues and purples, while orange and red represent the warmth.

### The essential tools for color grading include

#### ● White Balance

White balance helps to make your photos look more natural by correcting color cast issues. After using white balance, the result is that the whites in your pictures would look exactly like the human eye will perceive it. White balance adjusts your image's color cast to make them look warmer or cooler.

#### ● Brightness and Contrast

Brightness and contrast are essential in color grading and are among the most used photo editing tools. Different sliders control brightness and contrast during editing. It's important to note that your image's brightness will affect the contrast and vice-versa. That's why they usually appear together, even if they refer to different tools.

#### ● The Three-Way Color Corrector

Many photographers refer to the three-way corrector as the color correction's workhorse. That's because this tool adjusts hue, saturation, brightness, and contrast in a single interface. The three-way corrector performs the job of three tools in one interface. Using the three-way corrector ensures that you work faster than usual.

#### ● The Fast Color Corrector

The fast color corrector is like the three-way corrector. However, there are many limitations with the number of potential looks you can achieve with this tool. The fast color corrector primarily focuses on adjusting tint and saturation. Its major advantage over the three-way corrector is its user-friendliness and simplicity.

#### ● Curves

While using curves is pretty complicated, the tool offers impressive functionality that you can't refuse. Curves are very powerful and precise. Their main function is to overhaul or remove your image's brightness altogether to give it a distinctive look.

#### ● The Unsharp Mask and Sharpening Tools

With the unsharp mask and sharpening tools, you can give your picture's edges a sharp illusion by modifying the contrast. This is typically useful for images that you shoot in dark conditions.

Sharp pictures are always a lovely sight. However, these tools can't correct pictures taken out of focus. To get the best results from these tools. Then you can start moving them back till you get your desired sharpness.

#### ● Color Match

As the make implies, color match tools modify a target picture's colors to fit the reference image. This is an automatic process and helps to save time.

## Common Steps To Color Grade a Photo

These are the essential stages for color grading your images:

● Step 1:  
The first step in color grading is deciding how warm or cool you want your image to look. Then, modify the white balance to suit your desired warmth or coolness.

● Step 2:  
After adjusting the white balance, the next step is to adjust saturation or hue.

● Step 3:  
The next step is to focus on the histogram. A histogram is a common feature in many photo editing software that informs you of your image's tonal values. The goal in this stage is to ensure equal color distribution. Keep adjusting your image till the colors are even.

● Step 4:  
Work on your highlights and shadows by modifying the green, red, and blue curves. Also, adjust your vibrancy setting for a good effect.

● Step 5:  
Explore split toning. Split toning is a process that involves adding colors to highlight and shadows independently. Learning how to split tone can make a difference in your photo editing.

## Tips For Color Grading Photography

The following best practices will enhance your color grading:

* About oversaturation or under-saturation. Your saturation should be just right to produce the perfect result. So, always be sure to pay maximum attention to this process. This tip is particularly useful when working with portraits.
* Remember that color grading doesn't fix a bad shot. So, be sure to improve your photography skills and take the best shots for excellent color grading results.
* Shoot your images in RAW. Doing this guarantees more control over your pictures' colors.
* Always experiment with different looks until you get your precise effect. Lightroom is one of the best color grading apps to use.
* Exercise maximum caution when manipulating backgrounds. Don't do too much, especially when you're taking an indoor shot. That's because manipulating indoor backgrounds too much can mismatch the foreground and background, making your portrait look weird.

## Don't Confuse Color Grading With Color Correction

The first way to fully appreciate color grading is by differentiating it from its closest term—color correction. Many people use both of them interchangeably, and that's wrong. Although color grading and color correction are post-production processes that enhance image colors, they perform different roles.
