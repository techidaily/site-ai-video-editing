Nothing is more satisfying than seeing the final cut of a video and realizing that everything we filmed is crystal clear, with vibrant colors and balanced light. Unfortunately, whether you are editing on your own or collaborating with a team, this can be difficult to achieve because color problems often occur. Unlike photo editors, where one photo can easily be fixed without affecting the rest of an album, video editing requires adjusting to fix one problem. We'll look at three different methods to correct color distortion in videos.

#### In this article

01 [What Is Color Distortion](#part1)

02 [How will Color Distortion Affect Your Videos?](#part2)

03 [Different Methods to Correct Color Distortion in Videos](#part3)

## What Is Color Distortion

Color distortion, also called chromatic aberration (CA), happens when the camera's lens cannot resolve the wavelengths of light that it is recording. It occurs due to dispersion, which is when the lens elements' refractive index varies with the light wavelength.

The refractive index of transparent materials often reduces with increasing wavelength. Because a lens' focal length depends on the index of refraction, this variation in refraction index affects focusing.

There are two types of CA: transverse (lateral) and axial (longitudinal). Axial aberration happens when different wavelengths of light focus at different distances from a lens (focus shift). Essentially, longitudinal aberration is often at long focal lengths.

On the other hand, transverse aberration happens when different wavelengths focus at different places in the focal plane due to the magnification or distortion of the lens varying with wavelength. Ideally, transverse aberration is often at short focal lengths.

The two types of CA have different characteristics, and they may occur together. Axial chromatic aberration occurs throughout an image, and you can reduce it by stopping down, hence increasing the depth of the field so that although the different wavelengths are focusing at different distances, they're still in acceptable focus.

When it comes to transverse chromatic aberration, it doesn't occur in the middle of the image, and it increases towards the edge. What's more? Stopping down does not affect it.

## How will Color Distortion Affect Your Videos?

Colour distortion displays itself as "fringes" of color on the boundaries separating bright and dark parts of the image in a video. Color distortion can also occur when adding effects to a video, such as the use of a green screen. By using the green screen to replace the real thing, the colors in the video can appear a little off.

## Different Methods to Correct Color Distortion in Videos

There are several methods to correct color distortion in your video. They include.

This timeline-based video editing software application allows you to import an entire folder, multiple files, or a single file. You can import video files using the Import command or the Media Browser.

### Step 2\. Head to Color Correction Effect

Once you have imported your video, place it on the timeline. Apply color correction effects to the video you placed in the Timeline. You can also select your video and drag and drop the effect you want to the Video Effects selection under the Effects Control Panel. Here are some of the color correction effects you can apply:

Brightness and Contrast Effect: With this effect, you can adjust the contrast and brightness of your video. Using this effect allows you to make adjustments to all pixel values in your video image at once — mid-tones, shadows, and highlights.

Color Balance Effect: This effect changes the amount of blue, green, and red in the shadow, highlights of an image, and mid-tones. Preserve Luminosity preserves the average brightness of your video image and changes the color. It maintains the tonal balance in your video image.

Nothing is more satisfying than seeing the final cut of a video and realizing that everything we filmed is crystal clear, with vibrant colors and balanced light. Unfortunately, whether you are editing on your own or collaborating with a team, this can be difficult to achieve because color problems often occur. Unlike photo editors, where one photo can easily be fixed without affecting the rest of an album, video editing requires adjusting to fix one problem. We'll look at three different methods to correct color distortion in videos.

## What Is Color Distortion

Color distortion, also called chromatic aberration (CA), happens when the camera's lens cannot resolve the wavelengths of light that it is recording. It occurs due to dispersion, which is when the lens elements' refractive index varies with the light wavelength.

The refractive index of transparent materials often reduces with increasing wavelength. Because a lens' focal length depends on the index of refraction, this variation in refraction index affects focusing.

There are two types of CA: transverse (lateral) and axial (longitudinal). Axial aberration happens when different wavelengths of light focus at different distances from a lens (focus shift). Essentially, longitudinal aberration is often at long focal lengths.

On the other hand, transverse aberration happens when different wavelengths focus at different places in the focal plane due to the magnification or distortion of the lens varying with wavelength. Ideally, transverse aberration is often at short focal lengths.

The two types of CA have different characteristics, and they may occur together. Axial chromatic aberration occurs throughout an image, and you can reduce it by stopping down, hence increasing the depth of the field so that although the different wavelengths are focusing at different distances, they're still in acceptable focus.

When it comes to transverse chromatic aberration, it doesn't occur in the middle of the image, and it increases towards the edge. What's more? Stopping down does not affect it.

## How will Color Distortion Affect Your Videos?

Colour distortion displays itself as "fringes" of color on the boundaries separating bright and dark parts of the image in a video. Color distortion can also occur when adding effects to a video, such as the use of a green screen. By using the green screen to replace the real thing, the colors in the video can appear a little off.

## Different Methods to Correct Color Distortion in Videos

There are several methods to correct color distortion in your video. They include.

With that in mind, let's look at how to correct color distortion in videos using Final Cut Pro.

### Step 1\. Open Your Video in Final Cut Pro

Click on the 'Window' tab at the top of your screen and select the video you'd like to edit from the drop-down menu.

### Step 2\. Switch to Color Effects Work Space

![how to correct color distortion with Final Cut Pro - switch to color effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/color-distortion-5.png)

Go to the Window panel and select the Workspaces option. Then, choose the Color & Effects option. Here, you can adjust a range of scopes, including the Luma Waveform, Vectorscope, and RGB Overlay.

### Step 3\. Correct the Color

Head to the color panel and click the drop-down menu next to No Corrections. Select Color Wheels, where you'll be able to control various parts of your video clips individually.

The Shadows wheel allows you to control the darker shades of your footage, Highlights controls the bright shades of your footage, and the Midtones wheel allows you to adjust the Luma channels in the middle of your video clip. The Master wheel allows you to adjust hue, saturation, and Luma channel (exposure).

In addition to the color wheels, you'll find more controls below that help you adjust the white balance.

### Step 4\. Save Your New Video File

After you've made these adjustments to your video, it's time to save and export the file. Click on the 'File' tab at the top of your screen and choose 'Export. Once you click 'Export,' you'll be saving the file to your hard drive. Once it's done, click 'Save.' The file will automatically be saved on your desktop.

## Conclusion

**●** If you are experiencing color distortion, you can use any of the three methods above to correct it. Filmora is one of the most popular video edit tools that people use to correct color distortion videos.
