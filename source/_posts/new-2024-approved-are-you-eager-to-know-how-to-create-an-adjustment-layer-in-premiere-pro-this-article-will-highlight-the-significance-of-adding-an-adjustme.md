## Part 3: Three Ways to Use Adjustment Layer in Premiere Pro

Do you want to use the **Premiere Pro adjustment layer** significantly? In this section, we will highlight three ways through which you can use the adjustment layer in Premiere Pro to edit your videos.

### 1\. Color Grading

Color grading in Premiere Pro can help you to adjust the balance and tone of your video. You can use the color grading effects and tools to set the exposure, brightness, saturation, and light according to your preference. It will also let you redefine the colors in your video efficiently. To use the adjustment layer for color grading, you can read the below instructions:

Step1 After uploading the video clip in Premiere Pro, create a new adjustment layer in the timeline. Drag and adjust it according to the duration of your video clip. Once done, go to the “Effects” tab and search for “FilmConvert Nitrate."

### 2\. Transition

To merge multiple video clips smoothly and efficiently, transitional effects can assist you. By adding a suitable transition effect, you can make your whole video look clean and cinematic. Moreover, you can use adjustment layers in Premiere Pro to add transition effects to your effect professionally. To do the transition effect, you can proceed to the following instructions:

Step1 First, drag and drop your video clips into the timeline. Once done, create the adjustment layer and apply it above the layers of video clips. Once done, search the “Offset” effect and apply it to the adjustment layer.

Step2 Now add the keyframe to the position where you want to start and end the transition effect. Afterward, right-click on the first keyframe and select "Temporal Interpolation." From there, choose "Ease Out." Repeat the same process with the last keyframe. Once done, add the “Directional blur” effect to the adjustment layer for a smoother look.

![select the ease-out option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/adjustment-layer-in-premiere-pro-7.jpg)

### 3\. Mask

By using masks in Premiere Pro, you can efficiently blur, highlight, or add an effect to a specific area of your video clip. With this tool, you can draw different mask shapes, such as ellipses, rectangles, etc. Thus, it’s a great way to edit any particular part of the video clip effortlessly. Here are the simple steps to add masks to the video clips using the adjustment layer:

Step1 Add the adjustment layer to the timeline and head to the “Effects” library to locate the “Crop” effect. Add this effect to the adjustment layer and then head to the Effects control.
