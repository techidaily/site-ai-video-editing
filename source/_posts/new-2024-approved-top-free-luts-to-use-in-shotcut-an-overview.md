## Part 1: How to Turn Videos Into Slow Motion on Windows for Free?

If you need to conduct some simple editing and effects on your films, there is no need to invest hundreds of dollars in a video editing software application. For example, you may use the Photos App pre-installed on Windows 10 machines to apply the slow-motion effect to your photographs.

**Step 1:** Right click the video and choose Open with Photos. If it has been recorded by an iPhone or Android device and stored up to OneDrive, it should appear in the Microsoft Photos app without any further effort. Just click it to preview the video.

**Step 2**: Go to the **Edit & Create** option on the right corner on the top, and then select **Add slo-mo** option.

**Step 3:** Using the slider, you can determine how slowly you want it to go. Microsoft has built-in support for "**Slow**" and "**Super-Slow**" performance levels. Drag the slide to the right end will trigger the super slow mode.

**Step 4:** Specifiy the part that you want to apply slow motion in the playback bar at the bottom, and then save the video that you have just [created with slow motion effects on Windows 10](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

The possibility exists that you are using an older version of Windows 10 on your computer if you do not see the option anywhere in the Photos app. You can also follow the steps above to create a slow motion video on Windows 11.

Browse Windows Update from the system menu and click on the appropriate button. When all of the updates have been installed, you will have the most recent version of the Photos app, which includes this functionality.

## Part 2: How to Convert Normal Video to Slow Motion for Free on Mac?

Slow-motion videos are among the most enjoyable parts of utilizing your iPhone for videography. Video may be recorded with a [frame rate](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) of 120 or 240 fps and then played back at a considerably slower rate than usual.

However, if you don't record video on your iPhone, making slow motion out of videos shot on other cameras or devices is more challenging. The good news is that iMovie for Mac can do this for you. We'll show you how in this guide.

Slow-motion films are easy to make [using iMovie on your Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Just follow the steps listed below.

**Step 1**: Click on the **Import Media** option in iMovie once launched on your Mac.

**Step 2:** Click on the blue **Import Selected** button once you've selected the video file in the file browser to slow it down.

**Step 3:** You may now open the movie in iMovie. Creating a **Project** is required at this stage. To do so, click on the Projects option.

**Step 4:** Once you've entered a name for your project, click the blue **OK** button.

**Step 5:** By dragging the movie onto your timeline, you may modify the video. Select the video by clicking on it and clicking on the **Speed** option to change its speed.

**Step 6**: The speed-editing interface will be shown here. Change **Normal to Slow** in the Speed drop-down menu.

**Step 7**: The duration of your movie will be increased by halves the pace at which it was initially recorded. The video may be slowed down even further by moving the **_speed slider_**.

**Step 8**: Go to the Menu Bar and choose **File > Share**. Select the file you want to share.

**Step 9**: Click the blue **Next** button once you've selected the properties you want for the file.

**Step 10:** Select a name for the file, store it, and then click the blue **Save** button to save it to your computer.

## Part 3: How to turn Normal Video to Slow Motion With VLC On Linux Computer?

The video speed may be controlled in two ways using VLC. Using shortcut keys or hotkeys is one method, while menus and buttons are another. Both methods are OK, but the shortcut option is the quickest and most efficient.

Speed up and speed down buttons appear on the upper right of the movie when you press them. Depending on how much you tweak it, the speed is represented as 1.50x or 0.80x. This option is available for those who like to use other shortcut keys.

**Step 1**: From the VLC menu bar, head over to the **Playback** for **Speed** and choose a speed option: _slower, slower (fine), normal, faster (fine), and faster_.

**Step 2**: Right-clicking is also possible to access these parameters from the Playback > Speed menu.

**Step 3:** The video's speed may be altered by selecting one of those options and then clicking the appropriate button.

If you are running VLC on Windows and Mac, you can check this article to find out the detailed information about [how to playback video in slow motion in VLC](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

**Step 1**: **Create A New Project** on the CapCut app's home screen. Browse and add the video you want to search for in slow-motion to the project.

**Step 2**: When you're ready to turn off the sound, go ahead and hit the **Mute clip audio** button first, so there will be no creep sound after applying the slow-motion effect.

![ mute video audio capcut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mute-video-audio-capcut.jpg)

**Step 3:** In case you just want to add a slo-mo effect to part of the video, you need to split the video accordingly. Split the portion of the video that will be slowed down by clicking on the **Split** button in the menu. And use the Split tool again to end the slow-motion effect to get a segment of the video.

**Step 4**: Tap the cut section of the video and then you will see the Speed option. Open the **Speed** menu by selecting it from the drop-down menu.

![ speed option in capcut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/capcut-speed-menu.jpg)

**Step** **5:** In CapCut, there are two methods to slow down a video, **Normal** and **Curve**, respectively. You may just choose the "**Normal**" option to make things easy. It is possible to reduce the video's frame rate by moving the speed slider to the left. You may, for example, make the pace 0.3 times slower. Apply a slow-motion effect by tapping the **Check** box.

![ change speed  in capcut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-video-speed-capcut-normal.jpg)
