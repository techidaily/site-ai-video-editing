/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Common/LUTs/Technical  
• You need to create these files if you have administrator access.  
/Users//Library/Application Support/Adobe/Common/LUTs/Creative  
/Users//Library/Application Support/Adobe/Common/LUTs/Technical
2. Copy your custom LUT files to each of the folders.
3. These will be available in your Lumetri Panel next time you launch Adobe Premiere Pro.

The process is the same for Windows Users. However, the target directories are different.

* For shared devices:  
C:\\ Program Files\\ Adobe\\Common\\LUTs\\Creative  
C:\\ Program Files\\ Adobe\\Common\\LUTs\\Creative
* You need to create these files if you have administrator access.  
C:\\Users\\yourusername\\AppData\\Roaming\\Adobe\\Common\\LUTs\\Creative  
C:\\Users\\yourusername\\AppData\\Roaming\\Adobe\\Common\\LUTs\\Technical

Adobe Premiere Pro accepts .look and .cube file types, allowing you more creative freedom. Additionally, you can save and export any custom premiere luts to use in other projects. The next section offers a step-by-step guide on how to do that.

Finally, Looks allow you to make quick adjustments to your videos using the presets available on the Lumetri Panel. You can access these from the Effects Panel. Furthermore, it also allows you to preview the result. The intensity of the look can vary depending on where the slider is on the effects panel.

## How to save and export your LUTS?

Most filmmakers prefer to save their premier luts for later use. Here is how to do it:

1. Follow the above process through to step 5.
2. Once you finish your editing, click on the Lumetri Pop Up menu and choose Save Preset.
3. Fill the respective fields with your custom information and click OK. The program will then save the clip to the location you specify.
4. You can save custom luts in the following ways:  
Scale only applies the new lut to the video. As such, all other luts you use are deleted. Therefore, if your video is one hour, your custom settings will run through the clip’s entire length.  
Anchor To In Point only saves the section of the clip where your custom settings are active. Additionally, the software will add all pre-existing luts to the section without scaling.
5. Additionally, you can repeat the process and export your LUTs in the following formats:  
.look exports the LUT as an Adobe Premiere Pro file to a location on your device.  
.cube saves the Lumetri preset you can use on other color grading software. For example, you can use your .cube custom lut with Filmora.

## How does Premiere Pro Classify LUTS?

A premiere pro lut can fall into two categories depending on its core function. These are:

#### • Looks

These are premiere luts you use to make changes to your video or photo’s appearance and color scheme. They are available as presets under the Lumetri Color Panel and offer quick fixes to your content.

#### • Input Lut

You use these premiere pro luts to interpret log footage. Additionally, they are the first step of your color correcting process and work best on DSLR footage. However, keep reading to discover how to use luts in Adobe Premiere Pro.

## How to use Luts in Adobe Premiere Pro?

Now that you are aware of how the program classifies the Luts, here is how you can correct your footage.

#### 1\. Get the latest version of the program

You can purchase and download the program from your region's Adobe Website. The program is available for both macOS and Windows. However, it is quite heavy on the system. According to reports, the below requirements are sufficient.

* You need a processer with 8 cores and clock speeds upwards of 3.2GHz.
* 16 GB of Ram is ideal for macOS. However, you do require upwards of 32GB if you are running Windows.
* Graphics cards from Nvidia and AMD are best if you also want to improve the program’s performance. You request one that can handle the Adobe Premiere Pro from your supplier.
* Furthermore, invest in a high-capacity storage device to save your projects since some outputs can be very large after color correction. The program allows you to render 4K files which are the largest.
* Finally, the above requirements are sufficient to run the following versions OF Adobe Premiere Pro:  
i. Adobe Premiere Pro 22.2  
ii. Adobe Premiere Pro 22.1.2  
iii. Adobe Premiere Pro 22.1.1

## Discover How to Download Mobile Phone Green Screen Videos and Pictures for Free. Elevate Your Content with HD Quality Green Screen Frames

The digital landscape is bustling with content creators showcasing their talent, brands promoting their products, and educators teaching various skills. Amidst all this digital hustle, have you ever stopped to wonder how some creators seamlessly integrate themselves into dreamy, otherworldly, or even fantastical backgrounds?

How does one moment show them standing in their living room, and the next, they’re strolling through the sandy beaches of the Maldives or floating in space?

The answer to these mesmerizing effects is the magic of green screens.

* [Part2: Free Websites to Download Mobile Phone Green Screen Videos and Pictures](#part2)

## Part1:What is Green Screen Footages and Application Scenarios

The concept of the green screen, or the green screen mobile frame, isn't new. Hollywood has used it for decades to transport actors to distant planets, into the heart of battles, or atop treacherous mountain peaks. The principle is simple: film your subject against a vibrant green backdrop, then use software to replace that green with any video or image you choose.

So, why green?

The color green is distinct, easily distinguishable, and not typically worn as a primary color in clothing. This makes it simpler for software to isolate and replace without accidentally morphing the subject into the new background. The result is a clean, nearly flawless integration of the subject with whatever setting or scene you can imagine.

But it’s not just about transporting subjects to new locations. A green screen mobile frame or video green screen frame allows for interactive presentations, imaginative storytelling, and even sophisticated effects, like adding dynamic weather elements or supernatural phenomena. It can turn a static, dull scene into something vibrant, interactive, and engaging.

**Application Scenarios:**

1. **Entertainment & Films:** This is the most obvious. From massive Hollywood productions to amateur short films, green screens create different worlds, enhance scenes with visual effects, or simply transport characters to diverse locations.
2. **Education:** Educators use green screens for virtual field trips or to create interactive lessons, making learning more dynamic and interesting.
3. **Gaming & Streaming:** Have you ever seen a game streamer with just their figure visible over the gameplay? That's a green screen at work.
4. **Digital Marketing:** Brands use it to produce compelling ads without the hefty cost of actual locations or sets.
5. **Social Media Content:** TikTokers, YouTubers, and Instagram influencers employ green screens to add a layer of creativity and uniqueness to their content, standing out in the ever-crowded space.

The magic of green screens is everywhere, bridging the gap between imagination and reality. With the rise of accessible technology and software, what was once restricted to big-budget studios is now at the fingertips of anyone with a camera, a green cloth, and a vision. And with the platforms we're about to delve into, sourcing green screen mobile frame HD content has never been easier. So, ready to jump into this world?

## Part2: Free Websites to Download Mobile Phone Green Screen Videos and Pictures

In today's digital age, the demand for high-quality visuals is at an all-time high. Green-screen videos and images can elevate your content, whether you're a budding YouTuber, a professional filmmaker, or someone trying to make a memorable Instagram story. Thankfully, there are numerous platforms where you can find green-screen mobile frame content; even better, they're free! Let’s dive deeper into these treasure troves:

### 01Adobe Stock

While Adobe Stock is renowned for its premium visuals, a lesser-known section offers complimentary content. Once in a while, you can find a beautiful green screen mobile frame HD ready for download. The content here is curated, ensuring that even the freebies maintain a high-quality standard. This makes it a great starting point for those new to the green screen world.

### 02iStock

Another heavyweight in the digital asset market, iStock occasionally surprises its users with free content. By rummaging through their vast library, you might come across a perfect video frame green screen for your next project. It’s a testament to their commitment to cater to all types of users, regardless of budget.

### 03Videezy

Videezy stands out for its user-friendly interface and many free green screen video frame options. Ranging from simple mobile frames to intricate animations, the platform has a rich variety. This makes Videezy a favorite for both novices and professionals. Its community-driven approach ensures a constant influx of fresh content.

### 04Pixabay

One can't discuss free visual content without mentioning Pixabay. This platform is a goldmine for both videos and images. Their collection of background green screen mobile frame assets is extensive. The community-driven nature means there's a diverse range of content, suitable for different cultural and thematic needs. Plus, the no-copyright angle ensures peace of mind.

### 05Pexels

Pexels mirrors Pixabay in many ways, offering various video green screen frame content. However, what sets Pexels apart is its emphasis on contemporary and trendy visuals. For those keen on staying ahead of the curve and ensuring their content resonates with younger audiences, Pexels is a go-to resource.

### 06Coverr

While it might not have the extensive library of the earlier mentions, Coverr compensates with uniqueness. Their green screen video frame content leans more towards the artistic side, making it ideal for projects that require a distinct touch. If you're after something that stands out and deviates from the norm, Coverr should be on your radar.

### 07Shutterstock

Typically, Shutterstock would be the last place to look for free content. Known for its premium offerings, the platform occasionally throws in some freebies. It's like a lucky draw. When you find a green screen frame video without the price tag, rest assured, it's a high-quality piece.

## Part3: Summary

The principle is simple: film your subject against a vibrant green backdrop, then use software to replace that green with any video or image you choose.

So, why green?

The color green is distinct, easily distinguishable, and not typically worn as a primary color in clothing. This makes it simpler for software to isolate and replace without accidentally morphing the subject into the new background. The result is a clean, nearly flawless integration of the subject with whatever setting or scene you can imagine.

But it’s not just about transporting subjects to new locations. A green screen mobile frame or video green screen frame allows for interactive presentations, imaginative storytelling, and even sophisticated effects, like adding dynamic weather elements or supernatural phenomena. It can turn a static, dull scene into something vibrant, interactive, and engaging.

**Application Scenarios:**

1. **Entertainment & Films:** This is the most obvious. From massive Hollywood productions to amateur short films, green screens create different worlds, enhance scenes with visual effects, or simply transport characters to diverse locations.
2. **Education:** Educators use green screens for virtual field trips or to create interactive lessons, making learning more dynamic and interesting.
3. **Gaming & Streaming:** Have you ever seen a game streamer with just their figure visible over the gameplay? That's a green screen at work.
4. **Digital Marketing:** Brands use it to produce compelling ads without the hefty cost of actual locations or sets.
5. **Social Media Content:** TikTokers, YouTubers, and Instagram influencers employ green screens to add a layer of creativity and uniqueness to their content, standing out in the ever-crowded space.

The magic of green screens is everywhere, bridging the gap between imagination and reality. With the rise of accessible technology and software, what was once restricted to big-budget studios is now at the fingertips of anyone with a camera, a green cloth, and a vision. And with the platforms we're about to delve into, sourcing green screen mobile frame HD content has never been easier. So, ready to jump into this world?

## Part2: Free Websites to Download Mobile Phone Green Screen Videos and Pictures

In today's digital age, the demand for high-quality visuals is at an all-time high. Green-screen videos and images can elevate your content, whether you're a budding YouTuber, a professional filmmaker, or someone trying to make a memorable Instagram story. Thankfully, there are numerous platforms where you can find green-screen mobile frame content; even better, they're free! Let’s dive deeper into these treasure troves:

### 01Adobe Stock

While Adobe Stock is renowned for its premium visuals, a lesser-known section offers complimentary content. Once in a while, you can find a beautiful green screen mobile frame HD ready for download. The content here is curated, ensuring that even the freebies maintain a high-quality standard. This makes it a great starting point for those new to the green screen world.

### 02iStock

Another heavyweight in the digital asset market, iStock occasionally surprises its users with free content. By rummaging through their vast library, you might come across a perfect video frame green screen for your next project. It’s a testament to their commitment to cater to all types of users, regardless of budget.

### 03Videezy

Videezy stands out for its user-friendly interface and many free green screen video frame options. Ranging from simple mobile frames to intricate animations, the platform has a rich variety. This makes Videezy a favorite for both novices and professionals. Its community-driven approach ensures a constant influx of fresh content.

### 04Pixabay

One can't discuss free visual content without mentioning Pixabay. This platform is a goldmine for both videos and images. Their collection of background green screen mobile frame assets is extensive. The community-driven nature means there's a diverse range of content, suitable for different cultural and thematic needs. Plus, the no-copyright angle ensures peace of mind.

### 05Pexels

Pexels mirrors Pixabay in many ways, offering various video green screen frame content. However, what sets Pexels apart is its emphasis on contemporary and trendy visuals. For those keen on staying ahead of the curve and ensuring their content resonates with younger audiences, Pexels is a go-to resource.

### 06Coverr

While it might not have the extensive library of the earlier mentions, Coverr compensates with uniqueness. Their green screen video frame content leans more towards the artistic side, making it ideal for projects that require a distinct touch. If you're after something that stands out and deviates from the norm, Coverr should be on your radar.

### 07Shutterstock

Typically, Shutterstock would be the last place to look for free content. Known for its premium offerings, the platform occasionally throws in some freebies. It's like a lucky draw. When you find a green screen frame video without the price tag, rest assured, it's a high-quality piece.

## Part3: Summary

So, there you have it. Green screens are the secret behind those cool videos where anything seems possible. And now, you can make those videos with all these resources too. Dive in, get creative, and have fun with it!
