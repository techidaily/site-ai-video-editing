01 [Is It Possible to Create a Transparent GIF From Video?](#Part 1)

02 [Can Parts of GIF Be Made Semi-Transparent?](#Part 2)

03 [6 Best Free Transparent GIF Maker Software](#Part 3)

## Part 1 Is It Possible to Create a Transparent GIF From Video?

GIFs are a complete infotainment package that keeps you imbibed with requisite information in a rather fun centered way. When it is about editing GIFs, you are free to experiment with limitless creativity. While making GIFs from videos is quite a common edit, something that gains attraction is, turning dull videos into classic, **transparent GIFs**.

Still wondering on this to be a possibility? Rest assured, because it is certainly a ‚ÄòYes‚Äô. You can very conveniently create a **transparent GIF** from your videos without a hustle. All you need to do is just a background shuffle. While you can do this with almost any GIF editing software available across the web, here‚Äôs how you can take up the process using the Egif video converter tool:

**Step 1: Convert a Video to GIF**

Using Egif, first of all convert a desired video into GIF. Take caution to manually remove backgrounds from all video frames and save the GIF using .gif or .png file extensions. Don‚Äôt use .jpg extension; else you will end up losing background transparency.

In case of a solid color GIF background, navigate to Egif‚Äôs ‚ÄòEffects Tool‚Äô and click on ‚ÄòReplace Color with Transparency‚Äô.

![Original GIF with White Background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/How-to-make-a-GIF-with-transparent-background-1.JPG)

**Step 2: Color Selection**

Make a desired color selection that you wish to replace with transparent pixels. Select ‚ÄòWhite‚Äô for a black and white GIF background. In case of color backgrounds, open any suitable picture editor (GIMP, MS Paint, etc.) and choose the hex color code using the ‚ÄòColor Picker‚Äô tool.

![Background Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/How-to-make-a-GIF-with-transparent-background-2.JPG)

![Processed GIF with Transparent Background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/How-to-make-a-GIF-with-transparent-background-3.JPG)

This tool however, has compatibility limitations and can replace only a restricted number of color backgrounds, which too should not match the color scheme of foreground objects that you wish to restore in your GIF. If you require partially transparent backgrounds within specific portions of complex animated creations, you can use the ‚ÄòGIF Maker‚Äô tool to selectively split and edit every clip frame, apply the transparency effect and finally merge all such clips together.

## Part 2 Can Parts of GIF Be Made Semi-Transparent?

No matter how much disappointing it appears, you can never introduce semi-transparent backgrounds in your GIFs. This is due to the fact that the GIF format has a limitation on pixel appearances. This basically means that you can only have completely opaque or completely transparent GIF backgrounds, strictly permitting nothing in between. Hence, it is a regret to conclude that you can literally never add anti-aliasing effects to your GIF backgrounds.

This may be a little disapproving though, but thanks to revolutions in technology, you can live up to the hope that creating semi-transparent GIFs would not be a forever tussle. You never know when the trick strikes IT engineers, and you may possibly be reading an article on interesting ways of creating semi-transparent GIFs in future!

All you need to do is just a background shuffle. While you can do this with almost any GIF editing software available across the web, here‚Äôs how you can take up the process using the Egif video converter tool:

**Step 1: Convert a Video to GIF**

Using Egif, first of all convert a desired video into GIF. Take caution to manually remove backgrounds from all video frames and save the GIF using .gif or .png file extensions. Don‚Äôt use .jpg extension; else you will end up losing background transparency.

![Original GIF with White Background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/How-to-make-a-GIF-with-transparent-background-1.JPG)

**Step 2: Color Selection**

Make a desired color selection that you wish to replace with transparent pixels. Select ‚ÄòWhite‚Äô for a black and white GIF background. In case of color backgrounds, open any suitable picture editor (GIMP, MS Paint, etc.) and choose the hex color code using the ‚ÄòColor Picker‚Äô tool.

03 [6 Best Free Transparent GIF Maker Software](#Part 3)

## Part 1 Is It Possible to Create a Transparent GIF From Video?

GIFs are a complete infotainment package that keeps you imbibed with requisite information in a rather fun centered way. When it is about editing GIFs, you are free to experiment with limitless creativity. While making GIFs from videos is quite a common edit, something that gains attraction is, turning dull videos into classic, **transparent GIFs**.

Still wondering on this to be a possibility? Rest assured, because it is certainly a ‚ÄòYes‚Äô. You can very conveniently create a **transparent GIF** from your videos without a hustle. All you need to do is just a background shuffle. While you can do this with almost any GIF editing software available across the web, here‚Äôs how you can take up the process using the Egif video converter tool:

**Step 1: Convert a Video to GIF**

Using Egif, first of all convert a desired video into GIF. Take caution to manually remove backgrounds from all video frames and save the GIF using .gif or .png file extensions. Don‚Äôt use .jpg extension; else you will end up losing background transparency.

In case of a solid color GIF background, navigate to Egif‚Äôs ‚ÄòEffects Tool‚Äô and click on ‚ÄòReplace Color with Transparency‚Äô.

![Original GIF with White Background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/How-to-make-a-GIF-with-transparent-background-1.JPG)

**Step 2: Color Selection**

Make a desired color selection that you wish to replace with transparent pixels. Select ‚ÄòWhite‚Äô for a black and white GIF background. In case of color backgrounds, open any suitable picture editor (GIMP, MS Paint, etc.) and choose the hex color code using the ‚ÄòColor Picker‚Äô tool.

![Background Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/How-to-make-a-GIF-with-transparent-background-2.JPG)

![Processed GIF with Transparent Background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/How-to-make-a-GIF-with-transparent-background-3.JPG)

This tool however, has compatibility limitations and can replace only a restricted number of color backgrounds, which too should not match the color scheme of foreground objects that you wish to restore in your GIF. If you require partially transparent backgrounds within specific portions of complex animated creations, you can use the ‚ÄòGIF Maker‚Äô tool to selectively split and edit every clip frame, apply the transparency effect and finally merge all such clips together.

## Part 2 Can Parts of GIF Be Made Semi-Transparent?

No matter how much disappointing it appears, you can never introduce semi-transparent backgrounds in your GIFs. This is due to the fact that the GIF format has a limitation on pixel appearances. This basically means that you can only have completely opaque or completely transparent GIF backgrounds, strictly permitting nothing in between. Hence, it is a regret to conclude that you can literally never add anti-aliasing effects to your GIF backgrounds.

This may be a little disapproving though, but thanks to revolutions in technology, you can live up to the hope that creating semi-transparent GIFs would not be a forever tussle. You never know when the trick strikes IT engineers, and you may possibly be reading an article on interesting ways of creating semi-transparent GIFs in future!

## Part 1 How to Match Paint Color Without a Sample

We will be discussing three methods in which you will get the perfect answer to the question of how can I **match my paint color** perfectly. So, let us jump right into the first method without further delay.

### 01**Method 1 Perfect Match Paint without a sample**

The following steps will help you attain **Perfect Match Paint** without the necessity of a sample.

**Step Clean the print area**

The first and the most essential step is to make the area where you will be painting clean and tidy. As time passes, fingerprints, marks, dust, and many other things accumulate and make the area dirty. And if you do not clean the same, then the paint you do on it becomes much darker, dull, and gives a shabby outlook.

Use a damp sponge, and if possible, it is better to use soap on the sponge. And most importantly, you will have to let the area dry out completely before you put it on to test the paint. Moreover, the new paint adheres much better than before when you clean the area.

![clean area](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-do-perfect-match-paint-100%25-the-easy-way-1.jpg)

**Step Scraping off**

The next step requires you to use a utility knife. And with that utility knife, you will have to scrap an inch or 2.5 cm of your wall paint. It is because, when you have a sample, you can easily bring that to the store for **paint matching near me**. Use a plastic bag to secure the sample price. It will prevent the paint of the sample to smudge or getting any marks or destruction.

And after you **find paint colors** that match the ones you need, try to dab a little of that paint on the sample. As a result, you will precisely know how perfectly the new shade of paint matches with the new one. It ensures optimum precision and can be the **best way to match paint**.

![scrapping off](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-do-perfect-match-paint-100%25-the-easy-way-2.jpg)

**Step Bring the object if possible**

The best way to maintain absolute precision in the match is by bringing an object to the store. You can also opt for a **car paint match near me**. If you bring the object with the color for matching, it ensures perfect matching and 10precision. Nowadays, the technology is highly advanced and will help you obtain the best paint match.

### 02**Method 2 Using a sample**

Since we have discussed the steps for matching paint without the sample, you must know how to match color with the help of samples. So, here are the steps for doing so.

**Step 1: Click a Picture of the original hue**

This step is necessary for better precision and matching the color as perfectly as possible. Clock a picture of the original color sample. The color in the photo might not be absolutely precise. But it can help to a large extent to match the color as perfectly as possible. You can easily take the sample to any renowned color matching store, like, **dupli color paint match** and have the perfect color matching done.

And it is better to not one picture or from just one angel. It will be best to take numerous snaps and that too, from different angles, sides and lighting conditions. It will help you get the original color shades in different angles, shades and lights, and it increases the possibility of matching the color as impeccably as possible.

**Step 2: Bring home more than one sample**

You will see numerous samples of paints that you feel will match the color you brought from your home as a sample of the original color. You might not be sure which sample perfectly matches the original sample color at that exact moment. However, if you find a sample that seems t match perfectly, you must not make your decision right at that moment. Because in the store, the lighting, angles, and many other factors play a hugely influential role in enhancing the shades of the sample colors.

So, the color you see in the store often does not remain the same in natural light settings; it might get a bit darker or lighter. So, it is always better to bring home those samples that you feel match the original shade of the sample you brought. This increases the possibility of being the most precise and impeccable in matching the colors.

![samples color match](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-do-perfect-match-paint-100%25-the-easy-way-3.jpg)

**Step 3: stick the sample and compare.**

This is the final step for matching the colors of paint with the help of a sample. After bringing home the samples that you found similar to the original sample, tape them to the wall. Take a sample at a time and use a tap to place them on the wall. You can also tape all the samples side by side, leaving enough gap between them.

It helps better compare and matches the sample's colors and the wall. A common thing that occurs is that in the daytime, you find one color matching perfectly, whereas, in the nighttime, some other sample color is matching perfectly. In such an instance, it is best to ask the store if they can give you the shade by mixing both the colors: the color that perfectly matched with the sample in the daytime and the color that perfectly matched with the sample in the time.

![taping samples](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-do-perfect-match-paint-100%25-the-easy-way-4.jpg)

**Step 4: Paint the samples on the wall**

It is an optional step, and you can opt for this step if you are not getting a hundred per cent confidence in choosing the correct color. Try to paint the colors of the samples that you are finding similar to the wall. Since the wall already has the original color, when you paint the sample colors on it, the sample colors clearly distinguish which samples match more impeccably with the actual color.

![matching color](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-do-perfect-match-paint-100%25-the-easy-way-5.jpeg)

### 03**Method 3 with the help of apps**

Since the technology has advanced in the most progressive way possible, you can easily match the paint colors through an application. So now, we will be listing down the steps that will help you match the paints with the help of mobile applications. The steps are given as follows.

**Step 1 Install the application**

You will find numerous mobile applications meant for matching paint colors. Opt for the ones you find the best and most efficient. Download it and install it on your phone.

![color matching app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-do-perfect-match-paint-100%25-the-easy-way-6.jpg)

**Step 2 Scan the shade**

![scanning shade in app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-do-perfect-match-paint-100%25-the-easy-way-7.jpg)

![paint sample](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-do-perfect-match-paint-100%25-the-easy-way-8.png)

So, it is always better to bring home those samples that you feel match the original shade of the sample you brought. This increases the possibility of being the most precise and impeccable in matching the colors.

**Step 3: stick the sample and compare.**

This is the final step for matching the colors of paint with the help of a sample. After bringing home the samples that you found similar to the original sample, tape them to the wall. Take a sample at a time and use a tap to place them on the wall. You can also tape all the samples side by side, leaving enough gap between them.

It helps better compare and matches the sample's colors and the wall. A common thing that occurs is that in the daytime, you find one color matching perfectly, whereas, in the nighttime, some other sample color is matching perfectly. In such an instance, it is best to ask the store if they can give you the shade by mixing both the colors: the color that perfectly matched with the sample in the daytime and the color that perfectly matched with the sample in the time.

Try to paint the colors of the samples that you are finding similar to the wall. Since the wall already has the original color, when you paint the sample colors on it, the sample colors clearly distinguish which samples match more impeccably with the actual color.
