Suppose you want to buy a pair of eyeglasses and don't know which pair would suit your look. Now you might wish to look at how your face would look on different frames. Here you can use AR and see which pair of glasses would fit you using AR. AR can be used to share and receive various kinds of tacit knowledge. Augmented Reality is often synonymously used for "Computed-mediated reality" and "Mixed- Reality."

Despite such an exceptional concept, many users raised questions about the privacy issues of this app. AR technology constantly needs to record the real environment, which involves real human beings. Recording their movement breaches their privacy which can cause legal trouble for the user. If the videos are recorded with consent, they will not harm anyone.

When someone looks through a VR, everything, including the object's environment, is virtual or an illusion. When AR is used, the object is virtual, but the environment is real.
