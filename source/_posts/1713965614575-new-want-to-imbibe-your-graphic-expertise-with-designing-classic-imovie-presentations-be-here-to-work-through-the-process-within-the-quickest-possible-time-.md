### 6\. Adding Transitions and Effects

**Filmora interface** is packed with many filters, overlays, and even transition effects. You can choose from different effects and filters by dragging and dropping to your layer. To apply a transition between two clips, simply place the transition effect between those clips. Additionally, you can change the opacity of the applied filters. Also, you can change the duration of your transition effects.
