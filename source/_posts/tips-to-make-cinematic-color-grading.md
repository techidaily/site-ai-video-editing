## Tips to Make Cinematic Color Grading

New modern color grading software allows you to do point-and-click color grading right in your browser. Color changes are as easy and intuitive as painting or sketching.

You can choose from many different look presets and movie emulations based on Hollywood movies plus real-time previews of your favorite LUTs with this software.

## Part 1\. What is Cinematic Color Grading?

The cinematic look is all the rage these days and aims to mimic images captured on real film rather than digitally created. To achieve this effect, film directors use various means from lighting to cinematic color gradation. The latter is a powerful tool for bringing a cool or warm tone to a video and providing smooth color transitions to fall on an image that doesn't look too real but feels emotional.

This kind of post-production processing, which produces beautiful results when used by color magicians, requires a deep understanding of colors and their effect on our psyche and even physiology. It's not enough to watch a color grading video and use a LUT to get where you want. You should at the very least have an understanding of:

* Color wheel
* Color quality
* Color harmony and discord
* Warm and cool colors
* Color context

## Part 2\. Tips to make cinematic color grading

Here are three helpful tips to create cinematic-looking images in DaVinci Resolve.

In my 10-year career as a colorist, I've worked on every type of content imaginable: short, long, commercial, educational, episodic—you name it. And while each of these formats requires its approach, the one constant that spans them all is the client's desire for a cinematic look.

Virtually all of us aspire to more cinematic color, but we often come up short—in part because the term itself has become too broad to effectively target. To focus on the goal, I like to think of "cinematic" as "an image whose key visual properties are consistent with those of printed film."

The print film was the primary medium through which we consumed cinematic images for the first century of filmmaking and is therefore at the very heart of cinematic aesthetics. In this video, I'll show you my top three secrets to achieving this aesthetic quickly and consistently in Davinci Resolve.

### Tips1: Create Color Density

The first secret to film color is to create color density. Another key aesthetic property of film images is that colors can be either highly saturated or highly luminescent but cannot be both.

We can mimic this visual characteristic by identifying strongly saturated colors in our image and using the Hue vs. Lum to reduce their brightness. This simple technique is especially effective on pure primary colors (red, green, and blue).

![create color density](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/cinematic-grading-1.jpg)

### Tips2: Separation Beats Saturation

The second secret to film color is prioritizing separation over saturation. When you feel like an image lacks overall color or pop, it's all too easy to reach for the saturation knob, but that's not a very cinematic solution.

Instead, try using split toning—pushing cool colors into shadows and warm colors into highlights—to increase tonal separation and add depth to an image. This characteristic is present in virtually every film print and is deeply evocative when applied correctly.

### Tips3: Strong Contrast is Your Friend

The third secret of film colors is a strong contrast. This is not always easy, as a higher contrast look inherently requires more precision with exposure placement. Too often we pump up some contrast, end up with an image that looks blown out or too crisp, and then immediately back away from editing.

However, if you stick with high contrast long enough to improve your exposure, you'll get a very different result and be well on your way to a more cinematic image.

## Part 3\. How to add color cinematic grading by using Filmora?

New modern color grading software allows you to do point-and-click color grading right in your browser. Color changes are as easy and intuitive as painting or sketching.

You can choose from many different look presets and movie emulations based on Hollywood movies plus real-time previews of your favorite LUTs with this software.

[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is an option if you want to easily change the colors of your projects. You may just double-click the media after dragging it onto the editing timeline to change the contrast, saturation, brightness, and hue.

##### Step1Add the media

![add the media](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/cinematic-grading-2.jpg)

![color panel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/cinematic-grading-3.jpg)

* Contrast: By adjusting this setting, you can control the brightness and color in different parts of the image.
* Saturation: This setting highlights the gray part of the video to a shade. You can adjust it to make the colors of the entire video image appear more saturated or more subdued.
* Brightness: You can change this setting to adjust the overall darkness and lightness of your project.
* Hue: Hue is generally the lightness of a color. Let's say that when red is saturated with white, it creates a shade of pink.
* 3D LUT: 3D lookup tables provide your media with Hollywood movie color sets like the 007 series, Batman, Harry Porter, etc.

Hover over the indicator to adjust the color correction settings. Then left click on it and move the slider. The corresponding value stabilizes after releasing the mouse button.

[Color correction](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) presets help your video achieve an enhanced **cinematic look**. Adjust gives you control over fine-tuning the colors in your shots. You can make various adjustments such as color temperature and exposure.

In the **“Effects > LUT”** tab, you'll see an extensive selection of preset color settings. These include Vignettes, Movie Looks Like Old Movies, and Cinematic 3D LUT effects such as Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, House of Cards, and Mission Impossible.

## 1\. What is an intro video?

A video intro is a brief introduction, typically lasting between 5 and 15 seconds, that introduces your video, YouTube channel, or brand. Video intros are becoming increasingly popular. It is often the first occasion on which a viewer will have the chance to interact with the content you produce.

Because of this, it has the power to attract attention from the very beginning and to develop trust in the company or product that you are promoting. It goes without saying that this is one of the most critical factors to consider when trying to attract and connect with your desired audience.

After Effects is utilized by professionals working in the film business to create aesthetically spectacular work for cinema, television, video, and the online. The most significant drawback to After Effects is the fact that it requires an average beginner around eight weeks to learn the program by watching training videos and going through tutorials. In addition, the fee to join Adobe's Creative Cloud Suite membership service is quite high.

### Canva

When you use Canva, you will have instant access to a video introduction creator that is hosted on the web. You get access to a number of different themes, as well as royalty-free photographs and videos, as well as a drag-and-drop editor that you can use to create content that you can then share and post everywhere.

![canva intro maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canva-poster.jpg)

However, some limitations to using Canva include the fact that it only supports a limited number of output formats and there is a possibility that you will experience connectivity troubles while attempting to save and export your video introductions.

When it came to design, I previously relied on a combination of Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, and PicMonkey until I discovered Canva. After some time, we were able to navigate both with ease, but we found that Canva was more difficult to use than PicMonkey. Canva had a steep learning curve and lacked some of the features I was looking for in a design program.

We choose to disregard it. But I decided to give it another shot about two or three years ago, and this time I was impressed enough to switch PicMonkey out for it in my collection of editing tools. Canva had added a large number of features that made the program simpler to use and gave users the ability to accomplish more.
