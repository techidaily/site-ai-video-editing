## A Guide To Motion Tracking Using The Best Video Editors

One of the powerful editing features offered by several premium-grade video editors is motion tracking. It not only boosts the overall video quality but also helps ensuring the object is engaged throughout the video. Many users fail to apply the motion tracking effect to the videos because they don’t use a reliable tool. The primary motive of this discussion is to provide you with the best-in-class motion tracker.

Not only will we tell you the name of the software, but we will also guide you through the procedure of doing this. Moreover, many of you don't know what motion tracking is. So, this article will also provide significant information about this.

## Part 1: What Is Motion Tracking in Video Editing?

[Motion tracking](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) helps you analyze the movements of different objects in your video content. This process involves various tasks that can be very helpful in video editing. For example, tracking and identifying the position of elements over time. The main purpose of motion tracking is to add graphics. Moreover, you can also add digital effects to the tracked objects.

You will need special software or video editing tools to perform this process. Here's how you can understand the motion tracking process with ease:

### Selection of Object

The editor can select the object that he wants to track in an effective manner. This object can be a person or any moving element that needs tracking. Moreover, it can also be a moving vehicle or a logo as well. Tracking these moving elements in the frame can allow the editor to improve the areas which have high contrast or distinct features.

### Tracking Points

Selecting the object allows the software to identify specific points in the frame. These points can have distinct features or a high contrast that may affect the video quality. With the help of **video motion tracking**, the editor can note down these areas and improve them to enhance the viewer experience.

### Data Mapping

Once the software tracks the movements, it can be very useful for the editor. This is because it calculates the changes in position and rotation of each point. Moreover, it also maps the tracked data into a visual representation for the coordinating system. Using this system, the movements of the objects can be recreated in a 3D space.

### Using Effects and Refinement

After obtaining the motion tracking data, the video editor can apply different effects on the object. These effects can include adding graphics and text to the scene. Moreover, it can also help in animation or compositing visual elements. To ensure the accurate alignment of the effects, the editor may need to use extra tracking techniques or manual adjustments.

**●** Make the video personal

Looping a video is a great way to make your content stand out from the competition.

You can use this feature on Canva to create an eye-catching looped video that you can use in your social media posts and ads. It is great if you need to use a video in your project, but don't have time to do the editing. In this article, we'll walk you through how to Loop a video on Canva.

* It helps attract new viewers because they'll feel compelled to watch the whole thing or at least take action after watching part of it (like clicking on a button).
* It increases retention rates because people will remember something much better than just a static image or text string because there's movement involved in each frame of the image.

## Part 2: Alternative Way to Loop a Video

If you're using a [video editing software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) like Adobe Premiere or Final Cut Pro, it is likely that you have seen the generic technique of looping a video is by splitting it in two and pasting it together again. What if you need to put on repeat just one individual cut? This is where [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) steps in! It is a handy tool for trimming and adding clips into your recordings.

The Filmora software can be used to quickly create continual sequences of any duration, irrespective of how long the footage is. It makes possible to synchronize sound and video clips, splice them into one another, and even add titles and motion graphics for a special effect. If you utilize Filmora, you do not need to be an expert in video editing to make professional-looking results. Let us explore why Filmora is necessary for video editing.

Filmora is a video editing software that allows you to make professional-looking videos from your footage. It has a loop feature that lets you create seamless loops where each clip in the sequence plays over and over until you stop it. This can be useful for creating music videos, for example, or for creating small clips that loop seamlessly through the whole video.

The loop feature in Filmora software is a great way to put your video editing skills to the test. It allows you to edit a clip of any length and then play it back over and over again, which can be useful when you're looking for an ideal looping point or want to see how long a clip is before going back to find out why it didn't work.

Let's have a look that how can we loop the video on Filmora:
