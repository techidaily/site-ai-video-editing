Launch it, then click the **New Project**. If you have files from your storage then select the **New Composition Footage.**

![crop-vidoe-in-ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-vidoe-in-ae-1.jpg)

Check if the video is already in the interface. Find the **Magnifying** tab and zoom out the video into 50%. After that, click the **Grid** icon and **Proportional Grid**.

If you’re done cutting then you should unclick the **Proportiona**l grid, and the video’s magnification should be 100%. Afterwards, you can check the pixel aspect ratio correction in the After Effects. You need to go through the video before saving your project. This is to avoid unnecessary errors that will make the process troublesome.

Already satisfied with the cropped video? Then, select **File,** **Export** and finally **Add to Render Queue.** Check on the **Render Settings** (located bottom of the interface) to ensure high quality output. Following that, hit the **Output To** part and decide the destination and folder where you want it to be.

![crop-vidoe-in-ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-vidoe-in-ae-4.jpg)

Watch your cropped video and go ahead and repeat this with your other videos. After practicing this process many times, this will come to you as easy. If you get lost while following the instructions go back to this guide until it becomes a part of your memory.

Congratulations on making your first cropped video using After Effects! What was your experience while following through the guide? I hope that the information presented here is easy to understand and implement.

## How to Add VHS Effects to Videos for Free 2024

2023 has ushered in a wave of nostalgia, sweeping across various domains, from fashion to technology. Amidst this, videos have become a powerful medium to relive the past. If you're aiming to infuse your videos with a touch of the '90s, look no further than the VHS effect.

For those who need a quick trip down memory lane, VHS tapes were once the cornerstone of home entertainment. These clunky plastic cassettes captured countless memories, from family gatherings to favorite films and TV shows.

Incorporating these imperfections into today's high-definition videos imparts a distinctive vintage flair. It's akin to applying an Instagram filter to a photo, where a simple touch can transport a viewer back in time. Dive in as we guide you on adding this retro charm to your free videos.

## Part 1 The Power of Emojis in Marketing

Emojis are one elusive means to express the feel behind a content that is being presented, regardless of the diversities in the platform and information aspects. While the common beliefs with respect these graphic uplifts are restricted within personal boundaries of fun and entertainment, the professional credibility of emojis is no less.

When the talk is about marketing and business strategies, the significance of these elements cannot be limited within the constraints of domain and time. Entering into the application varieties, you can work with emojis everywhere, from promotional advertisements to promote your brand, to devising strategic video presentations and slideshows to showcase your company utilities in front of a target audience.

Beginning our discussion towards the same, let us look through the different aspects and benefits of including emojis as a compliment to business marketing strategies in the following section:

**Merits of Using Emojis as a Marketing Tactic**

### 01Social Media Utility

Considering the fact that social media is turning into a content sharing hub, irrespective of information genres, the business marketing arena is obviously not left untouched. With the revolutionary expansion in the concept and credibility of digital marketing, social media platforms have become a significant space for product advertisement and brand promotion.

Speaking in the light of the above, the fact that emojis have long been a part of social media conversations is something that cannot be ignored. Using a combination of emojis and social media can thus, work to deliver a more effective presentation of your brands, products and company services, while keeping the audience captivated by making them connect with the feel of the utility they are viewing at.

### 02Making the Brand Come Alive

It is a known fact that a trusted brand name works to earn a hoard of loyal customers in the long run. Adding an emoji in your brand promotion strategies helps to establish a great deal of emotional connection of the same with your target audience, while making them relate to the regular inclusion of these graphic elements in their social media conversations.

Working towards adding emojis in your product or company presentations or ad campaigns caters to convey the product information in a unique style of its own by adding an extra bit of liveliness to your brand.

You should however, be cautious while using emojis to promote your brand, lest these may end up crowding the presentation snippet. It is a wise decision to use a single or couple of emojis at the end of a text based content, rather than stuffing the same with a series of emojis to avoid the distraction of audience.

Another way of making an impressive use of emojis in your promotional media posts is creating engaging feature lists of your brand, or adding the same to the product headlines, while giving them an extra impact. Such graphic creativity will surely put your brand ahead of the numerous counterparts on promotional business sites.

### 03Enhanced Viewer Engagement

It is a common practice to include emojis within personal chats and social media conversations to ensure an improved peer engagement, while uplifting the degree of fun and entertainment. The same concept can be applied to brand promotion strategies for bringing in an increased number of interested audiences.

Supplementing your promotional content with emojis helps the latter to gain a casual and informal presentation approach that suits the audience in a much better way. Speaking in the light of the current social media and digital market trends, emojis have managed to achieve a universal credibility that is far ahead of video and image centered promotional elements.

As a product or business marketer, you can work with these conveying graphic utilities to initiate thematic conversations with your viewers and potential customers. Care should however be taken to make an intelligent and smart usage of emojis, to ensure that the latter works to uplift and compliment your promotional strategies, lest you would end up distracting your audiences.

### 04Supplementing the Content With a Cohesive Context

When aiming at creating a brand awareness of your product or company via promotional messaging, emojis can help to convey an emotional exactness that a text based content often falls short of adhering to.

While using emojis alone can make the task a bit difficult, an intelligent combination of the latter with cohesive text elements can effectively cater towards delivering a top rated promotional output, while adding an extra bit of meaning and depth to the same.

When promoting your product across social media platforms that have a restriction on the maximum number of characters within a single post or message, using emojis can compensate for the text you would otherwise prefer to add. The additional benefit of this inclusion lies in supplementing your text with the missing emotional connect and feel that works to build an emphasis of your brand among the viewers.

Working towards adding emojis in your product or company presentations or ad campaigns caters to convey the product information in a unique style of its own by adding an extra bit of liveliness to your brand.

You should however, be cautious while using emojis to promote your brand, lest these may end up crowding the presentation snippet. It is a wise decision to use a single or couple of emojis at the end of a text based content, rather than stuffing the same with a series of emojis to avoid the distraction of audience.

Another way of making an impressive use of emojis in your promotional media posts is creating engaging feature lists of your brand, or adding the same to the product headlines, while giving them an extra impact. Such graphic creativity will surely put your brand ahead of the numerous counterparts on promotional business sites.

### 03Enhanced Viewer Engagement

When promoting your product across social media platforms that have a restriction on the maximum number of characters within a single post or message, using emojis can compensate for the text you would otherwise prefer to add.
