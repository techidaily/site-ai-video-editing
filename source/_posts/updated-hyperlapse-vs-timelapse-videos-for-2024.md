## Hyperlapse VS Timelapse Videos

You've probably heard the terms "hyperlapse" and "timelapse" before. Whether it was in a blog post, a how-to guide, or on your preferred social media platform. Each of us has seen at least one image of one of them. However, what makes a difference? You're about to learn in this article!

With that said, let's begin!

## Part 1\. What is a timelapse, and how is it used?

Timelapses are familiar to you, whether they were used in a series to demonstrate a swift change from night today or at the beginning of your favorite influencer's vlog. But exactly what is it? The term "timelapse" refers to a photography method in which static images are stitched together to produce a time-warping video. When the video is played, the time seems to pass more quickly, creating the illusion that time is slipping away.

Put your camera in a fixed position, stop it from moving, panning, or tilting, then record for a long time to make your own timelapse. This period of time could last for five minutes, an hour, days, or even years. Once the film is gathered, all that's left to do is speed everything up.

The fact that time-lapses make for a pleasant visual effect is what makes them so popular in Vlogs and other media. This method enables you to describe the passage of time, the movement of individuals through space, etc. utilizes time-lapse.

## Part 2\. What is a hyperlapse?

On the other side, there are these things that we refer to as hyperlapses. In the subgenre of time-lapse photography known as cinematography, a hyperlapse is a filmmaking method used to generate motion shots by capturing movies rather than taking images. In order to create a hyperlapse, the camera does not remain stationary; rather, it follows the subject around and is typically held by the photographer.

The amount of time that elapses between pictures in a stop-motion video typically ranges from tenths of a second up to a few fractions of a second, although this can change significantly depending on what you want to show. However, after you have picked it, it must remain consistent in the same way that the timelapse does.

The attractive 3D look that hyperlapse produces is the primary draw for its utilization. The hyperlapse that is formed can produce a dreamy image, regardless of whether the camera is attached to a moving vehicle or is mounted on a tripod that is moving towards its target.

Additionally, you may use this approach to make stunning photographs with motion blur by employing long exposures. In most cases, the final image will be stabilized in post-production in order to eliminate some of the flaws that may have been captured in the original photo.

![hyperlapse sky video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/hyperlapse-sky-video.jpg)

## Part 3\. What differentiates them from each other?

The movement of the camera is what differentiates these two approaches the most from one another. When capturing a time lapse, the camera is kept relatively still and in the same position throughout. In addition, when you use a hyperlapse, the camera is continuously moving, which creates a 3D appearance in the image.

You could be scratching your head right about now, wondering when you should employ one of the two methods. If your subject is moving, you should take a time-lapse photograph; if the camera is moving, you should take a hyperlapse photograph. This question has a relatively straightforward answer.

The act of recording video for a hyperlapse can cause your storage to be filled up really rapidly. Therefore, you may wish to swap between the two methods depending on the length of time that you want to shoot for. If you are going to be filming for a significant amount of time, you should consider using a timelapse.

It is simple to determine the timelapse interval if you already know these answers. Choose the video's final frame rate. It may be 24, 25, or 30 fps. You shouldn't select more quickly. Choose the option that best fits your audience and location. Additionally, a time-lapse calculator is available.

The shoot time should then be converted to seconds. For instance, two hours are equal to 2 x 60 x 60 seconds, or 7200 seconds. Determine how many frames are required for your chosen timelapse now. For instance, the final product should be 30 seconds of 25fps video. You'll need to capture 750 frames in total because 30 x 25 is 750.

Divide the time (7200s in this case) by the number of frames to obtain the interval (750). You can round up the result, which is 9.6, which is pretty near to 10 seconds. Therefore, in our case, your interval should be set to 10s.

## Part 4\. Motion control timelapse

Now that we understand how the timelapse images that are static are created, we are able to incorporate some movement into the shots that are static. Moving the camera around during a timelapse is much more difficult than it appears to be in the video. Every movement of the camera is slowed down when using slow motion, which means that you can make even a shaky handheld movie look good when using slow motion. The situation is completely reversed while viewing a timelapse.

Because every movement of the camera is sped up, shooting with the handheld mode is nearly impossible. If you want the camera to appear to be moving slowly in the final timelapse, you will need to move it very slowly while shooting in order to achieve this effect.

For this reason, we will need to make use of motion control devices in order to accomplish our goal. Therefore, we refer to these kinds of photos as motion control timelapses. The camera can be moved very slowly and accurately along one, two, or all three axes using motors that are controlled electronically. The three-axis systems, which include a slider as well as a pan-tilt head, are by far the most popular.

## Extra Info: Best Time Lapse Video Maker – Filmora

## Conclusion

The finest results can be achieved by utilizing a variety of filmmaking approaches concurrently. Therefore, you shouldn't be afraid to try out new things by combining time-lapse photography with slow motion and video. In addition, make sure you visit the Hyperlapse Academy so you can become familiar with all of the different approaches. Use your imagination, and don't stop firing.

## How to Create the Stranger Things Upside Down Effect

With stranger things season 4 ending, it seems like great timing to make a stranger things style transition to the Upside Down. In the Netflix series Stranger Things, there is an opposite version of our world called the Upside Down. The Upside Down is dark, creepy, and possibly filled with aliens, monsters, creatures, and other things.

Now, you can also apply the Stranger Things Upside Down Effect to your video! This effect combines camera tricks and video editing within [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to transition from the normal world into the Upside Down.

## How-to Guide

_**1) Preparation**_

To make this effect, you will need two footage shots: one with the camera moving down and one with the camera coming back up.

When shooting for the footage, follow the steps below:

**First shot**

1. Find any item close enough to the ground that we can block our frame with.

![block our frame with item](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-1.jpg)

1. Once you have your talent lined up, rotate your camera while lowering it below the foreground item at a constant speed and leaving the camera there. The key is making sure when you go behind the object, the frame is nothing but black.

![rotate your camera](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-2.gif)

For the next scene, have your actor change positions, or you can change the set around to look like the Upside Down. For instance, adding fake plants and flickering lights.

**Second shot**

Start bringing your camera back up at the same speed and rotate it again in the direction it was moving.

![start bringing your camera back up](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-3.gif)

_**2) Steps**_

After you have all the footage, you can start editing it on Filmora. If you haven't installed it yet, you can download Filmora at their official website at <https://filmora.wondershare.com>.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

Now, launch Filmora on your PC and follow the steps below:

Step1 Take your first clip in the “normal” world and drag it down to a video track on the timeline. Trim the edge of the clip, so it ends on pure black and in a downward motion.

![trim the edge of the clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-4.jpg)

Step2 Drag the second clip (in the Upside Down) onto the video track on the timeline after the first clip. Trim this video, so it begins in pure black and an upward motion.

![trim video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-5.jpg)

Cut the clips to get the timing right since it should be a very fast transition. You can cut in the black frames so they won't be too apparent.

If you don't have a perfectly smooth transition, you can add a dissolve by going to **Transitions > Basic > Dissolve**.

![cut the clips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-6.jpg)

**Color Grading and Effects**

After the transition, you can make the clip look a lot more like the Upside Down from the show with a color grade and Filmora effects. Follow the steps below:

Step1 Double-click on your second clip, then go to **Color > Advanced**. For a quick edit, you can try one of the presets available, such as “cool film.” It will give you the colder blue tones that Stranger Things used for the Upside Down.

![go to color](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-7.jpg)

Step2 You can further edit the color grading in the white balance menu. Drag the slider to the left to get a blue, cold vibe for the Upside Down.

The “cool” or “warm” color grading technically talks about color temperature. A “warmer” look will be more orange, and a “colder” look will be bluer. You can also use the tint slider to fine-tune the look.

![further edit the color grading](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-8.gif)

Step3 Next, move down to the color, lower the brightness and increase contrast. It makes the scene darker and more sinister than the normal world.

![move down to the color](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-9.jpg)

Step4 Finally, go down to the vignette and drag the amount slider a tiny bit to give a Vinnette around your clip.

![go down to the vignette](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-10.jpg)

_**3) Pro Tips**_

You can still make your clip look even more like Upside Down with some Filmora elements.

Go to **Elements > Smoke > Smokescreen 2**. Drag this element on top of your Upside Down clip and trim it, so it starts at the same time the clip leaves the black frame.

![drag this element on top of your upside down clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-11.jpg)

You can adjust the opacity by double-clicking the smoke effect to open the setting.

Finally, go to the **Transition > Basic > Dissolve** to the start of the smoke and adjust it when the smoke gradually appears.

![open the setting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-12.jpg)

## Resources from Filmostock

You can also use filmstock effects to bring our video to the next level. Go to **Elements > Fire > Large Scale 12** and drag it down on top of your clip and the smoke.

![go to elements](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-13.jpg)

Double-click the clip and change the scale of the effect to your needs. Then, go to compositing to change the blending mode to the screen to help the effect blend in more.

![change the scale of the effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-14.jpg)

Now, go to color and open the white balance menu. Drag the two sliders to change the color of the particles to match your clip.
