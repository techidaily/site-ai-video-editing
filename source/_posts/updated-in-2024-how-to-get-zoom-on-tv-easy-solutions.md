## Part 1: Get Zoom on TV with HDMI Cable

Although Zoom provides companies and bigger organizations with a professional solution like Zoom Rooms, if you're at home, you don't need to put anything on your TV to use Zoom. You may start using Zoom right away by simply connecting your Zoom device to your TV. Connect your TV to your laptop's HDMI port if it has one. Simple as that, however if the laptop doesn't figure it out on its own you may need to explain what is going on with the second display. Although more reliable, connecting via cable means your source device is linked to the TV and you can't go for a stroll. It also means you don't have to worry about the wireless connection fading.

### Steps to Get Zoom on TV with HDMI

##### Step1Connect the HDMI End to the TV and the Other End to Your Device

You may use this in its place if you don't have an HDMI but do have a USB-C port. To connect to the HDMI cable coming into your TV, you'll need a dongle, but you'll need to make sure it's compatible.
