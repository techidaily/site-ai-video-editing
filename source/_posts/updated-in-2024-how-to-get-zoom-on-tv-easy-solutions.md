## Part 1: Get Zoom on TV with HDMI Cable

Although Zoom provides companies and bigger organizations with a professional solution like Zoom Rooms, if you're at home, you don't need to put anything on your TV to use Zoom. You may start using Zoom right away by simply connecting your Zoom device to your TV. Connect your TV to your laptop's HDMI port if it has one. Simple as that, however if the laptop doesn't figure it out on its own you may need to explain what is going on with the second display. Although more reliable, connecting via cable means your source device is linked to the TV and you can't go for a stroll. It also means you don't have to worry about the wireless connection fading.

### Steps to Get Zoom on TV with HDMI

##### Step1Connect the HDMI End to the TV and the Other End to Your Device

You may use this in its place if you don't have an HDMI but do have a USB-C port. To connect to the HDMI cable coming into your TV, you'll need a dongle, but you'll need to make sure it's compatible.

##### Step2Turn On your TV

Turn on your TV, then switch the video source to the HDMI port you just connected in your device to using the TV remote.

##### Step3Launch Zoom Meeting

Start or join a meeting by using the Zoom app on your smartphone (available for Android, iOS, Windows, and macOS).

## Part 2: Use AirPlay to Connect Zoom to TV

Using AirPlay mirroring, MacOS or iOS devices may share content with Zoom rooms. On MacOS and iOS, Airplay is used to communicate between the Zoom client and the Zoom room. There may be a great potential for your own business requirements if you can figure out how to utilize Airplay to Zoom mirror your screen to your Apple TV. By default, AirPlay sends audio to the Apple TV. Depending on how loud your speakers are set to play and where your input device's microphone is located, this may cause echoing and ever-louder feedback loops. Without further ado, let's look at some of the important strategies you may use to maximize live screen streaming on your Apple TV device.

### Steps to Use AirPlay to Connect Zoom to TV

Step1Navigate to the Airplay Display in the Apple menu's top right corner. Choose your Apple TV from the list of AirPlay Display options in the Displays preference pane. The "Show mirroring option in the menu bar when available" checkbox makes it easier to reach the AirPlay menu.
