### Adobe After Effect

![edit-gopro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-gopro-37.jpg)

**Supported System:** Windows and Mac

This GoPro editor is compatible with Mac and offers many basic video editing features to ensure top-notch results. This GoPro editor is great for editors who want to add special effects like motion tracking to their videos. The after-effect function allows you to add a graphical element to a moving person, animal, car, or camera. You can also create cartoon effects, logos, stickers, or text to move seamlessly with the action onscreen.

In addition to its essential editing tools, you can also remove elements from your video with the pro-level digital rotoscoping tools. You can also use the after-effect to add elements to the missing video. Other features include 360, 3D, VR editing, transitions, lens distortions, and distortion effects for professional editing.

This GoPro video editor is an effective software and is best for adding visual effects to action camera videos. However, it lacks some essential video editing tools that you might need to make your video Hollywood standard. In addition, it also has a steep learning curve which makes it not ideal for beginners. Furthermore, as a GoPro video editor looking to do just the basic edits, then the After Effects is definitely not for you.

### Pros

* It comes with realistic special effects
* It has a high-quality noise reduction

### Cons

* It is not for beginners due to the steep learning curve
* It comes with only a 7-day free trial
* It is quite expensive

### Steps to Edit using Adobe After Effects

* Step 1: Import your video by going to ‘file’ on the menu and clicking ‘import’ from the dropdown menu.

![edit-gopro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-gopro-38.jpg)

* You can begin by cutting out any unnecessary parts from the video. You can also add text transitions, text, and other edits.

![edit-gopro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-gopro-39.jpg)

* Step 2: Next, you can apply necessary editing such as trimming, transitioning, and other edits.

### Final Cut Pro

![edit-gopro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-gopro-42.jpg)

**Supported System:** Mac only

The Final Cut Pro is another best-paid GoPro video editor for editing GoPro videos on Mac. This video editor is ideal for editing 360 GoPro videos. This is because it offers all the editing tools you need to edit, import, and deliver both stereoscopic and monoscopic 360 videos. The GoPro video editors come with a lot of powerful features such as background noise removal, Multicam editing, color adjustment tools, and an object tracker.

You can use the GoPro video editor to visualize, remove camera rigs, change orientation, or straighten the horizon. Final Cut Pro can also easily apply graphics and effects to 360 videos and add 360 videos to regular videos with the tiny planet effect. With electronic stabilization, you can clean up your video and enhance your audience’s viewing experience. The magnetic timeline feature eliminates clip collisions and streamlines the video editing process.

Although the GoPro video editor has some notable GoPro features, it is expensive to purchase. However, it has a generous 90-day free trial to explore. It is also not beginner-friendly and requires time to learn, especially for new GoPro editors to understand. In addition, it supports several Video formats.

### Pros

* It has convenient asset management functions
* Precision editing is sure with the magnetic timeline function

### Cons

* It is expensive
* It is not ideal for GoPro beginners

### Steps to Edit using Final Cut Pro

## Which should I Choose: Free or Paid GoPro Video Editor?

Many of these GoPro video editors for Mac (free and paid) are available on the internet. Therefore, it can be hard sometimes to choose the right GoPro video editor for Mac. However, you’ll need to consider factors before making your choice. Here are some of these factors.

**Level of Expertise**

This is a vital factor you should put into consideration before choosing a GoPro video editor. As a beginner, you wouldn’t need a GoPro editor that offers complex editing functions that you can’t use. Also, as a professional, you shouldn’t go for an editor that lacks the necessary editing tools to meet your editing needs. As an editor, you should totally be on the lookout for an editor that supports both beginners and professionals. This will remove the need to search for a new video editor at any experience level.

**Interface**

**A**nother factor to consider is the user interface of your chosen video editor. When you go for a more friendly user interface, you will be saving yourself the time to get familiar with the software. Is the video editor free or paid? Regardless of the answer, check out the user interface before choosing one.

**Formats**

You also need to ensure that the editing software doesn’t limit you to specific video formats. You should go for a GoPro video editor that supports the common and trendy video formats. This will allow you to convert your edited videos when you need to share them.

Now, most free GoPro video editors offer just limited features to users, limiting your editing course. Furthermore, most paid GoPro video editors focus on a professional level, making it difficult for new editors to use. Therefore, you should totally opt for a GoPro video editor that succinctly supports all your editing needs.
