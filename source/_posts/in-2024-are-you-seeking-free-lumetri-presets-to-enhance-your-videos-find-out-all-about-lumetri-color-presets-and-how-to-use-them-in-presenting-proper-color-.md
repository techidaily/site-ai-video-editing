## Part 3\. iMovie Alternative to add filters on Computer

There are several reasons iMovie filters may not always serve your purpose. For example, there is no way on how to add face filters on iMovie. The collection of filters is rather limited. If you are not satisfied with the filters available on iMovie, there are several iMovie alternatives available. We recommend [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) due to its vast collection of filters of all categories to enhance your video to the next level. Here are steps on how to add filters to your video using Filmora on your computer.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

Step1 Download and install [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and it is available for Mac as well as Windows users. Open Filmora and click New Project.

Step2 Drag and drop video clips under Project Media folder. Thereafter, drag and drop video clips to Timeline.

![drag and drop video clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/create-new-project-02.png)

Step3 Go to Effects from the top panel and click on Filters from the left panel. You will see all the different categories of filters.

![click on filters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/filters-filmora-win.jpg)

Step4 Select any filter and drag and drop it on Timeline. You can stretch the duration of the filter as per your requirements.

You can also check Overlay> Utility option from the left panel to add face filters to your video in the same manner. If you want to save the modified video, click on Export button.

## Conclusion

If you are an iPhone user or a Mac user, you can add filters to your video using iMovie app. You have to install iMovie app on your iPhone, but iMovie comes pre-installed on Mac. But there are limited filters available on iMovie and there is a lack of face filters which are trending in today’s viral videos. That is why we recommend [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) where there is a wide range of filters available to apply to your video conveniently as per your requirements.
