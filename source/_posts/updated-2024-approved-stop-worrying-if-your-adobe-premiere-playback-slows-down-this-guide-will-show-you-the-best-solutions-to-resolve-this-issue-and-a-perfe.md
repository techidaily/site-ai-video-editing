## Part 2: Fixing the Premiere Pro Slow Playback Issue \[100% Effective Solutions\]

If your Premiere Pro is not smoothly playing the videos, this section is for you. Firstly, you should confirm that your playback is lagging or slowing down. To do so, analyze whether your playhead is making small jumps or playing smoothly. There are plenty of things that you can do to reduce or minimize the **Premiere playback slow**.

### Solution 1: Disable High-Quality Playback

Adobe Premiere Pro enables a High-Quality playback option by default. It helps in watching videos clearly but causes trouble. Thus, turning it off can fix the playback lagging.

To do so, open the Premiere Pro and go to the “Preferences” menu. From the list, select “Media Cache.” Now browse to select the media and tap on the “Delete Unused” next to the “Delete Unused Media Cache Files.

### Solution 4: Close Unnecessary Applications

Sometimes, lagging in playback occurs when you work on multiple applications. The system gets burdened and might slow down every process at that time.

### Solution 6: Change Playback Resolution

Due to the higher resolution of videos, playback lagging occurs. It has a quick solution: changing the playback resolution to a lower rate. For this purpose, go to "Settings" at the top right and choose the “Dynamic Quality” option. Select a lower resolution, like 1:2 or lower.

Proxy videos are proxy files that are compressed versions of original projects. They help users edit heavy and lengthy videos with any **Premiere Playback slow**. In your project panel, select your video and right-click on it. From the list, choose “Proxy” and explore “Create Proxies.”

Now, pick the "Codec" option from another window and tap "QuickTime." Specify a location for proxies and try to keep them in a new folder with the original media. Lastly, click "OK," and Adobe Media Encoder will instantly produce video proxies.
