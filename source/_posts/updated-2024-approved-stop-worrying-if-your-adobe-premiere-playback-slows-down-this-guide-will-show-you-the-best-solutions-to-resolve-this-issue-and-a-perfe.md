In Premiere Pro, the Media cache is a temporary storage space that keeps copies of files. It allows you to access the files faster and cause a good playback. If these media caches use hefty hard disk space, then to enhance playback performance.

To do so, open the Premiere Pro and go to the “Preferences” menu. From the list, select “Media Cache.” Now browse to select the media and tap on the “Delete Unused” next to the “Delete Unused Media Cache Files. After choosing the option to delete cache files, click on “OK and the files will be removed.

### Solution 4: Close Unnecessary Applications

Sometimes, lagging in playback occurs when you work on multiple applications. The system gets burdened and might slow down every process at that time. For a quick and effective solution, you should close the other tabs immediately. Only Adobe Premiere Pro and your file manager can remain open for continuous playback.

![close unnecessary applications, slow playback](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/resolve-premiere-pro-slow-playback-issue-4.jpg)

### Solution 5: Turn on GPU Acceleration

There is another fix you can try to overcome **Premiere Pro playback slow**. Without any delay, ensure that the Render is set to GPU Acceleration. Simply go to the “File” option at the top toolbar and click on the “Project Settings.” Then, pick “General” and set it to “Mercury Playback Engine GPU Acceleration.” This option is under the Playback Section and Video Render.

### Solution 6: Change Playback Resolution

Due to the higher resolution of videos, playback lagging occurs. It has a quick solution: changing the playback resolution to a lower rate. For this purpose, go to "Settings" at the top right and choose the “Dynamic Quality” option. Select a lower resolution, like 1:2 or lower. You should look for options that can reduce resolution from the original resolution of the clip.

Now, pick the "Codec" option from another window and tap "QuickTime." Specify a location for proxies and try to keep them in a new folder with the original media. Lastly, click "OK," and Adobe Media Encoder will instantly produce video proxies.
