### 04**Kapwing**

Step 1: Upload and edit your video with Kapwing.

Choose to "Get Started," upload a file from your device, or paste a video link from a third-party site like YouTube, Vimeo, or TikTok. In any case, you'll be whisked away to your very own video editing studio.

![Upload and edit](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/freeze-frame-video-editing-skills-10.jpg)

Step 2: Give your video a freeze-frame effect.

Select the "Timing" tab in the right navigation bar and click "Freeze Frame" after uploading your video to Kapwing.

In Kapwing, you may add a freeze-frame to a video.

As you can see, clicking "Freeze Frame" instantly creates an image layer for the frame your timeline slider was on. Click on the image layer and choose from the "Duration" dropdown option under the "Edit" tab in the right navigation bar to change the length of the freeze-frame. Alternatively, you may drag the image layer onto your timeline by clicking and dragging it.

That's all there is to it!

### 05**Animotica**

Step 1: Creating a New Project

To begin, open your video editor and select Create a New Project. Choose Empty Project, give your project a name, and click the Create a New Project button.

Step 2: Selecting the Video to Freeze

Select Add Video/Photo Clips from the drop-down menu.

You can add video clips to Animotica by navigating to where you saved your video clip, selecting it, and opening it. You'll now return to the project window, where your video will display. You can enable a wide range of enhancing options by tapping on the video clip with your mouse.

![Select a Video to Freeze](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/freeze-frame-video-editing-skills-13.jpg)

Step 3: The Freeze Effect

To activate your options, tap on the video clip. You must now decide which segment of the video you want to freeze. To make things easy for you, press the play and pause buttons when you reach the part you want to freeze.

Take a picture of the video by dragging your pointer down to the camera icon and pressing it to take a photo while keeping the clip paused, where you want it to be frozen. When you do that, a menu of three options will appear; select Take Snapshots and Insert in Current Position. This choice will split the movie in half and insert the scene you just recorded in the middle, resulting in a freeze.
