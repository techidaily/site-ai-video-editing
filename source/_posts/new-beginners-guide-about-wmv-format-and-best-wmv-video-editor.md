## Part 5\. WMV VS. MP4: What's the Difference?

MP4 is far more popular than the WMV file format. The world is shifting on the internet; MP4 is widely used and loved online. On the other hand, WMV is popular with Windows users, along with DVD and Blu-ray collectors.

If we talk about the supported software for MP4 and WMV, MP4 has bigger support. WMV is supported by fewer video players and online video editing tools. On the contrary, MP4 is supported by all the video players available for both Windows and Mac users; along with that, every online tool also supports MP4 format for video editing.

Now the world demands quality. In terms of quality, MP4 has better quality than WMV. WMV has lost the battle of quality provision against WMV. MP4 is a larger file than WMV in terms of file size. It is less compressed than WMV format, but the compression gives WMV an advantage over MP4.

Having a compressed file format produces files of smaller size, which can be easily stored. Easy storage of video files makes WMV a better option in places where the quality of the video can be compromised.

Step1 On your iPhone, launch the **Telegram app** and go to the **"Settings"** tab at the bottom right of the screen.

Step2 Select **"Privacy and Security"** and tap the **"Profile Photo"** option.

Step3 If you want to keep your profile picture private, choose the **"My Contacts"** option. This way, only people in your contact book will be able to see it.

![setting who can see telegram profile picture](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/setting-who-can-see-telegram-profile-picture.jpg)

Step4 You can add exceptions to your privacy settings from the **"Exceptions"** section. To hide your Telegram profile picture from certain users/contacts or groups, tap the **"Never Share With"** button. This will help prevent someone who is harassing you from seeing your profile picture.

Now, choose **"Add Users or Groups,"** search for and select their name from your list of contacts. Finally, tap **"Done"** to apply your changes.

![setting profile picture to never share with certain people](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/setting-profile-picture-to-never-share-with-certain-people.jpg)

Step5 If you want to always share your profile picture with a particular user or group, you can select the **"Always Share With"** option.

To add contacts, tap the **"Add Users or Groups"** option. Next, search for and select the contacts you want to add. Finally, tap **"Done"** to save your changes. Your profile picture will now only be visible to the selected people.

##### Android

Step1 Open the **Telegram** app on your Android device.

Step2 In the top left corner of the screen, tap the **three lines** to open the **Menu**.

Step3 Scroll down and tap the **"Settings"** option.

Step4 Now, tap **"Privacy and Security"** and select the **"Profile Photo"** option. If you want to share your profile picture with only your contacts, choose the **"My Contacts"** option. This will hide your photo from everyone else on Telegram.

![telegram privacy settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/telegram-privacy-settings.jpg)

Step5 Telegram offers two great options for managing who can see your profile picture: **"Always Allow"** and **"Never Allow."**

The **"Always Allow"** feature lets you add specific users or groups who will always be able to see your profile picture, even if they're not in your contact book.

Simply tap the **"Always Allow"** option and search for contacts using their usernames to add them to your list. Tap the **"Check"** icon to apply your changes.

![setting telegram profile picture privacy to always allow](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/setting-telegram-profile-picture-privacy-to-always-allow.jpg)

Step6 You can also choose the **"Never Allow"** feature to add contacts, users, or groups from whom you wish to hide your profile picture.

To do this, search for and select the contacts (or users) from whom you want to hide your profile picture. Tap the **Checkmark** icon to apply your changes.

Once you're done customizing the settings, tap the **Checkmark** icon from the top-right corner to save the settings. Now only people who you approve will be able to see your profile picture.

## How to Make Vintage Film Effect 1980S

The 1980s is widely regarded as the golden era of music and film-making. If you play a video recorded in the 80s, you'll notice graininess, blurriness, and light exposure, giving the footage a dreamy vintage touch. So, in this short tutorial, we'll learn how to create a vintage 1980-style video with a retro effect that will leave your audience yearning for more.

## Preparation

![1980s vintage scene](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/1980s-vintage-scene.gif)

In this tutorial, you'll need at least two video clips. First, take clear footage of a hoop dancer playing to music and a disco ball footage that you'll add to the background. You can also add another footage to give your dancing video the perfect transition.

**How to create a retro-style music video shot in the 80s:**

##### Step1 Import the video clips on [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

![import the video clips on filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1980s-1.jpg)

First, run Wondershare Filmora and add the video with the hoop dancer on the first track. Then, move the disco ball footage right above the first video track.

##### Step2 Add an animation keyframe

![add an animation keyframe](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1980s-2.jpg)

With the two videos imported on Filmora, move the playhead to the point where the hoop dancer begins to dance and double-click the disco ball footage.

![move the playhead to the point](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1980s-3.jpg)

Now find the **Animation** tab, then click the **Customize** tab. Next, click **Add** to apply a keyframe to this point of the video. Don't stop there. Move the playhead to the right and add another keyframe to the footage before changing the opacity to 50%.

![find the animation tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1980s-4.jpg)

Meanwhile, we'll add a keyframe to the third video with a lady removing her sunglasses. To do that, add the footage to the third track, then double-click the video track. After that, place the playhead at the start of the video and apply an animation keyframe before changing the opacity to 0%. Move the playhead a few keyframes forward and add another animation keyframe.

##### Step3 Add retro filters and effects to the video

![add retro filters and effects to the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1980s-5.jpg)

Go to the **Effect** tab and choose **Overlay**. Once that is done, select the **TV Static** option before choosing the **VHS Distortion** effect. This effect will give your video the retro feeling of the 1980s. Don't be afraid to try out the TV Static effects to find what works best in your video.
