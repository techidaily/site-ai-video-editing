## Looking for Simple Steps to Customize the Speed of Your Video in DaVinci Resolve? Find Out How You Can Do that and Discover an Easier Alternative to DaVinci Resolve

Slow-motion videos are in trend on social media platforms. You can shoot the footage in slow-motion mode or slow it down while editing the video. Similarly, if you are making a funny video, there are surely going to be parts where the video speeds up. Sped-up video clips have always been part of comic relief and entertainment for the audience. You will need a feature-rich video editor to customize the speed of your video.

DaVinci Resolve has established itself as a complete video editor. You can edit your video, correct the color, add visual effects and edit audio parts. You can undoubtedly change video speed in DaVinci Resolve. However, DaVinci Resolve's user interface is slightly complex for beginners. We will instruct on how you can speed up a video using DaVinci Resolve. We will also suggest you an easier alternative if you are not in favor of DaVinci Resolve.

## Part I. What are the Scenarios When You Need to Speed Up Video?

There are several scenarios when speeding up a video becomes a necessity. Here are the most probable ones that you can relate to.

**Boring But Necessary Parts** \- There could be some sections in a long video that are necessary but boring to watch. You can't bore your viewers and let them leave your video midway. Hence, you can speed up those sections to pass them away quickly.

**Funny Videos** \- The subject's actions in the video look very funny when you speed them up. Therefore, if you make funny videos to entertain your viewers, speeding up certain sections of your video with funny audio in the background should be a regular thing.

**Short Videos** \- Short-duration videos are extremely popular on social media platforms.

People upload them as Stories and Statuses to entertain their followers regularly. Therefore, a sped-up video can shorten the duration, accommodate the necessary content, and fit the video duration requirements of the respective social media platforms.

**Timelapse** \- Timelapse videos are a treat to watch. You can shoot the video in timelapse mode or speed up the video while editing. That is how you can fit hours of a video into a few minutes or seconds of video duration.

## Part II. Speed Up Video using DaVinci Resolve

DaVinci Resolve is a professional video editor where you can change your video's speed in several ways. You can instantly change your video clip's speed by mentioning the speed in terms of percentage.

You can also use the advanced Speed Ramp option to customize the video speed unevenly. Besides, there are retime curves to adjust the video speed at your convenience. Let us go through the detailed guide on how to speed up the video in DaVinci Resolve 17.

### Method 1\. Change Clip Speed Option

The simplest way is through the Change Clip Speed option. You can explicitly mention the speed percentage as needed. To speed it up, mention speed percentage above 100\. If you want to slow it down, the speed percentage will be below 100\. Here are the steps you need to execute.

Step1 After you have placed the video clip onto the timeline, select the clip and right-click on it.

![placed the video clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-up-video-with-davinci-resolve-1.jpg)

Step2 Tap "Change Clip Speed…" option.

![change clip speed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-up-video-with-davinci-resolve-2.jpg)

Step3 Once the Change Clip Speed dialog box opens, modify the speed from 100% to something higher if you want to speed it up.

![once the change clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-up-video-with-davinci-resolve-3.jpg)

Step4 Click on the Change button when you are happy with the result.

### Method 2\. Speed Ramping Option

Speed ramping is a process where you can vary the speed of your video unevenly. It means you can speed up some portions while slowing down others. This is achieved through retime controls that let you edit the video clips in sections using speed points. Here are the steps to illustrate the process.

Step1 Right-click the video clip on your timeline. From the menu, select the Retime Controls option.

![video clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-up-video-with-davinci-resolve-4.jpg)

Step2 Move the play head where you want to change the speed. Click the arrow next to 100% and select the Add Speed Point option. Similarly, move the play head to another point and add a new speed point.

![change the speed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-up-video-with-davinci-resolve-5.jpg)

Step3 Click on the arrow next to 100% to change the speed between two-speed points. Go to the Change Speed option and select from the preset. Based on your preset speed selection, the video's speed within the speed points will change.

The process of generating or creating additional pixels of an image or frame in a video is AI Upscaling. This has many good results on the final video output.

This is also used to improve the picture quality of DVDs and other low-quality videos. It is done to support lower quality videos or pictures on higher resolution screens like TV. This kind of upscaling is mostly done in TVs automatically.

## Part 2 How to Easily AI Upscale Video to 1080p or 4K?

The interesting part is that this upscaling is done by the higher resolution device itself.

## If You Are a Marketer Who Want to Create Facebook Ads to Boost Your Business, You Are Coming to the Right Place. We’ll Share You some Useful Tips to Start Your First FB Ads Campaign

Facebook ads can be an effective channel for reaching the right customers, but only if you have a strong strategy in place. If you are new to Facebook ads, don't rush into creating your first campaign without fully understanding the risks and rewards of advertising on Facebook.

![facebook ads campaign tips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/facebook-ads-campaign-tips.jpg)

Before you launch your first Facebook ad campaign, here are six tips to keep in mind:

## Part1\. Define the purpose of your ad

This can be a long-form or short-form question. If a user is browsing Facebook and sees your ad, you want them to know why they should click on it. Is it an offer? If so, what are they getting in return? Is the ad simply a call to action? You may want to include a “Learn more” button that links back to your website so that users can learn more about whatever they need to know before taking the next steps.

There are 11 Facebook Ads campaign objectives to choose from, and you should choose the one that best aligns with your goals.

![create new fb campaign](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/create-new-fb-campaign.jpg)

Awareness:

* Brand awareness - Show your advertisements to individuals who are most likely to recall them.
* Reach - Show your ad to as many people as possible

Consideration:

* Traffic - Send people to your website or app
* Engagement - Increase the number of times people see and interact with your ad.
* App installs - Advertise to individuals who are more likely than others to download and use your app.
* Video views - Increase the number of times people see and interact with your video
* Lead generation - Use forms, calls, or chats to obtain information from people eager in your business.
* Messages - Get more people to message you on Facebook Messenger

Conversion:

* Conversions - Advertise to people who have a higher likelihood of taking action, such as buying something or calling you from your website.
* Catalog sales -Show your potential customers ads for items in your catalog that match their interests, so they are more likely to buy from you.
* Store traffic - This allows you to use your Facebook page as a marketing platform. If you want to run store traffic ads on Facebook, include your shop information there.

Whatever the case, make sure you have a clear goal from start to finish to understand what exactly it is you are trying to accomplish for any given campaign.

## Part2\. Know your target audience

Before you create any ads, it's important to define who will see them. You'll want to think carefully about the type of person who would be interested in what you're offering and how they would respond when they see the ad. If you can't answer these questions, it's time to start considering different audiences.

![know your target audience](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/know-your-target-audience.jpg)

But how do we begin defining a target audience? To start, let's look at the different terms used by advertisers:

Customer: The person who has already bought from your company. For example, if you sell coffee makers on Amazon and have an existing customer base from those sales (customers), then this would be the most relevant term for you when deciding who should see specific ads for new products or services that may interest them based on past purchases or interests shown through other online activity such as browsing history or social media engagement with similar content/products/services.

Prospect: A lead that has expressed interest in buying something, but has not yet purchased anything from your company. A prospect does not necessarily mean someone has signed up for an email list or asked for more info; keeping leads fresh is just as important as nurturing prospects into customers later down the road so don't forget that part!

Now that you know who you are targeting, it's time to create an avatar for your target customer. An avatar is a fictional character that represents your target customer. This will help you to better understand their needs and wants, and it will also make it easier to create targeted ads.

![create an avatar for target customer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/create-an-avatar-for-target-customer.jpg)

There are a few different ways to create an avatar:

_1.) Customer profile:_ This is a simple way to gather information about your target customer. Start by creating a list of demographic information such as age, location, gender, education level, and income level. You can also include interests and behaviors, such as what they like to do for fun, what type of music they listen to, and what type of products they buy.

_2.) Persona:_ A persona is very similar to a customer profile, but it takes things a step further by giving each target customer a name and backstory. This can be helpful if you are targeting a specific niche audience.

_3.) Mind-map:_ If you want to get creative, you can create a mind-map of your target customer. This will allow you to brainstorm everything that you know about them and come up with new ideas.

Once you have created your avatar, make sure that you keep it in mind when creating your Facebook ad campaign. This will help to ensure that your ads are relevant and interesting to your target customer.

## Part3\. Prepare a decent image for your audience to click on

Images are the most important part of any ad. A good image will help your customers understand what it is that they're clicking on, and they may even want to share it with their friends. However, if your image is poor quality or irrelevant then, it won't do as well as it could have done.

You should start by picking a relevant image that shows off your product in the best light possible. If possible, try and get some type of testimonial from customers using your product so that other people can see how great your product really is!

![create decent image for fb ads](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/create-decent-image-for-fb-ads.jpg)

If you don't have good images available yet, don't worry! You can always hire a professional photographer who knows what kind of shots work best for advertising purposes but even if this isn't something that suits every business, there are still plenty of free resources out there too like Unsplash which offers high-quality stock photography under Creative Commons licenses under various conditions such as attribution when used commercially, so make sure whatever method you choose fits within these guidelines!

## Part4\. Practice Your copywriting skills

You can have the best-developed ad in the world, but if it doesn't have strong copywriting, your ads won't work as well. It's important to know what you're getting into before spending time and money on Facebook ads.

![practice copywriting skills fb ads](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/practice-copywriting-skills-fb-ads.jpg)

The following are just some of the ways you can improve your copywriting skills:

* Read other people's ads and see how they write their copy
* Read books about writing persuasive copy.

Try writing your own copy. Then have someone read it and give feedback on what they like and what they don't like about it. Try to learn from their suggestions.

There are also many different ways to write copy for a Facebook ad. Some people like to use specific formulas for their ads, such as: AIDA (attention, interest, desire, action). This formula was developed by an American businessman named Claude C. Hopkins in 1898 and is still widely used today. If you're not sure which method is best for you, it might be worth trying a few different ones. Have someone read your ad and give their opinion on which method was the most effective at convincing them that they should click on your ad.

You can also hire a copywriter to help you with your ad. However, if you don't have the budget for it at this point in time or just want to try writing your own first before hiring someone else, there are many different apps and websites that will help you to create an ad copy.

## Part5\. Decide what type of ad format will you use

It is a carousel ad, or single image/video ad, or a combination of both?

![choose ad type format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/choose-ad-type-format.jpg)

If you are going to use a carousel ad, you need at least three images. If you're using a single image or video ads, then you only need one image or video.

As always, if your budget allows it, try to increase the number of ad sets that are running at once so as not to cannibalize each other's reach—it's better to have multiple ads winning than just one.

If you're running a single video ad for example and your budget is $100 per day, it's best practice to have to create multiple versions of this single video ad so that they don't cannibalize each other.

## Part6\. Plan your ad budget

You need to determine how much you're willing to spend on your Facebook ads. This will help you to create a budget and also to decide how often you want your ad to be shown.

![plan your fb ad budget](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/plan-your-fb-ad-budget.jpg)

The average Facebook ad spends between $5 and $10 per day. However, this can vary depending on the type of product or service that you're promoting, as well as the size of your target audience.

If you have a large target audience, it might be worth increasing your ad budget so that your ad is seen by more people. On the other hand, if you have a smaller target audience, you might want to decrease your ad budget so that you don't spend too much money on ads that aren't being seen by as many people.

It's also important to consider how often you want your ad to be shown. If you want your ad to be seen by as many people as possible, it's best to have it shown more than once. However, if you only want your ad to be shown to a select group of people, it's best to have it shown less often.

Both of these factors will help you to determine your Facebook ad spend.

## The Bottom Line

If you're ready to get started with Facebook ads, we encourage you to put these tips into practice. I believe that they will help you make the most of your budget and achieve your goals, whether they be brand awareness, lead generation or sales.

## Step by Step to Rotate Videos in Windows Media Player

Video Editing and the emotion the final product evokes is dependent on many aspects, be it the source clips, the cuts introduced or the way of presentation. But to get to the end, there are several steps involved in the production process, and not every instance of it is perfect. But we all know, editing does often help iron out any kinks, with its ability to solve basic problems, like footage that is askew, or upside down. Thus with the steps listed in this article we will help you understand how you can rotate videos to ensure your edited project looks as intended.

This particular article considers the pre-installed Windows Media Player and WonderShare Filmora.

**_Note:_** _We documented the steps in this guide with Windows Media Player_ _(on a device running Windows 10_ _) and WonderShare Filmora._

## How to Rotate Videos with Windows Media Player?

Imagine you’re in a situation where you have gone ahead and finished the filming portion of a project on your smartphone but realise that the capture footage is upside down. Fortunately, this sort of a scenario is a common occurrence and it has quite a simple fix. If you look around the gallery app on your phone, you should be able to rotate the footage there itself, but if you’ve already moved it over to your laptop, hopping into a video editor can get this done in a jiffy.

Unfortunately, if you were planning to do this with the pre-installed Windows Media Player, _you will not be able to rotate the clip_. The software is only capable of being used as a Media Player that can help keep track of stored videos in a neat and easy to view format. It also has the ability to burn inserted discs, although we doubt any modern laptop comes with a disc drive.

Hence, to rotate video and still ensure its compatible with Windows Media Player, you can use free tools like VLC Media Player or Wondershare Filmora. The steps on how to use Wondershare Filmora to rotate video clips have been elaborated ahead in this article.

### **TIPS FOR WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER**

In case you want to use Windows Media Player as your default software to manage stored content, read this section to understand how you can control displayed video libraries.

While Windows Media Player will pull all compatible files present in the Default Video Library, you can customise the information made available by using the Organises Function.

To configure the Videos Section to display specific content follow the steps listed below.

* Click on Organize.
* Then move onto Manage Libraries
* Now click on Videos.

![rotate-video-wmp](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/rotate-video-wmp-2.png)

Once you add the new folder, the screen will update itself with all the video files present in the folder.

## **An alternate way to** **Rotate** **Video with Wondershare Filmora**

With Windows Media Player only being a playback tool, we feel free software like [Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) are a great option to have installed on your device.

In Wondershare Filmora, footage rotation can only be done via the Edit Option — in my experience this straightforward approach felt quite simple and intuitive. And in case you wish to incorporate Keyframes into the rotation step, the feature is available near the Timeline.

_The emphasis on accessibility for every function in Filmora, provides a significant advantage. The use of modern iconography also betters the familiarity users may have with the software. These factors make Wondershare Filmora a great option to consider. If you do not already have Wondershare Filmora, you can download the software by visiting the official website._

Now, the steps we have listed below will help you learn how to use the rotate function in Wondershare Filmora and get the desired output.
