This effect may be used for a number of reasons, including clip transitions, speeding up a clip to make it shorter, and slowing down a clip to make it longer. Speed ramping may be used with a number of various effects.

According to the business, Adobe Premiere Pro is one of the most widely used video editing products on the market today. The ability to alter the speed of individual clips is one of Premiere Pro's most important capabilities.

## What is Speed Ramping?

A speed ramp is used to gradually increase the speed of a video clip as it accelerates or decelerates. It is guaranteed that a smooth transition between two separate speeds will take place. The method is crucial in changing the tempo of the film and, as a consequence, creating a dramatic impression. The film's required velocity is achieved by the employment of super-fast visual effects.

A speed ramp, as opposed to a rapid shift in speed, provides for a more smooth transition between two drastically differing speeds. This method is used to focus attention on certain parts of your video, which has a huge impact on your editing. It provides just the right amount of zing to keep your audience interested and excited about your presentation.

### Examples of Speed Ramping

It works especially well when utilized to focus the viewer's attention on a certain moment or action in your videos, such as a tough jump or an impending bullet. Another name for this approach speeds ramping (sometimes known as time remapping). It may also be used to create a visually pleasing transition between two clips or pictures inside a single movie.

You may also use Speed Ramping to alter the runtime of your video to fit the time limits of other social media sites, such as Instagram and Vine. If you just have 30 seconds to deliver your video, the following are the two most common places where people apply speed ramping techniques:

Assume you are shooting a person walking and want the clip to play in slow motion so that viewers can clearly see the person's face. In this scenario, speed ramping is precisely what you need since it enables you to do precisely that.

Do you remember the famous movie “The Matrix” scene, when Neo dodges the bullets? It's not some typical scene; it’s a pretty good example of speed ramping.

## How to Create Speed Ramping/Time Remapping in Premiere Pro?

The properties section allows you to designate which portions of the timeline are affected by the ramp, as well as change factors like the curve type and bias.

### Steps To Use Speed Ramping In Premiere Pro

Follow the below-mentioned steps to learn how to use speed ramping in premiere pro:

* Download and install Adobe Premiere Pro. Once installed, launch the application.
* Create a new project in Premiere by clicking the New Project button. After that, import the film that you want to speed ramp. It is the simplest and most straightforward method of importing film into Premiere to just click and drag the clip into the project window.
* Before commencing any work with speed, click and drag the video track in the timeline to make it taller by increasing the height of the track. This will guarantee that you can see the speed ramp as you go to the next stages.
* To create a sequence if you don't already have one, drag a clip into the timeline and drop it where you want it to appear. Using the clip's parameters, Premiere will automatically generate a sequence with the necessary settings.
* Decide when you want to apply the speed ramp and mark the spot on the screen where you will do so. The key to a pleasant speed ramp is movement, so choose a time when the environment is very active. You can specify in and out points, cut the clip with "Command+K," or divide the clip into parts using the razor blade tool (which is accessible through the "Command+K" shortcut).
* Keyframes will be created at this point. It's first and foremost important that the keyframes be clearly visible. Access the proper view by selecting "Show Clip Keyframes" from the context menu when you right-click on your clip.
* Another drop-down option will appear, from which you'll choose "Time Remapping" and then press the "Enter" key.
* Select "Speed" from the drop-down menu.
* To create a keyframe, choose the pen from the toolbar (or just use the "P" key on your keyboard) and click on the white line running across the video track. If you wish to make a speed ramp, you'll need at least two keyframes: one to indicate where the speed ramp should begin and another to indicate where it should terminate.
* If you wish to create more sophisticated speed ramps, you may do so by including more keyframes in your animation.
* Switch back to the selection tool when you've finished placing your keyframes. "V" is the shortcut key for this.
* Now comes the critical moment: it's time to change the speed. This is a task that Premiere Pro makes rather simple. The only thing you have to do now is click on the white line between the keyframes you have created and drag it either up or down, depending on your preference for speed or slowness.
* It's not finished yet; we still need to smooth it out a little more. With the selection tool selected, click and drag one of the keyframe markers to the other side of the screen. The number of frames across which the speed shift will occur will be stretched out as a result of this. The longer and more gradual the speed ramp will be, the greater the distance between the two sides of the keyframe indication is separated.
* Complete the process with the other keyframe, and your speed ramp will be complete!

## Techniques to Make Speed Ramping Smooth

In this section, we will be viewing some advanced time remapping features of Adobe Premiere Pro, which are as follows.

### Keyframe Interpolation

When creating a speed ramp, keyframes are used to indicate the beginning and finishing points of the speed shift. However, there are a number of methods in which Premiere may transport the clip from point A to point B.

In the video industry, filling in the data between the two locations is known as keyframe interpolation.

* Simply dragging to divide a keyframe, like in the previous example, results in an equitable speed increase between the keyframes in the animation. Linear interpolation is the term used to describe this process.
* Instead of using Bezier Interpolation, you may utilize it to produce a smoother, more natural speed ramp. With Bezier Interpolation, the pace at which the speed increases will likewise accelerate, giving the effect of a more pronounced ramp.
* To build an S-curve shape, choose a keyframe and drag the Bezier handles to the desired position. Make adjustments until you are satisfied with the outcome.

### Speed Ramp Transition

Speed ramp transitions are easy to make and may be utilized to add visual interest to a wide range of video genres. This effect is achieved by boosting the clip speed at the end of a clip before transitioning into a cut.

* In the second clip, the tempo is abruptly boosted and subsequently decreased to provide a smooth transition between situations. It may symbolize the passage of time, a character's perplexity, or simply add flair to a commercial film.
* Using Premiere Pro, create a ramp-up at the end of your first clip and a ramp-down at the start of your second clip. The speed rubber band will be curved like a bell curve across the two clips when finished.

Adding speed ramps to films in Premiere Pro may improve the usefulness and looks of a variety of movies, from narrative features to social media posts. In Premiere, you may easily create and adjust speed duration directly in the timeline to meet any needs.

* To build an S-curve shape, choose a keyframe and drag the Bezier handles to the desired position. Make adjustments until you are satisfied with the outcome.

### Speed Ramp Transition

Speed ramp transitions are easy to make and may be utilized to add visual interest to a wide range of video genres. This effect is achieved by boosting the clip speed at the end of a clip before transitioning into a cut.

* In the second clip, the tempo is abruptly boosted and subsequently decreased to provide a smooth transition between situations. It may symbolize the passage of time, a character's perplexity, or simply add flair to a commercial film.

### Speed Ramping Tips

* **High Frame Rate:** The frame rate is an important consideration when it comes to speed ramping. If you wish to slow down the video after it's been recorded, shoot it at a frame rate higher than 60 frames per second. When a video is slowed down, there should be enough frames to guarantee that the video passes the 24 frames per second threshold frame rate.
* **Choose The Appropriate Frame Resolution:** Another possibility is to modify your video's frame resolution. The tip has the ability to edit the clip's properties from the Slowing down the video is achieved by changing the frame rate in the clip's parameters from 120 to 24 frames per second. As a consequence, the frames will be expanded to the proper frame rate. As a consequence, the video is slowed down but not jerked.
* **Purposeful** **Time Remapping:** Instead of keeping the same pace throughout the film, a deliberate speed ramp should be implemented. A video has emotional, mysterious, exciting, and slow-motion Why is this the case? The usage of the same video speed throughout the film may have a negative influence on the watching experience. As a result, it is critical that videos be separated into genres and that the tempo of the videos is modified accordingly.

Speed ramping is a popular Premiere Pro effect for good reason: it looks fantastic! When utilized simultaneously to spice up a video clip, slow motion and quick motion may both be great aesthetic choices. This practice may save you time by enabling you to show more about what you want to see in your edit without using harsh jump cuts.

![Speed ramping effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/1-tutorial-how-to-make-a-smooth-speed-ramping-in-premiere-pro.png)

This effect may be used for a number of reasons, including clip transitions, speeding up a clip to make it shorter, and slowing down a clip to make it longer. Speed ramping may be used with a number of various effects.

According to the business, Adobe Premiere Pro is one of the most widely used video editing products on the market today. The ability to alter the speed of individual clips is one of Premiere Pro's most important capabilities. While speed ramping is often used in sports highlights, changing the speed of video may be useful for a number of other types of material.

You'll learn how to construct a spectacular speed ramp in Adobe Premiere Pro, beginning with capturing the proper kind of video and moving to advanced tips and methods. Following that, we'll go through some ideas and inspiration for when to use a speed ramp in your circumstance.

## What is Speed Ramping?

A speed ramp is used to gradually increase the speed of a video clip as it accelerates or decelerates. It is guaranteed that a smooth transition between two separate speeds will take place. The method is crucial in changing the tempo of the film and, as a consequence, creating a dramatic impression. The film's required velocity is achieved by the employment of super-fast visual effects.

A speed ramp, as opposed to a rapid shift in speed, provides for a more smooth transition between two drastically differing speeds. This method is used to focus attention on certain parts of your video, which has a huge impact on your editing. It provides just the right amount of zing to keep your audience interested and excited about your presentation.

### Examples of Speed Ramping

It works especially well when utilized to focus the viewer's attention on a certain moment or action in your videos, such as a tough jump or an impending bullet. Another name for this approach speeds ramping (sometimes known as time remapping). It may also be used to create a visually pleasing transition between two clips or pictures inside a single movie.

You may also use Speed Ramping to alter the runtime of your video to fit the time limits of other social media sites, such as Instagram and Vine. If you just have 30 seconds to deliver your video, the following are the two most common places where people apply speed ramping techniques:

Assume you are shooting a person walking and want the clip to play in slow motion so that viewers can clearly see the person's face. In this scenario, speed ramping is precisely what you need since it enables you to do precisely that.

Do you remember the famous movie “The Matrix” scene, when Neo dodges the bullets? It's not some typical scene; it’s a pretty good example of speed ramping.

## How to Create Speed Ramping/Time Remapping in Premiere Pro?

Speed Ramping premiere pro is an excellent tool for speeding up video clips. ' In order to speed up or slow down the speed of a video clip, this effect may be employed. In this article, you'll learn how to make the most of this fantastic tool in Adobe Premiere Pro.

![Speed ramping in Premiere Pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/2-tutorial-how-to-make-a-smooth-speed-ramping-in-premiere-pro.png)

While using Premiere Pro, the ability to change a clip's speed without altering its pitch is a very useful feature. An example of how this feature comes in helpful is when you have a clip that shows someone or something moving from left to right or vice versa.

### Advanced Premiere Pro Time Remapping

The fact that this effect is so simple to use is its main benefit. By moving handles around on the clip, you may quickly choose different regions of the clip to be influenced by the adjustment when you apply it. This makes achieving the required result extremely quick and easy.

![Time remapping in Premiere Pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/3-tutorial-how-to-make-a-smooth-speed-ramping-in-premiere-pro.png)

If you want to go deep into the game, Speed Ramp offers some more advanced options that give you even more control over your speed modifications. The properties section allows you to designate which portions of the timeline are affected by the ramp, as well as change factors like the curve type and bias.

### Steps To Use Speed Ramping In Premiere Pro

Follow the below-mentioned steps to learn how to use speed ramping in premiere pro:

* Download and install Adobe Premiere Pro. Once installed, launch the application.
* Create a new project in Premiere by clicking the New Project button. After that, import the film that you want to speed ramp. It is the simplest and most straightforward method of importing film into Premiere to just click and drag the clip into the project window.
* Before commencing any work with speed, click and drag the video track in the timeline to make it taller by increasing the height of the track. This will guarantee that you can see the speed ramp as you go to the next stages.
* To create a sequence if you don't already have one, drag a clip into the timeline and drop it where you want it to appear. Using the clip's parameters, Premiere will automatically generate a sequence with the necessary settings.
* Decide when you want to apply the speed ramp and mark the spot on the screen where you will do so. The key to a pleasant speed ramp is movement, so choose a time when the environment is very active. You can specify in and out points, cut the clip with "Command+K," or divide the clip into parts using the razor blade tool (which is accessible through the "Command+K" shortcut).
* Keyframes will be created at this point. It's first and foremost important that the keyframes be clearly visible. Access the proper view by selecting "Show Clip Keyframes" from the context menu when you right-click on your clip.
* Another drop-down option will appear, from which you'll choose "Time Remapping" and then press the "Enter" key.
* Select "Speed" from the drop-down menu.
* To create a keyframe, choose the pen from the toolbar (or just use the "P" key on your keyboard) and click on the white line running across the video track. If you wish to make a speed ramp, you'll need at least two keyframes: one to indicate where the speed ramp should begin and another to indicate where it should terminate.
* If you wish to create more sophisticated speed ramps, you may do so by including more keyframes in your animation.
* Switch back to the selection tool when you've finished placing your keyframes. "V" is the shortcut key for this.
* Now comes the critical moment: it's time to change the speed. This is a task that Premiere Pro makes rather simple. The only thing you have to do now is click on the white line between the keyframes you have created and drag it either up or down, depending on your preference for speed or slowness.
* It's not finished yet; we still need to smooth it out a little more. With the selection tool selected, click and drag one of the keyframe markers to the other side of the screen. The number of frames across which the speed shift will occur will be stretched out as a result of this. The longer and more gradual the speed ramp will be, the greater the distance between the two sides of the keyframe indication is separated.
* Complete the process with the other keyframe, and your speed ramp will be complete!

## Techniques to Make Speed Ramping Smooth

In this section, we will be viewing some advanced time remapping features of Adobe Premiere Pro, which are as follows.

### Keyframe Interpolation

When creating a speed ramp, keyframes are used to indicate the beginning and finishing points of the speed shift. However, there are a number of methods in which Premiere may transport the clip from point A to point B.

In the video industry, filling in the data between the two locations is known as keyframe interpolation.

* Simply dragging to divide a keyframe, like in the previous example, results in an equitable speed increase between the keyframes in the animation. Linear interpolation is the term used to describe this process.
* Instead of using Bezier Interpolation, you may utilize it to produce a smoother, more natural speed ramp. With Bezier Interpolation, the pace at which the speed increases will likewise accelerate, giving the effect of a more pronounced ramp.
* To build an S-curve shape, choose a keyframe and drag the Bezier handles to the desired position. Make adjustments until you are satisfied with the outcome.

### Speed Ramp Transition

Speed ramp transitions are easy to make and may be utilized to add visual interest to a wide range of video genres. This effect is achieved by boosting the clip speed at the end of a clip before transitioning into a cut.

* In the second clip, the tempo is abruptly boosted and subsequently decreased to provide a smooth transition between situations. It may symbolize the passage of time, a character's perplexity, or simply add flair to a commercial film.
* Using Premiere Pro, create a ramp-up at the end of your first clip and a ramp-down at the start of your second clip. The speed rubber band will be curved like a bell curve across the two clips when finished.

Adding speed ramps to films in Premiere Pro may improve the usefulness and looks of a variety of movies, from narrative features to social media posts. In Premiere, you may easily create and adjust speed duration directly in the timeline to meet any needs.

## Best Frame Rate for 4K Video

People in the videography ad filmmaking world use complicated terminology like Ultra High Def to describe 4K videos. Even though you are not a complete stranger to the term 4K, you might still be unaware of what it means.

In a nutshell, 4K is the highest resolution you can watch your movies and videos. The details are incredibly crisp, meaning you can see pimples or the pores on an actor's face through the screen. However, the frame rate will significantly affect how you enjoy a 4K video. Therefore, it would be wise to learn how to choose the ideal frame rate to suit your needs.

Keep reading this article to learn more about frame rates and which is suitable for a 4K video.

![4k video frame rate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/4k-video-frame-rate.jpg)

## How Do Frame Rates Affect Video Viewing?

The motion will appear smoother if your video contains more frames per second. Even though your viewers are not tech-savvy, they will definitely notice the difference.

Consider a video of a duck drinking water from a pond. If you film and playback the same video in 24, 30, and 60fps, you will see a noticeable difference, assuming your shutter speed is set according to the 180-degree shutter rule.

If you are filming quicker motions of wildlife and birds, you are better off sticking to higher resolutions to give the viewer a pleasant experience and ensure the motion is fluid.

On the other hand, lower frame rates like 24fps are ideal for human movements, which are not as smooth as wildlife. Suppose you used 60fps for a cinematic film or a TV show. The video would look a bit odd because that is not how we see things in the natural world. In addition, your viewers aren't used to such smoothness.

## Viewing Requirements of 4K Videos

You may have heard about 4K videos and wondered what people mean by that term. In simple terms, a 4K video is a high-resolution video that is four times the usual 1080p HD video. When it comes to 4K videos, there are two standard resolutions. One of them is the standard for Digital Cinema which is 4096\*2160 pixels. The other is for television and is 3840\*2160 pixels.

To stream 4K content, you need a bandwidth between 10 and 20 Mbps. On the other hand, streaming platforms like Netflix require higher bandwidths of not less than 15 Mbps. In addition to the bandwidth we mentioned earlier, you need a 4KTV or 4K monitor.

This specification was brought up at the UHD Alliance, a union of more than 50 tech companies working together to support 4K content. Tech companies ought to ensure the devices they produce are compatible with 4K videos, which are becoming increasingly popular.

Below is a list of requirements any electronic device should fulfill before being termed a 4KTV or 4K monitor.

![requirements of 4k videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/4k-video-requirements.jpg)

* A resolution of not less than 3840\*2160.
* A 10-bit color depth that allows for 1,024 shades of red, yellow, and blue.
* A high dynamic range for color accuracy.
* An excellent combination of black level and peak brightness. The peak brightness should not exceed 1,000 nits, and the black level shouldn't go below 0.5 nits. Alternatively, the peak brightness shouldn't exceed 540 nits; neither should the black level plummet below 0.0005 nits.

## Best Frame Rate for 4K Video

We all know that the frame rate you choose for your video will significantly impact the viewer's experience and the overall style of your video. The frame rate will also affect how the video looks. For instance, a frame rate lower than 24fps will make your video look unprofessional and of poor quality. The content will also flicker because there aren't many still images per second.

On the other hand, a lower FPS causes the file size to be smaller, causing it to consume a lower bandwidth. The vice versa is also true. Now that you understand these facts, you might wonder which frame rate would be best for your 4K videos.

Research reveals that the most acceptable frame rate is 30fps and 60fps. This is because the motion will appear natural to the human eye without being too fast or unrealistic.

If you are wondering what is the best frame rate for 4k videos, we urge you to select 60fps because it contains more detail. The higher frame rate also makes the motion look very smooth and crisp. Perhaps you want to shoot a slow-motion video. In that case, an even higher frame rate of 120fps would be ideal.

## How To Choose The Base Frame Rates for Your Next Video

Choosing a frame rate for your videos is not complicated. However, it is not a straightforward process either. There are numerous moving parts that ought to work harmoniously for your video to turn out perfect and guarantee your audience will have a pleasant viewing experience. Before we dive into choosing the best frame rate for your 4K videos, let's help you understand the filmmaking process.

Most filmmakers and videographers see it fit to shoot videos in 120p or 4K. This step makes their work easier during the editing process. If the raw footage is in 4K, they can de-emphasize or retain specific plot points that would look great in the final video. However, not everyone is shooting a video for Hollywood. Therefore, shooting in 4K on your laptop for your YouTube channel might be difficult.

Below are some factors you should consider when choosing the best frame rate for a 4k video.

![factors for choosing frame rate for videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/factors-for-choosing-frame-rate.jpg)

#### File size

Shooting your video at a higher frame rate means more still images are packed into a single second of the video. Therefore, you will end up with a larger file size. If you want to shoot a video for your YouTube channel, it would be wise to stick to a smaller frame rate.

#### Purpose

It wouldn't make sense to shoot a talking head video at more than 24fps. However, a higher frame rate would be ideal for a travel vlog, where the details need to be crisp.

#### Medium of delivery

The standard frame rate for television is 24fps. On the other hand, it would be best to stick to a higher frame rate of 60fps if you intend to shoot content for the silver screen.

#### Motion in the video

Lastly, the movement within the video will play a massive role in the frame rate you choose. The faster the motion, the higher the frame rate needs to be. For instance, action movies don't do well in frame rates of less than 60 fps.

## How To Make A Video Longer

These days when you head on to social media, you can easily find 4-5 seconds video clips on the internet. However, many social media platforms like YouTube, Instagram, and other videos sharing platforms require you to make your video longer to meet the site’s minimum length requirements. So, for example, although Instagram’s minimum length is 3 seconds, you might want to find ways to engage your audience longer.

This article will describe the best ways to make a video longer. We’ll also offer a bonus tip on how you can edit your video to make it look better and attract more audience. On that note, let’s take a look.

**6 Best Methods to Make a Video Longer**

There are many methods out there to make your video longer. This section will touch on the six best methods to make a video longer.

**Loop the Video**

![make-video-longer-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/make-video-longer-1.jpg)

One of the best ways to make your video longer for most social media platforms is to loop the video. When you replay the video several times in a single row, it helps to multiply its length. An example is taking a 2-second video and looping it 4x. This automatically makes it into an 8-second video clip. With looping, you can simply replay the action of the clip rather than altering it in any way.

Many video editing software today allows you to loop your video for free. You have to upload the video and choose how many times you would like to loop it, and the software will get to work.

**Slow Down the Video Speed**

![make-video-longer-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/make-video-longer-2.jpg)

We would all agree that slow-motion makes everything seem longer automatically. You can utilize the same technique when you want to make a video longer. When you slow down a video clip, every second lasts longer. Using the slow-motion effect on a 3-second video will make the video 6 or even 9 seconds longer.

**Add an Intro and Outro**

![make-video-longer-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/make-video-longer-3.jpg)

Intro and outro are scenes you add before and after the video; these scenes are popular in YouTube videos. More generally, an intro is like a trailer. It shows the audience what the video is about, and the outro scene is usually used to show more information about the video maker. Adding an intro and outro to your video can add 2-4 seconds to your video clips.

It’s quite easy to add an intro and outro to any video. You can create them separately and then merge them with your video. The intro must be something relevant to the video clip; an example is adding a fast photo slideshow to the beginning of your video or a black frame. Relevant intro and outro scenes will make your video longer and maybe more engaging.

**Add Images to the Video**

This is another trick that most bloggers use to make their videos longer. It is an old trick in the book and makes your video significantly longer, depending on the number of videos you’re adding. A single picture can add a second or two to your video. You can simply use a video editor to merge the video clip and pictures into one seamless file.

**Boomerang Your Video**

![make-video-longer-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/make-video-longer-4.jpg)

If you have plans to upload your media to Instagram, then a top feature you can use to make your video longer is the boomerang feature. Instagram introduced the Boomerang feature to play short video clips forward and then repeat their reverse. So by using the Boomerang feature, you don’t only add a memory effect to your video, but you also make your video longer.

Alternatively, you can manually append your video clip to a reversed version; this option allows you to make a boomerang from an existing clip. Apart from Instagram, you can utilize many other editing tools to create a boomerang from an existing video.

**Add More Content to Your Video Clip**

![make-video-longer-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/make-video-longer-5.jpg)

Another step you can take is to add more materials to your video. This doesn’t necessarily mean you have to get your camera out and start shooting more scenes to add to your video. Instead, you can simply access online media libraries and get amazing materials from there that are relevant to your video clip.

Today, most professional video editors offer you access to royalty-free photos and music material. You can simply browse through their collections and pick materials relevant to your video. For example, you could add a soundtrack and videos or GIFs that make your videos engaging. Adding extra content to your video clip can make it longer by 10 seconds.

If you have plans to upload your media to Instagram, then a top feature you can use to make your video longer is the boomerang feature. Instagram introduced the Boomerang feature to play short video clips forward and then repeat their reverse. So by using the Boomerang feature, you don’t only add a memory effect to your video, but you also make your video longer.

Alternatively, you can manually append your video clip to a reversed version; this option allows you to make a boomerang from an existing clip. Apart from Instagram, you can utilize many other editing tools to create a boomerang from an existing video.

**Add More Content to Your Video Clip**

Another step you can take is to add more materials to your video. This doesn’t necessarily mean you have to get your camera out and start shooting more scenes to add to your video. Instead, you can simply access online media libraries and get amazing materials from there that are relevant to your video clip.

Today, most professional video editors offer you access to royalty-free photos and music material. You can simply browse through their collections and pick materials relevant to your video. For example, you could add a soundtrack and videos or GIFs that make your videos engaging. Adding extra content to your video clip can make it longer by 10 seconds.
