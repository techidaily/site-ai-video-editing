A majority of popular YouTube vloggers use green to enhance interesting background views to their videos. Screen replaces the background and adds depth and visually interesting patterns that ends up keeping the viewer captivated.

However, with YouTube Video green screen technology, ambient lighting is blocked out and the screen can be lit the same way every time. This brings consistency over a number of videos the user applies green screen on.

## Best Places to find Green Screen Effects

There are resources on the platform for all kinds of creators, including video editors, content creators, social media influencers, and marketers. You get unlimited access to all these resources for a single price when you subscribe to Filmstock. While there are other marketplaces that offer similar options, Filmstock does things differently.

**Green Screen Effects**

1\. Balance Beam

Ever wanted to walk across a small beam way high up in the air? Me neither, but you can make a cool effect that looks like you did. Throwing a green screen on the ground and then building a balance beam over top of it you can start recording the main shot. Strap a GoPro to your head and look down while walking across the beam.

2\. Shrink Effect

Okay this one is really easy. Take some footage of a person walking in front of a green screen, ideally looking at something to be featured in the main shot to sell the effect. Then take a close up of a small object. Key out the green behind the person, take the footage and drop it over your close up, and then scale it to match. Duplicate it, mirror it horizontally to act as a reflection and then drop the opacity and add some blur to make it look more realistic. It’s a fun little trick.

3\. Floating Object

This is a simple one, making an object appear to be floating. This is another two clip shot. First, take a shot with the object hanging in front of a blue screen. Then on the same location, take another shot but while pretending to levitate the hammer. Masking around the hammer will get rid of the string for hanging, key out the blue, and then dropping it on top of the other clip is all you need.

A green screen is a green surface used as a background when filming so that any image can replace the screen behind the actor or presenter. Shooting with a green screen involves filming a person or adding visual effects in front of a solid color. Then, by digitally removing or “keying out” that color, you can drop that scene onto the background of your choice in post-production. Removing the colored background is also referred to as “chroma keying.”

**Steps with Images**

The first step is to record footage in front of a green screen so that you can import it into WeVideo as a media file. To capture footage that is optimal for the Green Screen effect, please ensure the following:

* There is ample lighting distributed evenly around you with no shadows.
* You are in front of a **solid background with no creases**. Green or blue is the recommended color for your background.
* The quality of your camera is high enough so that the footage is not pixelated or grainy. 720p HD footage or above is recommended.

Step 2) Add media to the Timeline

Once you've captured the footage you want to use for the Green Screen effect, import that media file and add it to the Timeline. Remember to place the green screen footage in the Video 2 track and the clip you would like to use as the background in the Video 1 track.

If you are using more than two video tracks, place the green screen footage in the track above whichever track holds the background footage to ensure proper layering techniques are used.

 Step 3) Open the clip editor

Double click on the green screen clip in the Timeline to open the clip editor. In the clip editor, navigate to the Color Keying tab.

 Step 4) Use the color picker tool

Select the color picker tool and then click anywhere on the green screen footage to apply the effect.

 Step 5) __(optional)_ Adjust the color settings

The Green Screen effect should automatically apply without the need to adjust the color settings. However, if you would like to make these additional modifications, you can use the scroll bars to make the following adjustments:

* ****Show**\- You can select Mask to reveal a black and white representation of the mask you are applying using the color keying tool. Notice that the black area represents transparent sections of your video, while the white area represents opaque sections.
* ****Color Balance**\- This adjusts how selective the effect is. The further right you scroll, the wider the range of tints and shades are removed.
* ****Color Sensitivity**\- This smooths out any pixelation and rough edges of color that remain.
* ****Defringe**\- This helps reduce color bleeding at the edges of your mask. The left and right sliders control the level of white and black respectively to help match the edges of the mask with your new background color.

## How Long Does It Take To Edit Videos

If you want to put together the pieces for online videos the number one thing most of the time takes is **editing.**

**Why does editing take so much time and what to do for that?**

* **Too many choices.**

It completely depends upon how many choices you are giving yourself while editing a video. It takes time to make choices. For example, if your friend asks you to buy a card (any card) from the store. You go into the store and start searching cards from more than 50000 cards, it takes time. On the other hand, if your friend asks you to buy a card for his uncle’s pet dog. This time it becomes easier for you to go straight and choose from the pet cards without moving around the birthday and anniversary cards.

* **Amount of footage.**

It depends upon how much footage you have on your edit and what kind of content you are editing. Some of the content is really complex and takes a lot of time like V-logging but at the same time, you may have content that requires very less edit or zero edit.

The video editing will become a slit and a quick process for you compared to what it was a few years back. But there are a few key things that really speed up the editing process.

I am going to discuss from beginning to end how to edit a video.

1. **Outline**

You should take a paper and write down what you are going to say about your video. It would make your editing easy because you have already structured your content.

1. **Avoid distractions**

While editing you make a **flow state** in which the editing process becomes easier. But when you got distracted it takes a lot of time to get back to that flow state.

* My **kids** are my big distraction so, I usually start my editing process after they go to bed. (You can set yours).
* Keep your **phone** away because it is another distraction that consumes most of your time.
* Don’t keep **re-watching** your video all the time. Usually, people edit the first clip and before starting to edit the second clip they watch the first clip. After that, they edit the second clip and then re-watch the first and the second clip. It is also wasting a lot of your time. Do it at the end.

## **3\.** **Davinci Resolve for Mac.**

The Davinci Resolve is the most professional video editing software on Mac. It is absolutely ridiculous that it is giving access to you for free. Along with this, it is very professional video editing software that people used to create Hollywood movies and that kind of stuff. It provides a very easy and professional interphase that anyone can use without having training.

* The controls and features in the software are amazing and can edit videos **frame by frame.**

![video-editing-spend-time](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-editing-spend-time-12.jpg)

* There is also a dedicated area for **audio creation**.

![video-editing-spend-time](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-editing-spend-time-13.jpg)

* The **motion graphics** and

![video-editing-spend-time](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-editing-spend-time-14.jpg)

* A specific area just for **color grading** and **color correcting.**

![video-editing-spend-time](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-editing-spend-time-15.jpg)

That’s why the Davinci Resolve has got its name as a **finishing application** of movies. People come in and color grade their videos. As it is a very powerful software hence if you are working with an old computer and that’s not really a powerful computer, the Davinci Resolve would not be going to work properly for you.

It completely depends upon how many choices you are giving yourself while editing a video. It takes time to make choices. For example, if your friend asks you to buy a card (any card) from the store. You go into the store and start searching cards from more than 50000 cards, it takes time. On the other hand, if your friend asks you to buy a card for his uncle’s pet dog. This time it becomes easier for you to go straight and choose from the pet cards without moving around the birthday and anniversary cards.

* **Amount of footage.**

It depends upon how much footage you have on your edit and what kind of content you are editing. Some of the content is really complex and takes a lot of time like V-logging but at the same time, you may have content that requires very less edit or zero edit.

The video editing will become a slit and a quick process for you compared to what it was a few years back. But there are a few key things that really speed up the editing process.

I am going to discuss from beginning to end how to edit a video.

1. **Outline**

You should take a paper and write down what you are going to say about your video. It would make your editing easy because you have already structured your content.

1. **Avoid distractions**

While editing you make a **flow state** in which the editing process becomes easier. But when you got distracted it takes a lot of time to get back to that flow state.

* My **kids** are my big distraction so, I usually start my editing process after they go to bed. (You can set yours).
* Keep your **phone** away because it is another distraction that consumes most of your time.
* Don’t keep **re-watching** your video all the time. Usually, people edit the first clip and before starting to edit the second clip they watch the first clip. After that, they edit the second clip and then re-watch the first and the second clip. It is also wasting a lot of your time. Do it at the end.

## How Do You Find a High-Quality Video Marketing Company?

It is difficult to spot a high-quality agency because most promise a lot but deliver very little. With so many video marketing companies ready to scam you, the question boils down to how to find a high-quality agency that can provide the expected results. Here are some crucial steps to judge if a marketing video agency is worth your time and money.

##### Step 1 Be Clear About Your Objective

Before you start finding video content marketing companies, you should be clear about the goals you want to achieve through video marketing. For some brands, the goal could be increasing brand awareness and visibility by driving website traffic. For others, it could be generating leads and boosting sales. Once you are clear about your goals and expectations, you can start finding agencies that specialize in fulfilling your objectives.

![be clear about your objective](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/03/image_1.jpeg)

##### Step 2 Assess Overall Quality

On your journey of finding video marketing companies, you will come across many agencies that will look very promising, apparently. But you cannot take their promises for granted. Instead, evaluate their capabilities by reviewing their portfolio consisting of their past projects. You can assess their quality by judging their creativity, work style, production value, and marketing techniques from their past works. Once you are convinced of their skills and capabilities, you can shortlist them.

![assess overall quality](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/03/image_2.jpg)

##### Step 3 Give Priority to Experience

Selecting a marketing video agency without past experience with companies in your industry will be a blunder. This is because their past experience will help them understand your objectives and targeted audiences better. They are likely to be aware of the things that work and do not work with the audiences in your industry. Besides, they will be capable of finding opportunities and identifying challenges faster during the marketing process. Therefore, agencies with experience in your industry should get priority on your list.

![give priority to experience](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/03/image_3.jpg)

##### Step 4 Check Customer Testimonials

Checking out the reviews of past clients and customers is an essential part of selection. Customer testimonials can reveal insights for you to judge the strengths and weaknesses of the agency. You can form an opinion on their professionalism, communication style, operational techniques, and customer satisfaction. You should check the reviews and feedback on their websites and ask for references from their past customers.

![check customer testimonials](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/03/image_4.jpg)

##### Step 5 Watch out for Creativity

Creativity differentiates between excellence and average in the video marketing world. Every company invests in video marketing, but only a few are successful in their efforts. The key to their success lies in their creative thinking and innovative approach. Creativity makes video content attention-grabbing, long-lasting, and highly sharable.

Similarly, innovative marketing techniques will give you a significant edge over your competitors. You can judge a video marketing agency's creativity if they pitch unique ideas, creative storytelling, and innovative marketing approaches. Watch out for the reviews to determine if the company has a proven record of creativity in their field.

![watch out for creativity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/03/image_5.jpg)

##### Step 6 Take Optimization Seriously

Creative video content is useless if it cannot reach the most targeted audiences. The reach in the digital world depends on optimization. That is why when you choose a **marketing video agency** near you, ensure they understand optimization principles. Proper search engine optimization helps a video rank higher in search results and get more organic audiences.

Optimization techniques vary for search engines, video streaming websites, and social media platforms. A video marketing agency should have expertise in optimization for organic reach and generating leads.

![take optimization seriously](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/03/image_6.jpeg)

##### Step 7 Dive Into the Process

You should choose a video agency that is more open about its operation and process of execution. They must explain the entire process, from concept development to final delivery. Similarly, they should be open to suggestions, flexible in approaches, and adaptable during challenges.

Understanding the execution process will help you determine instinctively if the agency is worth your investment. There should be clarity in the thought process and executive plan with deadline and budget for your peace of mind and satisfaction.

![dive into the process](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/03/image_7.jpeg)

##### Step 8 Focus on Communication

Communication is a highly underrated skill in the professional world, especially when outsourcing your work to an agency. Without proper communication, there cannot be a proper collaboration with the **video marketing company**. If you cannot share your feedback or get involved in the required process, your goals and objectives will stay unachieved.

Therefore, while discussing the execution plan, you should emphasize communication. For example, you can check how often you will get updates and how responsive and proactive the agency will be with suggestions and feedback. Communication enhances transparency in execution and boosts customer satisfaction.

![focus on communication](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/03/image_8.jpg)

##### Step 9 Request a Proposal

You must have shortlisted a few high-quality video marketing companies following the steps mentioned so far. It is time to request a proposal or quotation from the interested agencies. You should reiterate your goals, objectives, expectations, and requirements so the agencies can provide tailored proposals accordingly.

You can also clarify any doubts and assess their professionalism and communication well. The proposals can reveal the level of service you will get. The more detailed the proposal, the deeper you can evaluate the service and make the final selection accordingly.

![request a proposal](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/03/image_9.jpg)

##### Step 10 Evaluate Return on Investment

Last but not least, you should compare the prices to evaluate which proposals offer more value for your money. You should also calculate your return on investment so that your investment brings in the expected results without damaging you monetarily. You will also get to know the hidden charges and deliveries, and you should consider an agency that mentions them upfront for transparency. Finally, trust your assessment and instinct and select the best promotional video production company to take your business to the next level.

![evaluate return on investment](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/03/image_10.jpeg)

## How Do You Find a High-Quality Video Marketing Company?

It is difficult to spot a high-quality agency because most promise a lot but deliver very little. With so many video marketing companies ready to scam you, the question boils down to how to find a high-quality agency that can provide the expected results. Here are some crucial steps to judge if a marketing video agency is worth your time and money.

##### Step 1 Be Clear About Your Objective

Before you start finding video content marketing companies, you should be clear about the goals you want to achieve through video marketing. For some brands, the goal could be increasing brand awareness and visibility by driving website traffic. For others, it could be generating leads and boosting sales. Once you are clear about your goals and expectations, you can start finding agencies that specialize in fulfilling your objectives.

##### Step 2 Assess Overall Quality

On your journey of finding video marketing companies, you will come across many agencies that will look very promising, apparently. But you cannot take their promises for granted. Instead, evaluate their capabilities by reviewing their portfolio consisting of their past projects. You can assess their quality by judging their creativity, work style, production value, and marketing techniques from their past works. Once you are convinced of their skills and capabilities, you can shortlist them.

##### Step 3 Give Priority to Experience

Selecting a marketing video agency without past experience with companies in your industry will be a blunder. This is because their past experience will help them understand your objectives and targeted audiences better. They are likely to be aware of the things that work and do not work with the audiences in your industry. Besides, they will be capable of finding opportunities and identifying challenges faster during the marketing process. Therefore, agencies with experience in your industry should get priority on your list.

##### Step 4 Check Customer Testimonials

Checking out the reviews of past clients and customers is an essential part of selection. Customer testimonials can reveal insights for you to judge the strengths and weaknesses of the agency. You can form an opinion on their professionalism, communication style, operational techniques, and customer satisfaction. You should check the reviews and feedback on their websites and ask for references from their past customers.

##### Step 5 Watch out for Creativity

Creativity differentiates between excellence and average in the video marketing world. Every company invests in video marketing, but only a few are successful in their efforts. The key to their success lies in their creative thinking and innovative approach. Creativity makes video content attention-grabbing, long-lasting, and highly sharable.

Similarly, innovative marketing techniques will give you a significant edge over your competitors. You can judge a video marketing agency's creativity if they pitch unique ideas, creative storytelling, and innovative marketing approaches. Watch out for the reviews to determine if the company has a proven record of creativity in their field.

##### Step 6 Take Optimization Seriously

Creative video content is useless if it cannot reach the most targeted audiences. The reach in the digital world depends on optimization. That is why when you choose a **marketing video agency** near you, ensure they understand optimization principles. Proper search engine optimization helps a video rank higher in search results and get more organic audiences.

Optimization techniques vary for search engines, video streaming websites, and social media platforms. A video marketing agency should have expertise in optimization for organic reach and generating leads.

##### Step 7 Dive Into the Process

You should choose a video agency that is more open about its operation and process of execution. They must explain the entire process, from concept development to final delivery. Similarly, they should be open to suggestions, flexible in approaches, and adaptable during challenges.

Understanding the execution process will help you determine instinctively if the agency is worth your investment. There should be clarity in the thought process and executive plan with deadline and budget for your peace of mind and satisfaction.

##### Step 8 Focus on Communication

Communication is a highly underrated skill in the professional world, especially when outsourcing your work to an agency. Without proper communication, there cannot be a proper collaboration with the **video marketing company**. If you cannot share your feedback or get involved in the required process, your goals and objectives will stay unachieved.

Therefore, while discussing the execution plan, you should emphasize communication. For example, you can check how often you will get updates and how responsive and proactive the agency will be with suggestions and feedback. Communication enhances transparency in execution and boosts customer satisfaction.

##### Step 9 Request a Proposal

You must have shortlisted a few high-quality video marketing companies following the steps mentioned so far. It is time to request a proposal or quotation from the interested agencies. You should reiterate your goals, objectives, expectations, and requirements so the agencies can provide tailored proposals accordingly.

You can also clarify any doubts and assess their professionalism and communication well. The proposals can reveal the level of service you will get. The more detailed the proposal, the deeper you can evaluate the service and make the final selection accordingly.

You should also calculate your return on investment so that your investment brings in the expected results without damaging you monetarily. You will also get to know the hidden charges and deliveries, and you should consider an agency that mentions them upfront for transparency. Finally, trust your assessment and instinct and select the best promotional video production company to take your business to the next level.
