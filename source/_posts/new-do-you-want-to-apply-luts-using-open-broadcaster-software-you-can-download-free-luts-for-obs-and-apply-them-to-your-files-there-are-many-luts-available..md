## How to Create a Glitch Text Effect?

Have you noticed the glitching effect that appears when you play a video or in games, creating a sporadic shaky effect on video edges? While this usually signifies a systematic software issue in these cases, the effect itself can work to create a dynamic visual style for different objects when done intentionally.

In fact, many video editors today use the glitch effect on elements in their videos, like the introductory title in movies or trailers. It creates a futuristic look to the text, which highly appeals to viewers who engage more in the video itself.

Suppose you are looking to add a similar effect to the title of your video project or other text-based content that you will add to your video, use a good tool for that. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), in particular, makes adding this effect very simple. Let's learn how.

![move to playhead](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-glitch-text-effect-2.jpg)

Then, double-click on the copied clip to open the text editing window. Click on the section where you can add the text and change it to the second word of your title. Again, copy this clip and paste it next to it, adjust it to be one second long, double-click on it to adjust the text to read the third word, and so on.

Continue until all of your intro's words are added in these clip forms.

## 5\. Create and add the snapshots

Following the previous step, click on the My Media section. Then, tap on the first clip in the collection and tap on the Snapshot icon at the end of the editing toolbar right above the timeline. Repeat this step for all the clips you have added until a snapshot of each of the words is stored in the media library.

Next, you have to grab hold of the first snapshot that you click and move it to the Track 1 of the timeline. Use the cursor to hold it and reduce the size of the clip to the same amount as the first clip on Track 1\. To be sure, you can place the playhead at this point to see that the ending time for both clips is aligned.

## 7\. Edit the snapshots for all words

After making changes to the first word, you must take hold of the second word's snapshot from the media library. Drag and then drop it onto Track 1 of the editing timeline right next to the first clip. Then, hold the edge of this clip and reduce its size to fit the same duration as the second clip adjacent to it on Track 2.

Following that, you must choose this clip on Track 1 and right-click on top of it. Click on the "Paste Effects" option from the next drop-down menu, and the same adjustments will apply to this clip.

![click on the paste effects option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-glitch-text-effect-7.jpg)

Repeat this step with all of the next snapshots of the following words.

Scroll down until you reach the Filmstock option. You must click on it and find the Flicker option from the list. Under this collection, there are many options available. You must choose the Video\_seg effect and drag it to the editing timeline above Track 2.

![drag it down to the editing timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-glitch-text-effect-8.jpg)

At this point, ensure the effect falls right above the first and second clip parts in the track below. Tap on the edges of this clip to reduce the size of the video effect, taking careful note to keep the clip 8 frames long overall.

Then, copy the cut-down effect from Track 3 and paste it at every intersectional point between the separated word-based clips in Track 2.

Go to the Effects tab at the top and choose the Filters collection next. Under it, choose the Chaos 1 effect option, drag it down to the timeline, and place it above the previous clip on Track 4\. Adjust the starting edge of this clip to have the same starting point as the Video\_seg effect on Track 3 with an overall 8-frame duration.

![adjust the edges of the clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-glitch-text-effect-10.jpg)

## 10\. Edit the Effect

Next, you have to double-click on this clip to open the editing window for this effect. In this section, go to the Frequency parameter and increase the slider to 400\. Following that, click on the Position X parameter and move the slider to the 0.20 point. Next, do the same for the Position Y parameter, but to the 0.70 point.

Afterward, go to the Effects tab again and choose the Filmstock tab. Among the collections here, you have to choose the Glitch option and select Glitch Stripe 1 from the collection. For an easier searching experience, you can directly type the effect in the search bar under the Effects tab.

![select glitch stripe 1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-glitch-text-effect-12.jpg)

Then, drag and drop it on Track 5 of the timeline right above the previous effect and reduce its duration to the same level as the first two effects. Copy it and then paste the clip again for each clip-to-clip intersection.

After this part, drag the Glitch Dispersion effect down to the timeline. Place it above the previous effect and adjust the clip's size to the same length. Again, copy the effect and repeat the steps again. Next, repeat the same whole process with the Negative Flicker effect from the Flicker collection on Track 7.

## Want to Give a Bold and Colorful Look to Your Ad or Abstract Art Project? This Quick and Easy Tutorial Teaches How to Create a Risograph Effect in Photoshop

Risograph printing is a digital printing process that combines the best features of offset and screen printing used by many small print shops and design studios to provide trendy vibes and a classic look to the images.

If you’re a novice graphic designer or illustrator, you’ve probably seen Risograph prints and wondered how they are made. Well, this article will help you **create a risograph effect in Photoshop** quickly!

## What Is Risograph Effect?

Before we look into how to create a risograph effect in Photoshop [in the later part of this article](#%5FHow%5FTo%5FUse), let’s have a basic understanding of Risograph.

Risograph was created in **1986** by a Japanese company called **Riso Kagaku Corporation.** It’s a form of stencil printing, a technique that uses a stencil to create an image on a piece of paper.

The Risograph machine prints images by building them up one layer at a time, with each subsequent layer being a different color. Because of this, each print produced is imperfect, though some artists believe this only adds to the Risograph's unique charm and distinct look.

The Risograph printing effect gives images a vibrant and bold look, making them perfect for ads, magazines, and abstract artworks. The printing method is also used for many products, including books, fabric, magazines, newspapers, plastic, metal, and even some forms of packaging.

### How To Create A Dual-Tone Risograph Effect

After creating an image with the risograph effect, how to make it more visually vertical? At this time, the dual-tone impact will help us have a more delicate picture.

The dual-tone effect is a technique in the risograph effect that combines two or more overlapping images to give a more vibrant look to the final project or emphasize the critical concept, information, or idea.

To create a dual-tone risograph effect in Photoshop, do the following steps.

Step1 To create a dual-tone risograph effect, add another subject to the canvas and set the blending mode to **Multiply.** Also, change its opacity to blend the two issues well. Make sure to turn the subject to **Smart Object** by right-clicking on the object's layer and selecting **"Convert to Smart Object."** Adjust the position of the subject on the previous one.
