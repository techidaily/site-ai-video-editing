A video background changer is a tool that can swap the background of any video. These tools usually work in three simple steps.

* Analyze the footage.
* Separate the subject or “subjects” from the background
* Switch backgrounds.

The process starts when a user uploads a video clip. The tool analyzes the footage and separates the subjects from the background.

![final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/03/best-video-background-changers-online-4.png)

The video editors’ community refers to Final Cut Pro as one of the most professional applications for Mac users. It is a standard editing software that competes with DaVinci Resolve, Premiere Pro, and the rest. It uses the standard ground-to-top layering system to organize a timeline and is easy to learn.

Though it cannot **edit background videos online, users can download it** and use its chroma key effect. Like Premiere’s ultra-key effect, the chroma key function can select and remove a specific color. This is not the only way to remove backgrounds, but it is the most effective. If done correctly, no bleeding or distorted subject traces will be found.

**Features**

* Simple object motion tracking
* Color grading and cinematic color LUTs
* Supports 4k - 8k footage editing, rendering, and exporting
* Text animations
* Apple’s Neural Engine for speed edits

Premier Pro has a wide range of free tutorials on YouTube from various content creators. This makes the learning process a breeze.

**Features**

* AI-assisted transcription and subtitling
* Customizable workspaces
* Audio effects and dedicated audio editing interface
