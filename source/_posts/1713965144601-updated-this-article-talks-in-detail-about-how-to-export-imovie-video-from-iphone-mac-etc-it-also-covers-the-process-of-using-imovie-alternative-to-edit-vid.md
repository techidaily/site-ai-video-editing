## Part 1: What is SRT?

An SRT is one of the most common formats used in subtitling or captioning files. 'SRT' refers to a 'SubRip Subtitle' file, which originated from the DVD-ripping software by the same name. [SubRip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubRip) would extract or rip subtitles and timings from live video, recorded video, and DVDs.

SRT has four major components:

1. A numeric counter indicates the number or position of the subtitle.
2. A Start and end time of the subtitle which is separated by the characters.
3. A Subtitle in one or more lines.
4. A blank line indicates the ending of the subtitle.

Now that you know about SRT let's understand why you should convert your Word file to SRT.

## Part 2: Why Should You Convert Word to SRT?

Most subtitles on the Internet are distributed in SRT format. Moreover, media players, lecture capture software, and video recording software are compatible with the SRT format.

Also, user frequently asks from forum like:

“I received a docx. file with subtitles already translated and the corresponding YouTube video URL. I was asked to proofread and then embed the subtitles into the video.”

To solve this, you can not only save it as a TXT document and change the file extension to .SRT, but also, a much easier way, convert subtitles from Microsoft Word files to SRT format through a easy-to-use SRT converter.

## Part 3: How to Convert a Word file to an SRT file without the software?

### Timestamp issue

**How to add timestamps**:

There are two ways to add timestamps in the file.

1. **Either add timestamps manually in the word document.**

To write timecodes, the format used is Hours:minutes:seconds,milliseconds and milliseconds being rounded to 3 decimal places. Separate each timestamp with a two-hash arrow (written as - ->) and a blank line indicates the next caption sequence. After saving, these files are named with .srt extension.

1. **Or edit the SRT file after creating it using a video editor which has the ability to edit SRT.**

You can also edit the SRT file after creating it by using video editing software such as [Happy Scribe’s](https://www.happyscribe.com/). It has audio-to-text/video-to-text feature that includes multiple timestamps options.

### Language Conversion Feature of SRT file

## Part 1\. How to Add Text Animation in After Effects

You may roughly follow the instructions in this article and produce a similar effect with After Effects if you are familiar with that application and prefer it for graphics and animations. Using Adobe AE, let's demonstrate how to make a text animation effect.

### 1\. After Effects' Fly-in Text Animation

Fortunately, creating this type of effect inside of Adobe AE is really fairly simple and doesn't need downloading and installing any other templates. For those who are knowledgeable with AE and want to create the effect, that is a significant bonus.

**Steps to Add Fly-in Text Animation in AE:**

Step1 The first step is adding your Title Layer to a Comp that has a colorful backdrop and create a route for the text to follow using the Pen tool.

![title layer styles premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/title-layer-styles-premiere.jpg)

Step2 In the next step, rotate the Text menu, Path Options, and Layer down. Using the Pen Tool, change the path to the mask you just created. To advance a few frames, use your keyboard's directional keys.

![select pen tool premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/select-pen-tool-premiere.jpg)

Step3 Afterwards, set a Keyframe for First Margin at frame 0; reduce the value to whatever is appropriate for your Path and change the First Margin value to 0 at frame 30 to center the text on the path's length.

![key frmae margin premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/key-frmae-margin-premiere.jpg)

Step4 Lastly, give this keyframe an Easy Ease to setup the Fly-in text animation.

### 2\. After Effects Typewriter Animation

A great pre-set for animators wishing to produce effects of text on paper is Typewriter Text Presets. The Bevel settings, which let you create the essential indentation effect, are more stunning than the pre-speed set's control. A fun and simple method to show titles in your films is using typewriter effects. While the classic typewriter effect could seem a bit antiquated, combining it with additional text effects will result in something fresh and interesting.

**Steps to Add Typewriter Animation in After Effects:**

Step1 In the Media Viewer, choose the Text tool and enter your title. Then, use the Character panel to change the font, color, and size.

![composition settings premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/composition-settings-premiere.jpg)

Step2 Look for the Typewriter effect in the Effects panel. To see text choices, click the little triangle.

![typewriter effects premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/typewriter-effects-premiere.jpg)

Step3 Select "Opacity" under "Animate" from the menu and advance your timeline a bit and alter the number from "Start" to 100%. Change the keyframes' positions to alter the animation's length.
