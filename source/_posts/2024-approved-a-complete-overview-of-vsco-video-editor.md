## How to Blur Part of a Video Using OpenShot

Designed for Windows, Mac, and Linux, OpenShot is a free, open-source, and cross-platform video editor. While there's no predefined function or filter in this tool to help you blur part of a video, OpenShot has another way of blurring static parts of your video: it uses an image.

OpenShot blur part of video is free, and you'll use its open-source programs as a base program for the edition of the video and GIMP Image Manipulation software to edit photos. Follow the guide below to learn how to blur out something in a video using OpenShot.

Step 1: Download OpenShot and install it on your device.

![blur part of a video using openshot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-12.png)

Step 2: Take a screenshot from your video, where the part you want to blur is easily visible. You can do this by going to a relevant frame and utilizing Save Current Frame with a camera icon, located on the right side of the video preview window in a standard program configuration.

![blur part of a video using openshot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-11.png)

Step 3: Be sure to save your video screenshot on your computer.

Step 4: Since you have exported a relevant frame from your video as a screenshot, you need to open it in a photo editor that can handle PNG pics and transparency, like the GIMP Image Manipulation program. Use any selection tool to select the area of the picture you want to blur on the video. Depending on your preferences, you can choose the free select tool, the ellipse select tool, or the rectangle select tool.

![blur part of a video using openshot - select blur area](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-13.png)

Step 5: In the blur filters submenu, open the Pixelize tool and adjust the options that suit your preferences. You can use CTRL-Z to cancel the operation, and repeat it until you find the best combination of blurring settings.

Step 6: When you are satisfied with blurring, right-click on the blurred area and select Invert in the Select submenu; this will allow you to select the entire part of the frame that has not been blurred, which is the part you would like to get rid of because you will only have to use the blurred part of your video overlay where necessary.

Step 7: Now, cut the section of the picture you do not want to keep. You can do this by using CTRL-X. The blurred filter for your video is now ready.

![blur part of a video using openshot - cut unwanted section](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-14.png)

Step 8: If after cutting you notice a plain color rather than a checkerboard canvas representing transparency, use CTRL-Z to cancel the cut. Then, use CTRL-I to invert the selection again to get control of the blurred selection again, and copy or cut it using CTRL-X or CTRL-C.

Step 9: Create another image using CTRL-N, and ensure you have navigated to the advanced options and selected transparency as the fill-in color, and paste your selection there.

Step 10: You now have a perfect photo with full transparency, which is represented by a checkerboard canvas, except for the section of the video frames you would like to blur that should be pixelized.

Step 11: Use the Export option under the File menu to export the photo to your PC as a . PNG file. To save a picture with a transparency channel, you need to use the . PNG extension.

Step 12: Now return to OpenShot video editor and import the generated picture with a pixelized portion in the OpenShot video project. Next, add the picture as an overlay track. Make sure it's above the video track.

Step 13: If the program asks you to import the photo as an image sequence, select the NO option because you need to import a still photo, and not a video sequence.

Step 14: The picture will be displayed before the video, blurring only the portion of the video where you modified the frame. The other parts of the video won’t be touched. You can make adjustments to ensure the picture track is only displayed at required moments. And that's how to blur part of a video using OpenShot.

## Conclusion

● Now that you know how to blur out part of a video, you can have fun and censor anything you want in your clips. Use Filmora to blur moving and still parts on your video.

## How to Blur Part of a Video Using OpenShot

Designed for Windows, Mac, and Linux, OpenShot is a free, open-source, and cross-platform video editor. While there's no predefined function or filter in this tool to help you blur part of a video, OpenShot has another way of blurring static parts of your video: it uses an image.

OpenShot blur part of video is free, and you'll use its open-source programs as a base program for the edition of the video and GIMP Image Manipulation software to edit photos. Follow the guide below to learn how to blur out something in a video using OpenShot.

Step 1: Download OpenShot and install it on your device.

![blur part of a video using openshot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-12.png)

Step 2: Take a screenshot from your video, where the part you want to blur is easily visible. You can do this by going to a relevant frame and utilizing Save Current Frame with a camera icon, located on the right side of the video preview window in a standard program configuration.

![blur part of a video using openshot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-11.png)

Step 3: Be sure to save your video screenshot on your computer.

Step 4: Since you have exported a relevant frame from your video as a screenshot, you need to open it in a photo editor that can handle PNG pics and transparency, like the GIMP Image Manipulation program. Use any selection tool to select the area of the picture you want to blur on the video. Depending on your preferences, you can choose the free select tool, the ellipse select tool, or the rectangle select tool.

![blur part of a video using openshot - select blur area](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-13.png)

Step 5: In the blur filters submenu, open the Pixelize tool and adjust the options that suit your preferences. You can use CTRL-Z to cancel the operation, and repeat it until you find the best combination of blurring settings.

Step 6: When you are satisfied with blurring, right-click on the blurred area and select Invert in the Select submenu; this will allow you to select the entire part of the frame that has not been blurred, which is the part you would like to get rid of because you will only have to use the blurred part of your video overlay where necessary.

Step 7: Now, cut the section of the picture you do not want to keep. You can do this by using CTRL-X. The blurred filter for your video is now ready.

![blur part of a video using openshot - cut unwanted section](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-14.png)

Step 8: If after cutting you notice a plain color rather than a checkerboard canvas representing transparency, use CTRL-Z to cancel the cut. Then, use CTRL-I to invert the selection again to get control of the blurred selection again, and copy or cut it using CTRL-X or CTRL-C.

Step 9: Create another image using CTRL-N, and ensure you have navigated to the advanced options and selected transparency as the fill-in color, and paste your selection there.

Step 10: You now have a perfect photo with full transparency, which is represented by a checkerboard canvas, except for the section of the video frames you would like to blur that should be pixelized.

Step 11: Use the Export option under the File menu to export the photo to your PC as a . PNG file. To save a picture with a transparency channel, you need to use the . PNG extension.

Step 12: Now return to OpenShot video editor and import the generated picture with a pixelized portion in the OpenShot video project. Next, add the picture as an overlay track. Make sure it's above the video track.

Step 13: If the program asks you to import the photo as an image sequence, select the NO option because you need to import a still photo, and not a video sequence.

Step 14: The picture will be displayed before the video, blurring only the portion of the video where you modified the frame. The other parts of the video won’t be touched. You can make adjustments to ensure the picture track is only displayed at required moments. And that's how to blur part of a video using OpenShot.

## Conclusion

● Now that you know how to blur out part of a video, you can have fun and censor anything you want in your clips. Use Filmora to blur moving and still parts on your video.

## Practical Ways to Resize Video in Handbrake

Videos are a great medium to share thoughts, concepts, guides, and memories, but regardless of how far technology has come getting them online can pose an issue sometimes. These obstacles often tend to be because either a video clip is too long or the amount of data in it is so high that the service just cannot upload the file to its servers and make it available for the intended receiver.

To solve this issue, users often need to resize a video so that the data cap, which behaved as a restriction, is no longer applicable. Now, there exist multiple software that can do this, and most video editor programs include the ability to export videos in less data-hungry sizes or formats.

So, if you ever face a similar issue, here is a guide on how you can resize videos via Handbrake and Wondershare Filmora. The former is a lightweight tool perfect for batch resizing videos, while the latter is a powerful free video editing software.

## How to resize video with Handbrake

Open Handbrake and follow the steps listed below.

Once open, the software will present you with options to either import a single video file for resize or a whole batch via folder selection.

**_Note:_** _If you do not have Handbrake, you can_ [_download it by visiting the official website_](https://handbrake.fr/)_. Also, you will need_ [_Windows .NET Framework 6.0_](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0/runtime?utm%5Fsource=getdotnetcore&utm%5Fmedium=referral) _to use Handbrake._ _If your system does not have the correct config Handbrake will let you know and fail to launch._

Once you have imported the video file, the software will present you with two choices.

* **Option 1:** Use a preset available in the application — the best choice for beginners to choose for beginners.
* **Option 2:** Set a custom resolution via the Dimensions Tab.

**_Note:_** _To ensure the resize is perfect, find out which file format plays best with the end location of your video and convert the video clip to that version._

How your screen will look once you have imported a video file.

### **How to Resize Video via Option 1**

**Step 1:** Import Video File by choosing

* Single Import, or
* Batch Import

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-2.jpeg)

**Step 2:** Choose a Preset in Handbrake.

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-3.jpeg)

**Step 3:** Click on Start Encode after choosing the desired preset.

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-4.jpeg)

**Step 4:** Wait for the Encode to finish. The application shows progress in a bar at the bottom of the screen.

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-5.jpeg)

**Step 5:** Click on Browse in the bottom right corner to enter the Save File dialogue. At this point, you can set a file name and select a new save location.

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-6.jpeg)

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-7.jpeg)

### **How to Resize Video via Option 2**

**Step 1:** Import Video File by choosing

* Single Import, or
* Batch Import

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-8.jpeg)

**Step 2:** Click on the Dimensions Tab to open up a dialog box that will let you edit video resolution.

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-9.jpeg)

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-10.jpeg)

The Dimensions Dialog Box

**Step 3:** Modify resolution to ensure the clip you get is in the right setup.

**_Note:_** _If you see 1920 x 1080 on your screen, the first number (1920) stands for the width of the video file, while the second number (1080) stands for the height._

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-11.jpeg)

**Tip**

The one thing to keep in mind while using Option 2 is to ensure that the aspect ratio of the video file is maintained; this will prevent the final video from looking like its skewed and prevent it from becoming too tall or too wide

_Via Option 2 you can also add borders to the final video if desired, while resizing it to your liked resolution._

## An easier way to resize video with Wondershare Filmora

While the resize feature in Handbrake is capable of working on multiple video files at once, the user interface of the application may seem daunting to some. Hence, if you’re just starting to learn, we recommend accessing more user-friendly software, say Wondershare [Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) . You can resize videos in the video editor by following the steps we have detailed below.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For Win 7 or later (64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For macOS 10.14 or later

Just keep in mind, when using WonderShare Filmora the resize option appears at the end of the video editing process — during the export action.

**Step 1:** Import a video file into Wondershare Filmora.

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-12.jpeg)

**Step 2:** Drag the video file onto the timeline and then choose Export from the top bar.

**Author’s Notes:** Here, I recommend using the Export to Device option as having a local copy which you then manually upload to services like YouTube is a process that you can have more control over.

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-13.jpeg)

**Step 3:** Choose the video file format (marked in Red) and then choose the resolution you require (marked in Yellow).

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-14.jpeg)

**Tip**

If you press on the settings tab (marked in Yellow, in the image above) and choose custom you can modify more aspects of your video file. Including the configuration used by the audio components.

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-15.jpeg)

Choose Custom under the Settings Option to customise Video Details with more precision

**Step 4:** Click on Export once you’ve decided on the resolution.

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-16.jpeg)

With this you will now have a video file that has been resized to a size or converted to a format that will hopefully function well with your desired platform.

**Note:** You can also reset the resolution of an entire project before hand in Wondershare Filmora by choosing the right configuration from the **Project Settings** option, found under the **File Tab**.

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-17.jpeg)

## The Bottom Line

Having read this piece, you may have noticed that software capable of resizing videos can prove quite useful. Wondershare Filmora is this, plus a lot more, its convenient and intuitive user interface is also something we believe will feel welcoming to users. Speaking of Handbrake, while effective and great for batch encoding — if you want to resize more than one video we recommend having Handbrake handy — its bare-bones interface can be intimidating. Regardless, both programs are convenient to utilize and perfectly capable of doing the task at hand with relative ease.

Just keep in mind, when using WonderShare Filmora the resize option appears at the end of the video editing process — during the export action.

**Step 1:** Import a video file into Wondershare Filmora.

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-12.jpeg)

**Step 2:** Drag the video file onto the timeline and then choose Export from the top bar.

**Author’s Notes:** Here, I recommend using the Export to Device option as having a local copy which you then manually upload to services like YouTube is a process that you can have more control over.

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-13.jpeg)

**Step 3:** Choose the video file format (marked in Red) and then choose the resolution you require (marked in Yellow).

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-14.jpeg)

**Tip**

If you press on the settings tab (marked in Yellow, in the image above) and choose custom you can modify more aspects of your video file. Including the configuration used by the audio components.

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-15.jpeg)

Choose Custom under the Settings Option to customise Video Details with more precision

**Step 4:** Click on Export once you’ve decided on the resolution.

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-16.jpeg)

With this you will now have a video file that has been resized to a size or converted to a format that will hopefully function well with your desired platform.

**Note:** You can also reset the resolution of an entire project before hand in Wondershare Filmora by choosing the right configuration from the **Project Settings** option, found under the **File Tab**.

## The Bottom Line

Having read this piece, you may have noticed that software capable of resizing videos can prove quite useful. Wondershare Filmora is this, plus a lot more, its convenient and intuitive user interface is also something we believe will feel welcoming to users. Speaking of Handbrake, while effective and great for batch encoding — if you want to resize more than one video we recommend having Handbrake handy — its bare-bones interface can be intimidating. Regardless, both programs are convenient to utilize and perfectly capable of doing the task at hand with relative ease.

How your screen will look once you have imported a video file.

**Step 1:** Import Video File by choosing

* Single Import, or
* Batch Import

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-8.jpeg)

The Dimensions Dialog Box

**Step 3:** Modify resolution to ensure the clip you get is in the right setup.

**_Note:_** _If you see 1920 x 1080 on your screen, the first number (1920) stands for the width of the video file, while the second number (1080) stands for the height._

![resize-video-in-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-11.jpeg)

**Tip**

The one thing to keep in mind while using Option 2 is to ensure that the aspect ratio of the video file is maintained; this will prevent the final video from looking like its skewed and prevent it from becoming too tall or too wide

_Via Option 2 you can also add borders to the final video if desired, while resizing it to your liked resolution._
