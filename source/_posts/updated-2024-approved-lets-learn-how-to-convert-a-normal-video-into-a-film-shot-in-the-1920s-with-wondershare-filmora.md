**Step 1**: **Create A New Project** on the CapCut app's home screen. Browse and add the video you want to search for in slow-motion to the project.

**Step 2**: When you're ready to turn off the sound, go ahead and hit the **Mute clip audio** button first, so there will be no creep sound after applying the slow-motion effect.

**Step 3:** In case you just want to add a slo-mo effect to part of the video, you need to split the video accordingly. Split the portion of the video that will be slowed down by clicking on the **Split** button in the menu. And use the Split tool again to end the slow-motion effect to get a segment of the video.

**Step 4**: Tap the cut section of the video and then you will see the Speed option. Open the **Speed** menu by selecting it from the drop-down menu.

**Step** **5:** In CapCut, there are two methods to slow down a video, **Normal** and **Curve**, respectively. You may just choose the "**Normal**" option to make things easy. It is possible to reduce the video's frame rate by moving the speed slider to the left. You may, for example, make the pace 0.3 times slower. Apply a slow-motion effect by tapping the **Check** box.

Make a slow motion video at this stage to spice things up. CapCut allows you to add text, create transition effects, and more.
