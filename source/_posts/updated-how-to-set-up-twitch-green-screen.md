## How to Set Up Twitch Green Screen

Green screens are a fun way for creators to bring their personality to their stream, allowing them to dynamically alter their stream background and make their content appear even more engaging and polished. With Twitch green screen background, you can easily configure Chroma key settings and detect your green screen with a single click.

The twitch green screen attaches directly to the back of your chair. You don't have to worry about stands, or spacing behind your chair. Just attach it and go. This portable green screen can fit on the back of your chair a feature that makes it easy to assemble and use for start-up twitchers.

## How to set up a Green Screen with Twitch Studio

****Set Up Your Camera**

First things first, make sure that your camera is being detected on Twitch Studio. If you do not already have a layer with your webcam on your scene, click Edit Scene and add a webcam layer by clicking the + icon on the left next to Layers.

Once your webcam layer has been created, make sure that the desired device is selected, plugged in, and that you have not turned off every webcam (Camera icon on the bottom left of Twitch Studio).

****Set Up Your Green Screen**

Once your green screen is set up in your background, select your webcam layers to display your webcam settings.

We recommend using the Auto-Detect Color feature as it will automatically detect the best color code for you and will be a great base to work from. If you prefer, you can manually pick the color code by either providing the color code in the Color to Remove field or clicking on the colored square to display a color spectrum that you can select from.

The Chroma Key section is located at the bottom of the webcam settings, and you will be able to toggle the chroma key on and off by clicking the eye icon.

To adjust the chroma key settings, you can click on Edit Chroma Key. You will be able to change the color code and change similarity, edge transparency and color correction for the perfect fit.

## Conclusion

You probably already have an idea of how to use a green screen, at least in principle. You film something or someone in front of a colored background — the green screen — then you replace everything that’s in the color of the screen with other footage, images, charts, presentations, or whatever visuals you want. However, Chroma keying a live stream works almost the same way. The main difference is that you have to replace the green screen as you’re filming, rather than during editing.
