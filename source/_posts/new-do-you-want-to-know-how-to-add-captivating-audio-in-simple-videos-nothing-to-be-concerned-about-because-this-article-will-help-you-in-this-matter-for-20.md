Moreover, it can also be a moving vehicle or a logo as well. Tracking these moving elements in the frame can allow the editor to improve the areas which have high contrast or distinct features.

### Tracking Points

Selecting the object allows the software to identify specific points in the frame. These points can have distinct features or a high contrast that may affect the video quality. With the help of **video motion tracking**, the editor can note down these areas and improve them to enhance the viewer experience.

### Data Mapping

Once the software tracks the movements, it can be very useful for the editor. This is because it calculates the changes in position and rotation of each point. Moreover, it also maps the tracked data into a visual representation for the coordinating system. Using this system, the movements of the objects can be recreated in a 3D space.

### Using Effects and Refinement

After obtaining the motion tracking data, the video editor can apply different effects on the object. These effects can include adding graphics and text to the scene. Moreover, it can also help in animation or compositing visual elements. To ensure the accurate alignment of the effects, the editor may need to use extra tracking techniques or manual adjustments.
