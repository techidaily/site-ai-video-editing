## How Can You DIY VHS Overlay in After Effects?

The 90s generation is familiar with Video Home System video. Today, Moviemakers use VHS static overlay to give their videos an antique and vintage look.

The VHS glitch overlay has become increasingly popular as it changes the video's theme, tone, and whole look. Let's see how we can add DIY VHS overlay in after effects-

## Part 1：Step by Step DIY VHS Overlay in After Effects?

The retro "VHS Look" has become relatively trendy in recent years. The memories associated with the popular VHS trend has helped the trend make a comeback. Creating this effect in After Effects may seem to be a complicated process if you have not tried it before. But we have made it easier for you to add VHS overlay in Adobe After Effects. Follow the steps to add it in after effects-

Before you begin, download and install VHS preset if you haven't already. Remember that VHS preset only works with After Effects CC 2018 and up. So, make sure you have the recent version of After Effects or the one not older than the 2018 version.

Step 1: To create a VHS look on your video, drop any video of your choice into the project panel and give it a name, let's say, "VCR static overlay". Set the width and height to 1920 and 1080 px, respectively.

![changing composition settings on after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/changing-composition-settings-on-after-effects.jpg)

Step 2: Right-click on your video and select New Comp from Selection. Drag your video to a new composition and then go to Lumetri Color < Basic Correction. Add some contrast. You can set it to 50 or any other number of your choice. Then bring the white level down to -55.

![getting lumetri color effect to get vhs look](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/using-lumetri-color-effect-to-get-vhs-look.jpg)

Then open the Creative tab. Increase the faded film to 40\. Set sharpening to -70\. Bring vibrance to -30.

Note: Here, I changed the number to get the effect I wanted. You can change the numbers and set the values as per your requirements.

Now, click on the Curves option. Drag down the white curve and then align it with the original curve. Move the green curve up a bit and bring down the blue curve. Then comes the Vignette tab. Open it and set the number to -1.

![changing white green and blue curves on after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/changing-white-green-and-blue-curve-on-after-effects.jpg)

Step 3: Now, we will give our video a subtle RGB spit appearance. For that, we need to use the Channel Blur effect twice. First, go to Effect < Blur & Sharpen < Channel Blur. Set red blurriness to 20\. Turn on the repeat edge pixels. Then change the Blur Dimensions from horizontal and vertical to vertical.

![giving rgb split appearance to video with channel blur](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/giving-rgb-split-appearance-to-video-with-channel-blur.jpg)

Step 4: Again, go to Effect < Blur & Sharpen < Channel Blur. Set blue blurriness to 30\. Repeat the process of checking the repeat edge pixels box. Change the Blue Dimensions from horizontal and vertical to horizontal.

Step 5: Next comes giving the video artificial sharpening look using Unsharp Mask. So, go to Effect < Blur & Sharpen < Unsharp Mask. Under the Unmask Mask menu, set the amount to 100 and the radius to 10.

![using unsharp mask to give you video sharpening look](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/using-unsharp-mask-to-give-your-video-sharpening-look.jpg)

Step 6: To add a font to your video, simply search VHS font on Google. Look for the one you want to use in your video and download it. To give your video that authentic VHS-style look, we suggest downloading free VCR OSD Mono font and installing the font on your system.

Step 7: Go to Layer < New < Solid and choose any color. We chose white. Now, under Effects & Presets, search for a number. Drag it to the white solid. Choose the font VCR OSD Mono. You can change the number to time or date. You can also add time manually. Select the text tool, go to the source text, hold alt, and click on the stopwatch. Write "timeToCurrentFormat() and time will be displayed on the video. Let us say we want to see the date on the video instead of time. So, change the time to date. Drag the date to the bottom right of the video to give it the look of an old VHS tape.

If you are a beginner and want a simple VHS effect, you can follow these easy steps and create the VHS video that will transport you back to the 90s.

## Discover How You Can Use Vectorscope to Adjust Luminance, Color Grading, and More in Your Video Editing Projects

Our eyes process colors differently. When two people look at the same picture, they may see different shades of colors. In post-production, Vectorscopes help to color grade and make sure you get your images exactly right. This means that you will process the exact color that you want across devices. **Premiere Vectorscope** is a great choice for anyone looking to correct and grade colors. Using Vectorscope Premiere allows you to get quantitative data about your image for a more accurate assessment of colors within the film. In this article, we explore what comprises Premiere Pro Vectorscope and how to use them in video editing.

**Color Correction Editor** An easy-to-use video editor helps you make color correction and color grading experience for videos!

![Wondershare Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box.png)

## **Part 1\. Vectorscope: What is It and How to Read**

Vectorscopes provide a great post-production way for color correction. It is video scope that provides greater data about the color properties of an image. Another way to look at it is that a Vectorscope is a circular graph, which monitors the following information of an image. By looking at it, you can measure saturation outward from the center while hue is measured in a circular pattern.

The Vectorscope contains markings indicating the degree of saturation and hue in an image. The distance of the markings from the center indicates how saturated the color is in your image. In simple terms, the further the markings, the more saturated the color. The two main options of Vectorscope are HLS and YUV. The HLS displays the hue, lightness, saturation, and signal information at a glance. On the other hand, the YUV mode contains several color boxes, giving accurate levels of hue and saturation.

![vectorscope](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/demystifying-the-vectorscope-a-comprehensive-guide-for-premiere-pro-color-correction-1.JPG)

Vectorscopes are useful to filmmakers and editors to ensure greater conformity in a film as they transition from one shot to the next. When the camera captures an image with too much saturation, using a Vectorscope helps to reduce the said saturation. This makes Vectorscope a useful feature for color correction and color grading. Color correction involves altering the colors of an image within a film to provide consistency and tone for the film. On the other hand, color grading is more like a supercharged version of color correction. It refers to altering a film so that it matches a tone or theme. Since the two, grading and correction are important, more video editing will use a combination of both.

### **How to Read a Vectorscope**

Learning how to read a Vectorscope will make your video editing fun and easier. The best way is to view the Vectorscope in relation to the color wheel. When using Premiere Vectorscope, the colors are nicely labeled for anyone to understand. You only need to understand the primary colors of saturation and hue to accurately read a Vectorscope.

![reading vectorscope](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/demystifying-the-vectorscope-a-comprehensive-guide-for-premiere-pro-color-correction-2.JPG)

The hue color is the direction to which the marketer points. For instance, a marker pointing toward the boxes labeled “R” indicates that the hue is predominantly red. On the other hand, the saturation correlates to the length of the marker. The image is more saturated when the marker is furthest from the center of the wheel.

Keep note of the two boxes in each main color. The box that is close to the center indicates 75%, and you will normally avoid the marker extending beyond this first box. Any marketer that extends beyond this is known as non-broadcast safe or illegal colors. Although you may need to go beyond the first box in some projects for stylistic reasons, the general rule of thumb is to avoid that.

Without proper calibration, your images may end up looking too red or too blue. They will not look natural at all and will affect the overall quality of your video. Therefore, using the features within the vectorsope will help you color-grade your images to perfection.

## **Part 2\.** **[Vectorscope in Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html): A Brief Guide**

Just like many other video editing software, Adobe Premiere Pro offers Vectorscope to help in post-production. The best way to look at Vectorscope in Premiere Pro is to use the Color Correction workspace. Once you have launched the software, Click Window, followed by Workspace, and then Color Correction. Access the reference monitor directly to deliver the program.

The reference monitor will first display composite video. Clicking on the setting icon allows you to access the panel and choose the video scope you want to use. Now, this is how you use the Vectorscope in Premiere Pro:

### **1\. Reading a Vectorscope on Premiere Pro**

A Vectorscope is similar to a color wheel. It displays colors in the same places as the wheel, with cyan to the bottom right and red to the top left. When you see a dot or line in the Vectorscope, you can tell it is giving you information about the color or chrominance of a shot. Essentially, this information is the hue (specific color) and the saturation (the strength of that hue).

![color wheel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/demystifying-the-vectorscope-a-comprehensive-guide-for-premiere-pro-color-correction-3.JPG)

As you examine the Vectorscope, you get to see how strong a particular color is by the length of the line from the center of the wheel. A longer line indicates that the color is more saturated. However, all Vectorscopes have small color targets. The Vectorscope points are lined with a drop-down used to read the scope. The default is set to 75%, which is a good limit for a typical broadcast system.

![drop-down](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/demystifying-the-vectorscope-a-comprehensive-guide-for-premiere-pro-color-correction-4.JPG)

### **2\. Adjusting Skin Tones**

A commonly used feature of the Premier Pro Vectorscope is the Skin Tone Line. With this feature, you get the line on the scope between the Yellow and the Red sections at about 10.30 or 11 o’clock position.

The Vectorscope skin tone line represents the color of blood flowing through the skin. You can use this line to check the accuracy of skin tone color representation regardless of the ethnicity of the person you’re filming. In particular, video images are more accurate

The major problem is figuring out how to look at skin tones in a shot with many other colors. With the skin tons line in Premiere Pro, color correction becomes easy and quick. You only need to use a garbage matte, which is found under video effects then keying. Adjust the points so that they cover the skin of the person on the shot, then look at the Premiere Pro Vectorscope to see your end results.

## **Part 1\. Vectorscope: What is It and How to Read**

Vectorscopes provide a great post-production way for color correction. It is video scope that provides greater data about the color properties of an image. Another way to look at it is that a Vectorscope is a circular graph, which monitors the following information of an image. By looking at it, you can measure saturation outward from the center while hue is measured in a circular pattern.

The Vectorscope contains markings indicating the degree of saturation and hue in an image. The distance of the markings from the center indicates how saturated the color is in your image. In simple terms, the further the markings, the more saturated the color. The two main options of Vectorscope are HLS and YUV. The HLS displays the hue, lightness, saturation, and signal information at a glance. On the other hand, the YUV mode contains several color boxes, giving accurate levels of hue and saturation.

![vectorscope](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/demystifying-the-vectorscope-a-comprehensive-guide-for-premiere-pro-color-correction-1.JPG)

Vectorscopes are useful to filmmakers and editors to ensure greater conformity in a film as they transition from one shot to the next. When the camera captures an image with too much saturation, using a Vectorscope helps to reduce the said saturation. This makes Vectorscope a useful feature for color correction and color grading. Color correction involves altering the colors of an image within a film to provide consistency and tone for the film. On the other hand, color grading is more like a supercharged version of color correction. It refers to altering a film so that it matches a tone or theme. Since the two, grading and correction are important, more video editing will use a combination of both.

### **How to Read a Vectorscope**

Learning how to read a Vectorscope will make your video editing fun and easier. The best way is to view the Vectorscope in relation to the color wheel. When using Premiere Vectorscope, the colors are nicely labeled for anyone to understand. You only need to understand the primary colors of saturation and hue to accurately read a Vectorscope.

![reading vectorscope](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/demystifying-the-vectorscope-a-comprehensive-guide-for-premiere-pro-color-correction-2.JPG)

The hue color is the direction to which the marketer points. For instance, a marker pointing toward the boxes labeled “R” indicates that the hue is predominantly red. On the other hand, the saturation correlates to the length of the marker. The image is more saturated when the marker is furthest from the center of the wheel.

Keep note of the two boxes in each main color. The box that is close to the center indicates 75%, and you will normally avoid the marker extending beyond this first box. Any marketer that extends beyond this is known as non-broadcast safe or illegal colors. Although you may need to go beyond the first box in some projects for stylistic reasons, the general rule of thumb is to avoid that.

Without proper calibration, your images may end up looking too red or too blue. They will not look natural at all and will affect the overall quality of your video. Therefore, using the features within the vectorsope will help you color-grade your images to perfection.

## **Part 2\.** **[Vectorscope in Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html): A Brief Guide**

Just like many other video editing software, Adobe Premiere Pro offers Vectorscope to help in post-production. The best way to look at Vectorscope in Premiere Pro is to use the Color Correction workspace. Once you have launched the software, Click Window, followed by Workspace, and then Color Correction. Access the reference monitor directly to deliver the program.

The reference monitor will first display composite video. Clicking on the setting icon allows you to access the panel and choose the video scope you want to use. Now, this is how you use the Vectorscope in Premiere Pro:

### **1\. Reading a Vectorscope on Premiere Pro**

A Vectorscope is similar to a color wheel. It displays colors in the same places as the wheel, with cyan to the bottom right and red to the top left. When you see a dot or line in the Vectorscope, you can tell it is giving you information about the color or chrominance of a shot. Essentially, this information is the hue (specific color) and the saturation (the strength of that hue).

![color wheel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/demystifying-the-vectorscope-a-comprehensive-guide-for-premiere-pro-color-correction-3.JPG)

As you examine the Vectorscope, you get to see how strong a particular color is by the length of the line from the center of the wheel. A longer line indicates that the color is more saturated. However, all Vectorscopes have small color targets. The Vectorscope points are lined with a drop-down used to read the scope. The default is set to 75%, which is a good limit for a typical broadcast system.
