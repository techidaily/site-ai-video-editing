Since the era of [social media](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), content creation has become a new trend. Creators around the globe can interact with their followers from a single platform. It gives them a chance to share their ideas and showcase their talents. Hence, here is how slow-motion videos benefit a creator in his journey:

* **In Video Tutorials:** Do you have a channel where you post tutorials to perform a specific task? This effect can help you slow down the video for the audience to absorb your words. It helps creators to show their viewers that they genuinely care about them. A video where basics and details are discussed is considered right.
* **In Revealing Details:** We encounter situations where the camera cannot capture a moment right. This is because the normal playback speed cannot highlight video details. On the other hand, a slo-mo takes proper time to showcase details. These help handle an event planning or dress designing page.
* **In Creating Aesthetics:** Another application of slo-mos is that they help with creativity. Adding this effect at the right time and duration enhances visuals. Moreover, adding a slo-mo effect gives the video an aesthetic appeal. It can enhance the visuals of a travel, cooking, or fashion video.

In such documentaries, slo-mos are used to present a natural phenomenon. It helps the viewers understand how a certain process occurs. Moreover, it focuses on small details in an ecosystem to explain better.
* **In Reflecting Content:** Next time you watch reels, notice that slo-mos catch your attention. Videos with the right speed manipulation appeal to the eyes, and viewers often watch them again. In addition, they help focus on the specifics of a gadget, fashion product, or more.

The GIF image format is a bitmap image format that supports up to 8 bits per pixel. APNG (Animated Portable Network Graphics) is a format for animated images that supports 24 bits per pixel and 8 bits of transparency, which is not available in GIFs. Backward compatibility with non-animated PNG files is also maintained.

Because the initial frame of an APNG file saves as a regular PNG stream, it can display by most conventional PNG decoders. Extra chunks can hold frame speed data and different animation frames (as provided by the original PNG specification).

Is APNG superior to GIF? APNG files are smaller and have more outstanding quality than GIF files. However, GIF is more compatible than APNG. Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome, and Opera support APNG, while practically all online browsers support GIF.

The .apng (Animated Portable Network Graphics) extension is an unofficial extension to the Portable Network Graphics format (PNG ).

APNG files have the same.png extension as PNG files and can be opened by software like Mozilla Firefox, Chrome with APNG compatibility, and iOS 10's iMessage apps.

### 2\. How to Create APNG File?

**Step 1: Select Image**

Click File > Open to bring up the photo you wish to convert to PNG.

**Step 5: Compress**

The compression rate is set to "Best" by default, but the Save Options box contains a few extras to check if you want a bit more control over the compression of your file. The file size will be determined by changing the compression rate; the higher the value, the less compression will be utilized when saving your image.

![Compressed](https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/2018-08-21_16h58_41.png?trim=1,1&bg-color=000&pad=1,1)

The GIF image format is a bitmap image format that supports up to 8 bits per pixel. APNG (Animated Portable Network Graphics) is a format for animated images that supports 24 bits per pixel and 8 bits of transparency, which is not available in GIFs. Backward compatibility with non-animated PNG files is also maintained.

Because the initial frame of an APNG file saves as a regular PNG stream, it can display by most conventional PNG decoders. Extra chunks can hold frame speed data and different animation frames (as provided by the original PNG specification).

The GIF image format is a bitmap image format that supports up to 8 bits per pixel. APNG (Animated Portable Network Graphics) is a format for animated images that supports 24 bits per pixel and 8 bits of transparency, which is not available in GIFs. Backward compatibility with non-animated PNG files is also maintained.

Because the initial frame of an APNG file saves as a regular PNG stream, it can display by most conventional PNG decoders. Extra chunks can hold frame speed data and different animation frames (as provided by the original PNG specification).

Is APNG superior to GIF? APNG files are smaller and have more outstanding quality than GIF files. However, GIF is more compatible than APNG. Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome, and Opera support APNG, while practically all online browsers support GIF.

Select several files on your computer using the "Choose Files" button or the dropdown menu to select an online file from a URL, Google Drive, or Dropbox.

![Choose file](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/online-gif-to-apng-converter-9.jpg)

**Step 2**: Choose Image Format

Determine the image format, quality, and size you want to use. You choose to use the original image size or select "Change width and height" and enter a custom image size. 1920x1080 is an example of a \[width\]x\[height\] format. Only a few image formats support the picture quality choice, such as JPG, WEBP, or AVIF. The value ranges from 1 (lowest picture quality and highest compression) to 100 (highest image quality and lowest compression) (best quality but least effective compression). If this field is left blank, the converter will use the estimated quality of your input image if found; otherwise, 92 by default. JPG, PNG, TIFF, GIF, HEIC, BMP, PS, PSD, WEBP, TGA, DDS, EXR, J2K, PNM, or SVG are examples of target image formats.

You can convert non-animated GIF files to APNG format. APNG files have the same.png extension as PNG files and can be opened by software like Mozilla Firefox, Chrome with APNG compatibility, and iOS 10's iMessage apps.

**Step 5: Compress**

The compression rate is set to "Best" by default, but the Save Options box contains a few extras to check if you want a bit more control over the compression of your file. The file size will be determined by changing the compression rate; the higher the value, the less compression will be utilized when saving your image.

![Compressed](https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/2018-08-21_16h58_41.png?trim=1,1&bg-color=000&pad=1,1)
