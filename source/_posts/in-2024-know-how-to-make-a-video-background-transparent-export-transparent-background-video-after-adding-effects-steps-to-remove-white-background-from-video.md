## How To Add Text In After Effects

In almost every video you come across, you will see text added to the video in different parts. There are various reasons why adding text to videos becomes a necessity. First of all, you can highlight the underlying message or key points in your video. Along with audio and video, the viewers will have another cue point in the form of text that they can retain in their memory for longer. You add animated texts to video to make the video interesting to watch and break the monotony of visual cues only.

Besides, you may have to want credits and add intro as well as outro to your video where adding text is almost a necessity. Text can help your viewer get the context of your video and make sense of the content. After Effects is a popular video editor thanks to its visual effects, text animation animations, and instant video enhancement tools. We will illustrate the different ways of adding text in After Effects in simple steps.

## Part 1\. Add Text in After Effects with Horizontal Type Tool

Once you have imported your video clip into the Timeline, there are several ways you can add text to your video. First of all, you can right-click on the Timeline and select New> Text to create an empty text layer and add any text you want. Similarly, you can go to Layer> New> Text option to do the same. But the easiest way of adding text in After Effects is by using Horizontal Type Tool. Here are the steps on how you can add text in AE with the type tool.

Step1Once you have imported your video into the Timeline, click on Horizontal Type Tool located in the top bar to add any text. You can press Ctrl+T(Windows) or Command+H(Mac) to get it instantly.

![horizontal type tool ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/horizontal-type-tool-ae.jpg)

Step2Click on the video where you want to place the text and type your desired text there. After you are done adding your text, press Enter key in Num pad to exit out of the text field in the video.

![add text field ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/add-text-field-ae.jpg)

Step3This will automatically create a text layer on Timeline. You can now move the text and place it anywhere you want. You can also modify the text style and add animation which we will illustrate in the next section.

## Part 2\. Use the Character Panel to Edit Text in AE

When you select Type tool and add your desired text, you get a default style for the text. It is most likely that you have to modify the text style such as changing color, font, and size to fit in your video seamlessly. That is when you have to visit the Character Panel. Character Panel is where you get to edit the font of the text you have typed, increase or decrease the font size, change the font color, and much more. Apart from that, you can increase the spacing between lines when your text is a paragraph instead of a few words. Here are the steps to use Character Panel to edit text in AE.

Step1Once you have typed your text using Horizontal Type tool on the video, click on the text.

Step2Go to Character panel located in the right side of the screen. If it is minimized, click on the panel to expand it.

![character panel after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/character-panel-after-effects.jpg)

Step3The first option in the panel is the font of the text. By the side of the font is the text color. You can use the color picker tool to choose any color as per your preference.

![choose font color ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/choose-font-color-ae.jpg)

Step4Below the font, you can select the font style such as regular, bold, italics, and likewise. The subsequent part is to change the font size and adjust vertical spacing between lines and horizontal spacing between characters.

![select font style ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/select-font-style-ae.jpg)

Step5The next section deals with Stroke option as well as fill the text option. You can fill the background of the text with any desired color.

![stroke option after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/stroke-option-after-effects.jpg)

## Part 3\. Add Animated Text to Video with Animation Presets

Now that you have added a static text and set the text format as per your preference, it is time to animate the text. A static text in a video does not look appealing, and animated texts make the video eye-catching instantly. You can use text animation presets in After Effects to add animated text to video. Here are the steps to add animated text to video with animation presets and effects.

Step1Click on the text on your video that you want to animate. Go to Effects and Presets panel located on the right side.

![effects and presets after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/effects-and-presets-after-effects.jpg)

Step2Under Effects and Presets panel, Click on Text option. This will open all the different categories of animation presets available that you can apply to the text on your video.

![text option under effects presets](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/text-option-under-effects-presets.jpg)

Step3Select any desired animation that you want to apply to the text and drag and drop the animation on the text in the composition window. Play the video and watch the applied animation on the text.

![apply text effects ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/apply-text-effects-ae.jpg)
