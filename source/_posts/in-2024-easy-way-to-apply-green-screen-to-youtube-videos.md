## Best Places to find Green Screen Effects

There are resources on the platform for all kinds of creators, including video editors, content creators, social media influencers, and marketers. You get unlimited access to all these resources for a single price when you subscribe to Filmstock. While there are other marketplaces that offer similar options, Filmstock does things differently.

**Green Screen Effects**

1\. Balance Beam

Ever wanted to walk across a small beam way high up in the air? Me neither, but you can make a cool effect that looks like you did. Throwing a green screen on the ground and then building a balance beam over top of it you can start recording the main shot. Strap a GoPro to your head and look down while walking across the beam.

2\. Shrink Effect

Okay this one is really easy. Take some footage of a person walking in front of a green screen, ideally looking at something to be featured in the main shot to sell the effect. Then take a close up of a small object. Key out the green behind the person, take the footage and drop it over your close up, and then scale it to match. Duplicate it, mirror it horizontally to act as a reflection and then drop the opacity and add some blur to make it look more realistic. It’s a fun little trick.

3\. Floating Object

This is a simple one, making an object appear to be floating. This is another two clip shot. First, take a shot with the object hanging in front of a blue screen. Then on the same location, take another shot but while pretending to levitate the hammer. Masking around the hammer will get rid of the string for hanging, key out the blue, and then dropping it on top of the other clip is all you need.

A green screen is a green surface used as a background when filming so that any image can replace the screen behind the actor or presenter. Shooting with a green screen involves filming a person or adding visual effects in front of a solid color. Then, by digitally removing or “keying out” that color, you can drop that scene onto the background of your choice in post-production. Removing the colored background is also referred to as “chroma keying.”

**Steps with Images**

The first step is to record footage in front of a green screen so that you can import it into WeVideo as a media file. To capture footage that is optimal for the Green Screen effect, please ensure the following:

* There is ample lighting distributed evenly around you with no shadows.
* You are in front of a **solid background with no creases**. Green or blue is the recommended color for your background.
* The quality of your camera is high enough so that the footage is not pixelated or grainy. 720p HD footage or above is recommended.

Step 2) Add media to the Timeline

Once you've captured the footage you want to use for the Green Screen effect, import that media file and add it to the Timeline. Remember to place the green screen footage in the Video 2 track and the clip you would like to use as the background in the Video 1 track.

If you are using more than two video tracks, place the green screen footage in the track above whichever track holds the background footage to ensure proper layering techniques are used.

 Step 3) Open the clip editor

Double click on the green screen clip in the Timeline to open the clip editor. In the clip editor, navigate to the Color Keying tab.

 Step 4) Use the color picker tool

Select the color picker tool and then click anywhere on the green screen footage to apply the effect.

 Step 5) __(optional)_ Adjust the color settings

The Green Screen effect should automatically apply without the need to adjust the color settings. However, if you would like to make these additional modifications, you can use the scroll bars to make the following adjustments:

* ****Show**\- You can select Mask to reveal a black and white representation of the mask you are applying using the color keying tool. Notice that the black area represents transparent sections of your video, while the white area represents opaque sections.
* ****Color Balance**\- This adjusts how selective the effect is. The further right you scroll, the wider the range of tints and shades are removed.
* ****Color Sensitivity**\- This smooths out any pixelation and rough edges of color that remain.
* ****Defringe**\- This helps reduce color bleeding at the edges of your mask. The left and right sliders control the level of white and black respectively to help match the edges of the mask with your new background color.

## Best Frame Rate for 4K Video

People in the videography ad filmmaking world use complicated terminology like Ultra High Def to describe 4K videos. Even though you are not a complete stranger to the term 4K, you might still be unaware of what it means.

In a nutshell, 4K is the highest resolution you can watch your movies and videos. The details are incredibly crisp, meaning you can see pimples or the pores on an actor's face through the screen. However, the frame rate will significantly affect how you enjoy a 4K video. Therefore, it would be wise to learn how to choose the ideal frame rate to suit your needs.

Keep reading this article to learn more about frame rates and which is suitable for a 4K video.

![4k video frame rate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/4k-video-frame-rate.jpg)

## How Do Frame Rates Affect Video Viewing?

The motion will appear smoother if your video contains more frames per second. Even though your viewers are not tech-savvy, they will definitely notice the difference.

Consider a video of a duck drinking water from a pond. If you film and playback the same video in 24, 30, and 60fps, you will see a noticeable difference, assuming your shutter speed is set according to the 180-degree shutter rule.

If you are filming quicker motions of wildlife and birds, you are better off sticking to higher resolutions to give the viewer a pleasant experience and ensure the motion is fluid.

On the other hand, lower frame rates like 24fps are ideal for human movements, which are not as smooth as wildlife. Suppose you used 60fps for a cinematic film or a TV show. The video would look a bit odd because that is not how we see things in the natural world. In addition, your viewers aren't used to such smoothness.

## Viewing Requirements of 4K Videos

You may have heard about 4K videos and wondered what people mean by that term. In simple terms, a 4K video is a high-resolution video that is four times the usual 1080p HD video. When it comes to 4K videos, there are two standard resolutions. One of them is the standard for Digital Cinema which is 4096\*2160 pixels. The other is for television and is 3840\*2160 pixels.

To stream 4K content, you need a bandwidth between 10 and 20 Mbps. On the other hand, streaming platforms like Netflix require higher bandwidths of not less than 15 Mbps. In addition to the bandwidth we mentioned earlier, you need a 4KTV or 4K monitor.

This specification was brought up at the UHD Alliance, a union of more than 50 tech companies working together to support 4K content. Tech companies ought to ensure the devices they produce are compatible with 4K videos, which are becoming increasingly popular.

Below is a list of requirements any electronic device should fulfill before being termed a 4KTV or 4K monitor.

![requirements of 4k videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/4k-video-requirements.jpg)

* A resolution of not less than 3840\*2160.
* A 10-bit color depth that allows for 1,024 shades of red, yellow, and blue.
* A high dynamic range for color accuracy.
* An excellent combination of black level and peak brightness. The peak brightness should not exceed 1,000 nits, and the black level shouldn't go below 0.5 nits. Alternatively, the peak brightness shouldn't exceed 540 nits; neither should the black level plummet below 0.0005 nits.

## Best Frame Rate for 4K Video

We all know that the frame rate you choose for your video will significantly impact the viewer's experience and the overall style of your video. The frame rate will also affect how the video looks. For instance, a frame rate lower than 24fps will make your video look unprofessional and of poor quality. The content will also flicker because there aren't many still images per second.

On the other hand, a lower FPS causes the file size to be smaller, causing it to consume a lower bandwidth. The vice versa is also true. Now that you understand these facts, you might wonder which frame rate would be best for your 4K videos.

Research reveals that the most acceptable frame rate is 30fps and 60fps. This is because the motion will appear natural to the human eye without being too fast or unrealistic.

If you are wondering what is the best frame rate for 4k videos, we urge you to select 60fps because it contains more detail. The higher frame rate also makes the motion look very smooth and crisp. Perhaps you want to shoot a slow-motion video. In that case, an even higher frame rate of 120fps would be ideal.

## How To Choose The Base Frame Rates for Your Next Video

Choosing a frame rate for your videos is not complicated. However, it is not a straightforward process either. There are numerous moving parts that ought to work harmoniously for your video to turn out perfect and guarantee your audience will have a pleasant viewing experience. Before we dive into choosing the best frame rate for your 4K videos, let's help you understand the filmmaking process.

Most filmmakers and videographers see it fit to shoot videos in 120p or 4K. This step makes their work easier during the editing process. If the raw footage is in 4K, they can de-emphasize or retain specific plot points that would look great in the final video. However, not everyone is shooting a video for Hollywood. Therefore, shooting in 4K on your laptop for your YouTube channel might be difficult.

Below are some factors you should consider when choosing the best frame rate for a 4k video.

![factors for choosing frame rate for videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/factors-for-choosing-frame-rate.jpg)

#### File size

Shooting your video at a higher frame rate means more still images are packed into a single second of the video. Therefore, you will end up with a larger file size. If you want to shoot a video for your YouTube channel, it would be wise to stick to a smaller frame rate.

#### Purpose

It wouldn't make sense to shoot a talking head video at more than 24fps. However, a higher frame rate would be ideal for a travel vlog, where the details need to be crisp.

#### Medium of delivery

The standard frame rate for television is 24fps. On the other hand, it would be best to stick to a higher frame rate of 60fps if you intend to shoot content for the silver screen.

#### Motion in the video

Lastly, the movement within the video will play a massive role in the frame rate you choose. The faster the motion, the higher the frame rate needs to be. For instance, action movies don't do well in frame rates of less than 60 fps.

Therefore, it would be wise to increase your knowledge base and learn everything there is to know about 4K videos and how to set the best frame rates.
