As Final Cut Pro X natively supports R3D/ProRes RAW files, there's no necessity to support them. Inside the extension, you can change the transcoding codec, color space, output file resolution, delayering mode, and highlight recovery. Color Finale Transcoder lets you change RAW files' color temperature/tint, ISO, and sharpness/detail. Import a preview LUT to see how your film will look.
