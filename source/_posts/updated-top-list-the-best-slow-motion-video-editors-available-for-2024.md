## Bonus Part: Get the Perfect Results of Slow-Motion Video with Wondershare Filmora - Desktop Solution

In this section, you have read about so many **slow-mo editors** that you might be bored by now. However, one common drawback that all of them had was versatility. They offered high-speed manipulation settings but with limited additional features. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is a world-class, all-in-one video editing software. Anyone can use it, from a beginner to a professional or from an Android user to an iOS user.

When you enter this **slow-motion video converter**, it displays two types of speed modification. One is the Uniform Speed option, while the other one is Speed Ramping. Both of them excel at their tasks and offer custom speed and duration settings. Filmora has recently introduced the “Optical Flow” option in its latest V13 upgrade. This helps to smoothen out a slo-mo video by adding frame rates.

### Steps to Slow Down Video in Filmora

In this section, we will discuss the Filmora Speed Ramping feature to create a slo-mo. If you are a beginner and have never edited before, this feature suits you the best. It has over 6-speed ramping templates for adding creative speed change effects. You can modify these models to fashion a slo-mo, and here is how to do it:

##### Step 1Access the Speed Feature

After opening Filmora and opening a project, select the clip in the timeline and go to the settings panel. From there, reach the "Speed" > "Speed Ramping" tabs and select a preset. If you don't like the featured presets, click on "Customize" for manual editing.
