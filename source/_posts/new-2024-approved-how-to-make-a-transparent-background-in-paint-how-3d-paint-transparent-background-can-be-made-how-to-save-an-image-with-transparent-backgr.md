## Part 1: Popular Visual Effects you can add to Zoom

You may apply one of four main graphic effects to your Zoom meetings. The visual effects that you may use in your next Zoom video chat are briefly summarized below.

### 1\. Visual Backgrounds

Virtual backdrops may transform any plain wall into an artistic setting. Zoom provides you the choice to add photographs to your backdrop in addition to offering you a few pre-made backdrops. Zoom lets you add a movie to your backdrop in addition to simply photographs. With the help of this imaginative feature, gather your pals and enjoy your favorite meme or video. A presentation's collection of photos, a video, or a single image may all serve as virtual backdrops. A green screen would often be used as your real backdrop and consistent lighting would be required.

To avoid having to reveal your real surroundings while in a conference, you may add any picture or video as a virtual backdrop in Zoom. You have the option of adding own photos and movies or selecting from the pre-existing backdrop films and images. The file type for video backgrounds should be MP4 or MOV, and the resolution should range from 360p to a maximum of 1080p. Ensure that the mirroring of your video is deselected in the Zoom's Video settings if your backdrop picture has text that may be read. By using virtual backdrops, you may alter the background of your video as it appears to the audience member with whom you are speaking. During the video conference you're in, the other participants will be able to view your face and body overlaid on the backdrop of your choice.

### 2\. Filters

With these filters, you can have fun in all of your Zoom meetings! Filters are a fun way to spend time with loved ones who are far away, particularly at a period when maintaining social distance is crucial. Filters are the modifications you make to yourself during Zoom meetings (such as a mustache, beard, etc.). They enliven the proceedings and contribute to the fun and memorability of your Zoom meetings.

Your films' colors may be changed, and video filters can also add new aspects. By selecting a filter appropriate for each event, like team meetings or game nights, you may create the right atmosphere. You may embellish your face in the video with flowers or animal traits by using Zoom's various filters. Alternately, you might just convert your video's color to black and white. The video filters from a different program, however, allow you to apply more vibrant filters and place a greater emphasis on special effects.

### 3\. Lighting and Touch-ups

The Lighting function enhances lighting effects and makes adjustments for low light situations to make you seem more professional during a Zoom conference. Similar to this, Touch-up enhances your facial characteristics by making your skin shine, erasing wrinkles, and giving your face a radiant appearance.

On your Zoom videos, changing your lighting and applying touch-ups may improve how you seem. By adjusting your lighting, you can make even dim illumination look bright. By doing touch-ups, you may get a smoother skin texture and get rid of any obvious imperfections.

### 4\. Studio Effects

Zoom has been developing on a new feature called Studio Effects that would give customers the option of using virtual cosmetics in their movies. They are still checking it out before formally releasing it since it is still in beta. However, it is still available to users under the Backgrounds & Filters area. You may adjust the opacity as you like. You have the option to choose a new color or one of the predefined colors. Additionally, you may decide to employ the face effects in all of your next meetings, albeit doing so might be problematic if you use Zoom for business. Don't worry if you're running late. Zoom can give your face a natural-looking cosmetic makeover in only one minute!

This function is intended for less formal settings, such as gatherings of friends or family. Anyone who wants to seem more professional during meetings has access to Studio Effects, which offers the choice of various eyebrow colors, beards, and lipsticks. These are a few recently added features. You may add mustaches, beards, and brows in a variety of designs, hues, and intensities. Additionally, you have the option of coloring your lips.

Step 6: Perform the same process for the rest of the tracks. Time the titles to match the clip’s ending. Now, add a dissolve transition at the end of the clip. Trim the clip into two parts and apply square blur by navigating to the "Effects" tab to blur the video clips.

![add dissolve transition and effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/create-cinematic-style-videos-6.jpg)

Step 7: Moving on, adjust the alpha for blur intensity. Add a dissolve transition between the cuts. In the final step, go to the "Animation" and then "Customize." Reframe the last clip and animate a zoom-out effect. Reduce the "Scale" percent to do so. A creative cinematic intro is ready!
