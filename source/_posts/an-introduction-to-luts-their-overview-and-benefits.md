## Part 1 What GIF/Video Can Crash Discord (Explained)?

As a result of the fact that some GIFs/Videos can crash Discord due to the RAM overload method within the GIF/Video file, hidden contents out of frame probably. More so, there are GIF/ Video that makes your Discord client reload. As soon as you see it play, your Discord will reload like it does when pressing "ctrl + r." This bug does not work on the iOS client since the Gif appears as an image (so far tested in windows and iOS clients)

To solve this, we recommend that you use **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** in the production of Gifs and Videos as this will help stop the **Discord crash GIFs** due to its exclusive features that help to prevent the crashing of Discord.
