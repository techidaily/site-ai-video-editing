Go to the default folder on the top left and rename it Cam\_A.

**2\. Organize your Timeline and Video Tracks**

##### Step1 Create Tracks for Picture Editing

Keep the first three tracks for picture editing. These tracks are usually for picture editing that includes footage with no effects or some simple effects—for example resizing, keyframing, transitions, or Green Screen.

![create tracks for picture editing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_7.jpg)

##### Step2 Create Tracks for Temporary Footage

Set up the fourth track for the temporary footage or placeholders so you can quickly switch the temporary footage without spending extra time looking for them.

![create tracks for temporary footage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_8.jpg)

##### Step3 Create Tracks for Effects

Set the fifth video track as the effect track. It will include all effects from firmware that do not apply to the footage directly.

![create tracks for effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_9.jpg)

![create tracks for on and off content](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_10.jpg)

**3\. Organize your Audio Tracks**

##### Step1 Create Tracks for Dialects

The first two tracks are usually for dialects. You can include all the dialects of characters in these tracks. Keep one track for each character. If you have more characters, feel free to assign more tracks to them.

![create tracks for dialects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_11.jpg)

##### Step2 Create Tracks for Additional Audio

The third audio track could be for any additional audio, such as voiceover. If you don't have a voiceover in your video, you can leave it empty.

![create tracks for ambient sound](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_14.jpg)

**4\. Color Code Your Clips**

Suppose you want to make the timeline even easier to view. In that case, you can select all clips from a camera or a subject and color code them into a specific color. For example, you can color code the footage from camera A in red, camera B in yellow, and Camera C in blue. Now, when you look at the Timeline, you can quickly distinguish footage from different cameras.

![color code your clips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_16.jpg)

## Part 2: Pro Tips about Improving Video Editing Efficiency

**1\. Rename Individual Clips**

It would be much simpler to organize the timeline if you could quickly rename individual clips. Cut a clip into smaller segments and give each clip a different name. Make sure these clips have a name other than the source video to avoid confusion.

**2\. Remove Empty Timeline**

For quick video editing, timeline organization is essential. Organize your materials and footage at all times to prevent delays. Put everything in the correct folders with the proper labels. To keep your timeline organized, select "Delete Empty Tracks" from the context menu when right-clicking on the track window on the left.

**3\. Use Keyboard Shortcuts**

Knowing keyboard shortcuts allows you to carry out the editing process quickly and precisely.

**4\. Select Good Music**

Don't only concentrate on the images; the music also affects how well your video comes out. For example, suppose you're making a drama movie. In that case, you should pick the right music track to evoke particular emotions in your viewers.

**5\. Add Text and Graphics**

Depending on the style of the video, adding text, graphics, or stock video to your project could be helpful. You should provide more text than just the title for some videos.

## Summary
