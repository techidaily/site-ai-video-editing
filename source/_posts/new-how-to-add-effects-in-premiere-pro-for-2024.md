Whether to use the built-in webcam of your laptop or the computer you’re using or you can use a personal computer screen recorder like OBS Studio (Open Broadcaster Software).

* I changed the Title and the Description as an example and the thumbnail as well. You can edit it when you continue to scroll down. You'll choose what kind of category it fits in. If you want, you can also add it to your Playlist and you’ll choose your audience, if it’s suitable for kids or not.

![create stream details](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/create-stream-details.jpg)

* And since my YouTube Channel was already monetized, I have the options to monetize the live streaming too.

![create stream monetization](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/create-stream-monetization.jpg)

* As what it says, you need to customize the live stream according to your preference.

![create stream customization](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/create-stream-customization.jpg)

* And the final step before you can actually go on live, you will choose the visibility of your live broadcast. Usually, most of the people choose **_Public_** located at the bottom area of the options listed in the image below.

![create stream visibility](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/create-stream-visibility.jpg)

* The image below shows how it looks like after you click the “DONE” button. And the only thing that you need is to click the “GO LIVE” button and everyone can participate on your live streaming.

![go live on youtube](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/go-live-on-youtube.jpg)

And here's an actual example of a Live streaming that I’ve already done before on my YouTube Channel. I used OBS Studio in presenting the information that I needed, to convey the message to the audiences that are interested in learning Hebrew language to be exact.

![record youtube live stream](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/record-youtube-live-stream.jpg)

During the live streaming, you can see people interacting with you on live and that’s totally awesome!

**Live streaming is essential for your YouTube Channel success for two main reasons:**

1. You can minimize the part of editing a raw vlog and that is time consuming, you can just click the “Go Live” button and follow all the required steps and you can share all your ideas through everyone who will watch your live streaming. You can exchange thoughts, interact with them right away. You can also enhance your speaking skills in front of the camera. A very much needed ability if you want to be a YouTuber like us.
2. If you’re a newbie in vlogging, YouTube set its requirements for you to be their YouTube Partner; which includes 1000 subscribers and 4000 watch hours (240,000 minutes). So, if you want to get pass above it as fast as you could, YouTube livestreaming could be the best key to achieve it. Imagine you're going to be on live for about 3 hours in a row, so that’s 180 minutes already.

To sum it up, if you’re someone who wants to share your ability to the virtual world out there; then YouTube platform can be one of your go-to-stage. You can also choose Facebook if you want to target large audiences. Although YouTube is the second largest search engine next to Google, I think Facebook are a way ahead when it comes to reaching potential viewers or audiences because Facebook statistics show that more than two billion users have an account, 65 million businesses have Facebook pages and advertisers are crazy about it. Most of our friends and relatives are on Facebook. And that’s freaking insane. So, what are you waiting for, choose your social platform and GO ON LIVE![Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

## 3 Ways To Stream And Record At The Same Time

The popularity of live streaming has exploded recently. A live stream is simply a video broadcast in real-time over the internet. It's a great way to connect with people directly, whether for a gaming session, a cooking show, or a Q&A.

## Way 1\. Use OBS To Stream And Record Video At The Same Time

## Way 2\. Use Twitch To Save Your Streams

Twitch is the most popular and best live streaming platform that allows gamers to broadcast their gameplay to a live audience and also gives them the ability to save their past broadcasts, or **"streams."**

This feature can be useful to save your live stream for later viewing or share your stream with someone who missed it.

### Features

Twitch offers a variety of features that make it a unique and powerful game streaming platform. Some of the most notable ones are:

* **Live streaming:** Twitch allows gamers to share their gameplay in real-time with other gamers around the world. This live aspect of the platform makes it unique and engaging.

**You can save your stream on Twitch in two ways:**

### Steps

Here are the quick steps to saving a stream on your PC from Twitch. But first, you need to enable Twitch VODs before starting your broadcast in the following way:
