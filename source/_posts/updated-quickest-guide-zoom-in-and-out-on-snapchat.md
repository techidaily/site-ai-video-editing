### How to make OBS green screen settings better

Using green screens for filmmaking isn't the most complicated or difficult thing in the world but it certainly has its pitfalls. If you ask any experienced filmmaker what to look out for when using a green screen, chances are they're going to mention lighting about a billion times and that's for good reason.

### Tips on How to make OBS green screen settings better

* Evenly light your green screen so you can get a good key.
* Watch out for light flares. Use some a matte box or your trusty paw to block out any unwanted light.
* When lighting, try to create as much separation between your subject and the green screen as you can.
* Shutter speed: Minimize motion blur by raising your shutter speed to 1/80 or 1/100
* Aperture: Setting your aperture to f4 or f5.6 will give you slightly more depth of field, which will blur and smooth out your green screen.
* Format: Set your camera to the best recording format it has.
* ISO: Try to avoid high ISOs.

![crop-vidoe-in-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-vidoe-in-vlc-2.png)

Click the **Tools** on the menu and select the **Effects and Filters.**

![crop-vidoe-in-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-vidoe-in-vlc-3.png)

After that, click on the **Video Effects** and under that select **Crop.** Doing this, will open the cropping editor.

![crop-vidoe-in-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-vidoe-in-vlc-4.png)

You need to enter specific pixels on the **left**, **right, top** and **bottom**. This will depend on your preferences. If it is your first time and you don’t know the exact pixels then just input what you think would be enough.

![crop-vidoe-in-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-vidoe-in-vlc-5.png)

After entering your preferred pixels, you can preview it. If you would like to adjust then just simply repeat entering the specific pixels.

Congratulations on getting here! You finally cropped your video using the VLC media player.

Although there are disadvantages to using this as your cropping tool. Like for example you want the real-time preview of what you’ve changed in your video. This would be a turn off for some that want their outputs to be shown to them immediately. Aside from this, there is a chance that you will forget one step to make and thus, the whole process would need to start over from scratch. Lastly, is the freedom to batch crop multiple videos. This is especially important for those that need to have many clips in one video. A user might lose the continuity of the story within his video.

While one of its strong suits is the affordability of the software. It is completely free and has no additional charges that may surprise you in the future. Finally, your output won’t have watermarks that could destroy the aesthetics of your video.

What are your experiences with using it as a cropping tool? What would you recommend to improve it? It is up to you the user if you want to continue using this as your partner in removing the excess in your videos.
