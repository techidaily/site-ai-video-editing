## Step by Step to Cut Videos in Lightworks

Have you ever tried to edit a video, but found that it was too difficult? In this article, we will take a look at the software Lightworks and learn how to cut videos using it.

In this blog post, we will cover the cutting of videos in Lightworks. We will talk about what Lightworks is and how to download it. We'll also cover the general interface so you know which buttons do what. Finally, we'll talk about exporting a finished video and getting started with your next project in Lightworks!

## What is Lightworks?

Lightworks is an editing software created by a company called Lightworks. It's a free video editor that is incredibly powerful and has been used to edit some of the most popular films of recent years.

The software was originally designed for professional filmmakers, but it's now available for anyone to use for any type of project. You can download Lightworks from the website here - <https://www.lightworks.com/>

## Downloading the Software

First, download the Lightworks software from the website. You can do this by clicking on the big green button that says "Download the Latest Version". When you click on it, you'll be prompted to select your operating system and download the appropriate package.

Click "Next" and you'll see a license agreement and a prompt for installation details. Fill in your information and click "Next" again to start your installation.

When installation is complete, launch Lightworks by double-clicking on the Lightworks icon in your files section.

The first time you open Lightworks, you'll need to go through a few steps of initializing before using it for editing videos. This includes setting up your project settings and choosing whether or not to keep a backup of your previous work.

We will cover these initial steps separately in future blog posts, so don't worry if it's all unclear right now!

## The Interface

New users to the software will notice that there are four different windows. The first window is the Project window. This window shows you all of the footage you have loaded into your project, as well as any clips you've added to your project (see below) and edits you've made. You may also notice a timeline in this window; this is where you'll be placing your clips to create your video.

![cut-video-in-lightworks](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-lightworks-1.png)

The Toolbar is located at the top of all four windows and gives quick access to commonly used features like adding clips, cropping, cutting clips, and more.

![cut-video-in-lightworks](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-lightworks-2.png)

The Edit List Window displays all of the clips that are available for use in your Project Window or Timeline. They're not ordered chronologically; they're ordered by how they were imported into Lightworks.

![cut-video-in-lightworks](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-lightworks-3.png)

The Timeline Window displays a list of edited scenes from your edited project for viewing purposes only - it does not contain anything about editing or timeline manipulation tasks.

![cut-video-in-lightworks](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-lightworks-4.png)

The Monitor Window displays information about what's being displayed on screen at any given time. It can be used to preview videos before exporting them, previous scenes from the timeline, or rendered video frames after applying render effects.

## Step by Step in Cutting Videos in Lightworks

It's not difficult to cut or divide a clip in Lightworks, and it doesn't require a lot of time or effort. The following are the simple actions you'll need to do to get started:

Step 1: First and foremost, you must import your movie into Lightworks. The simplest way to do this is to drag the clip you wish to work with onto the timeline:

![cut-video-in-lightworks](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-lightworks-6.png)

Step 2: After you've uploaded your clips to the timeline, you'll be able to begin trimming them. To do so, simply slide the play head to the point where you wish to cut the clip and press the "C" key on your keyboard:

![cut-video-in-lightworks](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-lightworks-7.png)

Step 3: After you've cut the part you need, you'll need to erase the rest. To do so, use your mouse to select the part you don't want to erase, then use your mouse to pick the "Delete" option, or just click the "delete" button on your keyboard:

![cut-video-in-lightworks](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-lightworks-8.png)

Step 4: When you're finished, right-click the "ALL" option in the lower-left corner of the Timeline and select "Export" from the menu that appears:

And that is how to use Lightworks video editing software to cut and trim a clip, which is a very fundamental component of video editing and one of the simplest tasks to undertake. So, I hope you've learned how to chop and trim a video after reading this article.

## Motion Tracking Is the Process of Tracking the Movements of a Project in a Video. This Article Will Show You How to Apply Motion Tracking Effect Into Videos

Motion tracking makes it easier to follow the movement of objects and provide the sensed data to a program for additional processing. Motion tracking involves recording an object's movements that match a previously stored motion template. This has a wide range of uses, including in robotics, entertainment, sports, the military, and the entertainment industry. Additionally, it is utilized in the creation of video games and films. While motion tracking is frequently referred to as match movement in the film and video game industries, motion tracking is frequently referred to as motion capture in other contexts.

## Part 1\. Learning to Understand Motion Tracking

We need to ask the really crucial question now that we have a fundamental understanding of what it is. What in the world am I going to do with this? In order to do that, let's quickly review some excellent applications for motion tracking. You could,

Utilize tracking information to stabilize motion  
Add text or solids as additional compositional elements  
Add 3D elements to 2D footage  
Use effects or color gradation methods  
Replace the screens on your computer, mobile device, or television

These are just a few examples of how motion tracking might be useful. You need to be able to track motion in compositions of any complexity.

## Part 2\. What software do you need?

There are numerous options for motion tracking applications. With advantages and downsides, we've compiled a list of the finest motion tracking programs. The following are the best video editors for motion tracking in our opinion:

### Filmora

Wondershare created [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to enable you to fully express your creativity. FilmoraPro is the best option if you want to make some high-level modifications to your video. In addition to the pre-sets offered, it allows you to tweak the effects for a more expertly edited appearance.

![filmorapro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/MotionTracking1.png)

Motion tracking is currently its best feature. You may track a skater as they race across the ice or follow a boat as it travels. Use the motion tracking feature to add drama to your videos. You won't have to worry about getting lost because FilmoraPro features an amazingly simple UI. Simply click on the person or object you wish to track and choose Motion Track from the Effects menu.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

### Blender

Open-source and cost-free motion tracking software is called Blender. It's an excellent 3D creating tool. Modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing, video editing, 2D animation, and of course motion tracking is all supported.

![blender video editing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/blender-video-editing.jpg)

### Kdenlive

A motion tracker was recently added to Kdenlive, an open source and free video editing tool, under its Effects section. This program analyzes an object's tracking information and automatically generates a map of the object's motion. Following that, you can align a title, an image, an icon, and any other 2D elements to the moving object using this track. Motion Tracker's regularly updated algorithms are one of its key characteristics, which leads to a higher tracking success rate and faster tracking speed.

![kdenlive adjust slider](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kdenlive-adjust-slider.jpg)

### HitFilm Express

The free edition of HitFilm Express is a wonderful place to start if you're learning the fundamentals of 2D motion tracking. To get superior tracking results, it offers two motion tracking types: Single Point for tracking simply position and Double Points for tracking position, scale, or rotation of an object. You can either steady the video with the tracking data or change the point with a CG object.

![hitfilm express](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hitfilm-express.jpg)

Its optical flow tracking technique is outstanding. It successfully tracks a moving item that changes into multiple shapes or is veiled for a few frames by figuring out the brightness flow of the moving object. Beginners can therefore save a great deal of time and effort when designing settings to deal with complex frames.

### VEGAS Pro

In VEGAS Pro 18 and later, auto motion tracking is a freshly upgraded function. Despite its late birth, it included the Mocha masking and planar tracking technology, winner of an Academy Award. It enables you to accurately attach images and messages and even adjust for shifting perspective. You can hide faces, license information, and any private objects using this capability.

![vegas pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vegas-pro.jpg)

### Adobe Premiere Pro

Because of its superior editing capabilities, Premiere Pro seems to be a requirement for anyone learning video editing. Premiere Pro, however, has a limited number of presets and automatic tools in order to provide consumers the most control.

![adobe premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-premiere-pro.jpg)

When masking and blurring a face, motion tracking only works with the auto option. If not, you will need to enter and alter multiple keyframes to add text or resize the video, or you will need to install an extension to convert the mask's tracks to any transformed parts.

### PowerDirector

Due to its simplicity of use, PowerDirector is unquestionably among the greatest motion tracking programs currently available. It accomplishes complex effects without having an advanced learning curve, in contrast to other video editing tools. As demonstrated in the introductory video up top, a simple interface may be used to easily track and manage one or more motion-tracked items.

![powerdirector for mac](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/powerdirector-for-mac-5.jpg)

With this program, creating a simple motion track may be done in only three easy steps. This editor is for you if you want to finish the job swiftly and painlessly and are new to intermediate video editing.

## Part 3\. Differences between camera tracking and motion tracking?

Making the audience forget that there is a camera in the room is one of the primary goals of filmmaking. To engage the audience, tracking shots like camera tracking and motion tracking are helpful. Tracking shots provide filmmakers the chance to immerse their audience more deeply in the storyline of their characters. I discovered that there is some ambiguity around how motion tracking and camera tracking differ from one another. I'll explain where the confusion might have originated and give you examples of how to use both strategies.

What distinguishes motion tracking from camera tracking? Their differences are due to how they view the course of action. From a camera's perspective, motion tracking monitors an object's movement. The scenario is more immersive thanks to camera tracking, which detects the movement of the camera and presents it as though you are in a virtual or augmented reality environment.

We'll examine tracking's development in the movie and its significance to the business. What it is and how it affects the cinematography industry. Along with the many software used for both motion tracking and camera tracking, we'll also look at some of the popular applications for both.

**Motion tracking**

Motion tracking is similar to a car pursuit on the highway in an action movie. Let's use a SimCity environment as another illustration: your Sim's movement is monitored against the steady scene of your home. The frame is set on your Sim, regardless of what your Sim does.

**Camera tracking**

When the camera must move and the object being "tracked" must remain stationary, camera tracking might be utilized instead of motion tracking. Information from a recorded live shot taken with a live camera is used for camera tracking. Then, using this data, a parallel virtual camera is projected in a three-dimensional composition frame. fresh 3D pieces are added while scenes are recreated.

On the Internet of Vehicles, motion tracking will be crucial. IoV will project the motion of your vehicle along the 2D path. Then, utilizing the information about your surroundings, you are informed of any potential roadblocks.

The same basic idea underlies motion tracking and stabilization. Both follow a moving target. When stabilizing, you choose the location where you wish to remain concentrated and centered despite movement. You track the object you wish to concentrate on while moving when you use motion tracking.

Sports videos frequently use basketball and football and use motion tracking. wherein the player is surrounded by a circle as he circles the court or the field for basketball.

## Conclusion

In video editing, techniques like motion tracking and camera tracking are frequently employed. Even though they are frequently compared, both employ various vantage angles to depict motion. By following the moving object's movement throughout the frame, motion tracking maintains the moving object in focus. A post-production technique called camera tracking uses data from a pre-shot movie to project a parallel virtual camera that displays a 3D perspective. If motion tracking and camera tracking have anything in common, it's the way they draw the viewer into the tale and make them feel like a part of it. This gives your audience a sense of immersion in the story and enables your movie to linger in their minds emotionally and visually long after the credits have rolled.

There are numerous options for motion tracking applications. With advantages and downsides, we've compiled a list of the finest motion tracking programs. The following are the best video editors for motion tracking in our opinion:

### Filmora

Wondershare created [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to enable you to fully express your creativity. FilmoraPro is the best option if you want to make some high-level modifications to your video. In addition to the pre-sets offered, it allows you to tweak the effects for a more expertly edited appearance.

Motion tracking is currently its best feature. You may track a skater as they race across the ice or follow a boat as it travels. Use the motion tracking feature to add drama to your videos. You won't have to worry about getting lost because FilmoraPro features an amazingly simple UI. Simply click on the person or object you wish to track and choose Motion Track from the Effects menu.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

### Blender

Open-source and cost-free motion tracking software is called Blender. It's an excellent 3D creating tool. Modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing, video editing, 2D animation, and of course motion tracking is all supported.

### Kdenlive

A motion tracker was recently added to Kdenlive, an open source and free video editing tool, under its Effects section. This program analyzes an object's tracking information and automatically generates a map of the object's motion. Following that, you can align a title, an image, an icon, and any other 2D elements to the moving object using this track. Motion Tracker's regularly updated algorithms are one of its key characteristics, which leads to a higher tracking success rate and faster tracking speed.

### HitFilm Express

The free edition of HitFilm Express is a wonderful place to start if you're learning the fundamentals of 2D motion tracking. To get superior tracking results, it offers two motion tracking types: Single Point for tracking simply position and Double Points for tracking position, scale, or rotation of an object. You can either steady the video with the tracking data or change the point with a CG object.

Its optical flow tracking technique is outstanding. It successfully tracks a moving item that changes into multiple shapes or is veiled for a few frames by figuring out the brightness flow of the moving object. Beginners can therefore save a great deal of time and effort when designing settings to deal with complex frames.

### VEGAS Pro

In VEGAS Pro 18 and later, auto motion tracking is a freshly upgraded function. Despite its late birth, it included the Mocha masking and planar tracking technology, winner of an Academy Award. It enables you to accurately attach images and messages and even adjust for shifting perspective. You can hide faces, license information, and any private objects using this capability.

![vegas pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vegas-pro.jpg)

### Adobe Premiere Pro

Because of its superior editing capabilities, Premiere Pro seems to be a requirement for anyone learning video editing. Premiere Pro, however, has a limited number of presets and automatic tools in order to provide consumers the most control.

![adobe premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-premiere-pro.jpg)

When masking and blurring a face, motion tracking only works with the auto option. If not, you will need to enter and alter multiple keyframes to add text or resize the video, or you will need to install an extension to convert the mask's tracks to any transformed parts.

### PowerDirector

Due to its simplicity of use, PowerDirector is unquestionably among the greatest motion tracking programs currently available. It accomplishes complex effects without having an advanced learning curve, in contrast to other video editing tools. As demonstrated in the introductory video up top, a simple interface may be used to easily track and manage one or more motion-tracked items.

![powerdirector for mac](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/powerdirector-for-mac-5.jpg)

With this program, creating a simple motion track may be done in only three easy steps. This editor is for you if you want to finish the job swiftly and painlessly and are new to intermediate video editing.

## Part 3\. Differences between camera tracking and motion tracking?

Making the audience forget that there is a camera in the room is one of the primary goals of filmmaking. To engage the audience, tracking shots like camera tracking and motion tracking are helpful. Tracking shots provide filmmakers the chance to immerse their audience more deeply in the storyline of their characters. I discovered that there is some ambiguity around how motion tracking and camera tracking differ from one another. I'll explain where the confusion might have originated and give you examples of how to use both strategies.

What distinguishes motion tracking from camera tracking? Their differences are due to how they view the course of action. From a camera's perspective, motion tracking monitors an object's movement. The scenario is more immersive thanks to camera tracking, which detects the movement of the camera and presents it as though you are in a virtual or augmented reality environment.

We'll examine tracking's development in the movie and its significance to the business. What it is and how it affects the cinematography industry. Along with the many software used for both motion tracking and camera tracking, we'll also look at some of the popular applications for both.

**Motion tracking**

Motion tracking is similar to a car pursuit on the highway in an action movie. Let's use a SimCity environment as another illustration: your Sim's movement is monitored against the steady scene of your home. The frame is set on your Sim, regardless of what your Sim does.

**Camera tracking**

When the camera must move and the object being "tracked" must remain stationary, camera tracking might be utilized instead of motion tracking. Information from a recorded live shot taken with a live camera is used for camera tracking. Then, using this data, a parallel virtual camera is projected in a three-dimensional composition frame. fresh 3D pieces are added while scenes are recreated.

On the Internet of Vehicles, motion tracking will be crucial. IoV will project the motion of your vehicle along the 2D path. Then, utilizing the information about your surroundings, you are informed of any potential roadblocks.

The same basic idea underlies motion tracking and stabilization. Both follow a moving target. When stabilizing, you choose the location where you wish to remain concentrated and centered despite movement. You track the object you wish to concentrate on while moving when you use motion tracking.

Sports videos frequently use basketball and football and use motion tracking. wherein the player is surrounded by a circle as he circles the court or the field for basketball.

## Conclusion

In video editing, techniques like motion tracking and camera tracking are frequently employed. Even though they are frequently compared, both employ various vantage angles to depict motion. By following the moving object's movement throughout the frame, motion tracking maintains the moving object in focus. A post-production technique called camera tracking uses data from a pre-shot movie to project a parallel virtual camera that displays a 3D perspective. If motion tracking and camera tracking have anything in common, it's the way they draw the viewer into the tale and make them feel like a part of it. This gives your audience a sense of immersion in the story and enables your movie to linger in their minds emotionally and visually long after the credits have rolled.
