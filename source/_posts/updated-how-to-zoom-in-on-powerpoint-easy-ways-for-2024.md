### 1\. Use the View tab Zoom command

PowerPoint's Zoom feature is a clever tool for creating and watching presentations. When the text or item you wish to deal with is too tiny for you to view, the Zoom tool might be useful. On the screen, a slide will look bigger as you zoom in, and smaller when you zoom away. Choose the appropriate zoom level in the "Zoom" dialog box by typing a number into the "Percent:" spinner or selecting an option from the "Zoom to" section. Click the "OK" button to apply the chosen magnification level after setting it.

##### Step1Zoom in with the View Dialog Box

Additionally, you may access the Zoom dialog box and choose a different zoom level by clicking the Zoom button on the View tab of the ribbon. choose the Ribbon's "View" tab. the "Zoom" button from the "Zoom" button group, and then.

##### Step1Click the Zoom In (+) button on the status bar

The horizontal scroll bar will then display underneath the slide if you zoom in on the slide until it can no longer fit horizontally on the screen. The slide may then be thoroughly examined at the selected magnification level by using it to scroll left and right.
