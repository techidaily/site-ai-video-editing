### 1\. Use the View tab Zoom command

Click the "OK" button to apply the chosen magnification level after setting it.

### 2\. Use the Zoom Slider at The Bottom of the Screen

In PowerPoint, the Status Bar's lower-right application window has the Zoom slider. This tool lets you adjust the slide's magnification level. This just modifies your sense of how near or far away the slide looks onscreen; the slide itself is unaffected in any way.

##### Step1Click the Zoom In (+) button on the status bar

The horizontal scroll bar will then display underneath the slide if you zoom in on the slide until it can no longer fit horizontally on the screen. The slide may then be thoroughly examined at the selected magnification level by using it to scroll left and right.

Click the "Fit slide to current window" button to the right of the Zoom slider to force the slide to fit inside the view's available slide area.
