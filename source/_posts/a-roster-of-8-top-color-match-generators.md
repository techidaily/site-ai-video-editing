1. **Edit and perform desired modifications (Optional)**

If you are just looking to resize the FLV video file, then you can skip this step and move to step no. 4\.

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-3.jpg)

1. **Resize the video by changing the aspect ratio**

Aspect ratio defines the shape of your video like if you want the video to be horizontal, vertical, square, or custom. Generally, the term ‘**resizing video**’ refers to changing the aspect ratio of the video. For that, go to the **_File_** and then to the **_Project Settings_**_._ Then on the Aspect Ratio box, select the one that you prefer or you can try custom scaling.

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-4.jpg)

1. **Resize the video by cropping**

When you change the aspect ratio of the project, some parts of your flv video might not fit or it might be shrunk small to fit. So you need to resize the flv video by cropping so that you can crop and focus on the part of the video you like. To crop the video, select the flv video clip in the timeline and click on the crop icon in the timeline toolbar. Now choose the ratio you want to crop and select the part you’d like to keep. Then click OK and your flv video will be resized.

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-5.jpg)

Click on the **_Settings_** button near the resolution and you’ll be shown some detailed preferences for exporting. Every setting here like frame rate, resolution, bitrate, etc. can affect the size of the output video.

1. **Resize the video by changing the aspect ratio**

## Part 1: What is Time Lapse?

### 1\. Technical basics of Time Lapse Photography and Videography

Time-lapse is a specialized type of shot that can be achieved in-camera, through editing, or a combination of both. Time-lapse is a technique where frames are shot much slower than a normal rate (e.g., 24 frames per minute instead of per second).

Professional time-lapses are a series of raw photos even though they are sometimes perceived as videos. In a nutshell, a time-lapse is a short video that processes by revealing the evolution of a series of events, invisible to the eye.

The simplest and most useful formula is time per frame (TPF), multiplied by frames per second (FPS), multiplied by 60 seconds. Using this formula will tell you how long to record to end up with your desired time lapse length or “recording time” (RT). TPF x FPS x 60 = RT

### 2\. What is a Time-lapse video used for?

The use of time-lapse photography and video is an excellent storytelling technique since compelling stories are essential to effective marketing. A time-lapse can also offer excellent insight into the advancement of developmental projects.

#### **①** Scientific research

* Time-lapses may be utilized to spread the word about scientific investigations to a wide audience. You can use time-lapse photography to gain money by selling the material of interesting scientific investigations to documentary makers or instructional websites.
* Scientists can visualize processes that would be challenging or sometimes even impossible to study in real life, thanks to time-lapse photography

#### **②** Individual enjoyment

Time-lapses are also utilized by filmmakers for scenes requiring extended durations of time with little significant activity occurring during the shot (such as night slowly turning into day).

#### **③** **Commercial use**

* Time-lapse videos are a wonderful instrument for enhancing the perception of your brand because they are. As a result, many consumers find it interesting.
* Time-lapse videos are the epitome of the old saying that "good things come in small packages" for any brand.

## Part 2: Record or Shoot Your Time-Lapse Video

### 1\. Select Your Subject

The best way to create a time-lapse video is to pick your subject very carefully. Movement is the most crucial factor to consider while selecting a time-lapse subject. Any movement—whether it be caused by people, animals, vehicles, water, clouds, or anything else—can create an exciting and captivating time-lapse.

* Some of the iconic ideas of filming a time-lapse include:
* A stunning glimpse of the day and night cycle of life at sea.
* Construction of a building from ground till its completion
* Capturing the traffic movement
* Ice melting
* Sun setting
* A great shot of a galaxy

### 2\. Prepare Right Equipment

Choose your equipment before heading out to capture time lapses. There are several options available for time-lapse cameras and applications, ranging from basic and affordable to sophisticated and pricy.

#### **①** **Camera**

You cannot make a time-lapse without owning a camera, whether it is a mobile phone, a compact, or a DSLR. The quality of the final result will be as good as the quality of the equipment you use.

**\- Smartphone camera apps (iPhone/Android)**

All good smartphones now possess a built-in camera with good optical quality, for example: recently Apple Company launched its new iPhone 14 with a magnificent 48-megapixel camera. By using such cameras we have been able to produce really good pictures, although not in negative conditions, such as those with low-light, etc.

For apple: use IguanaLapse or TimeLapse to create your great time-lapses

For Android: use Time-Lapse – Lite

\- **Point-and-shoot cameras**

Even though smartphone cameras have taken over in this digital era, it is still not possible to say that point-and-shoot cameras are not doing their magic. A point-and-shoot camera is really handy.

Some examples of point-and-shoot cameras which are best for creating fun time-lapse videos include Olympus Tough TG-6, Nikon Coolpix W300, Fujifilm XP140, Panasonic Lumix ZS70 / TZ90, and many others in the list.

**\- Action cameras**

Action cameras, also known as action cams are compact, rugged, handheld, or mountable digital cameras that are designed to capture what you see when you are immersing in a movement. The action camera is usually mounted to your helmet, chest, handlebars of a bike or motorcycle, or tripod to record life.

The best action cameras for creating time-lapses include GoPro Hero11 Black, Insta360 ONE RS Twin Edition, DJI Action 2, DJI Pocket 2, and GoPro Hero9 Black.

**\- DSLR cameras**

This is the best choice in terms of cost/benefit: it produces excellent results and high image quality. The best and top-rated DSLRs for creating terrific time-lapses include Nikon D850, Canon 80D, Canon EOS 90D, Sony A7 III, and others.

#### **②** Tripod/Gimbal/other stabilizers

Owning a solid and stable tripod is essential for the success of a time-lapse video. A good tripod will support the load without any problems and will keep the arsenal stable for the duration of the shooting session. The best way to use a tripod for filming a time-lapse is to use orient on a tripod that is quite high (at least 170cm).

Some best tripods used to record time-lapses include BONFOTO B671c, Patekfly Flexible Tripod, Sirui Easy Traveler ET-2204, and Vanguard Alta Pro 263AB 100.

A gimbal is a tool that uses motors and intelligent sensors to support and stabilize a camera. The best gimbal and other stabilizers used to film time-lapses include Moza Air 2, DJI RS 2, Zhiyun Crane-2S, Benro RedDog R1, iKan EC1 Beholder, and Feiyu AK4500.

#### **③** Intervalometer/other camera shutter triggers

An intervalometer is a small device able to trigger the shutter of your camera every ‘n’ second, ‘n’ times (also infinite). It can be external, or as we saw earlier, integrated into the camera.

Some of the best intervalometer include Nikon Integrated Intervalometer. With a Nikon D3, you can go into Shooting Menu, and then activate” Interval Timer Shooting”.
