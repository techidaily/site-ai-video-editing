Discord is no secret, gradually becoming one of the most popular platforms for everyone. And why not when it allows users to communicate via different channels, including video calls, texts, media, voice calls, and files through private channels.

The digital platform is under Discord Inc and became official a while back. It operates under multiple operating systems, including macOS, Android, Linux, iOS, Android, iPadOS, and web browsers. As a result, it is an excellent way for everyone. The platform has risen to fame in the last six months, with many people using it.

As much as the platform is doing great, many things often arise, especially creating **Discord GIF Avatar**. In other words, how to deliver the best PFP or avatar for your account. Since Discord has recently gained maximum fame, there are fewer details. Fortunately, this article is here to save the day. It includes relevant information about an **animated avatar for Discord** or GIF discord avatar. Read through the summary below.

#### In this article

01 [Why Discord Is Becoming Popular Recently?](#Part 1)

02 [Why Discord Emojis?](#Part 2)

03 [How to Create Discord Emoji GIF?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 Why is Discord Becoming Popular Recently?

How often do you visit social media? You probably know that the current trending networking platform is Discord if it is frequent. After all, it has risen to fame with millions of users in no time. Plus, the introduction of the **GIF Avatar Discord** has left many fans amazed with the application. You can also confirm its popularity with the many friends using it.

Discord features multiple good points that explain why most people love it, including the **avatar Discord GIF.** However, many people still question its popularity and its rise recently. As a result, this section will answer this question using relevant facts.

**●** **It is suitable for gaming communication:** Discord is primarily popular among gamers. The platform is new, but it has quickly overtaken its competitors, Skype and TeamSpeak. Why? Many gamers consider it a revolutionized application that solves all their worries making gaming communication bigger and better. Before Discord, gaming communication was difficult and dangerous. After all, you need to share personal Skype details that connect with your phone, making it a not-safe option. When we consider TeamSpeak, you realize that it is limiting with the option available since you only have a voice call. Discord brings out the best network channel; gamers and friends have quickly started using it.

**●** **Most services are free: Discord includes multiple benefits that make** communication straightforward and convenient. Luckily, most of the services available are free, meaning that almost everyone can access them. As a result, many people would quickly settle for Discord compared to other platforms since you can get so much at no cost. Currently, they have the **Discord Nitro gif avatar**, which is affordable and multiplies the fun.

**●** **Create Discord bots are no cost:** Discord allows users to create bots for free without including any hosting fee hence an affordable option.

**●** **Constant updates that match the audiences' needs: Things change in no time for Discord**. Why? The developers are active and listen to the community's opinion of what they want and why they need it. Therefore, it delivers the show that people urgently need leading to popularity rise.

**●** **It rarely includes ads in private chats:** A platform can become frustrating, mainly when it features multiple ads every minute. However, Discord is different since it almost has no ads. Therefore, people can freely chat with friends and other gamers.

**●** **Discord is safe:** The settings under Discord are safe since they include suitable privacy options and monitoring. Thus, it is a safe option. But many people often raise the question of open chatting in apps and the security issues that come with them. Many people can confirm that Discord is a safe option and if you feel otherwise, ensure that you only add friends you know.

## Part 2 Why Discord Emojis?

From the information above, you can tell that Discord's primary role is communication. And we all know that emojis are the real deal in every conversation since emojis easily communicate our feelings. Currently, most platforms with messaging options include emojis to multiply the fun. The same case happens for Discord emojis. They are there to make communication appealing, interesting, funny and reveal how you feel about a situation.

**Importance of Discord emojis**

**●** **Emojis help you to communicate the right emotions**. Sometimes, it's impossible to express the right feelings using words, and emojis come to the rescue in such situations. Of course, they are useless for formal communication, but Discord holds a considerable weight for various issues.

Creating a Discord account is simple and free, not even considering the hosting cost. However, the developers include the Discord Nitro version, which contains multiple features that make conversations bigger and better. However, the Nitro version is a paid subscription of $4.99 monthly. Creating a discord emoji GIF is quite simple if you are under the later version. After all, it includes the available GIF options that you can choose from depending on your taste. However, if you are under the free option, you won't have this option.
