## How to Add VHS Effects to Videos for Free 2024

2023 has ushered in a wave of nostalgia, sweeping across various domains, from fashion to technology. Amidst this, videos have become a powerful medium to relive the past. If you're aiming to infuse your videos with a touch of the '90s, look no further than the VHS effect.

For those who need a quick trip down memory lane, VHS tapes were once the cornerstone of home entertainment. These clunky plastic cassettes captured countless memories, from family gatherings to favorite films and TV shows. While they might be alien to newer generations, they hold a special place in the chronicles of video evolution.

The VHS effect isn't just about mimicking the look of these tapes. It's about encapsulating their essenceâ€”grainy visuals, occasional jitters, and that characteristic static. Incorporating these imperfections into today's high-definition videos imparts a distinctive vintage flair. It's akin to applying an Instagram filter to a photo, where a simple touch can transport a viewer back in time. Dive in as we guide you on adding this retro charm to your free videos.

Double-click the files and they will be imported into the program. You can also directly drag and drop photo and video files into the video editing program. Then you need to set up the project such as aspect ratio and resolution.

##### Step2Add a photo to the video and apply some effects

After importing the files into the program, drag the video clip to the video editor timeline at the bottom of the screen. Then drag the photo to the track above the video. Click the "**Play**" icon to preview the video. Move the photo on the track to the point where you want to view it and drag the end to shorten or increase the duration of the photo.

After that, edit your photo as you choose. Place the image anywhere you want, then drag its edge to change the size of the playing windows. The picture-in-picture track can also be customized using a variety of customizable settings provided by Filmora. To access the picture, color, and motion panel, double-click the additional image on the track. Here, you can select from more than 30 motion effects to animate the added photo, alter its saturation and hue, perform some color correction, or alter its transformation.

##### Step3Save the new video file

![save the new video file](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/kapwing-image-to-video-8.jpg)
