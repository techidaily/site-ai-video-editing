Editing video with Final Cut Pro is not a complicated process. Here are the steps to help a beginner get started.

**Step1: Create a new project & import media**

When you Launch the Final Cut Pro interface, Libraries and Events are automatically created. You only need to create a new project.

At the top menu bar, click _File > New > Project_ to create a new project. Here you will have to type in a new name of the project and then select ‘_Use Automatic Settings’_.

At the top menu bar again, click _File > Import > Media_ to enable the program to bring up the Media Import window where you can select the video and audio files you want to import into your new project.

After selecting all the media you want to include in your project press _‘Import Selected’_ and then close the media window.

**Step 2: Add your trimmed clips to the timeline.**

The thumbnails of all the media you have imported will be appearing in the browser. For you to create a new video you need to arrange and trim that media in the timeline.

In your browser, you can set the _‘In_ and _Out’_ points for each video clip by holding ‘_Option_’. To do this you will have to click the thumbnail and drag it. The yellow timeline that appears on the clip represents the range that will be added to your video timeline.

After arranging them in the order that you want them to play, trim your clips by moving the mouse cursor to the edge of its thumbnail. This is done by using the _'Trim tool’._ Drag forward or backward to adjust the clip's endings.

If you are arranging the clips in your sequence, you need to drag and drop any of the clips from the timeline into a different position. Final Cut Pro has a tool known as Magnetic timeline that will automatically insert and arrange the clips for you. You just need to ensure that your clips do not overlap or lay on top of each other.

To preview your video in the viewer, press the space bar on your keyboard or the Play icon in your software interface.

**Step 3: Add Title, Texts, Transitions, and Effects**

The transition’s length can be adjusted by dragging inwards or outwards. To customize your transition you can open the inspector by pressing ‘_Command + 4’_ and make the adjustments.

**Effects**: With Final Cut Pro inbuilt Effects, you can add some more value to your video after you are done with basic arrangements in the timeline. To add the effects click on the ‘_Effects browser’_ icon to open it.

Next to the effects browser icon, choose your preferred effect and add it between any 2 clips. By doing this you will have added animation effect between them.

**Step 4: Add Audio, Music, and Color.**

**Audio & Music:** At this point, you can import and add your music. Photos and Audio sidebar icon is located above the browser and you can click to open, and then select Sound Effects.

To see all the songs available in Final Cut Pro, you can type the word _'Jingle_' and you can preview them by pressing the small play button.

**Color correction**: By highlighting all the video clips in your video timeline, you can see a yellow outline around them.

Then open the drop-down menu by clicking the ‘_Enhancement_’ icon situated below the Viewer.

To improve the color and contrast, select Balance Color or _'Option + Cmd + B’_.

Editing video with Final Cut Pro is not a complicated process. Here are the steps to help a beginner get started.

**Step1: Create a new project & import media**

When you Launch the Final Cut Pro interface, Libraries and Events are automatically created. You only need to create a new project.

At the top menu bar, click _File > New > Project_ to create a new project. Here you will have to type in a new name of the project and then select ‘_Use Automatic Settings’_.

At the top menu bar again, click _File > Import > Media_ to enable the program to bring up the Media Import window where you can select the video and audio files you want to import into your new project.

After selecting all the media you want to include in your project press _‘Import Selected’_ and then close the media window.

**Step 2: Add your trimmed clips to the timeline.**

The thumbnails of all the media you have imported will be appearing in the browser. For you to create a new video you need to arrange and trim that media in the timeline.

In your browser, you can set the _‘In_ and _Out’_ points for each video clip by holding ‘_Option_’. To do this you will have to click the thumbnail and drag it. The yellow timeline that appears on the clip represents the range that will be added to your video timeline.

After arranging them in the order that you want them to play, trim your clips by moving the mouse cursor to the edge of its thumbnail. This is done by using the _'Trim tool’._ Drag forward or backward to adjust the clip's endings.

If you are arranging the clips in your sequence, you need to drag and drop any of the clips from the timeline into a different position. Final Cut Pro has a tool known as Magnetic timeline that will automatically insert and arrange the clips for you. You just need to ensure that your clips do not overlap or lay on top of each other.

To preview your video in the viewer, press the space bar on your keyboard or the Play icon in your software interface.

**Step 3: Add Title, Texts, Transitions, and Effects**

**Title and Texts**: Final Cut Pro has many Titles located in the browser where you imported your media. You can add them by dragging them into your video's timeline. To access those titles you can press the _'Title and Generators’_ icon in the sidebar to open it.

**Transitions**: When adding Transitions, there is nothing wrong with a “_hard cut_” between 2 clips. Use the transitions only where they make sense so as not to ruin your video. To add these transitions, you need to open the ‘_Transition browser’_ by clicking on its indicated icon.

The transition’s length can be adjusted by dragging inwards or outwards. To customize your transition you can open the inspector by pressing ‘_Command + 4’_ and make the adjustments.

**Effects**: With Final Cut Pro inbuilt Effects, you can add some more value to your video after you are done with basic arrangements in the timeline. To add the effects click on the ‘_Effects browser’_ icon to open it.

Next to the effects browser icon, choose your preferred effect and add it between any 2 clips. By doing this you will have added animation effect between them.

**Step 4: Add Audio, Music, and Color.**

**Audio & Music:** At this point, you can import and add your music. Photos and Audio sidebar icon is located above the browser and you can click to open, and then select Sound Effects.

To see all the songs available in Final Cut Pro, you can type the word _'Jingle_' and you can preview them by pressing the small play button.

**Color correction**: By highlighting all the video clips in your video timeline, you can see a yellow outline around them.

Then open the drop-down menu by clicking the ‘_Enhancement_’ icon situated below the Viewer.

To improve the color and contrast, select Balance Color or _'Option + Cmd + B’_.

Now that you are done editing your video, you can save and share as you prefer.

## How To Make a Video Podcast

Starting a video podcast can be quite intimidating, but the truth is; having the proper knowledge will help you do things more correctly.

As we all know, knowledge is the key to success. So, for you to navigate your way around the video podcasting industry easily, you need to consume enough information that will enable you to make fewer wrong decisions.

To help you out, we took our time to do more research on how to record video podcasts, and in this post, we will share all you need to know to record a video podcast that stands out.

## Part 1\. But first: why record with a video?

If you've done a little research, you'll notice many podcasters switched to recording with videos instead of audio. Did they decide to start doing that so we could see their faces? Well, the answer is NO. But before we discuss more on that, you should know what a video podcast is and its types.

You guessed right. A video podcast is a podcast with video. The video element could be a static image or a video recording of the podcast host and the guest. A video podcast will help you do the following;

**1\. Enhance the visual content**

Research shows that humans learn more from what they visualize than what is heard. Yes, this is because 30% of the human brain comprises neurons dedicated to visual processing, and just 3% is dedicated to hearing. Besides, videos are always more engaging compared to audio. So why not combine both to boost your podcast performance?

**2\. Level up the personality and relatability**

Most people have more belief in what they see than what is heard. So, video podcasts allow audiences to easily see your expression and understand your passion for the subject you discuss. It also builds a deeper level of connections between you and them. Also, it helps to add to the originality of your podcast and your brand as a whole.

**3\. Make the content more accessible**

Your podcast show becomes more accessible when it's in the video. You won't be limited to just uploading it on podcast platforms but also on social media as a short TikTok trailer, Instagram post, YouTube video, etc. Doing this will get your content in front of a wide range of audience, thus prompting more people to engage with your podcast.

## Part 2\. Get your gear set up

The first step to starting a video podcast is getting your gear set up. We recommend you start with the following podcast equipment:

* A camera (if recording a video podcast)
* Microphone(s)
* Headphone(s)
* Memory cards
* Tripods
* Computers
* Recording software or a digital audio workstation

Let's dig deeper into each of these. We've compiled the best podcast equipment for beginners and pros alike based on our extensive research.

### 1\. DSLRs Camera – [Sony A6300](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Mirrorless-Camera-Interchangeable-Digital/dp/B007GK50X4) ($779)

![sony a630 dslrs camera](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-video-podcast-1.jpg)

If you're looking to record remotely, just like most podcasters in 2022, we'd advise using a DSLR camera by connecting it to your computer using an Elgato Cam link. A $30 version of the device is available on Amazon.

DSLR cameras are perfect for video podcasts, and one of the most reliable options is the Sony A6300 camera. It's one rugged camera that feels very good at hand, and it offers excellent 4K video recording quality that allows you to shoot amazing videos for podcasts. You can never go wrong with such a camera at your fingertips.

There is also other equipment – a microphone you need to start a podcast. There are many quality microphones in the market, but one of the most popular options among podcasters is the Shure SM58\. It's an XLR microphone that usually requires an interface to record. However, if you prefer a USB microphone, you can purchase either Rode, NT-USB mini, or the Shure MV7.

![already 74 camera tripod](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-video-podcast-5.jpg)

It would help if you had a tripod to shoot stable podcast videos. A tripod is a support tool that will enable you to adjust your camera height, movement, and stability to record a perfect video from any required angle. It is essential if you don't have anyone helping you behind the camera.

### 6\. Computers - [ASUS VivoBook 15 F515](https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-i3-1005G1-Processor-Fingerprint-F515JA-AH31/dp/B08H4YTTLP/ref=sr%5F1%5F5?crid=OFVRJ25DL6DN&keywords=ASUS+VivoBook+F510UA.&qid=1668970500&sprefix=tri%2Caps%2C1798&sr=8-5)($358.99)

## Part 3\. Build your set

Besides having a good quality camera and other podcast gear mentioned above, it's also crucial to make your set look gorgeous. It makes your video podcast look more professional. Below are ideas for some techniques you can employ.

### 1\. Depth & lighting

To make a professional-looking video podcast, you need to add as much depth as possible. So yes, there should be enough distance between you and the background (don't be too close or too far). However, if this is impossible because you have a small space, good lighting should spice things up. Godox SL -150 is one perfect choice that you can opt for.

### 2\. Make your background interesting

Your background shouldn't just be left alone. It would be best to put up some fascinating stuff that will blend with the podcast's theme and make the video look more admirable. For example, if your podcast discusses relationships, you should have a background that suits the topic.

### 3\. Declutter

It's never a good idea to leave unnecessary items in the background because that makes it look messy. Also, it may compromise everything you've done to spice it up. So, after you finish putting up an exciting background, take a few minutes to inspect the lighting, the elements, and lots more. Then, ensure it's clean and tidy.

## Part 4\. Create a collaborative doc

Creating a collaborative doc is also essential for making a podcast. You might ask: "what is a collaborative doc?" Well, it's where you jot down information on the following;

* **Niche or Topic**
* **Brand name**
* **Format for the Show and each of the Episodes**
* **Intro and Outro Music**
* **Create a Cover Art**
* **Ideas to record the first podcast**

## Part 5\. Create your show

Now that you have a perfect plan and setup, the next thing is to start the show. But first, what format have you chosen for your first show? Is it the static image recording? The remote interview recording? The in-studio recording? or interview & b-roll recording? Not sure of which format to start with? Worry less. We'll walk you through the steps of the process for each process. Just keep reading;

### Method 1: Static Image Podcast Recording

![static image podcast recording](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-video-podcast-8.jpg)

It is the simplest way to record a video podcast. You don't necessarily have to show your face. Instead, record an audio podcast, then convert its file into a video file and add a static image to the background to keep playing as the viewer is listening.

You need video editing software to create this kind of video podcast - Filmora is a perfect choice. However, keep in mind that this kind of video podcast is usually less engaging, only that you'll be able to publish it on various video platforms.

**Equipment Required:**

* Video editor - Filmora
* Computer

### Method 2: In-studio Podcast Recording

![in-studio podcast recording](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-video-podcast-9.jpg)

Unlike static image recording, this kind of video podcast requires you to show in the video. It involves capturing the conversation between you and a guest or your colleague from a perfectly set up studio.

**Equipment required:**

* Camera
* Microphone
* Tripod (if you have nobody to stay behind the camera)
* Computer
* Headphones
* Video editing software - Filmora

### Method 3: Remote Interview Podcast Recording

![remote interview podcast recording](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-video-podcast-10.jpg)

It is just like a live-stream podcast. It involves recording multiple speakers who are not in the same room as you. This kind of video podcast is reliable when you intend to shoot online interviews with guests across the country.

**Equipment Required:**

* Software that supports capturing multiple webcams. An example is Riverside.
* Microphone
* Computer
* Video Editor - Filmora

## Part 6\. Edit your video podcast

After creating your show, the next thing is to edit your video podcast to make it look worthy when you publish it on any platform. But for this operation, you need powerful video editing software like Filmora.

## Part 3\. Build your set

Besides having a good quality camera and other podcast gear mentioned above, it's also crucial to make your set look gorgeous. It makes your video podcast look more professional. Below are ideas for some techniques you can employ.

### 1\. Depth & lighting

To make a professional-looking video podcast, you need to add as much depth as possible. So yes, there should be enough distance between you and the background (don't be too close or too far). However, if this is impossible because you have a small space, good lighting should spice things up. Godox SL -150 is one perfect choice that you can opt for.

### 2\. Make your background interesting

Your background shouldn't just be left alone. It would be best to put up some fascinating stuff that will blend with the podcast's theme and make the video look more admirable. For example, if your podcast discusses relationships, you should have a background that suits the topic.

### 3\. Declutter

It's never a good idea to leave unnecessary items in the background because that makes it look messy. Also, it may compromise everything you've done to spice it up. So, after you finish putting up an exciting background, take a few minutes to inspect the lighting, the elements, and lots more. Then, ensure it's clean and tidy.
