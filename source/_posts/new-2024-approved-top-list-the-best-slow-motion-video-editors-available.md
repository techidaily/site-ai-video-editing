#### 3\. Motion Tracking

Create animations from mere graphics to insert in your videos using this AI. Just add any graphical emoji, text, or sticker and link it with a moving object. Once you enable the motion tracking option, you will see them come to life. You can also apply an effect or filter to a specific portion throughout the video using making and motion-tracking options.
