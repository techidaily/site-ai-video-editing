### Using Uniform Speed to Create a Slow-Motion Video in Filmora

Uniform Speed is the basic method of creating slow motion in Filmora. It simply modifies the playback speed of video with the help of a slider. The procedure of slomo creation, like **The Slow Mo Guys** in Filmora, is given below:

##### Step 1Import Media to Start Slomo Creation

After downloading Filmora on your device, click the "New Project" button to start. From the editing interface, click the "Ctrl + I" keys, choose the video, and bring it to the timeline after import. Select the clip in the timeline and use your cursor to reach the settings panel. Go to the "Uniform Speed" section under the "Speed" tab and change the speed slider settings.

![drag the slider to adjust speed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/secret-to-slomo-videos-with-the-slow-mo-guys-5.jpg)

##### Step 2Start AI Frame Interpolation Settings

This is the AI feature that increases the video frame rate for a smooth, slow-motion effect. You can access this option at the bottom of Uniform Speed settings. Expand it and select the “Optical Flow” option for your purpose.

##### Step 1Access the Speed Ramping Feature

After importing and bringing media to the timeline, select it and reach the settings panel. Access the "Speed" > "Speed Ramping" option to start editing.
