### Steps to Slow Down Video in Filmora

In this section, we will discuss the Filmora Speed Ramping feature to create a slo-mo. If you are a beginner and have never edited before, this feature suits you the best. It has over 6-speed ramping templates for adding creative speed change effects. You can modify these models to fashion a slo-mo, and here is how to do it:

##### Step 1Access the Speed Feature

After opening Filmora and opening a project, select the clip in the timeline and go to the settings panel. From there, reach the "Speed" > "Speed Ramping" tabs and select a preset. If you don't like the featured presets, click on "Customize" for manual editing.

##### Step 2Add Video Frames

Once you have set the slo-mo speed, reach the "AI Frame Interpolation" section at the bottom. Click on the navigation icon and select "Optical Flow" from there.

#### 3\. Motion Tracking

Create animations from mere graphics to insert in your videos using this AI. Just add any graphical emoji, text, or sticker and link it with a moving object. Once you enable the motion tracking option, you will see them come to life. You can also apply an effect or filter to a specific portion throughout the video using making and motion-tracking options.

#### 4\. Speech-to-Text

Subtitles and captions have become an important part of cinema or videography. To ensure that your content reaches an international audience, use Filmora's STT feature. With its automated speech recognition and NLP systems, it transforms any speech into text. Moreover, it has multilingual support to make content accessible at international levels.
