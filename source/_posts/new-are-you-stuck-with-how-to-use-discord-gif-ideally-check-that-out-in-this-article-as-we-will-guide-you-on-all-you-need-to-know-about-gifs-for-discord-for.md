**Step 4:**

## An easier way to split the video

The whole process of splitting the video into a VLC media player is extremely easy for managing and handling without any requirement of technical knowledge. But unfortunately, you can apply the frame-by-frame technique on the short videos. Monitoring is essential during the split and looking at the complete process whenever the recording is in VLC.

This causes the loss of quality. Here, the substitute that is also available is [Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) . It is the recommendation of the graphic designers, web developers and videographers because it is freely available and lightweight software for the systems.
