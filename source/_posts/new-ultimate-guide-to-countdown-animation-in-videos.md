**How to make a countdown animation with Canva**

Canva offers a range of great-looking countdown templates that'll help you create one in just a few minutes. And if you need a simple countdown animation, you can download one of their free templates. Let's make it from scratch:

##### Step1 Select The Background

With Canva, you get a wide range of free backgrounds. Click on the button labeled "Search." Now choose the "light old film" background element and click Add.

![select background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/3-actionable-ways-to-create-animation-for-videos-12.png)

Then select the text tab and choose any font style, color, and size.

![enter your number](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/3-actionable-ways-to-create-animation-for-videos-13.png)

##### Step3 Animate Text

Next, select the font again, and then, at the top, there's an option for Text Animation.

Adding text animation to your countdown timer will make it more realistic and match your background better than a straight-up countdown timer.

![animate text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/3-actionable-ways-to-create-animation-for-videos-14.png)

##### Step4 Edit The Page Timing

![edit page timing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/3-actionable-ways-to-create-animation-for-videos-15.png)

##### Step5 Duplicate The Page

![duplicate the page](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/3-actionable-ways-to-create-animation-for-videos-16.png)

##### Step6 Export / Download Video

Step1 Download Wondershare Filmora from the official website. If you have already downloaded the Wondershare Filmora. Open it, and let's start editing the video.

![select the material](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-02.png)

Step3 Drag and drop **Clip 1** onto the timeline and move the playhead to the last frame of the clip.

![drag-drop clip 1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-03.png)

Alt text: Paper rip effect.

Step4 Now right-click on **Clip 1** to open the menu and select **Add Freeze Frame**.

![selecting add freeze frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-04.png)

Step7 Double-click the paper picture on the timeline to open the settings window and then open the **Compositing** menu. Then Change the **Blending Mode** from Normal to **Multiply**.

![opening compositing menu](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-07.png)

In the preview window, we can see that the freeze frame has the paper texture now!

![freeze frame has a paper texture](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-08.png)

Step8 Now you can use the new feature of Filmora to export this small portion of the video. First, click and drag the playhead to the start of the freeze frame and press **"I"** on the keyboard to set the **IN POINT**, then move the playhead to the end of this freeze frame and press **"O"** on the keyboard to set the **OUT POINT**.

![setting the in point](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-09.png)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** If you have the latest version, Filmora will automatically set the OUT POINT on the timeline.

Step9 Then click **Export** and choose **Create Video**. Let's name it **freeze frame 1** and click on Export.

![selecting create a video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-010.png)

It will only export the selected part on the timeline. Once the exporting process is completed, **Right-Click** on the timeline and **Cancel** the selected range.

Step10 Import the **Freeze Frame 1** to the media folder and replace the **Freeze Frame + Paper Photo** with this clip. Then adjust the length of this clip to 1 second.

![replaced the freeze frame and paper photo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-012.png)

Step11 Now let's make the second part of the transition effect. You should drag and Drop **Clip 2** onto the timeline and move the playhead to the clip's first frame. Then Add a Freeze Frame; you can also do it by pressing the **Alt+F** keys. Now click and drag the playhead to the end of the freeze frame and make a **Cut**.

![adding clip 2 to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-013.png)
