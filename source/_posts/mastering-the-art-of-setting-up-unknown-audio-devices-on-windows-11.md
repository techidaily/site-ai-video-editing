## 1\. Check the basics

 To efficiently identify the source of the problem, you need to confirm that your audio device is functioning properly. If you’re using external speakers, check the power source and connections. Check if they’re working properly on other devices.

## 2\. Install all Windows updates

 Windows updates often address software bugs and compatibility issues that may contribute to the audio problem. To take advantage of bug fixes and system improvements that come with Windows updates, you can verify if you install all the available Windows updates. Below are the steps you take:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** . Type**check for updates** and click**Check for updates** from the list of results.

## 3\. Update audio drivers

 Outdated or incompatible audio drivers can cause audio issues. If you can’t remember when was the last time you updated your drivers, do it right now. Driver updates often tackle bugs, enhance compatibility, and improve performance.

 There are mainly two ways you can update your audio drivers:[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and **[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

3. Select the**Sound** tab and you should see the details of your sound card.

Or you can update your audio drivers through the Device Manager:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo + R keys** simultaneously to open the Run box.
2. Type**devmgmt.msc** and hit Enter.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/run-devmgmt.msc_.jpg)
3. In the Device Manager window, find and double-click the**Sound, video and game controllers** category to expand it. Right-click on the audio device for which you want to update the driver. This could be your sound card or integrated audio device.  

![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/update-audio-drivers.jpg)

 Then follow the on-screen instructions to search for and install the latest drivers.

### Option 2: Automatically update drivers with Driver Easy

Driver Easy is a driver updater tool designed to simplify the process of updating device drivers. It is user-friendly and convenient. You don’t need to know the make and model of your audio device, Driver Easy handles it all. Driver Easy can help you identify missing and outdated drivers, and download and install the latest ones for your system, direct from the manufacturer’s websites.

Below is the simple three-step guide to update drivers with Driver Easy:

(This requires the Pro version – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.

If you’re experiencing issues like audio cutting out, using the Windows audio troubleshooter can be a helpful step in troubleshooting the problem.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo + I keys** simultaneously to open Settings.
