## Solving Persistent Audio Disruptions on Your Windows 11 PC - Easy Fixes Inside

It can be a frustrating issue that the sound or audio on your Windows 11 computer intermittently stops or becomes distorted. To troubleshoot the issue, you may need to check various settings and potential causes. In this tutorial, we’ve got you covered!

1. **[Check the basics](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Install all Windows updates](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Update audio drivers](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Run the audio troubleshooter](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Disable audio enhancements](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
6. **[Restart audio services](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

## 1\. Check the basics

 To efficiently identify the source of the problem, you need to confirm that your audio device is functioning properly. If you’re using external speakers, check the power source and connections. Check if they’re working properly on other devices.

 If you’re pretty sure that your speakers or headphones are in good condition, try the fixes below.

## 2\. Install all Windows updates

 Windows updates often address software bugs and compatibility issues that may contribute to the audio problem. To take advantage of bug fixes and system improvements that come with Windows updates, you can verify if you install all the available Windows updates. Below are the steps you take:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** . Type**check for updates** and click**Check for updates** from the list of results.

## 3\. Update audio drivers

 Outdated or incompatible audio drivers can cause audio issues. If you can’t remember when was the last time you updated your drivers, do it right now. Driver updates often tackle bugs, enhance compatibility, and improve performance.

 There are mainly two ways you can update your audio drivers:[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and **[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

### Option 1: Get driver updates from the manufacturer’s websites or via the Device Manager

 You can visit the manufacturer’s website for your sound card, find the driver version that corresponds with your system, and follow the on-screen instructions to download and install the latest driver.

_Have no idea which sound card you have? Take these steps:_

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo + R keys** simultaneously to open the Run box.
2. Type**dxdiag** and hit Enter.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/win11-dxdiag.jpg)
3. Select the**Sound** tab and you should see the details of your sound card.

Or you can update your audio drivers through the Device Manager:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo + R keys** simultaneously to open the Run box.
2. Type**devmgmt.msc** and hit Enter.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/run-devmgmt.msc_.jpg)
3. In the Device Manager window, find and double-click the**Sound, video and game controllers** category to expand it. Right-click on the audio device for which you want to update the driver. This could be your sound card or integrated audio device.  

![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/update-audio-drivers.jpg)

 Then follow the on-screen instructions to search for and install the latest drivers.

### Option 2: Automatically update drivers with Driver Easy

 If you don’t have the time or patience to update drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy is a driver updater tool designed to simplify the process of updating device drivers. It is user-friendly and convenient. You don’t need to know the make and model of your audio device, Driver Easy handles it all. Driver Easy can help you identify missing and outdated drivers, and download and install the latest ones for your system, direct from the manufacturer’s websites.

Below is the simple three-step guide to update drivers with Driver Easy:

1. **Download** and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Driver-Easy-Scan-Needed.jpg)
3. Click Update All to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the Pro version – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)

If you’re experiencing issues like audio cutting out, using the Windows audio troubleshooter can be a helpful step in troubleshooting the problem.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo + I keys** simultaneously to open Settings.
2. From the left navigation panel, select**System** . Scroll down and Click**Troubleshoot** .

To resolve audio-related problems such as audio cutting out, disabling audio enhancements can be a troubleshooting step that helps.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo + I keys** simultaneously to open Settings.
2. Select**System** and click**Sound** .
