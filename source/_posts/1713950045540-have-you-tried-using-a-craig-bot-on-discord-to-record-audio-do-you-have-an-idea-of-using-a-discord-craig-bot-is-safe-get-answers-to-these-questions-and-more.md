All Craig web services, like most websites, log all users' IP addresses to identify and prevent criminal activity. Craig does not keep track of anyone who does not speak in a recorded channel, use any **Craig bot commands**, or participate in an EnnuiCastr recording.

## Part 3 How Do I Enable Craig in Discord?

All Craig web services, like most websites, log all users' IP addresses to identify and prevent criminal activity. Anyone who does not talk in a recorded channel, use any **Discord Craig** commands, or engage in a recording using the Craig web app is anonymous to Craig.

## Part 4 How to Record Discord Audio Using Craig

Craig will not record without a visible label indicating that it is getting recorded. It records your conversation with others, but it also records each user as a unique audio track, making it much easier to edit or remove specific speakers if necessary.

Follow these simple steps to use a **Discord recording bot.**

**Step 1: Invite Craig**

You must first invite Craig to your server to use him. Visit Craig's website and click the "Invite Craig to Your Discord Server" option to get started.

Now, begin the joining procedure by pressing Invite Craig to your Discord Server. This action will take you to the authorization page for the Discord server. However, before using your server, you must first grant Craig permission to join it.

For a lasting impression on the celebrant, consider adding these when you **create a birthday slideshow.** A birthday slideshow should have the following:

**●** Background music

Lighten up your video with some background music. A slideshow just displaying photos without music isn't a good idea.

**●** Meaningful Quotes and greetings

You can spice up the birthday video by adding greetings, quotes, and well wishes to let the celebrant know you want to them feel fantastic.

**●** Make the video personal

Add a personal touch to the clip by adding things that matter to the celebrant, whether pictures of them taken while performing a hobby or a favorite place. You can also use photos of their achievements from the time of their last birthday to the present one.

**●** Keep it short and simple

You don't want to drag your audience with too many photos. I think the video would have the most impact when it is short, to the point, and keeps the viewers longing for more.
