## If You Are a Teacher or People Who Want to Share Their Ideas via Vides, You Can Always Make It on Your Own. This Article Will Share You 7 Tips to Create an Educational Video Easily

For many teachers, online classes begin with a live recording of their lectures or lessons. Sending the recorded lectures to the students allows them to pause the video and rewatch it multiple times.

Recording lectures before class can assist lecturers in filling gaps that may arise due to your absence. You don't have to worry about missing lessons if you're going on vacation or to be sick for an extended time.

![create teaching video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/create-teaching-video.jpg)

You can keep the class continuing even if you are absent by using pre-recorded lectures and sending the file to the class, so they know the lesson. With the help of an online lecture software or tool available on the internet, you can download it free.

These are the steps in creating an instructional video in your classes:

## Know Your Target Audience

Before you record the video to present in your classes, you need to **know your target audience**. We all know that some teachers handle grade school, and some handle high school level. We need to discover what kind of knowledge or skills your students hope to gain in your class learning the topic you presented. Try to use your book, or maybe add some research and then use that information to help you discuss with your students.

![know your target audience](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/know-your-target-audience.jpg)

Things you need to remember before you proceed to the next step:

* Who is your audience? We, educators, already know our audience. It depends on the school and what level we are going to handle. It's either grade school level or high school level.
* What is your topic/s? There are a lot of topics and subjects in the field of teaching but try to pick only one topic or subject to present to your class. For example, Computer Subject because I'm a computer teacher. I will be using this subject or topic about computers to create my instructional video for the class.
* What is the learning objective or learning outcome of your video? The learning objective of your video is the outcome that captures precisely what knowledge, skills, and attitudes the students should be able to exhibit following the instructions.
* How will your video benefit your audience? The students will learn and understand the lesson you are discussing, helping them gain knowledge of that subject to answer all the assignments, quizzes, or maybe an activity you will give them.

## Write a Script

Once you know your audience and have the topic you need, it's time to **write a script**. Think about your plan for presenting your video in your classes.

![write video script](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/write-video-script.jpg)

* Here are a few more writing script tips to help you in your classes:

Go to the mirror and practice. This tip may help some teachers instead of calling their loved ones and getting feedback about the script they write.

* Explain what you're doing and why you're doing it. You are not only presenting the topic and explaining it but also showing the class what the topic is all about, which will be suitable for your students. Present some examples, pictures, or videos for them to know better what your discussion is all about.
* Knowing your script 100% is important. Make sure that you already know your script before you record. If you forget something or make a mistake, go back to the beginning and repeat it correctly. Remember as a teacher that we are not allowed to make mistakes in the eyes of the students. So, double-check everything before you record it and show it to the class.

## Record the Narration

After writing your script, let's try to **record the narration**. You don't need any application software where you can record the narration. Simply using your mobile phone and having a good background is enough.

![record narration](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/record-narration.jpg)

Using a microphone to record the narration is necessary. Getting those headphones with one connected microphone is good. Some of that has noise cancellation, providing a much better sound quality while recording and ensuring that your videos don't contain background noise. Then, find a quiet place to record. Explain to your family members that no one will ever talk loud or shout while you are recording the narration.

Once you are ready to hit that record button, speak clearly. Nobody is perfect, so it's ok if you make a mistake. You don't need to start over, just pause and start again. You can remove the error or mistake by editing your finished product. Make sure your narration will be the same on the screen while recording your video.

## Record and Edit your Video

The first thing you need to do in **recording your video** is to clean up your computer screen and close all the unnecessary applications. You need to turn off also the notifications that will pop up on your computer before you start recording. You can also add your recorded narration to your video.

Here are a few simple tips for **editing your video**:

* Add some interactive elements like motions to highlight key points of your video.
* Adding music to your video is optional but may elevate a decent video to the next level. Pick something cheery. You want your audience to feel good while learning.

## The Video Duration

I'd say it's one of the first things students look at before they click the 'play' button of the video. It will benefit both teacher and the students if the video is brief and direct to the point. Some students are more likely to want a short video, or maybe let's focus on the time between 20 - 30 minutes video, where they can watch and learn on any platform, anytime. After that, you can add time by adding other pieces of information and giving activities and assignments.

## Be Yourself

Be yourself, and don't be afraid to make mistakes sometimes. Make sure that your personality shines throughout the video. Try to research how some teachers or maybe some speakers speak naturally and have a conversational manner with an enthusiastic tone.

When you are recording yourself talking, look right at the camera so students can feel eye contact with you, even if it is online. Sometimes we forget the words we need to say to the class, so try to prepare a note next to your webcam. The messages you prepare will help you don't look away from the camera all the time. Don't pretend to the class that you're reading something, just talk naturally as you would in real classrooms.

## Sharing your Video

Instead of sharing your recorded video with your students, you can also share it directly to online video platforms like YouTube, Facebook, and Vimeo or save the video as a local file to upload on a social media platform. They can go there and watch the video. You can also upload your file to the school learning management system like Google Classroom. Please take note of this; before sending the recorded video to your students, share it with first to a few people to get some video feedback about what you created. This might help you ensure that your message is clear and that your video accomplishes your goals for your students.

There's a chance that your recorded video doesn't meet your requirements or you are not satisfied with that for the first time. Don't worry; try it again, even if you recorded it once or several times. You need to trust yourself by doing it because we are teachers; we are doing our best for the students to learn something from us.

## Sync Audio With Video With Filmora

Syncing audio with video is an integral part of video editing for any video creator. But believe me; it's not such a difficult task if you know what to do. The point is IF YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO.

That's why in this brief guide, we'll show you the simplest way to sync audio with video using a fantastic video editor easily. But wait a minute, some of you might be confused about why we even need to sync separate audio & video when a single camera can record both. So let's first answer this simple question.

## Part 1: Why Do We Need to Sync Separate Audio & Video?

Creating great video needs extraordinary video graphics, content, and top-notch audio. And you can't expect a single camera to achieve all these goals. That's why all professional video creators use a specialized camera for recording with a separate audio recording device.

You might think it's an exaggeration, but this small change can have massive effects on the quality of your video. Especially the background noise removal effect of separate external microphones.

![recording audio and video separately for higher quality](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/recording-audio-and-video-separately-for-higher-quality.jpg)

But the downside of using this method is that after the recording is complete, you must sync these audio and video files. And if you don't do it right, all the effort goes to the drain within a split second. Well, nobody wants to watch a video with an audio lag. Isn't it?

Correctly synching an audio file with a video is easier than you think. You just need to prepare beforehand and use a suitable video editing tool. So considering these factors, let's first see what preparations we need. After that, we'll recommend a top-class video editing tool to achieve this goal in detailed steps. Why are we still waiting? Let's begin our journey.

## Part 2: Preparation for Syncing Audio With Video During Recording

You must make some preparations to sync an audio file with a video properly. It's to have a sound spike to match the footage properly with the separate audio file. And it might look disturbing, but even a simple Clap might do the job.

And if you want a professional way, just imagine the clapper board. You must have seen it in the film industry. This clapper board is used not only to mark the shot but also to create a sound spike when it claps. We use this audio spike as a reference to sync the audio files with the video.

![a clapper board used to start a film scene](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/film-start-clapper-board.jpg)

Every time you cut your shot, remember to clap on camera again the next time you roll. It's best to clap before you say "Action" or speak so that it's easy to find and sync when editing. But if you forget, you can also clap at the end of the shot before you cut. That is called a **Tail Slate**!!!

After you've recorded your video like this, the next step is pretty simple. The video editor we recommend is no other than the world's leading tool in the market, Wondershare Filmora. Let's move forward and see how to sync audio with video using [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

##### Step4Sync the audio & video files using the audio spike

Now that the video and audio files are on the timeline, you'll have to find the moment you clap your hands. Look at the waveform from the in-camera audio and the independent audio track. At the moment you clap, we'll see a spike.

**_Bonus Tip:_** _If you can't find the audio spike, zoom the panel to make it easier._

![find the sound spike on video and audio files](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/find-the-sound-spike-on-video-and-audio-files.jpg)

Now take the independent audio clip and align it so that both the spikes match.

![align the sound spikes with each other](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/align-the-sound-spikes-with-each-other.jpg)

The software lets us to log and transfer videos onto a hard drive, where it can be edited, processed, and output to a wide variety of formats. Final Cut Pro is so advanced that it is used by hobbyist filmmakers and industry professionals in TV, Film, and media. Anyone can get a free trial of the software for their Macs, but, to purchase directly from the Mac App Store it costs $299.99\. It’s evident that Final Cut Pro can’t be downloaded, installed, and thus used on Windows, which is unfortunate, but for Mac users, it’s a very powerful video editing software.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-1.jpeg)

What are the features this advanced computer program offers to Mac users? – itreads on the web-site of Final Cut Pro:

* Object Tracker and Cinematic mode;
* Blazing pro performance;
* Editing, audio, motion graphics, color grading, and delivery;
* The best plug-ins, effects, and tools from leading developers.

One of the most impressive things about Final Cut Pro is that through it, you can create 2D and 3D titles right in the program, apply and modify filters, and use the built-in chroma key for high-quality green- and blue-screen effects. But, one should not be alarmed when it comes to experience and knowledge in editing – even though Final Cut Pro seems so advanced with its powerful tools and the possibilities it contains, it is designed for easy use and can be used by amateurs as well as professionals.

The interface, which, when it comes to editing, is one of the most important aspects (if not the main one!), seems quite standard - an ordinary window configuration, sidebar with libraries, events, projects, collections… If you want to know more about the basics of Final Cut Pro, it would be helpful to watch a [beginner tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygBlgaT78mM), with the length of only 20 minutes, an introduction of the whole program.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-2.jpeg)

Anyway, the main topic of this article is about cropping – how to crop a video in Final Cut Pro? If you are a Mac user and have this program installed on your computer, and you as well have a footage where you want to remove some portions of the video and adjust the size of the cropped clip within a certain area, this article is for you. Even though cropping is especially used when it comes to the images, it is extremely helpful in certain situations about the video clips, as well. So, let’s dive into each step of cropping in Final Cut Pro!

## Steps to crop a video in Final Cut Pro

After getting Final Cut Pro ready to work in and opening it, you need to start as always, as in any other software: Of course, choose Import Media.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-3.jpeg)

The software will ask your permission to access files in your computer, so, in order to import some, guess you have to click on OK.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-4.jpeg)

Then, it will let you choose your file – but not by opening the new window (as in most cases), rather, you can choose file within the software.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-5.jpeg)

Once you have your file(s) chosen, you need to find Import Selected button on the down and right.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-6.jpeg)

This will lead you towards the editor again, but if you try to drag and drop your file into the sequence, the program will not follow this simple order…

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-7.jpeg)

This is because what the window below reads and looks like – it offers you create a New Project first. So, you need to hit it.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-8.jpeg)

This will create the sequence where you can add the video you have already selected and imported from your media.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-9.jpeg)

Now, it’s time to find where the cropping option is. It’s quite simple – look at the icon below and a little left of the screen where your video clip shows, click on it and you will see three options: Transform, Crop, and Distort. Needless to say, you will choose crop in this case, even if other options sound quite interesting, too!

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-10.jpeg)

Choosing Crop also gives you three options: Trim, Crop, and Ken Burns. Stick with the Crop again!

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-11.jpeg)

You will notice the kind of rulers on the angles of the video clip – they are there so you can crop your footage manually, by holding and moving them with your cursor to your liking.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-12.jpeg)

Of course, if you direct your cursor in the middle of the cropped video, you can move the whole cropping window around it, so you can find the area where you intend to crop better.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-13.jpeg)

And when the selected area is ready, you need to click on Done button on the right top side of the screen. If you are not satisfied with the result, you can take the step back, by clicking on Reset button right next to Done and modify the area again.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-14.jpeg)

On the right side of the screen, you notice a window where Crop is also written. Alongside it, if you hover over the option with your mouse, you will see the word: Show. Clicking on it will let you crop the video from each side from there, too.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-15.jpeg)

There, you can “play around” with Left, Right, Top, and Bottom sides.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-16.jpeg)

In the process, if you are unsure or you want to compare the original video to the cropped version of it, keep in mind that you can uncheck the Crop button.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-17.jpeg)

Finally, when you feel the result is what you have imagined, you can proceed to saving your work. For it to be done, you need to now find an Export button top right of the whole editor, and then, choose Export File (or else, if that’s what you are willing to do).

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-18.jpeg)

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-19.jpeg)

The next step would be Export Settings. You will see a new window which has three sections: Info, Settings, and Roles. The most important one here would be considered Settings, where you choose your preferred Format, Video Codec, Resolution, Color Space, Audio Format, and Action.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-20.jpeg)

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-21.jpeg)

 When you click on Next, you then choose the Name of your project and the location where you want to save it exactly.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-22.jpeg)

Then you click on Save, and in a short amount of time, you have your new cropped video where you chose to save it! So, that’s it with cropping in the Final Cut Pro!

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-23.jpeg)

## Steps to crop a video in Final Cut Pro

After getting Final Cut Pro ready to work in and opening it, you need to start as always, as in any other software: Of course, choose Import Media.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-3.jpeg)

The software will ask your permission to access files in your computer, so, in order to import some, guess you have to click on OK.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-4.jpeg)

Then, it will let you choose your file – but not by opening the new window (as in most cases), rather, you can choose file within the software.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-5.jpeg)

Once you have your file(s) chosen, you need to find Import Selected button on the down and right.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-6.jpeg)

This will lead you towards the editor again, but if you try to drag and drop your file into the sequence, the program will not follow this simple order…

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-7.jpeg)

This is because what the window below reads and looks like – it offers you create a New Project first. So, you need to hit it.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-8.jpeg)

This will create the sequence where you can add the video you have already selected and imported from your media.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-9.jpeg)

Now, it’s time to find where the cropping option is. It’s quite simple – look at the icon below and a little left of the screen where your video clip shows, click on it and you will see three options: Transform, Crop, and Distort. Needless to say, you will choose crop in this case, even if other options sound quite interesting, too!

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-10.jpeg)

Choosing Crop also gives you three options: Trim, Crop, and Ken Burns. Stick with the Crop again!

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-11.jpeg)

You will notice the kind of rulers on the angles of the video clip – they are there so you can crop your footage manually, by holding and moving them with your cursor to your liking.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-12.jpeg)

Of course, if you direct your cursor in the middle of the cropped video, you can move the whole cropping window around it, so you can find the area where you intend to crop better.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-13.jpeg)

And when the selected area is ready, you need to click on Done button on the right top side of the screen. If you are not satisfied with the result, you can take the step back, by clicking on Reset button right next to Done and modify the area again.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-14.jpeg)

On the right side of the screen, you notice a window where Crop is also written. Alongside it, if you hover over the option with your mouse, you will see the word: Show. Clicking on it will let you crop the video from each side from there, too.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-15.jpeg)

There, you can “play around” with Left, Right, Top, and Bottom sides.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-16.jpeg)

In the process, if you are unsure or you want to compare the original video to the cropped version of it, keep in mind that you can uncheck the Crop button.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-17.jpeg)

Finally, when you feel the result is what you have imagined, you can proceed to saving your work. For it to be done, you need to now find an Export button top right of the whole editor, and then, choose Export File (or else, if that’s what you are willing to do).

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-18.jpeg)

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-19.jpeg)

The next step would be Export Settings. You will see a new window which has three sections: Info, Settings, and Roles. The most important one here would be considered Settings, where you choose your preferred Format, Video Codec, Resolution, Color Space, Audio Format, and Action.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-20.jpeg)

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-21.jpeg)

 When you click on Next, you then choose the Name of your project and the location where you want to save it exactly.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-22.jpeg)

Then you click on Save, and in a short amount of time, you have your new cropped video where you chose to save it! So, that’s it with cropping in the Final Cut Pro!
