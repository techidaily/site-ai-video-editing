* [Method 1\. Using the Timeline Settings](#method1)
* [Method 2\. Using the Clip Attribution Settings](#method2)

#### Method 1\. Using the Timeline Settings

Are you looking for a speedy and straightforward method to slow down a video? In this **DaVinci Resolve slow motion smooth**, speed is adjustable via percentage. Here is a step-by-step guide to commence this action in DaVinci:

**Step 1:** After importing your clip into this software, bring it to the timeline. Then, right-click on this clip in the timeline; a selection panel will appear. In this panel, locate the "Retime Controls" option and click it.

![access remote controls](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/slow-motion-in-davinci-resolve-1.jpg)

**Step 2:** Commencing this action will feature a speed change option on your clip. Click on the navigation icon adjacent to the speed percentage in the timeline clip. As this opens a dropdown menu, select the "Change Speed" option to continue. Further, select a slower percentage in the given panel to slow down your video.
