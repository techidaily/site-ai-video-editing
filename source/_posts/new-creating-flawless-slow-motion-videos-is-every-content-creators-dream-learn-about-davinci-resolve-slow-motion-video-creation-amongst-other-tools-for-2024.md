**Step 2:** Commencing this action will feature a speed change option on your clip. Click on the navigation icon adjacent to the speed percentage in the timeline clip. As this opens a dropdown menu, select the "Change Speed" option to continue. Further, select a slower percentage in the given panel to slow down your video.
