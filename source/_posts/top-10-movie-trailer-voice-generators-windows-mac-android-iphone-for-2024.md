Creating an intro by using video clips is an easy task. You just need suitable video clips to use as an intro, and you are good to go.

Follow the steps as mentioned to create an intro using Video clips:

##### Step1 Import the Video Clips

After downloading Wondershare Filmora, your next step is to import your video clips. To perform this, follow the steps as mentioned below:
