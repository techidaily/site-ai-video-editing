## Keyframes Interval: Everything You Need To Know | Filmora

Many people may not understand what the **Keyframe Interval** stands for. However, it is a simple concept for video editors where the encoding settings determine the frequency at which the whole picture is transmitted.

The **Keyframe Interval** is responsible for how often a keyframe is generated within the video. A keyframe, also known as an i-frame, is a single frame that contains all of the necessary information for displaying a video. If the Keyframe Interval is set too high, it could lead to visible compression without compromising the quality of a video.

**Keyframe Interval** is essential in video streaming and recording, but it can be confusing. In this guide, we'll help you understand this concept to enable you to create better animations.

## Part 1\. What Is Keyframe Interval

Keyframe Intervals, also known as "Keyframe Frequency" in Adobe Flash Media Live Encoder (FMLE) and vMix or "GOP size" by some encoders, is the frequency at which keyframes are generated in an animated sequence. This is an important parameter to consider when creating animations, as it can impact the animation's file size, quality, and smoothness.

Keyframe Intervals are the distance in time between two keyframes. For example, if an animation is set to every 2 seconds interval and the frame rate is 30 per second, it means that every 60 frames, a keyframe is created.

![keyframe interval in a video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/keyframe-interval-in-a-video.png)

## Part 2\. How Does Keyframe Interval Work?

Keyframes are important in video and animation because they mark specific points in time that can be used to create a smooth and consistent transition between different states or images. The Keyframe Interval is the amount of time that passes between two keyframes.

In order to create a smooth and consistent transition, the Keyframe Interval must be carefully calculated. In a 60-frame-per-second video, a keyframe is recorded every 5 or 300 frames. Delta frames are "difference" frames that provide an incremental change from the previous frame.

Keyframes are different from delta frames in that a higher keyframe value results in a clearer video with fewer transmission artifacts and vice versa.

The Keyframe Interval can be adjusted to create a faster or slower transition between two keyframes. A shorter Keyframe Interval will create a faster transition, while a longer one will create a slower transition.

For example, if you want your transition to look smoother, use a longer interval, like two seconds. Conversely, a zoom effect over a 0.2-second interval will be quicker.

## Part 3\. A concept closely connected to Keyframe Interval - Bitrates

The relationship between keyframes and bitrates is important to understand when creating video content. Keyframes are the frames in a video that are used to define the start and end points of an encoding process. The bitrate measures how much information is being transferred in a given time from one place to another.

When encoding video, keyframes are used to establish a consistent quality throughout the video. The bitrate is then used to determine how much information can be transferred without affecting the quality of the video. Thus, the higher the video's bitrate, the better the quality.

Your mileage may vary regarding this explanation, as different encoders manage bitrates and keyframes in different ways.

For example, if you're using an encoder like Wirecast, you might notice that broadcasting in a still background with someone talking results in a higher quality video as compared to a moving background. This can be reproduced using the same average bitrate and Keyframe Interval between them.

This happens because the delta frames have to share a lot more information to share in each frame in the video with a moving background. When you have an encoder like Wirecast, it's working to keep your stream at an average bitrate. This can result in reduced quality if there is a lot of extra information in the [delta frames.](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/delta-frame#:~:text=In%20interframe%20video%20coding%2C%20a,%2Dframes%20or%20B%2Dframes.)

## Part 4\. What You Need To Know To Set A Right Keyframe Interval

After understanding the important concepts in video editing, let’s see how to set the keyframe level in our videos appropriately.

Most streaming services will automatically set it for you based on your stream's frame rate and bitrate. However, if you want to set the keyframe gap manually, there are a few things you need to keep in mind.

* Set the frame interval at 2 seconds. Do not increase it from 4 seconds.
* Disable the "auto" keyframe feature.
* To allow for b-frames, use an encoding profile higher than baseline and use IDR-based keyframes.

## Part 5\. How To Change The Keyframe Interval On OBS Studio

Above is the basic knowledge of the keyframe interval. Then, how to apply it to your real video-editing work? In this part, we will choose OBS to show you the application process.

OBS Studio is a powerful yet free and open-source screen recorder and live streaming tool for Windows, macOS, and Linux. One of the most useful features of OBS Studio is its ability to change the keyframe interval on the fly without having to restart your recording or stream.

The process for changing the it in OBS Studio has been made more efficient since the classic version. However, some users may have trouble locating the new setting.

Here's how to change the it on OBS Studio:

Step1 Launch the **OBS Studio** on your PC or laptop.

![launching the obs studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/launching-the-obs-studio.png)

Step2 From the bottom right of the screen, open the **"Settings"** menu.

![obs studio settings menu](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/obs-studio-settings-menu.png)

Step3 On the Settings Window, click **"Output"** and configure the output mode to **"Advanced."**

![setting the output mode to advance in obs studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/setting-the-output-mode-to-advance-in-obs-studio.png)

Step4 Finally, edit the **Keyframe Interval,** set it to **2** seconds, and click **"OK"** to save your changes.

![changing the keyframe interval value on obs studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/changing-the-keyframe-interval-value-on-obs-studio.png)

## Part 6\. Will Keyframe Interval Affect Your Video’s Quality?

When you try to set the keyframe gap by yourself, you may feel confused about the difference a higher or lower interval make to your video. Then, wil-l or how it affects your video’s performance?

In a stream, it determines the balance between smoothness and picture quality. A keyframe is a point that determines how often the entire frame is sent, as opposed to just the differences from the previous frame.

Therefore, if you set the Keyframe Interval higher, your video will be more stable with fewer artifacts but requires more bandwidth and processing power. Conversely, a lower Keyframe Interval value causes more artifacts but is less resource intensive.

A lower Keyframe Interval value will result in lower video quality, while a higher keyframe value will result in higher video quality. However, the optimal Keyframe Interval value can vary depending on the specific case.

For instance, you don't need a higher Keyframe Interval for streaming a live video, but you have to use a higher Key Interval value for recording.

## Part 1 What Scene is Photoshop's Color Matching Generally Used For?

You can **match color in Photoshop** in just a few simple steps. And as far as the question of what scene can be used for it, you can use any and every photo you want to match the colour for. And the following steps will be noting how you can adjust the color of an image in Photoshop.

**Step** Open both the images, the one you want to alter and the one you want to change it with. And if it is just one image, open and select that one image.

**Step** Choose the "Image" and then select the "Adjustment" option. And after you choose the "Adjustment" option, go to the "Match Colour" option. You will be noticing the target photo that you have opted for.

**Step** You will find the "Image Statistics" portion in the dialogue portion. Opt for the "Source" list and select the image name consisting of the shades and hues you would want your image to be altered. You will notice a thumbnail appearing in the dialogue as you do so. And you will automatically see the colours of the photo have changed.

**Step** Now use the "Preview" feature to see the **photoshop match colour tone**, and then you will be done with adjusting the colour!

## Part 2 How to perfectly match colors in Photoshop when combining photos

Now, we will be discussing the different steps that will help you **match color from photo** in Photoshop, with absolute precision and effortlessness. Here is the list of steps that you would need to follow to **match skin tone in Photoshop** most perfectly.

**Step 1 Duplicate the background of the original photo**

The first and the most essential step to **match lighting photoshop** or the colour or any other editing task is to duplicate the background of the original image. The reason for this is that without this step, we might lose out on the original background information, which is essential for the image.

And to duplicate the background of an image in Photoshop, you need to use a few shortcuts of your keyboard. If you are using a Windows device, then the shortcut for this will be "Ctrl+J", and if you are using Mac, then the shortcut will be " Command+J".

![photoshop duplicate layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-1.jpg)

**Step 2 Select the Image whose colour you want to change.**

Photoshop has several selection tools. Choose one of the many selection tools. You might choose the "Pen Tool" or the "Lasso Tool" or anything else. Select the image with the tool by drawing along the image with the tool. And when you are done with tracing the image with the selection tool of your choice, you will see a border marching around the image.

![selection tool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-2.jpg)

**Step 3 Select the area of the second image**

You will need the selection tool again. The second image is the one that consists of the colour you would want the original image to match with. So, use the selection tool again to trace out an area in the second picture with the colour you want.

Ensure that you trace out a substantial area with the colour you need. You need not be highly precise with selecting the area. Instead, focus on covering a large area so that you can cover up the different shades and hues of the colour.

![select purple](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-3.jpg)

**Step 4 Move back to the original picture**

We will proceed with the "Colour Match" feature in Photoshop, but before that, you must make sure that you have the original image selected. The technical term to use here is "Focus". So, ensure that the original image is in focus.

You can bring the original image into "focus" by clicking anywhere inside the document's window where the original image is present. And that will automatically bring back the focus to the original image.

**Step 5 Bring the "Colour Match" command into function**

After selecting the original image, reach out to the "Image" option and click on the "Adjustments" option. You will find the "Match Colour" option; click on it.

There are two sections of the "Color Match" option. One is the "Image Statistics" portion, and the other is the "Destination Image". The "destination Image" portion consists of the name of the original image and a few image settings as well. The options include "luminescence", "color intensity", "fade", and "neutralize".

**Step 6 Head to the "Image Statistics" portion**

The "Image Statistics" portion consists of the "Source" option. It is present in the bottom down part of the "Image Statistics" box. It is a drop-down box, and you will have to click on it. Tap on the small downward arrow beside the "Source" option and then choose the second image where you traced out the area of the colour you would want your original image to have.

![match color source](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-5.jpg)

Your image might have more than one layer, and if so, you will have to opt for the correct layer from the "Layer" option of Photoshop.

**Step 7 Select the correct options in the "Image Statistics" area**

In the "Image Statistics" portion, you will find some options, such as "Use Selection in Source to Calculate Colours" and "Use Selection In Target To Calculate Adjustment". You will have to click on this option and agree to them. It will instruct Photoshop to follow these instructions and colour match photos accordingly.

![match color](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-6.jpg)

Click on "OK" after doing the changes mentioned above and exit the dialogue box to proceed with the next step.

**Step 8 Add "Adjustment Layer"**

Go to the "Layers" option and then opt for the "Layers Palette" present at the bottom. Then select "New Adjustment Layer" and click on the "Levels" option.

![choose levels](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-7.jpg)

**Step 9 Adjust the Pointers**

You will find two pointers, one black and the other white. You will have to bring both the pointers to the centre of the line.

Then click on "OK" and exit the box to proceed with the next step.

![level adjustment layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-8.jpg)

**Step 10 Select "Luminosity"**

You will find the "Blend Mode" in the "Layers palette". Select the "Blend Mode" from there. You will find it reflecting "Normal", which is the default setting. You need to click on the small drop-down arrow and change the option from "Normal" to "Luminosity".

![luminosity blend mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-9.jpg)

**Step** Open both the images, the one you want to alter and the one you want to change it with. And if it is just one image, open and select that one image.

**Step** Choose the "Image" and then select the "Adjustment" option. And after you choose the "Adjustment" option, go to the "Match Colour" option. You will be noticing the target photo that you have opted for.

**Step** You will find the "Image Statistics" portion in the dialogue portion. Opt for the "Source" list and select the image name consisting of the shades and hues you would want your image to be altered. You will notice a thumbnail appearing in the dialogue as you do so. And you will automatically see the colours of the photo have changed.

**Step** Now use the "Preview" feature to see the **photoshop match colour tone**, and then you will be done with adjusting the colour!

## Part 2 How to perfectly match colors in Photoshop when combining photos

Now, we will be discussing the different steps that will help you **match color from photo** in Photoshop, with absolute precision and effortlessness. Here is the list of steps that you would need to follow to **match skin tone in Photoshop** most perfectly.

**Step 1 Duplicate the background of the original photo**

The first and the most essential step to **match lighting photoshop** or the colour or any other editing task is to duplicate the background of the original image. The reason for this is that without this step, we might lose out on the original background information, which is essential for the image.

And to duplicate the background of an image in Photoshop, you need to use a few shortcuts of your keyboard. If you are using a Windows device, then the shortcut for this will be "Ctrl+J", and if you are using Mac, then the shortcut will be " Command+J".

![photoshop duplicate layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-1.jpg)

**Step 2 Select the Image whose colour you want to change.**

Photoshop has several selection tools. Choose one of the many selection tools. You might choose the "Pen Tool" or the "Lasso Tool" or anything else. Select the image with the tool by drawing along the image with the tool. And when you are done with tracing the image with the selection tool of your choice, you will see a border marching around the image.

![selection tool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-2.jpg)

**Step 3 Select the area of the second image**

You will need the selection tool again. The second image is the one that consists of the colour you would want the original image to match with. So, use the selection tool again to trace out an area in the second picture with the colour you want.

Ensure that you trace out a substantial area with the colour you need. You need not be highly precise with selecting the area. Instead, focus on covering a large area so that you can cover up the different shades and hues of the colour.

![select purple](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-3.jpg)

**Step 4 Move back to the original picture**

We will proceed with the "Colour Match" feature in Photoshop, but before that, you must make sure that you have the original image selected. The technical term to use here is "Focus". So, ensure that the original image is in focus.

You can bring the original image into "focus" by clicking anywhere inside the document's window where the original image is present. And that will automatically bring back the focus to the original image.

**Step 5 Bring the "Colour Match" command into function**

After selecting the original image, reach out to the "Image" option and click on the "Adjustments" option. You will find the "Match Colour" option; click on it.

There are two sections of the "Color Match" option. One is the "Image Statistics" portion, and the other is the "Destination Image". The "destination Image" portion consists of the name of the original image and a few image settings as well. The options include "luminescence", "color intensity", "fade", and "neutralize".

**Step 6 Head to the "Image Statistics" portion**

The "Image Statistics" portion consists of the "Source" option. It is present in the bottom down part of the "Image Statistics" box. It is a drop-down box, and you will have to click on it. Tap on the small downward arrow beside the "Source" option and then choose the second image where you traced out the area of the colour you would want your original image to have.

![match color source](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-5.jpg)

Your image might have more than one layer, and if so, you will have to opt for the correct layer from the "Layer" option of Photoshop.

**Step 7 Select the correct options in the "Image Statistics" area**

In the "Image Statistics" portion, you will find some options, such as "Use Selection in Source to Calculate Colours" and "Use Selection In Target To Calculate Adjustment". You will have to click on this option and agree to them. It will instruct Photoshop to follow these instructions and colour match photos accordingly.

![match color](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-6.jpg)

Click on "OK" after doing the changes mentioned above and exit the dialogue box to proceed with the next step.

**Step 8 Add "Adjustment Layer"**

Go to the "Layers" option and then opt for the "Layers Palette" present at the bottom. Then select "New Adjustment Layer" and click on the "Levels" option.

![choose levels](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-7.jpg)

**Step 9 Adjust the Pointers**

You will find two pointers, one black and the other white. You will have to bring both the pointers to the centre of the line.

Then click on "OK" and exit the box to proceed with the next step.

![level adjustment layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-8.jpg)

**Step 10 Select "Luminosity"**

You will find the "Blend Mode" in the "Layers palette". Select the "Blend Mode" from there. You will find it reflecting "Normal", which is the default setting. You need to click on the small drop-down arrow and change the option from "Normal" to "Luminosity".

![luminosity blend mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-9.jpg)

## Part 1 What Is the Difference Between VR and AR?

Both AR and VR use a distinctive approach and consider different use cases. They work on the concept of bringing a simulated environment to the user. Both VR i.e. the virtual reality and AR i.e. augmented reality are technologies used to replace or enhance the real-life environment with the simulated one. Virtual reality is the replacement of real-life environments with simulated ones. Whereas, Augmented reality is the procedure of augmenting the real-life environment with the addition of digital elements to a live view. This can be done by the camera on a smartphone.

The main aim of designing AR is to provide detailed information to the user about the real world. Its whole design is done by considering and adding the elements of the real world. Whereas, virtual reality is an entirely different simulation. It completely replaces the real-world environment with the virtual world.

Even Though both technologies are the simulation of the real world, they use different components of design and also have distinct targeted audiences. The concept behind VR is to distance the user from the real world as much as possible. Whereas, the concept of AR works with the real world to create a simulated environment.

The use of an eye-covering headset and headphones is very common to make an illusion of the real world, in the case of VR. Whereas, AR is usually accomplished with a smartphone or tablet screen. Here, the camera of the phone is focused at a point to capture the live-streaming of a moment on the screen. The captured data is then prepared by adding some useful information.

The applications of VR are architecture and retail, training, product design, etc. Whereas, the applications of AR are diagnostic data, navigation information, repair instructions, etc. The availability of **ar video maker** also eases the task of the industries for the mentioned purposes.
