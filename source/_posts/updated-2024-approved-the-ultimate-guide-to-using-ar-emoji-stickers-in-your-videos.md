## Change Video Speed with FFmpeg

Have you ever wanted to speed up or slow down a video? Maybe it was too long, or you wanted to draw out an exciting part of the video without having to watch the boring parts.

In this article, we will be showing you how to use FFmpeg to speed up and slow down your videos using CLI. You'll also find some other useful FFmpeg commands that you can use on your videos.

Finally, we will explain how to automate these commands so that you can run them on all your videos with ease.

![how to automate these commands](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-speed-ffmeg-1.jpg)

## Part 1\. [What is FFmpeg?](https://ffmpeg.org/about.html)

FFmpeg is a free and open-source cross-platform software project that can record, convert, and stream audio and video. It was developed by Fabrice Bellard in 2000\. It has since become one of the most popular tools for transcoding media content on Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, Windows NT, and more.

One of its lesser-known capabilities is to speed up or slow down videos in just about any design you can think of — with either the audio or the video synced to the other if desired.

### [Uses of FFmpeg](https://ottverse.com/what-is-ffmpeg-installation-use-cases/)

FFMPEG is a command-line tool that can manipulate and transcode video files. Its uses are as follows:

* FFmpeg can create, trim, join or separate video clips on the fly and encode them into formats including MPEG, VOB, M2TS, TS, RMVB, or AVI.
* It can be used for Video processing, Video packaging support, Video compression, Audio, and Video container support, FFplay, and FFprobe.
* It also has extensive options for altering the look of an image in just about any way imaginable. Whether you want to change the brightness, hue, saturation, or perform multiple operations like subsampling (resizing) without reducing quality—the list goes on!

You could think of it as the Swiss army knife for video manipulation tasks. The interface might seem intimidating at first, but once you get the hang of it, all commands are broken down into simple English phrases.

The most important thing to know before getting started with this is how to use FFmpeg's -i and -v flags for input and output, respectively. To apply effects like slow motion playback or fast motion playback, use these flags in tandem with one another when specifying which file should be edited.

### Benefits and Disadvantages of FFmpeg

FFmpeg has many benefits over other video editing software because it is free and open source, meaning that you have access to the code so that you can modify it if needed. Thus, it's a better option when compared to other video editing software such as Avidemux, QuickTime Pro 7, and Adobe Premiere Elements 12\. Some of these benefits include:

* Being able to edit videos on multiple platforms (Windows, Mac OS X);
* FFmpeg has features to speed up and slow down video;
* Being able to convert from one format into another seamlessly;
* An extensive amount of features are at your disposal.

Some of the drawbacks are that some settings are not configurable, like with YouTube's built-in editor. The main disadvantage, though, would be the lengthiness of the program's installation process: not only do you need to download FFmpeg itself but also three external libraries like libx264, libmp3lame, and libfaac; then you must compile all six packages before the installation completes. Luckily this process doesn't take very long.

Another possible disadvantage is the time required for downloading the various resources since they may not be readily available on standard file hosting sites such as Mediafire or Dropbox (though they can be found through third-party websites). If you're looking for something more robust than Windows Movie Maker or iMovie, we recommend checking out FFmpeg.

### Major approaches to speed up a video in Filmora

As we know that Filmora has the option to change the speed of a video, so let's find out step-by-step how to do that; you can also watch this [Tutorial on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w6CEhFHnII):

### Method 1: Use the 'Fast' or 'Slow' option to change the speed

Just as simple as the heading is, this option is pretty straightforward, but you cannot decide how much speed you want to add to your video or how slow you want it to be.

### Method 2: Changing Uniform Speed in Wondershare Filmora

You need to check your video's FPS and import your clip first.

Pick your preferred video. Go to the menu and select "Download." After hitting the "Plus" button, you may maintain the video's quality by choosing "Match to Media."

![go to the menu](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/change-video-speed-2.PNG)

After the movie has loaded, you have two options: double-clicking the clip or selecting the speed option provided below the screen.

![double clicking the clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/change-video-speed-3.PNG)

A window appears when we double-click the chosen video. We shall navigate to the "SPEED" section beneath this window. Additional "Uniform Speed" and "Speed Ramping" panels may be found on this speed panel. We shall operate within the uniform speed panel to alter the video's tempo consistently. A slider is provided for us to adjust the movie's pacing.

The general speed of the film is continually increased or decreased when we choose the option for constant pace. If we choose the speed option on the screen, it gives us a built-in range of numbers that we can use to change the video's pace in addition to presets like rapid and regular slow.

![rapid and regular slow](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/change-video-speed-4.PNG)

Once we click "OK," the video's tempo adjusts automatically.

### Method 3: Adjusting the Fast/Slow motion to fit your movie using the Speed Ramping option

To set up the speed ramping feature for your video, double-clicking the video will give us access to the "SPEED RAMPING" option in the speed panel. When we select the speed ramping option, we see a range of graphs. Each graph shows a number of tempo variations that we may use in our movie.

For Instance, when we select the "MONTAGE" preset, the video's tempo changes based on how many keyframes we choose and at what rate. As previously stated, as the graph rises above one and falls below one, the movie's tempo will slow down, increasing its regular speed.

![increasing its regular speed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/change-video-speed-8.PNG)

Moving these keyframes higher will make the video go more quickly, while moving them downward will make the movie move more slowly. We may also add more keyframes by using the add button up top, as seen in the image. When satisfied with our results, we will produce the video after pressing the "OK" button.

## Synchronizing Videos Can Be Hectic, but Do You Wish to Know a Good Tool for This Purpose? This Article Will Discuss Wondershare Filmora, Which Is Perfect for This

Video quality and engagement are prone to impact badly if your audio is not synchronized with the video. This can happen because of technical issues or frame rate mismatches. In case you somehow get unsynchronized audio in the video, you need to use a reliable video editor to cater to this issue. To help you with this issue, this article will provide the best-in-class video editor named Wondershare Filmora.

## Part 1: Why Should You Synchronize Your Audio And Videos in Video Editing?

Audio and video synchronization is important for presenting a good quality viewing experience. Here are the main reasons you shouldn’t neglect this in your audio and video.

### Lip Sync and Narrative Flow

Synchronizing audio and video is crucial to maintaining the film's narrative flow. Well-synchronized audio and video offer a very smooth experience to the viewers. If the lips and dialogue flow are not well maintained, it can cause distraction in the storytelling. As a result, the real message won't be conveyed to the viewers.

### Viewer Engagement

Do you wish to ensure that your viewers pay full attention to your video and that your message is well conveyed? Your video quality and sound matter the most for the best experience. When the audio and video are well-synced, the viewers pay attention to the content. They are not distracted due to the bad quality of the video.

### Value of Quality Production

A high-quality video with perfect sound quality and proper syncing builds a good perception. If the video quality is bad or does not have proper sync, it can leave a bad impression. Therefore, to enhance the impact of these emotional and dramatic effects, it is imperative to focus on these core things.

### Professionalism and Quality

To make your viewer experience outstanding, focus on paying attention to details. A good quality video represents your professionalism and the standards of your production. When it is synchronized, the viewer will always see this as a high-quality creation.

![push transition filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/push-transition-filmora.png)

Step 10

Open a new Filmora project and adjust the Project Settings like we did the first time. Then, go to **Sample Color** and drag the White color to the Timeline once more.

Step 11

Go to **Titles** and drag the Default Title to the Timeline, above the White Sample Color clip. Now, double-click the Default Title clip and go to **ADVANCED.** Here, set the text color to green, choose a font you like, and increase the text size. Click **OK.** Export it and name it “Temporary”.

![edit text in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/edit-text-in-filmora.png)

Step 12

Open a new project in Filmora. Import and Drag the same background image you used before to the Timeline. Double-click on it and drag the Saturation bar to **\-100**. Now, drag the file you named “Temporary” into the Timeline.

![drag file into timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/drag-file-into-timeline.png)

Step 13

Double-click on the Temporary clip, scroll down when the new window appears, and find the **Chroma key** section. Enable this. Now, drag the Edge Feather bar to **0\.** Export this video and name it “2nd Text”.

![green screen in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/green-screen-in-filmora.png)

Step 14

Open one more new project in Filmora and import the following files. There should be four, titled “Background”, “Transition”, “1st Text”, and “2nd Text”.

Step 15

Click on **Sample Color** and drag the **Black** color to the 1st Track of the Timeline. Then, move the Playhead to the 1-second marker and drag the “**Transition**” clip to the same Track within the Timeline.

![transition clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/transition-clip.png)

Step 16

From the **Transitions** tab, select the **Push** transition and drag it to the Timeline.

![add transition in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-transition-in-filmora.png)

Step 17

Set the Playhead at the 1-second marker once again. First, add the “1st Text” clip into Track 2 of the Timeline. Then, add another **Push** transition at the beginning of this clip.

![add clip in timeline filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-clip-in-timeline-filmora.png)

Step 18

Now, double-click on the “1st Text” clip and enable the **Chroma Key** option. Then, set the **Edge Thickness** and **Edge Feather** bars to **0.**

![edit chroma key options filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/edit-chroma-key-options-filmora.png)

Step 19

Set the Playhead at 4.5 seconds. Snip the Timeline. Then, add a new Default Title on the right side of the Playhead on Track 2.

![insert new title in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/insert-new-title-in-filmora.png)

Step 20

Double-click on the Default Title and go to Advanced settings. From there, delete the default text and click on the highlighted button like in the image below to add a new background to this clip. Add the same background you’ve used throughout the entire video.

![add background to title filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-background-to-title-filmora.png)

Step 21

Add a new text here and customize it to match the text style in your “2nd Text” clip you exported earlier. Click **OK**.

![add text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text.png)

Step 22

Next, go to the Transitions tab and drag the **“Row Split”** transition clip between Track 2 and the New Default Title you just created. Then, double-click on the transition and change its duration to 1 second.

![row split transition](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/row-split-transition.png)

Step 23

Set the Playhead to the 5.5 seconds marker. Drag the “2nd Text” clip you exported earlier here. Then, simply add another **Row Split** transition between this clip and the Default Title.

![drag new clip in timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/drag-new-clip-in-timeline.png)
