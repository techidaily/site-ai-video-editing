While LUTs are commonly used to speed up the color grading process, they can also be used for other tasks, such as color transfer between software, monitor calibration, and more.

In this article, we’ll explore a particular LUT – Leeming LUT Pro™ and how you can use it in various video editors.

![use lut in filmora - open color tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/leeming-lut-pro-5.jpg)

### Step 4\. Apply a LUT to the Video

Under the color tab, navigate to the 3D LUT option and select one of the available options in the 3D LUT drop-down menu to apply a LUT.

Many LUTs are named after popular TV shows and series whose visual styles they mimic, such as Batman, House of Cards, Game of Thrones, Mission Impossible, Harry Potter, Star Wars, and more.

Once you apply a LUT, you can see your changes in the Preview Window. Besides using the preset LUTs, Filmora also allows you to use custom LUTs. Instead of choosing one of the presets, click on the Load New LUT option to import your custom LUT into Filmora.

### Step 5\. Make Fine Adjustments

Once you apply a LUT, Filmora can allow you to make further modifications to the video. Click on the Advanced button at the bottom of the color tab to view advanced color correction options.

In the new window that opens, you can adjust several things, such as color, light, HSL, and more. You can also choose from a variety of other available presets.

## Conclusion

LUTs are a fast way to color grade your footage after color correction. However, to ensure your LUTs work effectively, here are some important guidelines you should observe when using LUTs:

* Ensure your footage matches from shot to shot, especially if you’re applying LUTs to multiple clips.
* Ensure your exposure is correct before using LUTs. You can use a histogram to help you set the exposure.
* Ensure you apply LUTs to a video that’s been properly color corrected.
* Make small adjustments to things, such as brightness, saturation, contrast, exposure, color temperature, and tint for best results.
* Test out various LUTs before settling for one because shooting conditions can drastically affect how different LUTs look.

Ultimately, LUTs are an excellent way to make your video more cinematic. If you don’t have advanced video editing skills or prior experience working with LUTs, don’t worry. Filmora is a user-friendly video editing software that allows you to quickly apply LUTs with no video editing experience. Just download Filmora for free to get started.

Color grading can be a tedious process, especially if you don’t have the technical skills required to achieve the desired result. That’s where a LUT can come in handy. So, what is a LUT?

LUT stands for “look up table.” Simply put, a LUT is a color preset that you can apply to your video footage to speed up the color grading process. While LUTs are commonly used to speed up the color grading process, they can also be used for other tasks, such as color transfer between software, monitor calibration, and more.

In this article, we’ll explore a particular LUT – Leeming LUT Pro™ and how you can use it in various video editors.

## What is Leeming LUT Pro™?

Leeming LUT Pro™ is the world's first unified, corrective Look Up Table (LUT) system for supported cameras. It’s designed to maximize dynamic range, fix skin tones, remove unwanted color casts and provide an accurate Rec709 starting point for further creative color grading.

The Pro LUTs are designed for perfect Rec709 colorimetry and have a linear luma curve, with an average measured dE(2000) of less than 1\. As a result, they are visually indistinguishable from reality to the human eye.

Athena LUTs are a brighter version of Pro. They are designed around how the eye sees while retaining the same perfect colorimetry as Pro.

![use lut in filmora - open color tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/leeming-lut-pro-5.jpg)

### Step 4\. Apply a LUT to the Video

Under the color tab, navigate to the 3D LUT option and select one of the available options in the 3D LUT drop-down menu to apply a LUT.

Many LUTs are named after popular TV shows and series whose visual styles they mimic, such as Batman, House of Cards, Game of Thrones, Mission Impossible, Harry Potter, Star Wars, and more.

Once you apply a LUT, you can see your changes in the Preview Window. Besides using the preset LUTs, Filmora also allows you to use custom LUTs. Instead of choosing one of the presets, click on the Load New LUT option to import your custom LUT into Filmora.

### Step 5\. Make Fine Adjustments

Once you apply a LUT, Filmora can allow you to make further modifications to the video. Click on the Advanced button at the bottom of the color tab to view advanced color correction options.

In the new window that opens, you can adjust several things, such as color, light, HSL, and more. You can also choose from a variety of other available presets.

## Conclusion

LUTs are a fast way to color grade your footage after color correction. However, to ensure your LUTs work effectively, here are some important guidelines you should observe when using LUTs:

* Ensure your footage matches from shot to shot, especially if you’re applying LUTs to multiple clips.
* Ensure your exposure is correct before using LUTs. You can use a histogram to help you set the exposure.
* Ensure you apply LUTs to a video that’s been properly color corrected.
* Make small adjustments to things, such as brightness, saturation, contrast, exposure, color temperature, and tint for best results.
* Test out various LUTs before settling for one because shooting conditions can drastically affect how different LUTs look.

Ultimately, LUTs are an excellent way to make your video more cinematic. If you don’t have advanced video editing skills or prior experience working with LUTs, don’t worry. Filmora is a user-friendly video editing software that allows you to quickly apply LUTs with no video editing experience. Just download Filmora for free to get started.

## OpenCV Object Tracking: The Complete Guide

**OpenCV Tracking** is a popular method used for tracking objects in a video in real-time. OpenCV is a powerful library used for image processing and computer vision applications.

From real-time video analysis to Augmented Reality, OpenCV Tracking has a wide range of uses and can help both private and public sectors to detect and track the desired object in an image or video.

In this comprehensive guide, we’ll explore **OpenCV Tracking** and its pre-built trackers**.** We will use the OpenCV library and Python to implement this Object Tracking application.

## Part 1\. What Is Object Tracking?

Object Tracking determines the location of an object in a video and can be used for a variety of purposes, including surveillance, security, traffic control, digital forensics, anomaly detection, gesture recognition, visual surveillance, human-computer interaction, augmented reality, and robot vision.

Even though it may seem easy for an average person, object tracking is quite complex for computers because they have to analyze a set of frames and estimate the object’s trajectory based on numbers instead of images.

Because of how complicated it is, Object Tracking is considered one of the most difficult tasks in computer vision. Even though it's a challenge, it's not impossible to accomplish.

And there are two levels of Object Tracking that you should learn about:

### 1\. SOT & MOT

1. **Single Object Tracking (SOT):** SOT is a tracking algorithm that creates advanced appearance models and/or motion models to manage difficult issues like out-of-plane rotations, illumination variations, or scale changes.
2. **Multiple Object Tracking (MOT):** MOT tracks every part of a video and is mainly concerned with mid-level tasks and serves as a foundation for high-level tasks.

### 2\. The Difference Between Tracking And Detection

After knowing what Object Tracking is, there is another concept you should also be aware of - Object Detection.

The Object Tracking and Object Detection are two important methods in computer vision. Object Tracking tracks the position of a given object in an image in real-time, while Object Detection identifies and localizes objects in an image or video. That is the difference.

## Part 2\. Types Of Object Tracking

### Image Tracking

Image tracking allows users to interact with digital content more naturally and helps users move and interact with digital objects in the same manner as they will with real-world physical objects.

Image tracking can be used in various augmented reality (AR) applications, such as AR gaming, shopping, and navigation. Moreover, you can also use it for educational purposes, such as teaching anatomy or providing instructions for a difficult task.

### Video Tracking

Video tracking is the process of tracking objects in a video sequence and can be used for various applications, such as detecting and counting objects in a scene, understanding their motions, and recognizing activities.

## Part 3\. What Are The Difficulties Of Object Tracking?

As what has been mentioned above, the use of object tracking is versatile. However, there are some challenges associated with Object Tracking, such as:

**Background Clutter:** The background can impact extracting an object's features. If the background is more densely populated, detecting or tracking the object of interest can be more difficult.

**Occlusion:** This is a phenomenon where the object being tracked is affected by the background or foreground. This causes the tracking algorithm to get confused due to multiple objects coming close together, hence, losing track of the object.

**Varying spatial scales:** Varying spatial scales refer to the target object being of a different size or shape, which can confuse the algorithm, leading to errors.

**Training and Tracking Speed:** If the object is moving too fast or is too small, it can be difficult to track. Therefore, the tracking module has to be designed to track, identify, and localize objects in a matter of seconds.

## Part 4\. Stages Of The Object Tracking Process

After the introduction of object tracking technically, let’s learn about its mechanism of it from two sides: periods of the working process and the way it tracks.

### 1\. Stages Of The Object Tracking Process

Following are the stages of the Object Tracking process:

**Target Initialization**

Target initialization is the first step in Object Tracking and involves defining the targets or objects of interest and drawing a bounding box around them in the initial frame. After that, the tracker has to detect the position of the object in the frame while drawing the bounding box.

**Appearance Modeling**

Appearance modeling is important for understanding how an object will look under different circumstances. If the object being tracked changes appearance due to different lighting, angle, or speed, the tracking algorithm may lose its information and the object itself. Therefore, it has to be conducted to let the algorithm detect the changes and distortion.

**Motion Estimation**

Motion estimation entails the capacity of the model to anticipate an object's future position with precision.

**Target Positioning**

Motion estimation is a process of approximating the most likely region where an object could be present. After the object's location is approximated, a visual model can be used to determine the target's location more accurately.

### 2\. Methods Of Object Tracking

Here’re some methods of Object Tracking:

**OpenCV-Based Object Tracking**

**OpenCV Object Tracking** method is widely used because it offers several built-in functions designed specifically for this purpose, such as GOTURN, MIL, MediandFlow, and CSRT. The tracker type you select will depend on your specific application design. Each tracker has its pros and cons, so there is not a single type of tracker ideal for all applications.

**MDNet**

Multi-Domain Convolutional Neural Network Tracker is a convolutional neural-based visual tracker and has won the VOT2015 challenge. Moreover, it is composed of domain-specific layers, branches, and multiple shared layers.

The MDNetT tracker is a deep neural network that is trained on numerous Object Tracking datasets. The tracker is designed to work in multiple domains, including video, text, and images.

**DeepSort**

DeepSort algorithm can track objects in real-time and uses YOLO v3 to compute the bounding boxes around the objects in a frame.

DeepSort uses Kalman filter from Simple Online and Realtime Tracking algorithm and an identification model, ReID to interlink bounding boxes and object tracks.

**ROLO**

ROLO is a novel Object Tracking method that uses recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to learn object-specific Spatio-temporal representations. This method works with YOLO, an object detection algorithm, and an LTSM for determining the trajectory of an object.

## Part 5\. The powerful backup: OpenCV
