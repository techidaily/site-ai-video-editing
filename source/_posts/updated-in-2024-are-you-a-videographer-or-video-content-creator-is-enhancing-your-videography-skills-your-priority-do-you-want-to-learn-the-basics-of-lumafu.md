After creating LUTs, import and apply them to your LumaFusion. Next, blend or adjust your LUt by shifting the slider to get your desired effects. It's that simple!

3. Access rendered movies
4. Apply the second LUT

## Essential Things You Should Know About Color Grading in LumaFusion

Color grading is an essential post-production process that gives your footage's color scheme a distinctive appearance and character. This technique gives your videos some cinematic impression by painting over them.

With color grading, you can adjust your video's color balance, saturation, contrast, luminance, black level, etc. It helps to evoke the particular emotions or moods that you want your videos to exude.

These are the essential things to note about color grading in LumaFusion:

#### 1\. Does LumaFusion Have Color Grading?

In answering this question, it's essential to understand the difference between color correction and color grading. Both editing techniques have vital differentiating characteristics, so it's wrong to use them interchangeably.

Color correction ensures that videos look as natural to the human eye as possible. If there's a technical color error, for example, due to bad lighting, color correction helps fix that.

However, the aim of color grading isn't fixing color mistakes but using colors to convey a mood, atmosphere, or style. Some videographers classify color correction as the first phase in the color grading process.

Generally, you can use LumaFusion to color correct your footage. However, you can't color grade with the app except you decide to tamper with the color presets tab's color sliders. Even at that, you wouldn't get the perfect results you want.

Fortunately, LumaFusion allows you to import and apply LUT (look-up tables). With LumaFusion LUTs, you can color grade your footage to your satisfaction.

○ Bring In a LUT

After creating LUTs, import and apply them to your LumaFusion. Next, blend or adjust your LUt by shifting the slider to get your desired effects. It's that simple!

#### 3\. Can I Use Multiple LUTs in LumaFusion?

The short answer is a big YES. You can apply multiple LUTs in LumaFusion.

Here's how t go o about it:

1. Apply your first LUT
2. Export the LUT
3. Access rendered movies
4. Apply the second LUT

There is numerous manipulation you can do with LUT. For example, you can merge two or more LUTs into one.

## How to Create Video in Text Intro?

Have you ever seen videos on social media apps or movies and seen a video in text like the title as the intro? The highly appealing and unique style makes the video introduction stand out. Not to mention, it creates an illusion of almost-transparent titles that showcase the video playing in a subdued manner in the background, thereby showcasing a modern, funky intro.

![the example of text intro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-video-in-text-intro-0.gif)

Now, are you planning to create an effect such as that on your own video project? Worry not; you do not have to hire video editing experts at enormous costs or opt for a video editing course, to name a few. With [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you can create the effect at more than half the cost and effort. Let's learn how that works.

## 1\. Accessing the software

The first step to kickstart the whole process is downloading the software into your system. For this, visit the official website of Filmora and click on the Download button at the top of the page or the description. This will automatically download an installer for the app on your device.

![click on the download button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-video-in-text-intro-1.jpg)

From the Downloads section of your Mac or Windows-based device in the browser, double-click on the installer. It will ask you to confirm the terms and conditions and press the Install button on the next pop-up prompt. Then will start the overall downloading process of the software into your device, and it will take some seconds, after which Filmora will automatically open to the homepage.

Click on the "Create New Project" button on the homepage, and that will launch the software to the editor window.

![launch to the editor window](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-video-in-text-intro-2.jpg)

## 2\. Add Sample Color

On the main editor window of Filmora, you have to go to the My Media section. From the drop-down list, click on the folder full of Sample Colors. Next, click on the black sample color option and drag it down to the editing timeline. Finally, drop it in the place of the Track 1 section on the timeline.

![drop it in track 1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-video-in-text-intro-3.jpg)

## 3\. Put the Title tile into the video

After you add the sample color to the timeline, you have to click on the Titles tab from the top main toolbar of Filmora. Out of the options you find here, choose the Default Title. Then, hold it and drag the title template onto the Track 2 section of the editing timeline, and drop it in place.

Then, double-click on it to open the editing panel for the text. You will see a text field where you can update the title wording instead of "Your Title Here". Then, you have to change the size of this title text to 280\. Make sure to adjust the font style to whichever option you prefer, but typically a blocky style works. Click on the Bold icon to change the structure of the title text.

Scroll downward among the text editing parameters until you see the Text Spacing option. Whatever the default value here is placed as, you have to turn it to 10\. After that, click on the OK button.

![change the title](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-video-in-text-intro-4.jpg)

## 5\. Insert the background video

Next, go to the My Media tab again and choose the Project Media option. Right-click on the library section and tap on the Import button. This will open you to the device storage of your computer.

It would be much simpler to organize the timeline if you could quickly rename individual clips. Cut a clip into smaller segments and give each clip a different name. Make sure these clips have a name other than the source video to avoid confusion.

**2\. Remove Empty Timeline**

For quick video editing, timeline organization is essential. Organize your materials and footage at all times to prevent delays. Put everything in the correct folders with the proper labels.

**3\. Use Keyboard Shortcuts**

Knowing keyboard shortcuts allows you to carry out the editing process quickly and precisely.

**4\. Select Good Music**

Don't only concentrate on the images; the music also affects how well your video comes out. For example, suppose you're making a drama movie. In that case, you should pick the right music track to evoke particular emotions in your viewers.

**5\. Add Text and Graphics**

Depending on the style of the video, adding text, graphics, or stock video to your project could be helpful. You should provide more text than just the title for some videos.

![create a folder for camera 1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_1.jpg)

##### Step2 Create a Folder for Camera 2

Then go to the bottom left of the media browser and click on this icon to add a new folder. Rename it to Cam\_B.

![create a folder for camera 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_2.jpg)

##### Step3 Create a Folder for Camera 3

Repeat the steps to create another folder called Cam\_C. Now you can import footage from your different cameras into each folder.

![create a folder for camera 3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_3.jpg)

##### Step4 Create a Folder for Production Sound

After that, add three new folders and rename them to Production Sound, SFX, and Music. Production sound is usually the sound that is recorded on set. If you have recorded all dialects from the subjects on the location, you can put them into this folder.

![create a folder for production sound](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_4.jpg)

##### Step5 Create a Folder for SFX

SFX stands for sound effects. You can add push clapping, laughing and other Folly sounds into this folder.

##### Step6 Create a Folder for Music

Next, import all music files into the music folder. You can create folders for your graphics, B-roll, and stock footage if needed.

**2\. Organize your Timeline and Video Tracks**

##### Step1 Create Tracks for Picture Editing

Keep the first three tracks for picture editing. These tracks are usually for picture editing that includes footage with no effects or some simple effects—for example resizing, keyframing, transitions, or Green Screen.

![create tracks for picture editing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_7.jpg)

##### Step2 Create Tracks for Temporary Footage

Set up the fourth track for the temporary footage or placeholders so you can quickly switch the temporary footage without spending extra time looking for them.

![create tracks for temporary footage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_8.jpg)

##### Step3 Create Tracks for Effects

Set the fifth video track as the effect track. It will include all effects from firmware that do not apply to the footage directly.

![create tracks for effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_9.jpg)

##### Step4 Create Tracks for On and Off Content

Next, on the sixth video track, you can add the content that you would want to turn on and off from time to time. In this example, you can put the subtitles here.

![create tracks for on and off content](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_10.jpg)

**3\. Organize your Audio Tracks**

##### Step1 Create Tracks for Dialects

The first two tracks are usually for dialects. You can include all the dialects of characters in these tracks. Keep one track for each character. If you have more characters, feel free to assign more tracks to them.

![create tracks for dialects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_11.jpg)

##### Step2 Create Tracks for Additional Audio

The third audio track could be for any additional audio, such as voiceover. If you don't have a voiceover in your video, you can leave it empty.

![create tracks for additional audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_12.jpg)

##### Step3 Create Tracks for Sound Effects

The fourth track could usually be the sound effects track. You can add all the clapping sounds, laughing, and all kinds of other foley sound here.

![create tracks for sound effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_13.jpg)

##### Step4 Create Tracks for Ambient Sound

Keep the fifth track for Ambient sound and room tone. You can use it to keep a very subtle environment sound in specific scenes. For example, you can use the room tone recorded on sets.

![create tracks for ambient sound](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_14.jpg)

##### Step5 Create Tracks for Background Music

Finally, the sixth track is usually for background music. But, of course, you could also keep it empty if your project has no background music.

![create tracks for background music](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_15.jpg)

**4\. Color Code Your Clips**

Suppose you want to make the timeline even easier to view. In that case, you can select all clips from a camera or a subject and color code them into a specific color. For example, you can color code the footage from camera A in red, camera B in yellow, and Camera C in blue. Now, when you look at the Timeline, you can quickly distinguish footage from different cameras.

![color code your clips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_16.jpg)

## Part 2: Pro Tips about Improving Video Editing Efficiency

**1\. Rename Individual Clips**

It would be much simpler to organize the timeline if you could quickly rename individual clips. Cut a clip into smaller segments and give each clip a different name. Make sure these clips have a name other than the source video to avoid confusion.

**2\. Remove Empty Timeline**

For quick video editing, timeline organization is essential. Organize your materials and footage at all times to prevent delays. Put everything in the correct folders with the proper labels. To keep your timeline organized, select "Delete Empty Tracks" from the context menu when right-clicking on the track window on the left.

**3\. Use Keyboard Shortcuts**

Knowing keyboard shortcuts allows you to carry out the editing process quickly and precisely.

**4\. Select Good Music**

Don't only concentrate on the images; the music also affects how well your video comes out. For example, suppose you're making a drama movie. In that case, you should pick the right music track to evoke particular emotions in your viewers.

**5\. Add Text and Graphics**

Depending on the style of the video, adding text, graphics, or stock video to your project could be helpful. You should provide more text than just the title for some videos.

## Summary

You don't need to be an expert in video editing to produce high-quality videos. In reality, you can complete the task without any expensive, high-end professional training. So how? Well, with the proper video editing tools like Wondershare Filmora, anything is possible. Follow the above guide, organize your timeline and keep the tracks consistent while video editing on Filmora so it's easier to come back and edit a project or share with other editors.
