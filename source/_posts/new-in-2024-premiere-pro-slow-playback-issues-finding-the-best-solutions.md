To do so, open the Premiere Pro and go to the “Preferences” menu. From the list, select “Media Cache.” Now browse to select the media and tap on the “Delete Unused” next to the “Delete Unused Media Cache Files. After choosing the option to delete cache files, click on “OK and the files will be removed.
