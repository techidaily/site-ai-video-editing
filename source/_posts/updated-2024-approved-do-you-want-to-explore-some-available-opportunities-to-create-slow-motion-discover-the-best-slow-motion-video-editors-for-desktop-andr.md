## Part 2 How to Convert Slides to Digital - Step-by-Step Guide

Here, we will discuss step-by-step ways to turn the old slides into digital images. So, let’s begin:

**Step 1: Resolution**

The very first step for **converting slides to digital photos** is measuring and fixing the resolution of the slides. The technical measurement of image resolution is DPI (dot per inch). It helps you to predict the sharpness or clarity of the final image. The overall measurement depends on the size of the slide and the type of converter or scanner you are using. For example,

A 35 mm slide scanned at 10 MP will give you the images of size 13"\*9".

Step 2: Dust and Scratch Removal

If you have slides that have been wrapped in a box and remained untouched for so long, they might require cleaning. Such slides may develop mold buildup, age-related blemishes, or scratches. They need a cleaning process before using them to convert into slides. A lint-free cloth and an anti-static film cleaner are the best combinations to gently clean the slides and make them fresh.

Step 3: Color Correction and Restoration

Color correction and restoration is another important step when you are dealing with converting old slides into digital images. In order to correct the fading and color shift, you can use the built-in scanning software. You can also use other software for such purposes.

Wondershare Filmora is the best tool which can be used for the color correction of old slides. It is a handy tool with a variety of features.

Step 4: Using the Best Scanner cum Digital Converter

The next step is choosing the best quality scanner according to the requirement. 35 mm is the most common size of the slides. But, it does come with other uncommon formats too such as 110, 126, 120, 127, etc. You will come to know about the actual size when the image is mounted on the cardboard. Therefore, it is essential to select a quality and versatile scanner which can convert slides of any size effectively.

## Part 6: How to Convert Normal Video to Smooth Slow Motion In iPhone And Android Phones

In addition to the essential editing tools of the famous social media platform, TikTok, CapCut is [mobile video editing software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for both Android and iOS smartphones that were mainly built to complement them. Here is how you can use CapCut to transform a regular video into a slow-mo one:

**Step 1**: **Create A New Project** on the CapCut app's home screen. Browse and add the video you want to search for in slow-motion to the project.

**Step 2**: When you're ready to turn off the sound, go ahead and hit the **Mute clip audio** button first, so there will be no creep sound after applying the slow-motion effect.

![ mute video audio capcut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mute-video-audio-capcut.jpg)

**Step 3:** In case you just want to add a slo-mo effect to part of the video, you need to split the video accordingly. Split the portion of the video that will be slowed down by clicking on the **Split** button in the menu. And use the Split tool again to end the slow-motion effect to get a segment of the video.

**Step 4**: Tap the cut section of the video and then you will see the Speed option. Open the **Speed** menu by selecting it from the drop-down menu.

![ speed option in capcut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/capcut-speed-menu.jpg)

**Step** **5:** In CapCut, there are two methods to slow down a video, **Normal** and **Curve**, respectively. You may just choose the "**Normal**" option to make things easy. It is possible to reduce the video's frame rate by moving the speed slider to the left. You may, for example, make the pace 0.3 times slower. Apply a slow-motion effect by tapping the **Check** box.

![ change speed  in capcut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-video-speed-capcut-normal.jpg)
