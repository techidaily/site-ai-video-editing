## How To Use Virtual Green Screen to Shoot Video

We have seen video creators on YouTube using green screen effects to beautify their background to make the video look professional and eye-catching. The same is applicable for gamers who live stream their gameplay on Twitch. Instead of physically hanging green screens in the background, some video creators opt for virtual green screens. Yes, it is possible to shoot videos with a virtual green background, and you do not have to buy screen greens and deal with the problem of hanging them in the background.

The concept of using virtual greenscreen is rather new, but it is getting popular among amateur video creators who do not want to invest in purchasing green screens initially. When you use a virtual background to shoot your video, the actual physical background is replaced completely with a virtual green background. Thereafter, you have to replace this virtual background with anything by using a video editor. In this article, we will illustrate how to use a virtual green screen to shoot video.

Therefore, there are specific apps available through which you have to shoot your video so that your physical background gets completely replaced by virtual greenscreen in real-time.

Snap Camera from Snapchat is a free app through which you can shoot your video to get a virtual green background. The app comes with a Green Screen filter that makes this virtual background effect possible. However, you will need a camera recording app that can record your video with green screen effects from Snap Camera.
