All you need to do is just a background shuffle. While you can do this with almost any GIF editing software available across the web, here’s how you can take up the process using the Egif video converter tool:

**Step 1: Convert a Video to GIF**

Using Egif, first of all convert a desired video into GIF. Take caution to manually remove backgrounds from all video frames and save the GIF using .gif or .png file extensions. Don’t use .jpg extension; else you will end up losing background transparency.

**Step 2: Color Selection**

![Processed GIF with Transparent Background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/How-to-make-a-GIF-with-transparent-background-3.JPG)

If you require partially transparent backgrounds within specific portions of complex animated creations, you can use the ‘GIF Maker’ tool to selectively split and edit every clip frame, apply the transparency effect and finally merge all such clips together.

## Part 2 Can Parts of GIF Be Made Semi-Transparent?

Hence, it is a regret to conclude that you can literally never add anti-aliasing effects to your GIF backgrounds.

This may be a little disapproving though, but thanks to revolutions in technology, you can live up to the hope that creating semi-transparent GIFs would not be a forever tussle.

How to Make a GIF With Transparent Background?

#### In this article

01 [Is It Possible to Create a Transparent GIF From Video?](#Part 1)

02 [Can Parts of GIF Be Made Semi-Transparent?](#Part 2)

03 [6 Best Free Transparent GIF Maker Software](#Part 3)

## Part 1 Is It Possible to Create a Transparent GIF From Video?

GIFs are a complete infotainment package that keeps you imbibed with requisite information in a rather fun centered way. When it is about editing GIFs, you are free to experiment with limitless creativity. While making GIFs from videos is quite a common edit, something that gains attraction is, turning dull videos into classic, **transparent GIFs**.

Still wondering on this to be a possibility? Rest assured, because it is certainly a ‘Yes’. You can very conveniently create a **transparent GIF** from your videos without a hustle. All you need to do is just a background shuffle. While you can do this with almost any GIF editing software available across the web, here’s how you can take up the process using the Egif video converter tool:

**Step 1: Convert a Video to GIF**

Using Egif, first of all convert a desired video into GIF. Take caution to manually remove backgrounds from all video frames and save the GIF using .gif or .png file extensions. Don’t use .jpg extension; else you will end up losing background transparency.

In case of a solid color GIF background, navigate to Egif’s ‘Effects Tool’ and click on ‘Replace Color with Transparency’.

![Original GIF with White Background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/How-to-make-a-GIF-with-transparent-background-1.JPG)

**Step 2: Color Selection**

Make a desired color selection that you wish to replace with transparent pixels. Select ‘White’ for a black and white GIF background. In case of color backgrounds, open any suitable picture editor (GIMP, MS Paint, etc.) and choose the hex color code using the ‘Color Picker’ tool.

![Background Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/How-to-make-a-GIF-with-transparent-background-2.JPG)

![Processed GIF with Transparent Background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/How-to-make-a-GIF-with-transparent-background-3.JPG)

This tool however, has compatibility limitations and can replace only a restricted number of color backgrounds, which too should not match the color scheme of foreground objects that you wish to restore in your GIF. If you require partially transparent backgrounds within specific portions of complex animated creations, you can use the ‘GIF Maker’ tool to selectively split and edit every clip frame, apply the transparency effect and finally merge all such clips together.

## Part 2 Can Parts of GIF Be Made Semi-Transparent?

No matter how much disappointing it appears, you can never introduce semi-transparent backgrounds in your GIFs. This is due to the fact that the GIF format has a limitation on pixel appearances. This basically means that you can only have completely opaque or completely transparent GIF backgrounds, strictly permitting nothing in between. Hence, it is a regret to conclude that you can literally never add anti-aliasing effects to your GIF backgrounds.

This may be a little disapproving though, but thanks to revolutions in technology, you can live up to the hope that creating semi-transparent GIFs would not be a forever tussle. You never know when the trick strikes IT engineers, and you may possibly be reading an article on interesting ways of creating semi-transparent GIFs in future!

Discord is a free text and audio communication tool for gamers and other communities. The voice channel in the Discord server allows users to speak with many people. On the other hand, Discord does not have a voice recording feature. Users can use third-party solutions to capture their discord audio when speaking via voice chat. When recording someone else's discussion, be sure you have their permission. We'll show you how to record discord audio with the **Craig Discord bot** and record discord audio using Craig in this article. Craig can record discord calls also. Let's get started!

05 [Craig Bot Discord Q&A](#Part 5)

## Part 1 What is Craig Bot Discord?

Craig is a "Discord voice channel recording bot" with multi-track/multi-channel recording capabilities. In short, that means each speaker gets their audio file when Craig records your Discord voice channel.

Craig Recorder keeps track of all your recordings. You may use Craig Bot to record your calls in high-quality audio and video as a server owner.

Craig will record continuously for up to six hours. You can download a copy of the audio to examine the status of a recording until you download the file. The Craig website has a complete set of **Craig bot commands**, which you may immediately access by typing: Craig, help in a Discord channel.

## Part 2 Is Craig Discord Bot Safe?

All Craig web services, like most websites, log all users' IP addresses to identify and prevent criminal activity. Craig does not keep track of anyone who does not speak in a recorded channel, use any **Craig bot commands**, or participate in an EnnuiCastr recording.

## Part 3 How Do I Enable Craig in Discord?

All Craig web services, like most websites, log all users' IP addresses to identify and prevent criminal activity. Anyone who does not talk in a recorded channel, use any **Discord Craig** commands, or engage in a recording using the Craig web app is anonymous to Craig.

## Part 4 How to Record Discord Audio Using Craig

Craig will not record without a visible label indicating that it is getting recorded. It records your conversation with others, but it also records each user as a unique audio track, making it much easier to edit or remove specific speakers if necessary.

Follow these simple steps to use a **Discord recording bot.**

**Step 1: Invite Craig**

You must first invite Craig to your server to use him. Visit Craig's website and click the "Invite Craig to Your Discord Server" option to get started.

Now, begin the joining procedure by pressing Invite Craig to your Discord Server. This action will take you to the authorization page for the Discord server. However, before using your server, you must first grant Craig permission to join it.

## How To Fade Audio In Kinemaster

If you have been looking for video and audio editing tools then you have probably heard of Kinemaster. It is a great video editing app that allows users to edit all aspects of the video including any audio or music that may accompany the video. It has a lot of very useful features and the user interface is fairly easy to use.

One of the things that you can do with Kinemaster is to fade out audio, a useful feature that can help the ending of any video appear more authentic. In this article, we will be looking at how you can use Kinemaster to fade audio.

## Kinemaster Fade Audio Steps

The following steps show you how you can easily fade audio in Kinemaster;

Step1If you don't have Kinemaster already, start by downloading and installing the video editor on your computer.

Step2Open Kinemaster on your computer and then click on the “New Project” icon to start. Select the aspect ratio that you would like to use. If you are not sure, we recommend choosing the “16:9” aspect ratio.

![add new project kinemaster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/add-new-project-kinemaster.jpg)

Step3In the next window, click on “Media” to select the clip you would like to add to the Kinemaster project that you have just created.

![click media kinemaster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/click-media-kinemaster.jpg)

Step4To fade in and fade out the audio in the project, click on the gear icon from the options to the left of the screen.

![click gear icon kinemaster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/click-gear-icon-kinemaster.jpg)

Step5Select the “Audio” tab on the next screen and then turn on the switch next to “Audio Fade-in (Start of Project)” and “Audio Fade-out (End of Project).” This will add a fade-in and fade-out effect at the beginning of the audio and at the end of it.

![audio fade effect kinemaster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/audio-fade-effect-kinemaster.jpg)

Step6You can then easily set the duration of the “Audio fade-in” and “Audio fade-out” by dragging the slider below each option. We recommend setting the duration to just a few seconds.

![customize audio fade kinemaster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/customize-audio-fade-kinemaster.jpg)

Don't forget to save the project when you're done.

## Kinemaster Alternative to Edit Audio

Kinemaster is a good way to edit both audio and video on your computer, but the following options are just as good;

### 1\. VideoShop

VideoShop is a simple to use and highly effective program that you can use to create and edit videos on your computer. The interface makes it easy to import any video project that you have into the program and the wealth of very useful features can help you edit the video in various ways.

For example, you can change the speed of the video, add transitions at various points in the video, add and remove text, add and remove music and so much more. Although there is a free trial version, you will only be able to access some of the more useful features when you purchase the premium version.

The Pro version of VideoShop goes for $3.99 a month, but you can get lifetime access to the program for only $39.99\. One thing that VideoShop has over Kinemaster is that it is very easy to use, even beginner users find video editing a breeze with this tool.

![videoshop app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/videoshop-app.jpg)

### 2\. Filmora

If you are looking for a simple way to edit videos on Android or iOS devices, Filmora is one of the best options in the market. This mobile version of the very popular [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) video editor is just as easy to use as its parent program. You can use it to create video projects from scratch or upload a video and make changes to it.

It offers you a lot of choices when it comes to editing features including trimming sections of the video, adding filters, adding music, adding or removing text, and even changing the canvas or the background of the video. Advanced options such as changing the speed of the video are also available.

One of the things that we love about Filmora is that you don't even have to create an account to use it or remove the watermark added to the completed video project, watching a video ad can be enough. But this option is only available once every 24 hours, meaning that you can only remove a watermark on the free version once a day. Filmora is available for both iOS and Android and the yearly premium plan will cost you just $19.90.

![filmorago app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/filmorago-app.jpg)

### 3\. Quik

Quik is a video editing program created by GoPro for the purpose of editing GoPro videos, but that doesn't mean that you will not be able to use it to edit other types of videos. You can use Quik to create a new project or edit an existing video and gives users a lot of different options when it comes to video editing.

One of the main benefits of using Quik is that you can easily add music, audio, and special effects to a video as well as change the length of the video, fade audio in and out and even change when the music starts. It is also one of the best ways to use images to create collages and slideshows very easily. There are a lot of slideshow and collage templates to choose from, and you can edit them easily by adding your music and images. Quik is completely free to use and you can upload your creation to the cloud ad share the link with others.
