## Top 5 Best Video Denoisers

We all know that our recorded videos are not always perfect – when we use a mobile phone or digital cameras to shoot, our clips may contain hiss, compression and particles. These are the impurities that make our videos look uncomfortable, but it’s not a final result impossible to altar – help can come in the form of several video denoise software.

Editing is the guarantor that makes sure we can do different operations and achieve our desired results – computer programs, tools, opportunities that give us a hand in this process are kind of endless.

So, sometimes it’s really difficult to choose among so many options that come into waves. And if we choose our preferred ways, some people might not agree with us. Even so that it is quite subjective, we can still explain which tools and software we like to modify our videos, and fight with the impurities they have.

It looks amateur if the video is grainy, even if it is night shooting. We can get rid of the noise when we add lights or shoot in well-lit places, but there are some situations we can just depend on the ISO. So, for these grainy videos, there is a thing called denoising – when you get rid of the grains and make your shots as clear as possible. There are different ways to do this, and that happens in different software as well. What are the 5 best video denoisers in 2024 for us to work with? That, as we have already mentioned, might be something very subjective, but here is our selection: Wondershare Filmora, Neat Video, Shotcut, Adobe Premiere Pro, and DaVinci Resolve

**Wondershare Filmora X**

Wondershare Filmora X offers to change our damaged scene into something more acceptable. How to operate it? - You need to go to the Effects panel and type: “Smart Denoise”. right-click on the video and choose Edit Properties.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-1.jpg)

This ensures you see the Smart Denoise, where you can change opacity of the clip, threshold and radius.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-2.jpg)

Reduce Opacity until you are satisfied with the result. The box next to Smart Denoise will show you the scene before and after the effect.

**Bonus tip: Wondershare Filmora audio denoise**

We already explained how video denoising works, and we will go on with our selection and explanatory article about the process, but, as we are on the Filmora topic, we might as well mention that denoising might mean another thing too – which, in this case, regards audio background noise. It means to remove unwanted hum from the audio in order for it to become more hearable. So, doing this in Wondershare Filmora works in a quite easy way. Use the guideline:

Drag and drop your video into the timeline. Right-click on the clip and hit Detach Audio, which will let you separate audio and video from one another and make sure you can work on them one by one.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-3.jpg)

Double-click on the audio track and have access to the editing panel, where you can see Remove background noise – it is not needed to emphasize what this option does for you!

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-4.jpg)

That’s it – you are done, but keep in mind that there is a second way to achieve the same result as well, but this in case you don’t want to detach the audio: Double-click on the video clip in the timeline, the editing panel opens, so switch to Audio. Checking the box next to Remove background noise will show that there are three levels – weak, mid, and strong, and of course, you can choose to your liking!

If the voice recording doesn’t sound natural anymore, you can do the following: Click on Customize and Customize Equalizer window will open.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-5.jpg)

On the left, you can see the low tunes, while the highs are on the right. Background noises are often on the left, so you can lower them to get rid of them, but in order to have a more natural sound, raise the middle ones a little – and you are done when you are content with the sound!

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-6.jpg)

So, hmm… back to the original topic – denoising a video, shall we?..

**Neat video**

Neat Video kind of, speaks for itself… it is a powerful video editing tool suitable for Windows, macOS and Linux. It aims to reduce the digital noise, flicker, dust, scratches and other defects in the captured videos to improve the visual quality of the videos.

It is a plug-in for Premiere Pro, that does more or less what the product noise says: it makes grainy video look neater. It’s very easy to use and

How to do that in Neat Video? Here are the steps:

Find the clip you want to reduce the noise of and search for the neat video effect in the Effects Panel.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-7.jpg)

The video editors mostly use the SR version of it, because it seems faster and has kind of a better performance.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-8.jpg)

Then, you’ll have to drag the neat video plug-in to the clip to your choosing, take your attention to the Effect Controls panel on the left, and find: fx Reduce Noise v5 (SR) – press the button saying Prepare and this will open up the Build button as well, which wil open the Neat video effect window.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-9.jpg)

There, you’ll need to click on the Auto Profile. Selection window will appear, which you can move around the scene and resize, in order to select the noisy area of your footage. It is recommended to find the darkest or grainiest area there and select judging by this.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-10.jpg)

On the left side, you will find Filter Settings: under Spatial, you can play with the Noise Reduction Amount and Noise Level.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-11.jpg)

Then, you will hit Apply and – done, you can instantly see the results!

**Shotcut**

What about Shotcut? It is a free, open-source and cross-platform video denoiser for Windows operating system. It is also an outstanding video editor with trimming, splitting, color correction and other tools.

In order to reduce the noise there, do the following: first off, find filters, open that window and type in: Noise. This will open the options, and several of them are for noise reduction.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-12.jpg)

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-13.jpg)

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-14.jpg)

Choose Reduce Noise: Wavelet, add it to the Video and then feel free to modify the settings, such as: Decompose, Threshold, Percent. You can check and uncheck the effect in order to see the before-after difference. Then, click Apply button and it is ready to go!

Anyway, you can also try other similar effects such as Reduce Noise: HQDN3D and Reduce Noise: Smart Blur.

**Adobe Premiere Pro**

Even though we discussed video denoising in Adobe Premier Pro but with the help of a plug-in called Neat Video, reducing the noise in the video in this software can be achieved without the plug-in as well, through using effect which is called Median. And, Premiere Pro kind of deserves to be mentioned, so, let’s go for it!

Add the desired footage into the Timeline of Premiere Pro. Then, find the Effects Panel, where our wanted Median can be found –drag and drop the effect to the clip.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-15.jpg)

The Median should modify the grainiest parts of the whole clip, so in order to do this, we need to use masks. In the Effects Control panel, select the mask shape for the clip – the options are: rectangle, circle, or pen tool. With Pen tool, you move the Mask around the screen and resize it – the covered area will be affected.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-16.jpg)

If you change Feather setting to 100, the effect will lose a sharp edge and instead, there will be a smooth border.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-17.jpg)

So, you might think it is needed to repeat these steps several time to create masks in different areas, in order to cover all of the grainy space of the scene.

And, at last, to reduce the noise, adjust the effect settings.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-18.jpg)

Actually, Median just blurs the grainy parts, without directly taking them away. Lastly, you can get to know the Radios settings, which will help you to achieve your most desired look!

**Davinci Resolve**

DaVinci Resolve is also worth mentioning in this list, in a way because it is also different from other video editors. Let’s see how it works and, meanwhile, differs:

Add the footage into the timeline. Find the fusion tab underneath the timeline panel.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-19.jpg)

There, MediaIn1 and MediaOut1 will appear, and first, click on MediaIn1, - the scene will be shown in the first viewer – and MediaOut1 by default is appearing in the second. So, stay on MediaIn1, hit shift+spacebar, and find Remove Noise (RN). Click Add, which adds the Remove Noise1 node. On the top right corner there is an Inspector, which opens all the properties you can modify.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-20.jpg)

After going only into the second viewer, and in the top bar there is channel icons. Open it and click on red, but don’t get alarmed when your footage turns black and white – it’s just for a while. Go back to the Inspector, increase Softness Red and Detail Red.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-21.jpg)

This step helps remove grain from the red channel. Then repeat the same for green and blue channels. After finishing go to the same channel button and set it to “back to color”. The clip will be colorized again and now be clearer, compared to the first viewer.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-22.jpg)

So, Evrika – we hot to know 5 best video denoisers in 2024, with the addition of audio background noise removal in Wondershare Filmora – hope you enjoyed it, and hope this will help you create better videos for yourself and your viewers!

This ensures you see the Smart Denoise, where you can change opacity of the clip, threshold and radius.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-2.jpg)

Reduce Opacity until you are satisfied with the result. The box next to Smart Denoise will show you the scene before and after the effect.

There, MediaIn1 and MediaOut1 will appear, and first, click on MediaIn1, - the scene will be shown in the first viewer – and MediaOut1 by default is appearing in the second. So, stay on MediaIn1, hit shift+spacebar, and find Remove Noise (RN). Click Add, which adds the Remove Noise1 node. On the top right corner there is an Inspector, which opens all the properties you can modify.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-20.jpg)

After going only into the second viewer, and in the top bar there is channel icons. Open it and click on red, but don’t get alarmed when your footage turns black and white – it’s just for a while. Go back to the Inspector, increase Softness Red and Detail Red.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-21.jpg)

This step helps remove grain from the red channel. Then repeat the same for green and blue channels. After finishing go to the same channel button and set it to “back to color”. The clip will be colorized again and now be clearer, compared to the first viewer.

So, Evrika – we hot to know 5 best video denoisers in 2024, with the addition of audio background noise removal in Wondershare Filmora – hope you enjoyed it, and hope this will help you create better videos for yourself and your viewers!

This ensures you see the Smart Denoise, where you can change opacity of the clip, threshold and radius.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-2.jpg)

Reduce Opacity until you are satisfied with the result. The box next to Smart Denoise will show you the scene before and after the effect.

**Bonus tip: Wondershare Filmora audio denoise**

We already explained how video denoising works, and we will go on with our selection and explanatory article about the process, but, as we are on the Filmora topic, we might as well mention that denoising might mean another thing too – which, in this case, regards audio background noise. It means to remove unwanted hum from the audio in order for it to become more hearable. So, doing this in Wondershare Filmora works in a quite easy way. Use the guideline:

Drag and drop your video into the timeline. Right-click on the clip and hit Detach Audio, which will let you separate audio and video from one another and make sure you can work on them one by one.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-3.jpg)

Double-click on the audio track and have access to the editing panel, where you can see Remove background noise – it is not needed to emphasize what this option does for you!

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-4.jpg)

That’s it – you are done, but keep in mind that there is a second way to achieve the same result as well, but this in case you don’t want to detach the audio: Double-click on the video clip in the timeline, the editing panel opens, so switch to Audio. Checking the box next to Remove background noise will show that there are three levels – weak, mid, and strong, and of course, you can choose to your liking!

If the voice recording doesn’t sound natural anymore, you can do the following: Click on Customize and Customize Equalizer window will open.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-5.jpg)

On the left, you can see the low tunes, while the highs are on the right. Background noises are often on the left, so you can lower them to get rid of them, but in order to have a more natural sound, raise the middle ones a little – and you are done when you are content with the sound!

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-6.jpg)

So, hmm… back to the original topic – denoising a video, shall we?..

**Neat video**

Neat Video kind of, speaks for itself… it is a powerful video editing tool suitable for Windows, macOS and Linux. It aims to reduce the digital noise, flicker, dust, scratches and other defects in the captured videos to improve the visual quality of the videos.

It is a plug-in for Premiere Pro, that does more or less what the product noise says: it makes grainy video look neater. It’s very easy to use and

How to do that in Neat Video? Here are the steps:

Find the clip you want to reduce the noise of and search for the neat video effect in the Effects Panel.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-7.jpg)

The video editors mostly use the SR version of it, because it seems faster and has kind of a better performance.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-8.jpg)

Then, you’ll have to drag the neat video plug-in to the clip to your choosing, take your attention to the Effect Controls panel on the left, and find: fx Reduce Noise v5 (SR) – press the button saying Prepare and this will open up the Build button as well, which wil open the Neat video effect window.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-9.jpg)

There, you’ll need to click on the Auto Profile. Selection window will appear, which you can move around the scene and resize, in order to select the noisy area of your footage. It is recommended to find the darkest or grainiest area there and select judging by this.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-10.jpg)

On the left side, you will find Filter Settings: under Spatial, you can play with the Noise Reduction Amount and Noise Level.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-11.jpg)

Then, you will hit Apply and – done, you can instantly see the results!

**Shotcut**

What about Shotcut? It is a free, open-source and cross-platform video denoiser for Windows operating system. It is also an outstanding video editor with trimming, splitting, color correction and other tools.

In order to reduce the noise there, do the following: first off, find filters, open that window and type in: Noise. This will open the options, and several of them are for noise reduction.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-12.jpg)

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-13.jpg)

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-14.jpg)

Choose Reduce Noise: Wavelet, add it to the Video and then feel free to modify the settings, such as: Decompose, Threshold, Percent. You can check and uncheck the effect in order to see the before-after difference. Then, click Apply button and it is ready to go!

Anyway, you can also try other similar effects such as Reduce Noise: HQDN3D and Reduce Noise: Smart Blur.

**Adobe Premiere Pro**

Even though we discussed video denoising in Adobe Premier Pro but with the help of a plug-in called Neat Video, reducing the noise in the video in this software can be achieved without the plug-in as well, through using effect which is called Median. And, Premiere Pro kind of deserves to be mentioned, so, let’s go for it!

Add the desired footage into the Timeline of Premiere Pro. Then, find the Effects Panel, where our wanted Median can be found –drag and drop the effect to the clip.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-15.jpg)

The Median should modify the grainiest parts of the whole clip, so in order to do this, we need to use masks. In the Effects Control panel, select the mask shape for the clip – the options are: rectangle, circle, or pen tool. With Pen tool, you move the Mask around the screen and resize it – the covered area will be affected.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-16.jpg)

If you change Feather setting to 100, the effect will lose a sharp edge and instead, there will be a smooth border.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-17.jpg)

So, you might think it is needed to repeat these steps several time to create masks in different areas, in order to cover all of the grainy space of the scene.

And, at last, to reduce the noise, adjust the effect settings.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-18.jpg)

Actually, Median just blurs the grainy parts, without directly taking them away. Lastly, you can get to know the Radios settings, which will help you to achieve your most desired look!

**Davinci Resolve**

DaVinci Resolve is also worth mentioning in this list, in a way because it is also different from other video editors. Let’s see how it works and, meanwhile, differs:

Add the footage into the timeline. Find the fusion tab underneath the timeline panel.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-19.jpg)

There, MediaIn1 and MediaOut1 will appear, and first, click on MediaIn1, - the scene will be shown in the first viewer – and MediaOut1 by default is appearing in the second. So, stay on MediaIn1, hit shift+spacebar, and find Remove Noise (RN). Click Add, which adds the Remove Noise1 node. On the top right corner there is an Inspector, which opens all the properties you can modify.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-20.jpg)

After going only into the second viewer, and in the top bar there is channel icons. Open it and click on red, but don’t get alarmed when your footage turns black and white – it’s just for a while. Go back to the Inspector, increase Softness Red and Detail Red.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-21.jpg)

This step helps remove grain from the red channel. Then repeat the same for green and blue channels. After finishing go to the same channel button and set it to “back to color”. The clip will be colorized again and now be clearer, compared to the first viewer.

![video-denoiser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-denoiser-22.jpg)

So, Evrika – we hot to know 5 best video denoisers in 2024, with the addition of audio background noise removal in Wondershare Filmora – hope you enjoyed it, and hope this will help you create better videos for yourself and your viewers!

## Dollar-Store DIY Hacks to Use for Filmmaking on a Budget

Filmmaking is usually an expensive hobby, but slowly over time, it's become more affordable. Regular gear like cameras and lights are slightly cheaper, but there are plenty of ways to DIY regular items to use as film gear.

Making DIY film gear may not give you the same look as professional gear, but it could be a fun project and give you similar looks on a budget. In this article, let's look at some dollar-store DIY hacks that you can use for filmmaking on a budget.

![diy film gear](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/dollar-store-film-making-hacks-1.png)

## Tip 1\. Add foreground elements to improve the frame of videos

Let's start with something we can do to enhance your framing. Sometimes we want to direct our audience's attention to a specific part of the frame. In this case, it's the talent of placing an object in the shot's foreground that can help us do that. While also making a more attractive frame. At the dollar store, try using something like these fake plants.

![fake plants](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/dollar-store-film-making-hacks-2.png)

You can place it in front of your lens. Then focus on the talent behind it, giving a blurry foreground that perfectly frames the talent. Here's how the shot looks with and without foreground elements.

![framing the subject](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/dollar-store-film-making-hacks-3.png)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Remember, you can also use a **different angle** than simply approaching the object from the front. You can try and use different perspectives until you find the shot or footage you are looking for.

## Tip 2\. Adjust lights with poster boards

The shot below looks dark and boring because the background has no light. Here's the shot with and without the lights.

![shot with or without lights](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/dollar-store-film-making-hacks-4.png)

A practical light is a light that shows up on screen rather than lighting talent from off-screen. For example, some dollar stores have small LED accent lights for around three dollars.

Others even have lights with adhesive backings that allow you to place them all over the room—creating great lighting accents with small eye-catching pockets of light.

![lights with adhesive backings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/dollar-store-film-making-hacks-5.png)

On film sets, crews use a bounce to reflect light from one light source in another direction. At the dollar store, we can find something like this poster board to get a similar effect.

![use bounce to reflect light](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/dollar-store-film-making-hacks-6.png)

By reflecting the light onto the bounce, we get softer, more spread-out light when it's reflected. Then you will get the result in a nicer look. Using poster boards, you can do multiple things with light.

* Use white to bounce light.
* Use black as a flag to shape or block light.

![use white to bounce light](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/dollar-store-film-making-hacks-7.png)

* You can also use green for a small green screen when filming a product video

You might have seen how big production companies create those alienated landscapes, such as in the movie Avatar and many more.

The concept is recording your object in front of a green screen behind it. Then, it's much easier to add a separately filmed background to the final footage with a video editor like Filmora.

![green screen to create the fake background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/dollar-store-film-making-hacks-8.gif)

## Tip 3\. Smooth audio with felt pads or socks

Do you ever have audio pop while you are recording? It can get annoying. So, to fix the issues, we are now teaching you three practical ways.

### 1\. Felt pads

Felt pads with adhesive backs can be stuck onto noisy props like a coffee mug. This way, we won't hear the mug hitting the table when we're recording sound.

![felt pads](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/dollar-store-film-making-hacks-9.png)

### 2\. Socks as pop filters

Professionals use what they call a pop filter because a pop filter can reduce the loud pops from their mouths. But what is pop? Pops usually occur when people say words that start with the letter P or B.

Then what is a pop filter? You might have seen in some YouTube videos, especially live streamers, where they use a microphone with a plate on its head; that's called a pop filter. You can purchase pricey gear like a pop filter, or we can get a pack of cheap socks at the dollar store and place them over the mic.

It will make your voiceover slightly quieter, but it should also get rid of the popping. So keep adding socks until you hear no more pops in your voiceover.

## Keyframes Interval: Everything You Need To Know | Filmora

Many people may not understand what the **Keyframe Interval** stands for. However, it is a simple concept for video editors where the encoding settings determine the frequency at which the whole picture is transmitted.

The **Keyframe Interval** is responsible for how often a keyframe is generated within the video. A keyframe, also known as an i-frame, is a single frame that contains all of the necessary information for displaying a video. If the Keyframe Interval is set too high, it could lead to visible compression without compromising the quality of a video.

**Keyframe Interval** is essential in video streaming and recording, but it can be confusing. In this guide, we'll help you understand this concept to enable you to create better animations.

## Part 1\. What Is Keyframe Interval

Keyframe Intervals, also known as "Keyframe Frequency" in Adobe Flash Media Live Encoder (FMLE) and vMix or "GOP size" by some encoders, is the frequency at which keyframes are generated in an animated sequence. This is an important parameter to consider when creating animations, as it can impact the animation's file size, quality, and smoothness.

Keyframe Intervals are the distance in time between two keyframes. For example, if an animation is set to every 2 seconds interval and the frame rate is 30 per second, it means that every 60 frames, a keyframe is created.

![keyframe interval in a video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/keyframe-interval-in-a-video.png)

## Part 2\. How Does Keyframe Interval Work?

Keyframes are important in video and animation because they mark specific points in time that can be used to create a smooth and consistent transition between different states or images. The Keyframe Interval is the amount of time that passes between two keyframes.

In order to create a smooth and consistent transition, the Keyframe Interval must be carefully calculated. In a 60-frame-per-second video, a keyframe is recorded every 5 or 300 frames. Delta frames are "difference" frames that provide an incremental change from the previous frame.

Keyframes are different from delta frames in that a higher keyframe value results in a clearer video with fewer transmission artifacts and vice versa.

The Keyframe Interval can be adjusted to create a faster or slower transition between two keyframes. A shorter Keyframe Interval will create a faster transition, while a longer one will create a slower transition.

For example, if you want your transition to look smoother, use a longer interval, like two seconds. Conversely, a zoom effect over a 0.2-second interval will be quicker.

## Part 3\. A concept closely connected to Keyframe Interval - Bitrates

The relationship between keyframes and bitrates is important to understand when creating video content. Keyframes are the frames in a video that are used to define the start and end points of an encoding process. The bitrate measures how much information is being transferred in a given time from one place to another.

When encoding video, keyframes are used to establish a consistent quality throughout the video. The bitrate is then used to determine how much information can be transferred without affecting the quality of the video. Thus, the higher the video's bitrate, the better the quality.

Your mileage may vary regarding this explanation, as different encoders manage bitrates and keyframes in different ways.

For example, if you're using an encoder like Wirecast, you might notice that broadcasting in a still background with someone talking results in a higher quality video as compared to a moving background. This can be reproduced using the same average bitrate and Keyframe Interval between them.

This happens because the delta frames have to share a lot more information to share in each frame in the video with a moving background. When you have an encoder like Wirecast, it's working to keep your stream at an average bitrate. This can result in reduced quality if there is a lot of extra information in the [delta frames.](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/delta-frame#:~:text=In%20interframe%20video%20coding%2C%20a,%2Dframes%20or%20B%2Dframes.)

## Part 4\. What You Need To Know To Set A Right Keyframe Interval

After understanding the important concepts in video editing, let’s see how to set the keyframe level in our videos appropriately.

Most streaming services will automatically set it for you based on your stream's frame rate and bitrate. However, if you want to set the keyframe gap manually, there are a few things you need to keep in mind.

* Set the frame interval at 2 seconds. Do not increase it from 4 seconds.
* Disable the "auto" keyframe feature.
* To allow for b-frames, use an encoding profile higher than baseline and use IDR-based keyframes.

## Part 5\. How To Change The Keyframe Interval On OBS Studio

Above is the basic knowledge of the keyframe interval. Then, how to apply it to your real video-editing work? In this part, we will choose OBS to show you the application process.

OBS Studio is a powerful yet free and open-source screen recorder and live streaming tool for Windows, macOS, and Linux. One of the most useful features of OBS Studio is its ability to change the keyframe interval on the fly without having to restart your recording or stream.

The process for changing the it in OBS Studio has been made more efficient since the classic version. However, some users may have trouble locating the new setting.

Here's how to change the it on OBS Studio:

Step1 Launch the **OBS Studio** on your PC or laptop.

![launching the obs studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/launching-the-obs-studio.png)

Step2 From the bottom right of the screen, open the **"Settings"** menu.

![obs studio settings menu](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/obs-studio-settings-menu.png)

Step3 On the Settings Window, click **"Output"** and configure the output mode to **"Advanced."**

![setting the output mode to advance in obs studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/setting-the-output-mode-to-advance-in-obs-studio.png)

Step4 Finally, edit the **Keyframe Interval,** set it to **2** seconds, and click **"OK"** to save your changes.

![changing the keyframe interval value on obs studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/changing-the-keyframe-interval-value-on-obs-studio.png)

## Part 6\. Will Keyframe Interval Affect Your Video’s Quality?

When you try to set the keyframe gap by yourself, you may feel confused about the difference a higher or lower interval make to your video. Then, wil-l or how it affects your video’s performance?

In a stream, it determines the balance between smoothness and picture quality. A keyframe is a point that determines how often the entire frame is sent, as opposed to just the differences from the previous frame.

Therefore, if you set the Keyframe Interval higher, your video will be more stable with fewer artifacts but requires more bandwidth and processing power. Conversely, a lower Keyframe Interval value causes more artifacts but is less resource intensive.

A lower Keyframe Interval value will result in lower video quality, while a higher keyframe value will result in higher video quality. However, the optimal Keyframe Interval value can vary depending on the specific case.

For instance, you don't need a higher Keyframe Interval for streaming a live video, but you have to use a higher Key Interval value for recording.
