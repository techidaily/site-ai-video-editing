## Part 2 How To Use Keynote Slides

Apple’s keynote is a great option for Mac users to make beautiful slides for their presentations. Making a presentation focuses on idea or information you want to deliver to your audience. Designing a keynote slide includes, keynote slides sizes and dimensions which are very important.

Here are some important things to consider to make the best use of keynote slides.

### 01Keynote Slide Size Matters

Before designing your slides think about the screen size you’ll be presenting your presentation. Every screen has an aspect ratio. The aim is to create a keynote presentation that matches the aspect ratio of the screen on which you are going to present.

Screens on which your presentation will appear are:

**●** iPad and tablets

**●** Conference room projectors

**●** Laptop

**●** Widescreen, large format display

Setting the size of the keynote slide will ensure that your slides will match to the screen on which you are going to present. Keynote slides can be changed in different ways which includes changing the designs, dimensions and ruler options etc.

### 02Change Keynote Layout Dimensions and Size

Start off in keynote by clicking on the document option given at the top right corner. A new panel will open and all the changes will be done in that panel.When you will click on the document panel, there will be two tabs on the panels, make sure you are working on the labeled document panel.

![Adjust the slide size](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/Tactics-To-Make-Keynote-Slideshow-1.JPG)

On the slide size at the down side, you can set the size of the slide. By default you have two options 4:3 and 16:9 slide sizes. When you will create a new document, its size will be 4:3 by default, so before making a keynote slide make sure you check the size.

![Formatting 16:9 slide to 4:3 format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/Tactics-To-Make-Keynote-Slideshow-2.JPG)

Choose another theme for your presentation from this windows and click on choose button to re-theme your presentation. When you will choose your desired theme, all your content will be adapted to the newly selected theme.

### 04Entitle Rulers

Rulers are the important as they help in aligning element in your slide. A ruler ensures you that you are making each slide corresponding to the screen dimensions. Rulers can help you attain pixel – perfect design.

Here are a few simple methods for combining two or more videos into one and posting them on Instagram (IG).

Using the Instagram official app

There is no simple way to combine many videos into one on Instagram. You can, however, utilize the Story technique.

1) Create an Instagram Story with two or more videos. You can add stickers, text, and other elements if you like.

2) Tap the three dots icon on your Instagram Tale > Save > Save story. Your current Instagram Stories films and photos will be saved to the Photos app as a single video file.

3) Upload the resulting Video to Instagram!

**Tools To Use to Combine videos for Instagram.**

1. Wondershare Filmora is an easy-to-use video merger.

Before I detail online video joiners, I'd like to mention Wondershare Filmora, which can automatically merge video files without or with transitions. It merges video files with the same or various file extensions in 1:1 quality (.mp4, .mov, .mkv, .avi, etc). Continue reading to learn more about this simple video merging and how to merge videos.

Part 2: Using Filmora to combine, merge, and join clips

To join videos, first, import them.

![combine-video-instagram-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/combine-video-instagram-2.jpg)

You can drag the files from Windows File Explorer to the User's Album or click the "Import" button on the window and choose files from your computer. All imported files will appear in thumbnail format in the User's Album. To preview a file in the right-hand preview window, double-click it.

1. To merge video files, drag & drop them.

![combine-video-instagram-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/combine-video-instagram-3.jpg)

Move videos from the User's Album to the video track on the Timeline after that. All video files will be combined into a single video with no transition. However, you can use the following method to add transitions between video clips.

1. Add transitions in the third step (optional)

![combine-video-instagram-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/combine-video-instagram-4.jpg)

Add transitions between clips for a smooth transition from one to the next to make the linked videos look like a complete movie. Go to the Transition tab and drag the desired change to the intersection of two clips. You can also right-click any transition to bring up a menu with choices such as "Apply to All" and "Random to All" for your convenience.

Step 4: Combine video files into a single file.

![combine-video-instagram-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/combine-video-instagram-5.jpg)

Now that you've seen the merged Movie click the "Export" option to save the several video segments to a single file. Select any format from the list under the Format tab. All of the most common video formats are supported. Choose "Device" and choose the thumbnail of your device to play the combined video file on iPod, iPhone, or iPad. You may also publish the combined Video on YouTube or burn it to DVDs to watch on television.
