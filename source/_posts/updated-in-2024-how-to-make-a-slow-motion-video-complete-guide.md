The three projectors are set to give the street footage at the back scene to add more realism.

### Prime lenses

The foremost and most helpful lenses in filming are called prime lenses, which have fixed focal lengths. There is no Johns to zoom out and zoom-in in prime lenses.

For filming, we need to choose the right level of zoom, which the DP does by picking the right lens for the footage.

![prime lens of the camera](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/prime-lens-of-the-camera.jpg)

In the close-up scenes, there is a requirement for a wider field of view which also depends on the aspect ratio of shooting.

## Aspect Ratio

In filmy view, the most appropriate aspect ratio is 2.35, which is also a cinematic ratio. There is also another ratio of 16:9, which is a wider ratio. While 2.35 gives a more narrow perspective as compared to the prior one.

![note](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** The narrow ratio is helpful in showing the relationships between the subjects.

## Back up and Organize Your Files to Protect Any Misfortune Befalling Them. The Article Will Guide You on How to Back up and Manage Your Footage

Backing up your data is deemed significantly necessary among video editing communities. Files get corrupted easily. Having a backup drive can save your day and countless hours. You can back up your data any way you deem fit. However, it will do you right if you follow the advice of professionals.

The article is written explicitly after due consideration and suggestions from the professional video editor. You can follow the steps in it to make backup files. Let us start with very straightforward steps to help you understand the professional way of backing up and organizing your footage.

## Part 1\. Back Up Your Files

Backing up your files gives you peace of mind. If one file is lost, the whole project becomes vulnerable to failure. Therefore, every effort must be made to ensure the protection of files. The best way to protect the files from any misfortune is to back them up.

Remember, there is no specific way to back up your files. Depending on the project's requirements, you can do that differently. The following steps will light up how you can back up your files.

##### Step1Back up your files in two different places

It is crucial to do that. If one backup drive corrupts, you have the second option. It gives you an opportunity to back up files.

* You can make two different external backup hard drives.

![back up your data on two different external drives](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/back-up-your-data-on-two-different-external-drive.jpg)

* You can also use your internal and external devices as two backup options.

##### Step2Make specific folders for each purpose of the video

The next step is how you back up your files properly and safely. Make separate folders for the different formats you are importing in your drive. Always use the primary source to make a copy of your files.

Follow the steps below to understand how to back up your files in two drives.
