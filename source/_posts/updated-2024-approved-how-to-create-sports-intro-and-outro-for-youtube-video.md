## Part 2: Setting Up The Green Screen

Filming with the green screen is getting easier and easier. Anyone can do it, but before you get started, we will share some do's and don'ts to help you get the best results.

In fact, there are many ways to set up a green screen, but the most cost-efficient way is with a green screen fabric. If you are using a green fabric as a DIY green screen, make sure you steam or iron it out, whether taping it to a wall or hanging it off the rack. Keep in mind the green screen should not leave any wrinkles.

It is because wrinkles will make lighting the green screen a nightmare, and uneven lighting will leave you with shadows and disappointing results. It would help if you also pulled the green screen tight to get a seamless background. The better you do with the setup, the easier it will be the key it out later

## Part 3: Lighting a Green Screen

It doesn't matter how nice your green screen is. You won't get good results if you don't light it properly. When you light a green screen, be aware of these things.

* Make sure there are at least six feet of space between you and your green screen; therefore, you're not casting a shadow that cannot be keyed out later.
* Remember, any shadow on the green screen is bad. The lighting on the screen should be flat, even, and one-dimensional meaning. Please don't place the screen leaning at an angle since they'll make it harder to light evenly.
* Do light yourself and your background separately. It will ensure your subject wouldn't bleed into the green, which will create a halo around them.
* After you key out the green screen and lighting, your subjects should emulate the lighting from your final footage. For example, if you know sunlight is coming from the left light, your subject is from the left direction as well.

## Part 4\. Keying out your green screen

Once your footage is good, go into [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and import it into your timeline, then double-click it to find the chroma key menu. However, don't stop there. Clicking the chroma key button is not enough to guarantee perfectly keyed footage, so play around with the offset tolerance edge thickness and edge feather. Lastly, adjust it to make sure your edit looks as good as possible.
