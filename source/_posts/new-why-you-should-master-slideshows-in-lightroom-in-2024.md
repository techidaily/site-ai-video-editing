### Method 1: Use the In-Built Function to Adjust the Draft Video’s Length Directly

## Part 2\. Using The Third-party Tool to Adjust the Length Before Uploading to TikTok

The above-given steps are helpful in adjusting the clip length on TikTok, but what if TikTok does not support your created video? Yes, there are chances that the video you have created for TikTok cannot be uploaded straight away, mostly because the video length is too large.

## Part 3\. The Common Reasons If You Can’t Adjust the Length of TikTok Video

Hope the above part will prove helpful to you in terms of adjusting the TikTok video using Wondershare Filmora. Now, let's see what the common reasons which hinder users from adjusting the length of TikTok Videos are:

### 1\. The Video is Too Short

Most TikTok users worry about **why they can't adjust TikTok clip length.** The common reason behind this query is the short length of the video. If your video length is 3 seconds, then it would not be possible to shorten it further on TikTok. Thus, try to make a Video of at least 15 seconds to upload it on TikTok successfully.

### 2\. The Video is Too Long

If you have recorded a too-long video, it would not be possible to adjust its length on TikTok. Too long videos, especially more than 10 minutes, are less likely to be modified by TikTok. For that, you can take the help of Filmora to adjust its size. Filmora will trim the video to a suitable length within seconds.

### 3\. Using Green Screen or Other Incompatible Effects

Sometimes people use those effects in videos that are difficult to edit. For example, using a green screen creates some technical issues in your video, which gets weirder when you try to adjust the length of such a video. Due to this, proper adjustments in such videos are difficult to do on TikTok.

### 4\. App Glitch

As many people are engaged in using TikTok, so sometimes the app slows down. It becomes pretty difficult to adjust the length of TikTok videos when the app shows glitches. However, on Filmora, the case is totally the opposite. You will never face any difficulty, no matter how many users are using it.
