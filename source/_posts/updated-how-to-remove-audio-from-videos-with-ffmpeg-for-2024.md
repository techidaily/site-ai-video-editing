## How to Remove Audio From Videos with FFmpeg?

Unbelievably, the globe has been making headway in its endeavors. Considering how far the world has come in producing amazing things in recent times, it is impossible to fathom the progress made in the digital industry. There are now millions of video editing programs like **FFmpeg that remove audio**, each allowing you to accomplish anything. In addition to video editing, it is now possible to modify the music playing in the backdrop of a video. Doesn't it seem impossible to you? However, it has an actual appearance and is simple to pull audio from a video. You will, however, need to choose a tool with great care and consideration.

In the following parts, we will discuss how to **remove audio from video with FFmpeg** successfully. In addition, we have also looked at other software that has the potential to be an alternative to FFmpeg that is far more effective.

![remove audio from video ffmpeg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/remove-audio-from-video-ffmpeg-1.jpg)

## Part 1: How to Use FFmpeg to Remove Audio from Videos?

FFMPEG is a highly flexible video editing program from the command line. You may use it for various purposes, including converting between different file formats. But in addition to that, you may use it to **remove audio from your videos** or clips. Here are two different ways to delete audio using FFMPEG, depending on what you want to do. But most crucially, speed and quality are not sacrificed with any of these choices. It's about coding. When using other people's code, also label the author. Using FFmpeg, you can separate the audio. The audio in video files may be removed, added, extracted, and added again with the help of this powerful utility.

You will only need to [**install FFmpeg**](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) on your computer after you have purchased it. Removing video is straightforward, so you won't have to put in much effort to achieve this goal. Let's look at the many methods available.

**Use the Command Line**

Step1 The command to extract audio from your video file is visible for your review.

![ffmpeg use the command](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/remove-audio-from-video-ffmpeg-2.jpg)

Step2 It would be helpful if you updated the extension and the name of the file that was entered, but other than that, you won't need to do anything else.

![ffmpeg audio command](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/remove-audio-from-video-ffmpeg-3.jpg)

The preceding command is successful if the input file certifies. This is why you need to find the codec for the audio stream. If you obey this order, you will accomplish what you set out to do. A user might sometimes use an audio format returned by the previous command. However, this will only occasionally be successful.

The storage format that FFmpeg employs is determined by looking at the output file's extension. It would help if you knew that a storage format, a container, and an audio format are distinct. You will encounter a scenario where the audio format does not have a container named after it. Two problematic formats are among the most common formats; they are PCM and Vorbis. OGG is compatible with Vorbis, whereas WAV is compatible with PCM.

Let's investigate another approach to extract audio from a video using FFmpeg if the prior one was too difficult for you to grasp.

**Use the Terminal**

Step1 Verify that the format remains the same.

You will need to locate the video in its original format to be able to extract the audio from it. If you are unfamiliar with the primary format, you will be unable to determine the appropriate file extension. Because of this, you are going to need to make use of the ffprobe command.

![ffmpeg check the original format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/remove-audio-from-video-ffmpeg-4.jpg)

Now, change "myvideo.mp4" to the name of the video file you want to use. This will verify that you are familiar with the video's original file format.

After learning about the original audio's format, you can reencode a video clip to remove the audio from it.

![ffmpeg reencoding](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/remove-audio-from-video-ffmpeg-5.jpg)

Step2 Modify the format, please.

You might try replacing myvideo.mp4 with the directory and filename to see if it helps. Additionally, it would be helpful if you updated the name of the audio.ogg file with the name you want to use.

Therefore, if you follow the two approaches discussed above, you can extract audio from your video files with little to no work. To completely comprehend the stages, you must examine them in great detail.

## LUTs Can Make Ordinary-Looking Footage Look More Attractive. Read This Guide to Learn How You Can Easily Create Your Own LUTs Using Filmora

Color grading can feel daunting, especially if you don’t have much experience grading footage. Fortunately, LUTs can help you grade your footage almost effortlessly. Like your favorite Snapchat or Instagram filters, a LUT can instantly transform dull-looking footage into something more vibrant. So, what is a LUT?

LUT is an acronym for “look up table.” A LUT is a preset color that you can apply to footage to transform how it looks. Video editors, colorists, and filmmakers use LUTs to speed up color grading. However, you don’t need to be an experienced professional to use them. With minimal color grading and video editing experience, you can easily apply LUTs to your footage.

LUTs are usually denoted by the .LUT, .CUBE, or. 3DL file extensions. You can create LUTs using several video editing and color grading applications, such as Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, DaVinci Resolve, and Filmora. In this guide, we’ll explore how to create your own LUT and use custom LUTs in Filmora.

#### In this article

01 [Why We Need to Create Our Own LUT](#part1)

02 [How to Create Your Own LUT](#part2)

03 [How to Use Custom LUTs in Filmora](#part3)

## Why We Need to Create Our Own LUT

Many video editing tools usually come with pre-installed LUTs that you can quickly apply to footage. However, you may need to create your own LUT in some cases. Here are some reasons why you may need to create your own LUT:

### 1\. To Create a Particular Feeling

Clients may want their videos to evoke a particular emotion. If the pre-installed LUTs that come with your video editing software can’t evoke the particular feeling the client wants, you may need to create your own LUT. Some key questions to ask yourself when creating the LUT include:

* What is the genre of the video project?
* What kind of atmosphere do you want to create?
* Are there any colors or tones that you should emphasize?
* Once you ask yourself these questions, you’ll be able to create an appropriate LUT for the client.

For instance, if the genre of the video project is a comedy, you may want to create a LUT that highlights orange, yellow, and its tones to create a cheerful atmosphere.

On the other hand, if the project’s genre is an action video, you may want to create a LUT that highlights blue, green, and other similar tones to evoke a serious feeling.

### 2\. To Showcase Several Looks

Color grading often comes down to preference. There isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution when grading footage, especially if the video project is on a neutral topic.

Creating custom LUTs can allow you to preview different looks for clients and allow them to choose the footage they like.

### 3\. To Speed Up the Color Grading Process

Perhaps the biggest pro of LUTs is their ability to speed up the color grading process. Creating your own LUTs can allow you to use the same LUT for multiple projects that are similar and save time during color grading.

In addition, since color grading can take a considerable amount of time, creating your own LUTs can be helpful if you regularly work on projects with tight deadlines.

And if you’re working with an editor or team of editors, adding your own LUT to the footage can speed up editing and give the final cut a more refined look.

### 4\. When Working with Multiple Editing Tools

Nearly all popular video editing applications support LUTs. If you regularly use several applications for editing and color grading, LUTs can help you quickly achieve the same colors across all the various applications you use.

All editing applications have different color grading tools, so it’s relatively challenging to achieve the same colors across several applications. Creating your own LUTs can make it easier to transfer color values between different software.

## How to Create Your Own LUT

Creating LUTs is fairly simple. However, to create effective LUTs, ensure you prepare your source footage to avoid issues down the line when applying the LUT to your footage.

Here are some crucial things you should do when prepping your source footage:

* Ensure your exposure is perfect.
* Ensure your white balance is correct.
* Ensure your lighting reflects an accurate balance of highlights and shadows.

By ensuring these things are in order, you will be able to create a versatile LUT that you can apply across a wide variety of footage.

After prepping your source footage, you can then create your own LUT. Here’s how you can create a LUT in Filmora following a few simple steps:

#### Tips for Filmora New Version Users

Due to the updating of Filmora, some of the following operations may be different from the operations of the new version, new version users can click on the latest operation guide - [**Apply 3D LUT in color correction**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) in the User Guide section.

LUTs can make the color grading process easier and quicker. They can prove incredibly useful, especially if you’re unfamiliar with the color grading workflow or hard-pressed for time. They can also elevate your footage and make it look more cinematic.

While many video editing applications come with several pre-installed LUTs, try to create your custom LUTs using the steps above. Creating your LUTs from scratch may take you slightly more time than using pre-created LUTs, but creating the perfect LUT could save you time grading future projects.

When creating your own LUTs, try to create and apply several different LUTs to see which one is suitable for your footage. There usually isn’t a one-size-fits-all LUT option, so creating and testing out different LUTs is the best way to find the perfect custom LUT for your projects.

Color grading can feel daunting, especially if you don’t have much experience grading footage. Fortunately, LUTs can help you grade your footage almost effortlessly. Like your favorite Snapchat or Instagram filters, a LUT can instantly transform dull-looking footage into something more vibrant. So, what is a LUT?

LUT is an acronym for “look up table.” A LUT is a preset color that you can apply to footage to transform how it looks. Video editors, colorists, and filmmakers use LUTs to speed up color grading. However, you don’t need to be an experienced professional to use them. With minimal color grading and video editing experience, you can easily apply LUTs to your footage.

LUTs are usually denoted by the .LUT, .CUBE, or. 3DL file extensions. You can create LUTs using several video editing and color grading applications, such as Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, DaVinci Resolve, and Filmora. In this guide, we’ll explore how to create your own LUT and use custom LUTs in Filmora.

## Why We Need to Create Our Own LUT

Many video editing tools usually come with pre-installed LUTs that you can quickly apply to footage. However, you may need to create your own LUT in some cases. Here are some reasons why you may need to create your own LUT:

### 1\. To Create a Particular Feeling

Clients may want their videos to evoke a particular emotion. If the pre-installed LUTs that come with your video editing software can’t evoke the particular feeling the client wants, you may need to create your own LUT. Some key questions to ask yourself when creating the LUT include:

* What is the genre of the video project?
* What kind of atmosphere do you want to create?
* Are there any colors or tones that you should emphasize?
* Once you ask yourself these questions, you’ll be able to create an appropriate LUT for the client.

For instance, if the genre of the video project is a comedy, you may want to create a LUT that highlights orange, yellow, and its tones to create a cheerful atmosphere.

On the other hand, if the project’s genre is an action video, you may want to create a LUT that highlights blue, green, and other similar tones to evoke a serious feeling.

### 2\. To Showcase Several Looks

Color grading often comes down to preference. There isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution when grading footage, especially if the video project is on a neutral topic.

Creating custom LUTs can allow you to preview different looks for clients and allow them to choose the footage they like.

### 3\. To Speed Up the Color Grading Process

Perhaps the biggest pro of LUTs is their ability to speed up the color grading process. Creating your own LUTs can allow you to use the same LUT for multiple projects that are similar and save time during color grading.

In addition, since color grading can take a considerable amount of time, creating your own LUTs can be helpful if you regularly work on projects with tight deadlines.

And if you’re working with an editor or team of editors, adding your own LUT to the footage can speed up editing and give the final cut a more refined look.

### 4\. When Working with Multiple Editing Tools

Nearly all popular video editing applications support LUTs. If you regularly use several applications for editing and color grading, LUTs can help you quickly achieve the same colors across all the various applications you use.

All editing applications have different color grading tools, so it’s relatively challenging to achieve the same colors across several applications. Creating your own LUTs can make it easier to transfer color values between different software.

## How to Create Your Own LUT

Creating LUTs is fairly simple. However, to create effective LUTs, ensure you prepare your source footage to avoid issues down the line when applying the LUT to your footage.

Here are some crucial things you should do when prepping your source footage:

* Ensure your exposure is perfect.
* Ensure your white balance is correct.
* Ensure your lighting reflects an accurate balance of highlights and shadows.

By ensuring these things are in order, you will be able to create a versatile LUT that you can apply across a wide variety of footage.

After prepping your source footage, you can then create your own LUT. Here’s how you can create a LUT in Filmora following a few simple steps:

## How to Make Boring Videos Look Cool By B Rolls

Everyone is bored after watching a simple recorded video in which a character explains or tells a story. No one will watch it for more than 4 minutes!

After looking through this article, you will make your video more fascinating and get more views instantly. It's all just due to B-roll, which will act as a ninja feature in your video. In this regard, [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) will handle everything.

Scroll more to discover two different types of B-roll videos and get an idea of how to make fascinating B-roll videos.

## Part 1\. What Is a B-roll?

B-roll is alternative or supplementary video footage that editors can use to intercut in between their main video. In that way, B-roll can add more information to a scene.

### An additional footage

It is added as a supplementary video to interact with viewers more closely. This feature helps to give more details of a scene.

### Visual representation

When the main explanatory video is too boring, you can add a b-roll to represent the movie's story visually. It can also add to spice up and beat the energy of the narrative.

### Without sound

The B-roll shots are mostly without audio or with little background sound. In most cases, the sound of the primary video is continued while the B-roll footage is just shown.

### Act as a filler

The criteria for the B-roll is to provide the situation of the storyline. Additionally, it could be utilized as filler in between scenes in a movie or television program. B-roll may be found almost anywhere!

In this article, you will learn about two main kinds of B-rolls and the steps to edit them on [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Stick with us to the end!

## Part 2\. Two Types of B-rolls: Explanation Video B-rolls

When recording any explanatory video, the audience may leave it in the middle of a video if a character explains without any visual representation. When explaining something new, showing the object in B-roll can be more effective than just verbally explaining what the audience is seeing.

Let's take the video we made about microphones as an example. Instead of just verbally introduce the various mics, we inserted B-roll footage to display what they look like and how they can be used. The combination of the visual footage and the background voiceover presents the mic in a more vivid way. Also, it keeps the audience's attention.

![explanation b roll of microphone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/explanation-b-roll-of-microphone.gif)

**Goal of the explanation B-roll video**

The main goal of this type of B-roll is to show your audience what you are talking about instead of just telling them in a dull way.

## Part 3\. How to Edit Explanation B-roll Footage on Filmora?

After getting the footage and recording shots for B-roll videos, you need to edit it on the Wondershare Filmora. For this, follow the below-mentioned steps:

##### Step1Download the Wondershare Filmora

There is no need to do any complex process for editing on any platform. Because we have one platform on which every tool is available.

* First of all, you have to download the [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).
* Then get access to the entire features.

The premium version has new features and effects plugins that make editing more filmy and fun!

##### Step2Stock media in Filmora

After downloading, it's time to edit the B-roll video. If you can't film your own B-roll, you can use stock footage but make sure you have the license to use them.

## Part 4\. Two Types of B-rolls: Storytelling Video B-rolls

During the creation of short films or any storytelling videos, if a person sits and speaks without showing any character or anything else, it will turn boring. Due to this, you have more chances to lose your audience and viewers.

In visual storytelling, if you will insert more clips with close shots, it will make the environment cool. The crazy thing is that you can make mimic shots easily at home by utilizing household objects. Let's check out one of the examples.

### Example 1\. Film B-roll footage with food

So let's add some b-roll to give it more context even if you have a master shot of yourself looking off frame alone.

##### Step1Write a script

Before making any video, the first step is to write a script for the whole video. If you will have more than two characters, then make dialogues for everyone and practice it again and again to give a fascinating look.

Then speak to your audience, make sure that what you are speaking is vivid and make everything simple and crystal clear.

##### Step2Shot a primary video

First of all, make a primary video according to your script by implementing a camera at one side, or you can also change the angle of the camera lens during shooting to have a look from all sides.

![primary footage of a video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/primary-footage-of-a-video.gif)

As you can see that it's kind of boring for the audience, but we will make it more unique by implementing closer shots. For this, follow the last step:

##### Step3Make B-roll shots

Make closer shots of things which the character have to select and pick up. Check out two B-roll shots for the main video:

* First, make a closer shot of the object (Snacks) that the character is noticing prior.

![b roll footage number 1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/b-roll-footage-number-1.jpg)

* Second, create more intimate footage of the second object (Banana) which the character will select and grab.

The intriguing thing is that if the light is more shaped, it will more accurately reflect the image's background, setting, and context. Try it out!

##### Step1Cut the cardboard

You may shape the cardboard any way you desire. We'll experiment with this by cutting cardboard into the shape of window shades.

## Part 2\. Two Types of B-rolls: Explanation Video B-rolls

When recording any explanatory video, the audience may leave it in the middle of a video if a character explains without any visual representation. When explaining something new, showing the object in B-roll can be more effective than just verbally explaining what the audience is seeing.

Let's take the video we made about microphones as an example. Instead of just verbally introduce the various mics, we inserted B-roll footage to display what they look like and how they can be used. The combination of the visual footage and the background voiceover presents the mic in a more vivid way. Also, it keeps the audience's attention.

**Goal of the explanation B-roll video**

The main goal of this type of B-roll is to show your audience what you are talking about instead of just telling them in a dull way.
