## Part 1: 3 Techniques to Zoom PowerPoint Presentations

Microsoft is always developing new tools to help you create and construct amazing presentations. The PowerPoint Zoom function is one of them. It is not the straightforward zoom capability that has been a part of PowerPoint for a long time. Zoom in PowerPoint is a useful feature that enables you to go right to the information you want and promotes an interactive presentation that is seamless. You just need to be aware of three distinct sorts of Zooms to do it quickly and easily. They are described below:

### 1\. Use the View tab Zoom command

PowerPoint's Zoom feature is a clever tool for creating and watching presentations. When the text or item you wish to deal with is too tiny for you to view, the Zoom tool might be useful. On the screen, a slide will look bigger as you zoom in, and smaller when you zoom away. Choose the appropriate zoom level in the "Zoom" dialog box by typing a number into the "Percent:" spinner or selecting an option from the "Zoom to" section. Click the "OK" button to apply the chosen magnification level after setting it.

##### Step1Zoom in with the View Dialog Box

Additionally, you may access the Zoom dialog box and choose a different zoom level by clicking the Zoom button on the View tab of the ribbon. choose the Ribbon's "View" tab. the "Zoom" button from the "Zoom" button group, and then.

##### Step2Click the Zoom Button

Zoom in by going to the View tab attributes. Select Zoom in from the View menu after clicking. There will be a Zoom window where you may choose or input the zoom level. More options for adjusting the zoom level are available under the Zoom group on the View tab of the ribbon.

### 2\. Use the Zoom Slider at The Bottom of the Screen

In PowerPoint, the Status Bar's lower-right application window has the Zoom slider. This tool lets you adjust the slide's magnification level. This just modifies your sense of how near or far away the slide looks onscreen; the slide itself is unaffected in any way.

##### Step1Click the Zoom In (+) button on the status bar

The horizontal scroll bar will then display underneath the slide if you zoom in on the slide until it can no longer fit horizontally on the screen. The slide may then be thoroughly examined at the selected magnification level by using it to scroll left and right.

![how to zoom in on powerpoint](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/adjust-zoom-status-bar.jpg)

##### Step2Click the Zoom Out (-) button on the status bar

Changing the magnification level is simple using PowerPoint's Zoom slider. Click and move the slider left, toward the minus sign, to reduce the magnification level. To the left of the zoom slider is a percentage that represents the magnification level.

##### Step3Fit to the Window

Click the "Fit slide to current window" button to the right of the Zoom slider to force the slide to fit inside the view's available slide area.
