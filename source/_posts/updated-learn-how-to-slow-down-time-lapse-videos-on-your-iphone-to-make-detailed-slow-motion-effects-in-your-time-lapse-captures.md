## Dubbing Videos With Voiceovers | Using Wondershare Filmora

Voiceovers have been a great utility in the digital ecosystem for a while. From movies to videos, the use of voiceovers has provided content creators with new dynamics. While it has enhanced the quality of video creation, there are other technicalities that have arisen against it. In this article, we will be discussing the details involving voiceovers and recordings.

Also, it includes a discussion of tools that can be used to ensure professional voice recordings. Go through the provided details to know how to utilize voiceovers to perfection.

## Part 1: What is The Difference Between Voice Recording and Voiceover?

Do you know **voiceover** and voice recording are two different terms? They are often used correspondingly but have different meanings. Here are a few differences between the two in the section below:

**Voice Recording**

It is a process in which you can capture audio in your device using a microphone. Voice recordings can be any type of audio content, such as conversations, interviews, and much more. There are various settings for voice recording as well. It starts from studio recordings, outside and even home set-up recordings.

**Voiceover**

On the other hand, voiceover specifically refers to a recorded narration or video commentary. This includes documentaries, advertisements, films, television shows, and more. It provides information, explains visuals, or narrates a story to your audience. Mostly voiceover is scripted and well synchronized to convey the message to its audience successfully.

**Summary**

Wrapping up, the main difference between these two terms is the intent of audio content. In general, voice recording allows you to capture audio. In contrast, voiceover refers explicitly to the recording of some specific narrations. Ultimately, we can say that voiceover is a part of voice recording that should be synchronized with the visual media to fulfill its purpose.
