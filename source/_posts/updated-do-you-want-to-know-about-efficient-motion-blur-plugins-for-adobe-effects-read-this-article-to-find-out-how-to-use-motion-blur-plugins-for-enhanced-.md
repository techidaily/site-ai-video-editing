Step2Join the live stream. Click the live stream that you want to watch after selecting it.

Step3Click where it says, "Live Chat" and start typing anything you want to publish in the chat box. Next, select the

send button.

Additionally, a number of YouTube viewers frequently lament their inability to comment on livestreams or the fact that their messages keep disappearing. Because certain comments are flagged as spam and filtered, this is the cause. There is no other option but to post constructive criticism. If the streamer is one you enjoy or if you don't want to miss the author's next live stream. Then choose "HIDE Chat" if you don't want to see any comments at all.

## Guide To Cropping and Combining Content in Wondershare Filmora [Latest]

Video editing is one of the most essential tasks in a video project. It plays a role in creating videos that leave a lasting impression on your audience. From the initial raw footage to the final product, a video goes through several processes. One vital aspect of video editing is **trimming** and **merging**, which holds great importance for any video project.

The editing process changes the whole narrative of a video by adding more depth and feel to it. Through editing, you can remove unwanted segments, rearrange clips, and much more. Capturing and recording video is one thing, but bringing the best out of the raw files is another. To make your raw footage somewhat stunning, you have to sit in the editing room.

## Part 1: How Does Trimming or Merging Videos Help Users?

Merging and trimming videos is an editing technique that offers many benefits. Here's how these actions can help you in so many ways. Find out how it helps the users when they merge or **trim a video:**

### Trimming Videos

* **Trimming** allows users to remove unwanted portions of a video. You can eliminate mistakes, irrelevant footage, or unnecessary pauses in the video. It also helps streamline the content and improve its overall quality.
* It can help adjust the pacing of a video by removing or shortening sections that may be too slow or lengthy. This ensures a more engaging and dynamic viewing experience.
* By trimming, you can select the best moments from a longer video. You can also create highlight reels that showcase the most important or exciting parts.
* Many social media platforms have specific time limitations for videos. It allows you to meet these requirements and share their content without compromising its essence.

### Merging Videos

* The **merging** of videos enables you to combine multiple clips or segments into a single video. This technique is useful when users want to compile footage from different sources. It also creates a uniform narrative from separate scenes.
* Merging allows you to create montages or collages that showcase various moments or perspectives. This is often used in music videos, compilations, or video presentations.
* Doing this can make seamless transitions between different shots or scenes. This further creates a visually fluid experience for the viewer.
* It also helps you create a coherent storyline by combining different clips. You can use this technique to communicate ideas, emotions, or messages effectively.
