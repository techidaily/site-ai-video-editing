### How to smooth out cuts

Adding cuts in the beats is one part of the job, not the whole job. After adding these cuts, you have to smoothen them. With it, the point of interest for the audience becomes clear.

Indeed, you would not want your audience to have this experience. Head to the following techniques to understand how to smooth out video cuts

##### Technique 1: Showing multiple perspectives

The sound effects and music tracks in the royalty-free audio library are suitable for a variety of scenarios.

**●** There are a lot of transitions and filters to make the slideshow look amazing.

**●** There are various text templates to help you annotate more effectively.

Let your imagination run wild with editing tools that are both powerful and easy to use.

**Step 1**: Uploading Images and Videos to Filmora

Once the video editor has loaded, go to the Media tab's Import menu and select Import a Media Folder. Navigate to the folder containing the materials for your slideshow, select it with a click, then hit OK to import it into your project.

 **Step 2**: Position the Media Files on the Timeline

 Simply select a file to be added to the timeline and drag and drop it to the preferred location. Repeat this method for all of the images you'd like to include in your slideshow, then organise them in the same order as they'll appear in the presentation.

**Step 3**: Avoid Hard Cuts Between Slides by Using Transitions

A hard cut between two photographs can break the flow of your slideshow, but you can simply correct this by transitioning gently from one slide to the next.

If you double-click a transition after it's been added to the timeline, you'll be sent to the Transition Setting Window, where you can define the default duration for all transitions you add to a slideshow and choose your preferred transition mode.

**Step 4**: Enhance the colours in your slideshow with filters and overlays.

The Effects tab, which is next to the Transitions tab, contains a variety of visual effects that desaturate or brighten the colours in your images. Filmora's visual effects are divided into filter and overlay categories, each with its own subcategories such as Lomography, Sepia Tone, and Light Leaks.

**Step 5**: Incorporating Motion Graphics Elements into Slides

Hundreds of motion graphics templates are available in the Elements tab, which you can rapidly add to the timeline.

**Step 6**: Creating Slideshow Soundtracks and Recording Voiceovers

Select the Record Voiceover tool from the Record drop-down menu on the Media tab. When the Record Audio window appears on the screen, select the microphone you'll use to record the narration and press the Record button.

You may use Filmora's large library of music and sound effects for free. Simply navigate to the Audio tab and browse the subcategories of Electronic, Young & Bright, and Rock until you select the perfect song for the slideshow's soundtrack.

**Step 7**: Exporting Slideshows from Filmora

The final step in the process of creating a slideshow in Filmora is to export the project. Click on the **Export** button and wait for the **Export window** to appear on the screen. You can then select the output file format, set a preferred frame rate or resolution for your slideshow, or export

**●** There are a lot of transitions and filters to make the slideshow look amazing.

**●** There are various text templates to help you annotate more effectively.

Let your imagination run wild with editing tools that are both powerful and easy to use.

**Step 1**: Uploading Images and Videos to Filmora

Once the video editor has loaded, go to the Media tab's Import menu and select Import a Media Folder. Navigate to the folder containing the materials for your slideshow, select it with a click, then hit OK to import it into your project.

 **Step 2**: Position the Media Files on the Timeline

 Simply select a file to be added to the timeline and drag and drop it to the preferred location. Repeat this method for all of the images you'd like to include in your slideshow, then organise them in the same order as they'll appear in the presentation.

**Step 3**: Avoid Hard Cuts Between Slides by Using Transitions

A hard cut between two photographs can break the flow of your slideshow, but you can simply correct this by transitioning gently from one slide to the next.

If you double-click a transition after it's been added to the timeline, you'll be sent to the Transition Setting Window, where you can define the default duration for all transitions you add to a slideshow and choose your preferred transition mode.

**Step 4**: Enhance the colours in your slideshow with filters and overlays.

The Effects tab, which is next to the Transitions tab, contains a variety of visual effects that desaturate or brighten the colours in your images. Filmora's visual effects are divided into filter and overlay categories, each with its own subcategories such as Lomography, Sepia Tone, and Light Leaks.

Hundreds of motion graphics templates are available in the Elements tab, which you can rapidly add to the timeline.

Select the Record Voiceover tool from the Record drop-down menu on the Media tab. When the Record Audio window appears on the screen, select the microphone you'll use to record the narration and press the Record button.

You may use Filmora's large library of music and sound effects for free. Simply navigate to the Audio tab and browse the subcategories of Electronic, Young & Bright, and Rock until you select the perfect song for the slideshow's soundtrack.

**Step 7**: Exporting Slideshows from Filmora

Let your imagination run wild with editing tools that are both powerful and easy to use.

**Step 1**: Uploading Images and Videos to Filmora

Once the video editor has loaded, go to the Media tab's Import menu and select Import a Media Folder. Navigate to the folder containing the materials for your slideshow, select it with a click, then hit OK to import it into your project.

 **Step 2**: Position the Media Files on the Timeline

 Simply select a file to be added to the timeline and drag and drop it to the preferred location. Repeat this method for all of the images you'd like to include in your slideshow, then organise them in the same order as they'll appear in the presentation.

**Step 3**: Avoid Hard Cuts Between Slides by Using Transitions

A hard cut between two photographs can break the flow of your slideshow, but you can simply correct this by transitioning gently from one slide to the next.

If you double-click a transition after it's been added to the timeline, you'll be sent to the Transition Setting Window, where you can define the default duration for all transitions you add to a slideshow and choose your preferred transition mode.

**Step 4**: Enhance the colours in your slideshow with filters and overlays.

The Effects tab, which is next to the Transitions tab, contains a variety of visual effects that desaturate or brighten the colours in your images. Filmora's visual effects are divided into filter and overlay categories, each with its own subcategories such as Lomography, Sepia Tone, and Light Leaks.

**Step 5**: Incorporating Motion Graphics Elements into Slides

Hundreds of motion graphics templates are available in the Elements tab, which you can rapidly add to the timeline.

**Step 6**: Creating Slideshow Soundtracks and Recording Voiceovers

Select the Record Voiceover tool from the Record drop-down menu on the Media tab. When the Record Audio window appears on the screen, select the microphone you'll use to record the narration and press the Record button.

You may use Filmora's large library of music and sound effects for free. Simply navigate to the Audio tab and browse the subcategories of Electronic, Young & Bright, and Rock until you select the perfect song for the slideshow's soundtrack.

**Step 7**: Exporting Slideshows from Filmora

The final step in the process of creating a slideshow in Filmora is to export the project. Click on the **Export** button and wait for the **Export window** to appear on the screen. You can then select the output file format, set a preferred frame rate or resolution for your slideshow, or export
