## A Complete Guide to the Best Brand Story Videos |2023|

With the advent of streaming content accessible anytime, anywhere, conventional marketing has somewhat lost grip on its performance. Consumers are now savvy as they now take a step further, like using ad blockers or tuning out ads.

However, it doesn’t imply the end of advertising as a brand promotion tool altogether. Individuals still desire best-in-class deals and products and spend their money shopping. All they need is to get informed about the product or service more entertainingly and innovatively.

This is one of the reasons why many established brands are now shifting toward their **brand storytelling**. And there’s no better and highly effective way to portray **your brand story** than with video. Simply making a video resembling any conventional TV commercial ad with an irritating ‘Call Today’ voiceover won’t be enough to get results.

You must learn how many creative and successful brands are infusing their **branding and storytelling** strategies to engage their customers. If you’re reading this article, you’re aiming to build your own **brand storytelling video** and are wondering how to make it a successful one.

Make a video using clips where your customers tell a story about themselves and their experience with your brand.
* **Utilize The Trending Hashtags &** **Topics**: Social medial trends and news feed is what attracts today’s customers the most. Spotify’s advertisement team always wraps their ad campaigns into a package of top-events-and-stories.

**Valuable Storytelling Lessons From Airbnb’s Marketing Practices:**

* **Let Your Customers Be At The Heart Of Your Organization**: After interviewing users, Airbnb found out that no one can better inform them about their company than the community of their regular users. The conversations and interviews with such users helped Airbnb to prepare its entire brand story. Thus, you should, too, keep your customers at your core.
* **It’s Never Too Late To Discover Your Story**: Although launched in 2008, the company Airbnb realized they’d need to discover their business mission to scale and progress. They are an example that it’s never too late for your brand to find the brand story.
* **Content Is The King:** Airbnb always keeps posting content on its own blog and YouTube channel. Most of their content is based on user experiences and revolves around stories from within the brand’s community. Such high-quality content helped them to engage with the customers more efficiently.

### 4\. Nike - Most Powerful Brand Story Videos

If you’ve watched a Nike video ad featuring [LeBron James](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=%5FdIAMe1sQno) or others, you’ll know how much emphasis on emotions and inspiration.

Some of the marketing strategies that have helped them grow over the years include the following:

* They promote the advantages of their product’s features rather than simply highlighting and promoting the features. This is called **benefit-based marketing practice**.

Their tagline, ‘Give That Man a Bell, ’ best fits in terms of a man-to-man acknowledging something worth the celebration.

Here is what the video ad director Greg incorporated in the video to make it hit the marketing campaign’s motto:

**Sentimentality:**

* Greg incorporated an excellent blend of drama, emotion, and sentimentality in this two minutes video ad, which was as good as a two-hour Hollywood movie.
* The video hit the emotions on so many levels that you’ll feel like drinking a glass of whisky at the end of the ad.
* Your brand should also create a brand story video where you help your customers to acknowledge themselves by hitting their emotions at different levels.
* To know how just take a look at the ad yourself: [https://www.youtube.com/watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy7fxLwfOnQ&list=PL7tol-2iOCrEp2GQB0K1LxjIStnbFPi1f).

Significantly, Dove desires women to know that they are always encouraged, supported, and acknowledged for their real beauty. This storytelling helped Dove boost its product sales without making any direct references.

### 7\. El Gordo - The Spanish Christmas Lottery Ad 2021

### 5\. Bells - Reader

The marketing manager of Bell - Thami Silwana - revealed that the idea behind the ‘Bells-Reader’ campaign is to assist men in acknowledging, comprehending, and speaking about their personal victories.

They realized that sometimes it could be troublesome for men to interact with one another and acknowledge their inside feeling and emotions when one of them have achieved something. Their tagline, ‘Give That Man a Bell, ’ best fits in terms of a man-to-man acknowledging something worth the celebration.

Here is what the video ad director Greg incorporated in the video to make it hit the marketing campaign’s motto:

**Sentimentality:**

* Greg incorporated an excellent blend of drama, emotion, and sentimentality in this two minutes video ad, which was as good as a two-hour Hollywood movie.
* The video hit the emotions on so many levels that you’ll feel like drinking a glass of whisky at the end of the ad.
* Your brand should also create a brand story video where you help your customers to acknowledge themselves by hitting their emotions at different levels.
* To know how just take a look at the ad yourself: [https://www.youtube.com/watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy7fxLwfOnQ&list=PL7tol-2iOCrEp2GQB0K1LxjIStnbFPi1f).
