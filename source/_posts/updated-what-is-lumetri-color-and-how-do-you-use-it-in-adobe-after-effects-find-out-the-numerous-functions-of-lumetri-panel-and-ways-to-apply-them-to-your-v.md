## How to use Lumetri Color in Adobe After Effects

You don't need to be a pro for you to use Lumetri Color in Adobe After Effects. The color workspace in Adobe After Effect is designed to be straightforward and user-friendly.

With the functionality, you can easily manipulate the skin tones in your footage and refocus images.

## The Frames per Second Can Enhance or Hamper Your Ability to Enjoy Watching a Video on YouTube. This Article Will Define Frame Rates and Help You Choose the Best FPS

YouTube has become one of the to go to social media platforms for internet use because it provides entertainment for people who want to get entertained, learn or catch up with their favorite personalities. This platform has also given content creators a space to showcase their talents, educate the masses or simply have a good time when playing their games.

However, being a content creator on YouTube entails more than just posting a video weekly. You ought to ensure you get the frame rate in the video right. Failure to choose the correct frame rate will affect how your audience enjoys the video, increasing the chances that you lose subscribers.

Without further ado, let's discuss the best fps for YouTube.

![best fps for youtube videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-fps.JPG)

## How Does FPS Affect Viewing YouTube Videos?

Before we dive into how FPS affects your viewing experience on YouTube and determine the best frame rate for YouTube, let's define what it is. FPS is short for frames per second and is the number of still images appearing on display in one second. The more frames per second you have in your video, the clearer your video will become. The vice versa is also true.

To further simplify this definition, we will use the example of a flipbook. An animator usually draws an image on each page of the book. When they flip the pages in rapid succession, the images appear to be in motion. Suppose the animator used fewer pages to make their flipbook.

![flipbook animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/flipbook.gif)

The animation would not be as smooth and crisp as if they had used more pages, each with a different still image contributing to the final motion.

The human brain can easily differentiate between 12 distinct images. However, when the photos exceed 18 and move rapidly, the brain is tricked into believing that the pictures are in motion. A frame rate lower than 24FPS will make your YouTube video look choppy and unnatural, as if it lags in real time.

Ideally, 24fps is the best fps for YouTube videos featuring mundane activities that we see in daily life. However, if you want to pack more information into your video and make the motion a bit smoother, then 30fps is the best video frame rate for YouTube.

Perhaps you post fast-paced content about gaming and other live-action videos. You are better off choosing 60FPS, which makes high-speed scenes look more fluid and helps you capture double the information.

## What Is the Recommended & Highest Frame Rate for YouTube Videos?

Unfortunately, there is no correct answer when it comes to the best video frame rate for YouTube videos. The controversy still continues, and everyone seems to have their own opinion.

According to [Thomas Edison](https://techland.time.com/2012/12/06/riddles-in-the-dark-the-hobbits-48-frames-per-second-explained/), anything less than 46FPS for motion pictures will strain the eyes and give an unpleasant viewing experience. At the time, filmmakers and videographers were adamant about sticking to between 22-26PFS for their videos, provided the audio adaptability remained at 35mm.

Different frame rates are used for various displays, genres, and mediums. For instance, 1-16FPS was common in silent-era movies and stop-motion movies. However, this frame rate is neither universally accepted nor widespread in the world today.

![recommended frame rate for youtube videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/recommended-youtube-video-frame-rate.JPG)

An excellent example of a frame rate that produces larger-than-life videos with exceptional detail is 24fps. However, the NTSC confirms that it is, in fact, 23.97 frames per second when you consider issues to do with color and hue.

Another universally acceptable frame rate is 30fps, which is widespread in television. Videographers also use it to make slow-motion segments in sports videos or other fast-paced content. The sweet 60fps makes any motion look smooth as butter and significantly reduces any blur in your videos. This frame rate is also characterized by super fine details you can easily miss with 24 and 30fps. It is also the highest fps video on YouTube.

120fps is synonymous with grandeur, with its monumental footage suitable for slow-motion scenes. Lastly, anything above 120fps works great with ultra-slow-motion videos. Of course, we are talking 240fps, which is rare but not uncommon. However, you would need a high-speed capture camera, which we believe doesn't come cheap.

To sum it all up, 24fps is the recommended frame rate for YouTube. You can go higher than the baseline and use 30fps or higher if you make videos with lots of motion, like gaming videos. Most of the time, a higher frame rate is a personal choice rather than a necessity. However, we understand you want to give your viewers a pleasant experience while watching your content.

## What Is the Best Frame Rate for YouTube Videos?

If you want to record a video for your YouTube channel, you might wonder what is the best fps for YouTube videos. You are better off sticking between 24fps and 60fps. The platform has only recently added 8K support for videos, which is a plus for many content creators. Below is a list of frame rates for the most popular genres on YouTube.

![frame rate for youtube videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-video-frame-rate.jpg)

* Podcasts and talk shows - 30 FPS
* Gaming videos - 60 FPS
* Makeup tutorials - 60 FPS
* Educational videos - 24- 30 FPS
* Health and fitness - 24-30 FPS
* Sports - 40-60 FPS

Remember that the list above is not exhaustive and doesn't cover all types of content on the platform. We can't also guarantee that there is a "best" frame rate for your YouTube video. We suggest you heed our suggestion and practice to determine the best frame rate for YouTube videos.

We couldn't fail to mention that your frame rate should match the content uploading and decoding. Since the interlaced content may experience performance issues on YouTube, it would help if you deinterlaced it.

## How To Check FPS on YouTube Video?

Below is a simple guide on how to check fps on YouTube videos.

Step1 Open any video on YouTube and right-click on it. A pop-up window will appear. Select "Stats for nerds."

![stats for nerds in youtube](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-stats-for-nerds.jpg)

Step2 Narrow down on the "Current/Optimal Res" tab. The first set of figures before the forward slash represents the current resolution, while the figures after the forward slash represent the optimal resolution for the video. For instance, the figure in the picture below indicates that the resolution is 1280\*720, and the frame rate is 30FPS. The figures repeat themselves, meaning that the video is at the optimal resolution.
