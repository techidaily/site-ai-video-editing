The sources are special color presets that transform color schemas. The use cases of LUTs typically fall within the video and film industries. Individuals can also use these video-enhancing tools to better visualize their content.

Within LUTs, you will find a range of preset filters that can be applied. Meanwhile, the color grading is executed with more consistency. This way, the colors are accurately applied to all frames of visual content. The colors are mapped into the original footage using pre-determined color options. So, you don't need to adjust or manually customize individual colors.
