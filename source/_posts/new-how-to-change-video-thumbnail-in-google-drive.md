## How to Change Video Thumbnail in Google Drive

**What is a Google drive?**

“Google drive is a self-hosted cloud-based site that provides free space to store your files and pictures to share them with your friends and family”.

Google Drive is also used to promote businesses or websites. You can upload a video to Google Drive and embed the file in your blog or any other website.

**What is a Thumbnail?**

“A Thumbnail is a still image that acts as

a preview image of your video.”

A thumbnail is the first thing seen by the viewers while watching videos. It is the only thing that forces the viewer either to watch the video or not because it previews the video content. It is also shown in the search results. A thumbnail is just like the cover or title of a book. You will read a book by its cover. In the same way, a video is viewed by its thumbnail.

Google drive is also used for the promotion of websites and businesses. It does not offer to add a thumbnail or cover image like YouTube has the option to set and can change the thumbnail of the video. As we all know Google drive is not a streaming platform and has its own boundaries.

Normally, the google drive can generate a thumbnail from the video and uses the generated thumbnail ignoring the one you have uploaded. But on the other hand, if it cannot generate a thumbnail the uploaded thumbnail will be displayed. Usually, the default thumbnail may have weird facial expressions or may not be attractive for the viewers to open the video.

Here we are discussing a few alternatives to change the thumbnail of the video in Google drive.

Select a separate image to be housed in a separate column to set as a thumbnail image and then go into the **details, title,** and **Image settings.**

## Step by Step to Add Border to Video Using Premiere Pro

The border is really important as it frames up all the video. It makes the video eye-catching and gives a vivid effect. It also fixes the automated cropping issues, especially on Instagram. Along with this, it helps the viewers to watch the video as you can add effects about fun, travel, guides and etc. accordingly. Adding a border is super easy and it’s not more than fun!

So let’s start…

## **How to Add Borders to Videos in Premiere Pro**

Today we are going to discuss how to add borders to the video clips or images in premiere pro. It’s pretty simple to make borders of different colors and sizes for your video clips.

So, here are the two different ways we can use to add borders to our videos or images.

1. Adding a border to the video using a grid effect
2. Adding a border to the video using the essential graphics panel

### **Way 1\.** **Using a Grid Effect**

While working on the project, make sure the aspect ratio of the video is 16:9, and project settings are HD (1080P) and UHD 4K in premiere pro.

Let’s start step by step.

* Drag all the video clips by stacking them on video tracks in the timeline.
* Hit the **Effects** tab and write the **grid** in the search panel.
* Simply drag the **grid** option into the timeline of the videos.

* Select the **anchor value** to **0** for the x and y.
* Change the **size** to **width and height slider.**
* Change the **width** to **1920** and **height** to **1080**.

Now we have borders added as you can see below.

You can also change the width of the borders.

* Change the **width** to **30**.

You have the option to change the color of the border.

* Select the **blending mode** to **normal**.
* Select the **color picker** tool and change the color of your desire.

### **Way 2\.** **Using the Essential Graphics Panel**

First of all, you wanna be in your premium pro graphics workspace. This will pull off your graphics panel on your right. The good thing about the essential graphics panel is, that it is vector-based. So the different video clips with different resolutions will not pixelate.

Let’s dive in…

Now, to use the graphics panel you need to perform the following steps.

* **Import** the videos and drag them into the timeline.
* Select the **effects**
* Find **“alpha adjust”** and drag it into the effects control.

* Create a **4-point polygon mask**.

A rectangular mask will be created. You can edit it according to the frame requirement.

* Go to the corner of the mask border and press the shift key. Drag the border to resize and scale it proportionally.

* Again go to effect controls, under **opacity** hit **invert alpha**.
* Under **mask** hit **inverted**.

* Go to **motion** settings, change the **position**, and
* Go to **Alpha adjust** and set the **mask feathering** to **0**.

* Now go back to the **effects** panel and search the **paint bucket**.

* Under effects controls, hit the **alpha channel** under the **fill selector**
* Then hit **stroke** under the **stroke**
* You can turn up the **stroke width** to make it a bit thicker.
* Hit the **color** tab to change the color of the border as desired.

## **Conclusion**

We have discussed different software to add borders. All the software and tools are free to use. Similarly, they can be used on both Mac as well as Windows. They are user-friendly and provide full control over borders. You can use any one of them to make your borders and can easily engage viewers in your videos.

In all of the above applications, I recommend you to use **Wondershare filmora 11**. It is the most professional software and makes your video stand out.

**Way 1\.** **Using a Grid Effect**

While working on the project, make sure the aspect ratio of the video is 16:9, and project settings are HD (1080P) and UHD 4K in premiere pro.

Let’s start step by step.

* Drag all the video clips by stacking them on video tracks in the timeline.
* Hit the **Effects** tab and write the **grid** in the search panel.
* Simply drag the **grid** option into the timeline of the videos.

* Select the **anchor value** to **0** for the x and y.
* Change the **size** to **width and height slider.**
* Change the **width** to **1920** and **height** to **1080**.

Now we have borders added as you can see below.

You can also change the width of the borders.

* Change the **width** to **30**.

You have the option to change the color of the border.

* Select the **blending mode** to **normal**.
* Select the **color picker** tool and change the color of your desire.

### **Way 2\.** **Using the Essential Graphics Panel**

First of all, you wanna be in your premium pro graphics workspace. This will pull off your graphics panel on your right. The good thing about the essential graphics panel is, that it is vector-based. So the different video clips with different resolutions will not pixelate.

Let’s dive in…

Now, to use the graphics panel you need to perform the following steps.

* **Import** the videos and drag them into the timeline.
* Select the **effects**
* Find **“alpha adjust”** and drag it into the effects control.

* Create a **4-point polygon mask**.

A rectangular mask will be created. You can edit it according to the frame requirement.

* Go to the corner of the mask border and press the shift key. Drag the border to resize and scale it proportionally.

* Again go to effect controls, under **opacity** hit **invert alpha**.
* Under **mask** hit **inverted**.

* Go to **motion** settings, change the **position**, and
* Go to **Alpha adjust** and set the **mask feathering** to **0**.

* Now go back to the **effects** panel and search the **paint bucket**.

* Under effects controls, hit the **alpha channel** under the **fill selector**
* Then hit **stroke** under the **stroke**
* You can turn up the **stroke width** to make it a bit thicker.
* Hit the **color** tab to change the color of the border as desired.

## How to Create Loop Videos Using Filmora

A loop fashion lookbook will be familiar to you if you are a fashion YouTuber. Here we will show you how to record shots and make a creative lookbook to show off your best outfits in an excellent way with Wondershare Filmora.

![loop video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-1.gif)

## Shots recording for loop masking

The first and most crucial step for creating a good loop video is to record perfect shots. Here are the steps to record video shots for loop videos.

### How to create a loop video

Step1 Set your camera or phone on a tripod. Make sure it stands still and does not move.

![set up a camera](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-2.png)

Step2 Set it so that you have a door on one side and enough room for the subject to walk through the door and move out of the frame.

![move out of the frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-3.png)

Step3 Make sure all your outfits are ready.

![outfits ready](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-4.png)

Step4 Start recording on your camera. Walk through the door wearing the first outfit. Change your outfits and repeat the step with all your dresses. It would help if you kept the camera rolling while recording all these clips. Turning the recording on and off with every shot will result in many small movements.

## Editing footage with a professional video editor - Wondershare Filmora

![empty background frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-6.png)

Step4 Extend the frozen frame and cut out the rest of the video.

![extend the frozen frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-7.png)

Step5 We are done with the first track so lock it.

![lock first track](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-8.png)

Step6 Import the clip again on the second track. And find the sections of the clips where the subject is walking in the video. Cut the remaining part.

![import the clip on the second track](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-9.gif)

![put the first outfit clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-11.gif)

Step9 Move the second outfit to that playhead area.

![add a mask frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-18.gif)

Step16 Unlock the first track and move the playhead to find the point where the subject with 4th outfit moves out of the frame. Then, cut the remaining part of the freeze frame on the right.

![unlock first track](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-19.gif)

Step17 Now move the playhead to the first frame and find where it coincides with the last part of the final frame. Cut the previous piece.

![move playhead to first frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-20.gif)
