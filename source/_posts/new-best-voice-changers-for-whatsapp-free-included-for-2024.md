## Part 1\. How to put a background on a green screen to video?

The first thing you need to do is shoot your video with high-quality green screen in the background. Make sure that it is evenly spread and lit up so that there are no light and dark patches. Now that you have green screen video, you will need a professional video editor to replace the green screen with any background as per your requirements. Here are the three ways on how to add background to green screen.

### Way 1\. Use Filmora

[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is the easiest video editor to add a background to green screen video instantly. Filmora is a professional video editor with an intuitive user interface. There are loads of tools to add visual effects and perform basic to advanced editing. Filmora is available for Windows and Mac users and you have to transfer your recorded green screen video to your computer. You can replace green screen with a video as well as photo as per your preference. Here are the steps to put a background on green screen video using Filmora.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

Step1 Download and install [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Launch the application and click on New Project. You should have the green screen video as well as the background replacement video or photo ready with which you want to replace green screen background.
