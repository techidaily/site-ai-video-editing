## **Alternative Way to Edit FlV Video on Windows**

### **1\.** **VSDC**

VSDC is a free video editor along with a lot of advanced features. Cut, combine, trim, crop, and other editing capabilities are available to help you polish your FLV films.

Although it may not look logical, learning the editing capabilities hidden within modular boxes is simple. One noteworthy aspect of VSDC is its ability to produce good visual effects using many trendy video effects, transitions, and filters.

Furthermore, strong chroma keys, color correction, object modification, and other editing tools can be utilized to edit FLV videos. It not only creates excellent FLV videos, but it also supports a wide range of media conversion, allowing you to convert FLV files to various formats and export them without a watermark.

Therefore, follow the below mentioned steps to edit FLV video using VSDC:

Step 1: Install the software on the Windows. Open the application and import the video.

![edit flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-5.jpg)

Step 2: Use cutting and splitting tools to edit the video.

The first icon is a picture of a pair of scissors, which is a cutting tool. It's very useful when you need to cut the beginning or end of a film. Place the cursor exactly where you want to cut, then select "Trim start" or "Trim finish" from the dropdown cutting menu (the small triangle next to the scissors icon).

 ![edit flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-6.jpg)

Cropping is also simple. If you have too much additional space around the scene object recorded, just choose the file you want to trim and select the cropping icon from the "Cutting and Splitting" option. A new window will appear, allowing you to select the region of the scene that should stay.

![edit flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-7.jpg)

Step 3: Apply effects and transitions.

To use one, first select the video file you wish to edit, then go to the Video effects tab and select the effect you want to use. On the timeline, a new tab will appear, containing all of the effects done to the selected object. You can alter the effect's duration and position in time by dragging it with the mouse there. The properties pane on the right-hand side can be used to change other parameters.

Transitions follow the same rule. Place your cursor where you want the transition to begin, then choose a transition from the Video effects dropdown menu and manually adjust the duration.

![edit flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-8.jpg)

Step 4: Save changes and export video.

Make sure your movie appears exactly how you want it to before exporting it. If the video appears choppy, use the red preview button and lower the preview quality. When the PC's resources are insufficient to process the video in real time, lagging can occur. Keep in mind that it has no bearing on the outcome. When you're finished, navigate to the Export project tab and select an export format.

![edit flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-9.jpg)

### **2\.** **Adobe Premiere Pro:**

Professional video editors use Premiere Pro to make everything from YouTube videos to Hollywood films like Mank, a 2021 Oscar candidate. It's also widely utilized in the workflows of designers, animators, and VFX artists, and we can see why after lengthy testing.

We found the software's UI to be simple to use, and it increased our productivity by separating things into various workspaces, such as editing, effects, and audio. When we tested it on both Mac and PC, we discovered that each workspace helps handle a specific activity while minimizing distraction.

Edit the FLV video with Adobe Premiere Pro using the following steps:

Step 1: Import the video and create initial sequence.

![edit flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-10.jpg)

## **Alternative Way to Edit FlV Video on Mac**

### **1\.** **Blender:**

Under the GNU General Public License, Blender is a free, open-source 3D content production program that runs on all major operating systems. Blender is one of the greatest video editors for both Windows and Mac, with advanced features such as modifier-based modeling tools, powerful character animation capabilities, a node-based material, etc.

Because it is developed for professionals, it is tough to use as a beginner. However, it is unrestricted in its use and distribution. In addition, color options are changeable and versatile in the UI.

 In contrast, this free video editor is perfect for semi-pros or those who want to enhance their video editing skills. However, you'll need a lot of time and effort to learn it.

When it comes to video editing software, Apple's Final Cut Pro is one of the industry standards. As a result, it's widely utilized in the television and film industries - at least among Mac users. However, one of the truly convincing reasons to choose it over Premiere Pro is because it is subscription-free: you only pay once.

The software's Magnetic Timeline, grouping tools, a vast selection of effects, solid organizational capabilities, and simple ways to add and edit audio make it a favorite among professional video editors. 360° video, HDR, and powerful color correcting tools are among the other capabilities. It's a strong software with a lot of features.

Follow the steps to edit FLV video using Final Cut Pro:

Step 1: Create Project.

To make a movie in Final Cut Pro, you must first establish a project, which keeps track of your editing selections and the media you utilize.

The first icon is a picture of a pair of scissors, which is a cutting tool. It's very useful when you need to cut the beginning or end of a film.
