So, learning about the colours integrates the basic knowledge of colours in their minds which is to stay with them throughout their lives and utilize them as and when the necessity arises.

**●** **Offers them a means for verbal communication**

When a child learns about colours, they attain a way to describe the world around them. Therefore, it helps in enhancing their method of communication. As a result, it also nurtures and improves their verbal skills to a large extent.

When they know about the colours, it inaugurates a novel hallway of set communicating and knowing about the world around them.

**●** **Offers a way of describing the world**

For the children, this world is an absolutely new place. They have been introduced to this planet quite recently and are exploring and discovering the different aspects. And one of the major aspects of the world is its colour.

So, when they learn about colours, they tend to find a way to describe the environment. It gives them a better understanding of the world and their surrounding as they learn about the colours.

**●** **Learning to classify and sort**

When a child learns about colours, they tend to learn about sorting things and classifying the different objects based on colours. For example, they might be able to separate blue balloons from the red ones from a bunch of balloons in front of them.

Though it is based on colours, they learn the process of classification and sorting, which then gets applied to the other factors in life.

**●** **Learning about safety and health through colours**

The colour red is commonly associated with danger, and the colour danger is associated with safety. And this is generalized across almost all cultures. That is commonly reflected through the traffic lights, where we stop at red colour, get ready to move in the colour tallow and the green colour gives us the signal to move or the message of being out of danger.

Also, the colour blue indicates paleness or bruises in the skin. The colour red indicates rashes or blood. So, the knowledge of colour helps the children learn about safety and health.

**●** **Learn about association**

The above point of learning about health and safety with the help of colours includes learning another important aspect in life, which is association. If a child is unable to understand that the colour red is associated with danger, green is associated with safety and the like; then the knowledge will be of no use.

So, when the child learns about colours and connects them to the different safety and health measures, they automatically learn how to associate one thing with another. This process is crucial and will benefit them throughout their lives.

**●** **Learn about letters**

Eventually, as the child learns about colours, they would spell them as well. So, as a result, they will learn how to spell different colours. That will be a way to practice spelling, and this will result in them learning about letters and words a lot more efficiently and excitingly.

The stage therefore went completely black while the team behind hurriedly changed into new clothing and stage items for the following action.  

Those that seem to take place close together chronologically are edited together, while scenes that occur at separate periods or locales are faded out. These are recognizable features of the film. They alert us to the fact that the tale is moving to a later time or place, either thematically, chronologically, or geographically. In a practical sense, this is the time when the cast and crew switch out the set and clothes. But the fade-to-black marks the end of the scene in a symbolic and narrative sense.
