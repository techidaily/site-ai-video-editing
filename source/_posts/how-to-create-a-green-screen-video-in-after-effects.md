## How To Create A Green Screen Video In After Effects

You'll probably get the finest results in After Effects out of all the editing programs. Working with green screen footage in After Effects can be done in a variety of ways. Utilizing a built-in preset that combines three effects is advised by Adobe. Due to its ability to deliver speedy (and typically excellent) outcomes, this strategy is great for both beginners and specialists. We'll demonstrate how to do easily for you.

Let’s start off!

## 1\. Importing your footage

After you have imported your material into the After Effects project, you should next create a new composition using the footage. In the following stage, you have the option of either adding each plugin one at a time or doing it all at once. You may find them grouped together as Keylight, Key Cleaner, and Advanced Spill Suppressor in the Animation Presets box, which is located under the "Image Utilities" heading.

![import green screen video footage ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/import-green-screen-video-footage-ae.jpg)

## 2\. Remove the green color

After Effects users can get rid of a green screen by going to the "Animation Presets" window, searching for the "Keylight" preset, dragging, and dropping it over the clip, and then shifting their focus to the "Effects Controls" window. Make sure the Screen Colour is set to the color of your screen's background (which, in this case, is green). You may do this with the color selector.

![remove green color from video in ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/remove-green-color-from-video-in-ae.jpg)

## 3\. Clean up the shot

You have no doubt observed that some of the remaining parts do not have the correct keying installed in them. In order to get rid of them, you need to put the view into the Combined Matte mode and turn the Screen Gain up a notch.

Because everything that is not transparent is turned white by Combined Matte, any remaining debris can be seen very clearly after it has been applied. After you have finished cleaning the frame, you should change the view to Intermediate Result. Your footage may become contaminated with artifacts if the Final Result view is inadvertently switched on.

![clean up green screen shot ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/clean-up-green-screen-shot-ae.jpg)

You can go to the "Screen Matte" area if you feel like the frame still needs more tweaking after you've applied the previous ones. You can accomplish that with the assistance of Clip Black and Clip White. Feel free to turn the Clip Black dial all the way to the right and turn the Clip White dial to the left. You can also adjust the other settings, if necessary, but based on my observations, everything should be working properly at this point.

## The Bottom Line

After completing this lesson, you should have a better understanding of what a chroma key is, how to get rid of a green screen in After Effects, and how to adjust some settings if something goes wrong. Keep in mind that if the footage is not captured properly, you will not be able to successfully key out the green screen in the final video. Extra caution should be taken with the lights, and spills should be avoided at all costs!

## Steps to Create Gold Text Effects After Effects

Follow these steps to create a gold text effect in your After Effects video project;

Step1Start by creating an environment. To do that just right-click and choose “New Comp” and click “OK” to create one.

Step2Then we need to add fractal noise. To do that, click on “Effects and Presets” and type in “fractal” to choose “Fractal Noise.” You can double-click on it or drag it to the comp.

Step3Once this is done, you will need to do a little bit of housekeeping on the contrast and brightness. Increase the “Contrast” and reduce the “Brightness.”

Then go to the “Sub Settings” and reduce the “Sub Influence” down to zero.

Go to “Transform Option” and decrease the scale just a little bit. Then increase the “Scale Height” just a little.

Step4The next step is to add color to the scene. To do that, right-click on the layer and choose “New > Solid.” Select the gold color and click “OK.” Do the same with the second layer.

Step5Now you want to blend both colors by choosing a blending mode. Hold the “Shift” key and “hyphen” or “=” sign on the keyboard and choose “Overlay.”

Step6To make the color stronger, go to “Layer > Solid Settings” and choose a color.

Step7Go back to “Comp 3.” Right-click on it and select “New > Light” to add a new point of light.

Step8Go back to the project panel to click on “Comp 4” to add the environment. Right-click on the Comp 4 layer and make it an environment layer.

Step9In the options that appear, set “Appears in Reflections” to “Only” and you can then increase and decrease the color saturation until you have the desired result.

## Alternative Way to Create Video Gold

Adobe After Effects is a very good video editor, but one of the things that can make it inaccessible to many users is that it can be very difficult to use. Thankfully, there is another very effective video editor that you can use to create gold text that is much easier to use.

This is the [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), one of the best video editors in the market. Before we look at how you can use Filmora to create the perfect gold metal texture on your text, let's first look at some of its main features;

* You can use Filmora to edit videos at a very high resolution including 4K videos
* It can be used to remove the background and noise from the video very easily
* You can edit both video and audio in the same project
* Up to 5 text tracks and 10 music tracks can be added to the same timeline and the same project
* It is very easy to use with a simple and intuitive user interface

Here's how to use Filmora to create a gold metal texture for your text;

##### Step1Install Wondershare Filmora on your Computer

Download the [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) setup file to your computer and double-click on it to start installing the program to your computer.

Open the program once the installation is complete.

##### Step2Create a New Project

If you are starting from the beginning, you may need to create a new project.

To do that, click on “File > New Project” in the menu bar to start a new project.

If there was a project that you were already working on, click on “Open Project” on the main window and then click “File > Open Project” or “File > Open Recent” in the menu bar.

##### Step3Add A Title to the Timeline

To add a gold texture effect to a title on your video, we will first of all need to add a title to the project.

To do that, go click on the “Titles” tab at the top and drag one of the default titles to the timeline.

Once it is in the timeline, double-click on the title and edit it. Type in anything you want to appear in the title.

![add title to timeline gold effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/add-title-to-timeline-gold-effect.jpg)

Select the font that you want to use and choose a specific font size to use. These are all your preferences and will depend on your project.

Move the title to the second track in the timeline as you get ready to begin adding the colors.

##### Step4Start Adding Colors

Go to “Media” at the top and click on “Sample Colors.” Drag the black color image to the track directly below the title timeline.

![start adding colors gold effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/start-adding-colors-gold-effect.jpg)

Then take a snapshot of this newly created image by clicking on the “camera” icon next to the playhead.

Change the Font of the Title to something else more elegant like “Montez” and take another snapshot by clicking on the same camera icon.

![change the font gold effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/change-the-font-gold-effect.jpg)

##### Step5Add the Gold Effect

Delete everything from the timeline. Don't worry you took a photo of all the text layers and the effects added to each.

You will then need to find an image of a gold background. You can find these on any good background image site. Download a good clear image and upload it into Filmora.

Now drag and drop the gold background image to the second track in the timeline. Double click on the background image.

Select “Compositing” and then in the “Blending Mode” drop-down menu, choose “Darken.” Click OK.”

![blending mode composite gold effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/blending-mode-composite-gold-effect.jpg)

Hide the first layer in the timeline and select the gold background image layer. Click on “Animation” and then select “Customize.”

To create the customized effect that we need, click on the image and drag it from the right to the left side.

![customize animation gold effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/customize-animation-gold-effect.jpg)

## 4 Methods to Resize a WebM File

People resize videos for many reasons, the most common one being to reduce file size. Others might be to meet a specification, or for compatibility. When you resize a video file, you reduce its file size considerably- making it load faster on devices, reduce processing time, and save a lot of space. Most people prefer watching videos that are smaller in size compared to larger ones, that’s why some social media sites like Instagram, Tiktok, etc have preferred video resolutions, so if you are a user on these sites you might want to resize your video to fit.

The biggest concern most people have about resizing videos is whether it will retain its quality, another concern is that you don’t want to crop out your video while resizing. If the format of the video is mp4, wmv, avi, etc which usually have very large size, resizing it might be a bit of a problem because the video quality will reduce a lot, but if it’s a WebM video file, you can still achieve a good video quality even after multiple compression or changing its resolution, that’s because its codecs- VP8 and VP9 were designed specifically for that, and it’s supported by all browsers.

In the course of this article, we’re assuming you already have a WebM video and you want to resize it, and still maintain its quality so you can upload on your favourite websites without any hassles. We have handpicked some proven methods to help you with that, let’s see them:

## Method 1: Resize WebM file with Wondershare Filmora

For video resizing, Filmora offers you a couple of options: First you have an option of changing the resolution just before you export your video; you also have the option of cropping your videos to your preferred size and cutting out redundant parts of your videos to save space; but the third option is what we’ll show you in this guide, because we imagine you already have your video exported and you just want to resize. You can easily do that by changing the aspect ratio and we’ll show you in a few steps:
