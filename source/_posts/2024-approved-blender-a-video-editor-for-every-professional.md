## Learn How to Make a Gaming Montage - Guide & Tips

The popularity of gaming montage is growing every day in today's pop culture. There are currently more than 2.5 billion gamers, and most of them love watching gaming video content on YouTube. Whether people use a montage to parody gaming montages themselves or show off their skills, the effort and time put into them create impressive results.

We will explain how to create gaming montages and give you some tips that you might want to keep in mind to make epic videos.

## How to Make a Gaming Montage

You have several options when it comes to creating gaming montages. You can include a random cut of great scenes, a mixture of the highlighted moments you found thrilling and would like to share with other gamers. In other cases, you'll have to think of an engaging story in advance, then base your gameplay on this story.

Essentially, the workflow will be slightly different for these two scenarios. It's much easier with the random cut type, especially when using a reliable video editor. Editing montages is as exciting as playing the game.

With that in mind, here is how to make a gaming montage.

### 1) Decide Your Montage Story/Type

Deciding your montage type beforehand helps clear your mind and create an epic gaming montage that will keep viewers watching. It allows you to choose the relevant video clips for your gaming montage.

Choose the topic of the video and decide the length of each clip and the sequence of the clips. Be sure to put the most epic or funny clips in the last section of your video. And this will make your viewers watch the video until the end.

### 2) Record Your Gameplay Footage

The methods to capture the gameplay varies depending on the platform where the game is. The most important thing you have to keep in mind is to ensure your recorder supports Replay Buffer; this will allow you to record scenes that occurred minutes or seconds ago.

That means you do not need to record the gameplay the whole time and burn your hardware. Instead, you'll capture the moment after interesting things occur.

Game consoles like PS4 allow you to record the video natively for a maximum of one hour with the gamepad. A capture card lets you record it longer than 60 minutes.

Once you've all the clips you want on your PC, head over to <https://filmora.wondershare.net/filmora-video-editor.html> and download Filmora and install the software on your computer. This program allows you to edit your video clips and add cool effects that will make viewers keep watching.

### 3) Import You Videos to Media Library

You only have to import the videos to Filmora's media library and then drag and drop them into the timeline, where you can start making the edits.

By right-clicking on the clip in your timeline, you'll see the options to zoom, speed, change, split, or trim your videos. You can also add sound effects by going to the Audio Tab.

### 4) Choose Background Music for Your Montage

Music will help make your gaming montage engaging. Make sure you use a license-free track if you plan to post it on social media.

Using copyrighted music tracks and uploading the video on social media platforms can lead to video strikes. Luckily, Filmora has loads of non-copyrighted music tracks.

Navigate to Stock Media, where you'll find non-copyrighted music on Pixabay, and choose the one you prefer.

## Useful Tips for Making a Gaming Montage

Making gaming montages can help you build a large online community if you do the right thing. When making a gaming montage, there are a few tips that you should keep in mind. They include:

### 1\. Apply Velocity Effects

Adding velocity effects to your montage will help get the attention of viewers. You can couple the transition between scenes with a speed ramping effect.

Include slow motion where there is a gunshot or other big gaming moment. You can then speed up things to quickly move into another scene. You can create these velocity effects in Filmora and make it smooth.

### 2\. Avoid Game Loading Scenes

Do not include game loading scenes or any unnecessary clips in the gaming montage. Your audience does not have the time to wait for the scenes to load because they want to see action fast.

### 3\. Sync Gunshot with Music Beat

Try to match gunshot sounds with beats and rhythms in shooter video games. The beats of the music and the soothing sync of gunshots will catch viewers' attention and your video will become popular among gamers.

### 4\. Add Creative Transitions

You can spice up your gaming montage by adding transitions, especially when you have loads of clips for the montage. But avoid overusing it, as you could confuse your audience with a range of dazzling and glaring transitions.

### 5\. Color Grade the Video for the Mood

Use color grading to your advantage, as it can set the mood of your viewers. You can decide to make some scenes black and white to catch the viewersâ attention.

### 6\. Add Video Vignettes for Special Occasions

You can add dark edges around the corners of your video to highlight action or create a certain mood. For gameplay based on a story, use vignetting to add a sense of nostalgia or as a flashback that shows viewers the past.

You can use Filmora to apply the vignetting effect by heading to Advanced Color Tuning, then clicking the Vignette option. You can then add the vignette effect to the video. Additionally, you can adjust the vignette's exposure, feather, roundness, size, and highlights.

## Best Gaming Montage for Studying

Here are three gaming montages that are good for studying.

### 1\. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare

Uploaded by DemixB, the Call of Duty Game Montage uses Jacques Offenbach's Can Can Music track. It's a happy song that has a tempo of 81 BPM. The track has average danceable energy, and it's somewhat danceable.

DemixB set the gunshot in the montage video to the music tune. The track builds up to the climax when the gunshot echoes with the attention-grabbing orchestral explosions.

ShutteR used a slow-motion to highlight action in each scene, then speeds up again when he wants to fast out into the next scene.; this makes the video more engaging to keep viewers glued to their screens.

### 3\. NEVERMORE \[CS: GO\]

NEVERMORE \[CS: GO\] was uploaded by Fuze on his YouTube channel, and it has creative gameplay. The gaming montage is based on a story. He did the project with Apel, an artist who designed the Fever Dream series skins in the video.

The basic idea of this gaming montage was that the main game character is a corrupted policeman with purple glowing eyes because he's not human.

When the edits begin, the shape of the main character will shift from CS: GO CT models and turn into his real corrupt CT shape. So that's why his name keeps changing. You can get his real identity by pausing some of the frames and looking at the "Killfeed."

![Best Gaming Montage Example - NEVERMORE](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/gaming-montage-6.png)

Is APNG superior to GIF? APNG files are smaller and have more outstanding quality than GIF files. However, GIF is more compatible than APNG. Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome, and Opera support APNG, while practically all online browsers support GIF.

**Step 5: Compress**

The compression rate is set to "Best" by default, but the Save Options box contains a few extras to check if you want a bit more control over the compression of your file. The file size will be determined by changing the compression rate; the higher the value, the less compression will be utilized when saving your image.

![Compressed](https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/2018-08-21_16h58_41.png?trim=1,1&bg-color=000&pad=1,1)

The GIF image format is a bitmap image format that supports up to 8 bits per pixel. APNG (Animated Portable Network Graphics) is a format for animated images that supports 24 bits per pixel and 8 bits of transparency, which is not available in GIFs. Backward compatibility with non-animated PNG files is also maintained.

Because the initial frame of an APNG file saves as a regular PNG stream, it can display by most conventional PNG decoders. Extra chunks can hold frame speed data and different animation frames (as provided by the original PNG specification).

The GIF image format is a bitmap image format that supports up to 8 bits per pixel. APNG (Animated Portable Network Graphics) is a format for animated images that supports 24 bits per pixel and 8 bits of transparency, which is not available in GIFs. Backward compatibility with non-animated PNG files is also maintained.

Because the initial frame of an APNG file saves as a regular PNG stream, it can display by most conventional PNG decoders. Extra chunks can hold frame speed data and different animation frames (as provided by the original PNG specification).

Is APNG superior to GIF? APNG files are smaller and have more outstanding quality than GIF files. However, GIF is more compatible than APNG. Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome, and Opera support APNG, while practically all online browsers support GIF.

## Part 2\. How to Convert a GIF to APNG

Follow the 3 simple steps to **convert GIF to animated PNG**

**Step 1**: Choose Files

Select several files on your computer using the "Choose Files" button or the dropdown menu to select an online file from a URL, Google Drive, or Dropbox. The file size of an image can be up to 200 megabytes. You can use a file analyzer to gain detailed information about a source image, including its size, resolution, quality, and transparent color.

![Choose file](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/online-gif-to-apng-converter-9.jpg)

**Step 2**: Choose Image Format

Determine the image format, quality, and size you want to use. You choose to use the original image size or select "Change width and height" and enter a custom image size. 1920x1080 is an example of a \[width\]x\[height\] format. Only a few image formats support the picture quality choice, such as JPG, WEBP, or AVIF. The value ranges from 1 (lowest picture quality and highest compression) to 100 (highest image quality and lowest compression) (best quality but least effective compression). If this field is left blank, the converter will use the estimated quality of your input image if found; otherwise, 92 by default. JPG, PNG, TIFF, GIF, HEIC, BMP, PS, PSD, WEBP, TGA, DDS, EXR, J2K, PNM, or SVG are examples of target image formats.

**Step 3**: Click on Convert Now

Click the "Convert Now" option to begin the batch conversion. If one server fails, it will automatically attempt another; please be patient while converting. The resultant files will be in the "Conversion Results" section. Click the icon to display the QR code for the file or save it to an online storage like Google Drive or Dropbox.

## Part 3\. FAQ

### 1\. What Is APNG (Animated Portable Network Graphics )

The .apng (Animated Portable Network Graphics) extension is an unofficial extension to the Portable Network Graphics format (PNG ). It is a series of frames (a PNG image) that represent an animation sequence, producing a visual effect comparable to a GIF. APNG files support 24-bit pictures with 8-bit transparency. You can convert non-animated GIF files to APNG format. APNG files have the same.png extension as PNG files and can be opened by software like Mozilla Firefox, Chrome with APNG compatibility, and iOS 10's iMessage apps.

### 2\. How to Create APNG File?

**Step 1: Select Image**

Click File > Open to bring up the photo you wish to convert to PNG.

![Select image](https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/2018-08-16_11h20_31.png?trim=1,1&bg-color=000&pad=1,1)

**Step 2: Click Open**

Click "Open" when you've navigated to your picture.

![Click Open](https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/2018-08-16_11h21_15.png?trim=1,1&bg-color=000&pad=1,1)

**Step 3: Go to Save As**

After you've opened the file, go to File > Save As.

![Go to Save As](https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/2018-08-16_10h52_33.png?trim=1,1&bg-color=000&pad=1,1)

**Step 4: Save**

Make sure PNG is selected from the drop-down list of formats in the following box, then click "Save."

![Save ](https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/2018-08-21_16h58_07.png?trim=1,1&bg-color=000&pad=1,1)

**Step 5: Compress**

The compression rate is set to "Best" by default, but the Save Options box contains a few extras to check if you want a bit more control over the compression of your file. The file size will be determined by changing the compression rate; the higher the value, the less compression will be utilized when saving your image.

![Compressed](https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/2018-08-21_16h58_41.png?trim=1,1&bg-color=000&pad=1,1)

### 3\. How Do I Save Something as APNG?

Here are the steps to take when saving an image as APNG

**Step 1: Open Paint**

Open an image-editing program on your computer, such as Paint for Windows or Paintbrush for Mac. Simply double-click the software's icon on your desktop, or choose it from your applications list.

**Step 2: Go to saved Images**

Open the image you already saved. Navigate to the window where you saved the image. Click-hold it, drag it, and drop it onto the editor to display the image.

**Step 3: Resize Image**

Make changes to the image. You can resize or rescale the image before saving it as a PNG file, and you can even add text using your software's Text tool. This is, however, wholly optional.

**Step 4: Choose Save as**

PNG is the top format for saving images. Choose "Save as" from the "File" menu in the editor's upper left corner.

In the File Name window, provide the name you want for the file.

Under the File Name field, click the "Save as type" drop-down option to see all of the image's possible formats.

Click "Save" after selecting "PNG." The file will be saved as a PNG file in the same directory as the original.
