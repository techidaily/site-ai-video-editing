This is when you can depend on PowerPoint to erase the background of a photo without any hassle. Make sure you have PowerPoint 2010 or a later version installed before beginning. Because the earlier Microsoft PowerPoint versions don’t have a background removal feature.

Step 1: Open the image in a new tab

If there is anything that a designer hates in his precious photo, then it’s the background. It hides and distracts from the main subject at hand. You can use various photo editing tools to remove the background from PNG images or JPG. However, they may not do the job as easily as you are thinking.

Yes, we know that you may be wondering about Adobe Photoshop now. It can be used for removing the background too but are you ready to pay for it? No, right? This is when you can depend on PowerPoint to erase the background of a photo without any hassle. Make sure you have PowerPoint 2010 or a later version installed before beginning. Because the earlier Microsoft PowerPoint versions don’t have a background removal feature.

Step 1: Open the image in a new tab

**●** So, here are the points we can summarize through this article.

**●** The first and best thing is that you don't need to have any technical knowledge to make gifs to share with all your friends and have fun. You can easily make a gif online and add all sorts of animations and filters that you like.

**●** You don't need to have a PC either, you can easily use Gif generators that are available online, and they will be able to make a perfect gif for yourself on your phone itself.

**●** Using and making perfect gifs is an art, and you need to take care of the video you choose, time, lengths, the expression, and other filters while you make a gif online.
