## The 6 Key Features of Flixpress

Listed below are the features that make Flixpress stand out among the competitors.

### 1\. HD Downloads

It is an established fact that the quality of the video is the first factor for the audience to judge, and having a bad quality video uploaded to a YouTube channel that you wish to grow is not really a wise choice.

Flixpress offers you high-definition downloads that are perfect for viewing your video on the web and broadcasting it on television.

### 2\. Customizable Templates

Having templates that can be customized as per your needs really makes the task easier. Flixpress offers a variety of templates that give you the option to enter text in some fields. This text is then beautifully rendered out in the final edited video.

### 3\. Audio Tools

Adding the right audio can leave a significant impact on the overall aesthetic and impression of the video. It is perhaps one of the prime factors that decides whether the audio is edited well or not.

That said, Flixpress allows you to incorporate any custom audio file into the video. You will just be required to upload that audio in mp3 format, and that’s all. Other than that, you can add several sound elements as well.

### 4\. Multiple Formats

If you’re someone who owns a Mac operating system and wishes to export the video in a MOV format, let us tell you that Flixpress can transcode the video to match your needs. However, along with the MOV format, you also have the option to export the video in the standard MP4 format or a WMV format as well.

### 5\. Stock Video Library

Yes, you read that right. Flixpress is dedicated to offering you a comprehensive and affordable video product solution by providing a stock video library which means you can bid farewell to expensive stock footage sites.

It is to be noted that the team at Flixpress is fully committed to growing the Copyright-Free footage and background library, and the size of the library grows with the passing time.

### 6\. Preview

Being one of the spotlight features of Flixpress, this one really makes it stand out. With this feature, you won’t have to wonder what your video would look like as you can render a free watermarked preview. If you’re working for someone, you can send this preview to your client or boss for approval and tweak data before the final render.

Other than that, these previews can also be used as templates if you wish to duplicate the same video with variable data.

## What are the downsides of Flixpress?

While the F**lixpress intro maker** is a great choice for making intro videos, it may miss out on a few features. Other than that, individuals who have used Flixpress complained about the bad customer service that they offered, even to those who had signed up for the membership. Now, that can be quite frustrating, right?

We found a few major missing in Flixpress.

* The number of templates is limited.
* The content is rarely updated.
* The customer service they offered is poor. People can't get help with their problems, especially when those who sign up for membership want to cancel their subscription.

What if we were to tell you that there is an even better and professional tool that Flixpress?

## The 6 Key Features of Flixpress

Listed below are the features that make Flixpress stand out among the competitors.

### 1\. HD Downloads

It is an established fact that the quality of the video is the first factor for the audience to judge, and having a bad quality video uploaded to a YouTube channel that you wish to grow is not really a wise choice.

Flixpress offers you high-definition downloads that are perfect for viewing your video on the web and broadcasting it on television.

### 2\. Customizable Templates

Having templates that can be customized as per your needs really makes the task easier. Flixpress offers a variety of templates that give you the option to enter text in some fields. This text is then beautifully rendered out in the final edited video.

### 3\. Audio Tools

Adding the right audio can leave a significant impact on the overall aesthetic and impression of the video. It is perhaps one of the prime factors that decides whether the audio is edited well or not.

That said, Flixpress allows you to incorporate any custom audio file into the video. You will just be required to upload that audio in mp3 format, and that’s all. Other than that, you can add several sound elements as well.

### 4\. Multiple Formats

If you’re someone who owns a Mac operating system and wishes to export the video in a MOV format, let us tell you that Flixpress can transcode the video to match your needs. However, along with the MOV format, you also have the option to export the video in the standard MP4 format or a WMV format as well.

### 5\. Stock Video Library

Yes, you read that right. Flixpress is dedicated to offering you a comprehensive and affordable video product solution by providing a stock video library which means you can bid farewell to expensive stock footage sites.

It is to be noted that the team at Flixpress is fully committed to growing the Copyright-Free footage and background library, and the size of the library grows with the passing time.

### 6\. Preview

Being one of the spotlight features of Flixpress, this one really makes it stand out. With this feature, you won’t have to wonder what your video would look like as you can render a free watermarked preview. If you’re working for someone, you can send this preview to your client or boss for approval and tweak data before the final render.

Other than that, these previews can also be used as templates if you wish to duplicate the same video with variable data.

## How to Make Intro Video With Flixpress?

##### Step4 Sorting and Filtering the Templates

When you’re on the main page, all the templates will be visible to you, and these will include paid ones. If you've not bought a paid subscription, you will have to sort out the **flixpress free templates**, which can be done in two ways.

![upload image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/create-intro-video-with-flixpress-5.jpg)

##### Step7 Customize Text, Add Audio, Change Resolution & Create Preview

Even though the image subtitle will be made, you will still have the option to swap the image if you change your mind. Other than that, select the main title of the intro video and the color of the text as well.

Moreover, you can add audio as per your need and preference, and you can choose a resolution for the intro video too.

Once everything is done, create the preview to have a final look before rendering it.

## What are the downsides of Flixpress?

While the F**lixpress intro maker** is a great choice for making intro videos, it may miss out on a few features.

Now, that can be quite frustrating, right?

We found a few major missing in Flixpress.
