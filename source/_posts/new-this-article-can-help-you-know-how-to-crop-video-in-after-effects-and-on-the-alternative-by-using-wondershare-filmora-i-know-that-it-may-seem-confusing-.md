## This Article Can Help You Know How to Crop Video in After Effects and on the Alternative by Using Wondershare Filmora. I Know that It May Seem Confusing to Compare These Two at First. But, I’ll Provide an Explanation to Get the Cropped Video that You Want

Cropping a video is part of the process of video edting. Not all video editing software can be obtained freely. There are some that you need to spend to get the professional output that you aim for. After Effects,a member of the Adobe tools that exist can enhance your videos to another level. This article can help you know how to crop video in After Effects and on the alternative by using Wondershare Filmora. I know that it may seem confusing to compare these two at first. But, I’ll provide an explanation to get the cropped video that you want.

## Method 1: Cropping a Video using After Effects

After Effects is a professional motion graphics tool that can create outputs that are beyond the limits of reality. Like the other Adobe tools, this comes with a subscription fee to be able to maximize this product. But, is the price worth the risk? The “ Adobe” brand is known for its quality applications and customer’s satisfaction.

Let’s start with using this tool. The situation is that you want to crop your video using Adobe After Effects but you don’t know how to start. Search for the application on your computer. Launch it, then click the **New Project**. If you have files from your storage then select the **New Composition Footage.**

![crop-vidoe-in-ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-vidoe-in-ae-1.jpg)

Check if the video is already in the interface. Find the **Magnifying** tab and zoom out the video into 50%. After that, click the **Grid** icon and **Proportional Grid**.

![crop-vidoe-in-ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-vidoe-in-ae-2.jpg)

Click the **Square** icon, it is located beside the **Pencil** icon at the top section. The shape’s purpose is to crop the video section that you want to remain. If you’re done cutting then you should unclick the **Proportiona**l grid, and the video’s magnification should be 100%. Afterwards, you can check the pixel aspect ratio correction in the After Effects. You need to go through the video before saving your project. This is to avoid unnecessary errors that will make the process troublesome.

![crop-vidoe-in-ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-vidoe-in-ae-3.jpg)

Already satisfied with the cropped video? Then, select **File,** **Export** and finally **Add to Render Queue.** Check on the **Render Settings** (located bottom of the interface) to ensure high quality output. Following that, hit the **Output To** part and decide the destination and folder where you want it to be.

![crop-vidoe-in-ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-vidoe-in-ae-4.jpg)

Watch your cropped video and go ahead and repeat this with your other videos. After practicing this process many times, this will come to you as easy. If you get lost while following the instructions go back to this guide until it becomes a part of your memory.

Congratulations on making your first cropped video using After Effects! What was your experience while following through the guide? I hope that the information presented here is easy to understand and implement.

Even though it is not a free application, I hope you have experienced the advantages of using this compared to other tools. Did it come as a surprise for you that you can crop a video not just in Adobe Premiere but also in After Effects as well?

I hope that fear will not hinder you from trying this tool to crop your videos.

## Method 2: Cropping a Video using Wondershare Filmora

If you didn’t know there is also an awesome video editing software called Wondershare [Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) .

You can try it by searching the internet and downloading it on your computer. If simplicity is your priority then this may suit you perfectly. If you’re still hesitant then read the reviews and watch how others are using it.

There is no need to worry if you have a tight budget as downloading this would be free. You just need to go to the official site. Do not be scared of trying with something unfamiliar. I will guide you with using it and utilizing it to get the result that you dream of.

Wondershare Filmora just like the others that exist are video editors that will turn your raw videos into the vision that you like. Thanks to these applications, the gruesome process of manually cutting it by hand and permanently altering the footage are gone. You can make how many changes that you want without damaging the original video.

![crop-vidoe-in-ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-vidoe-in-ae-5.png)

Preparation is a must especially if you have multiple videos on your computer. A good tip would be renaming them by the sequence you plan to have. And, you could also place them in folders to avoid repetition and double copies. Once you’re done, you can drag and drop your video or

click the **Import.**

![crop-vidoe-in-ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-vidoe-in-ae-6.png)

Go ahead and select the video clip that you want to crop. Then, click the **Crop** tool and choose if you want the **Crop** or **Pan & Zoom.** Yes, you have options on what kind of crop you want it to be.

![crop-vidoe-in-ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-vidoe-in-ae-7.png)

An alternative way is by right clicking the video clip .Under the **Video** tab you can select the **Crop and Zoom** or **Crop to Fit** then adjust to your preferred ratio.

![crop-vidoe-in-ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-vidoe-in-ae-8.png)

You can review the cropped video to think through if this is the portion that you want to be included. Unlike other applications, you can go back and adjust it to your liking.

If you’re finally satisfied then you can export it. Choose the output format and you can also rename the file. Clicking the settings button will offer you additional options of your video output.

After all that, you have the cropped video that you can either upload or repurpose in another content. Did you enjoy the process of cropping it in Wondershare Filmora?

Don’t you think that the subscription is worth it? There is a trial that you could check out to test its capabilities and awesomeness.

## The Bottom Line

You are once again done with the process of checking out these two applications. After Effects and Wondershare Filmora have a different process when it comes to cropping videos. I hope that you had a clearer understanding on which of these two would suit your video editing needs. The interface also could change your mind depending if you want simplicity or a challenge. Price is also a factor that can affect your willingness to use these applications. But, this guide clearly shows you that it is worth paying for.

What are your thoughts on both of these tools? Did you find this information to be helpful?

**#1\. DJI Air 2S:** Among the best options for most people.

![dji air 2s](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/dji-air-2s.jpg)

The DJI's new Air 2S is our top pick. It finds the ideal compromise in terms of size, weight, picture quality, intelligent features, and price. The camera on the Air 2S isn't as nice as the Mavic 2 Pro's, which has a variable aperture for more flexible shooting in sunny conditions and includes neutral density filters to help make up for it.

1.3 pounds might not seem like much, but the Air 2S is a force to be reckoned with- it's durable enough to fly in light winds and can stay up for 30 minutes! Plus, the new collision-avoidance system will keep you safe even when there are trees around, and the 1 inch 20 mp sensor captures amazing 5K video or still photos.

**#2\. Skydio 2+ Drone:** If you want your flights to be handled automatically.

![skydio 2 drone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/skydio-2-drone.jpg)

The Skydio 2+ has the best collision-avoidance system, far outperforming any other drone on the market. If you want a drone that can follow your mountain bike off-road or quickly maneuver through obstacles without your help, this is it. Its 27-minute flight time and 6-mile range make it restrictions for some people, but plenty for most. The 1/2.3-inch sensor on this camera is good enough for 4K footage at 60 frames per second, but it's not as great as the 1-inch sensor in the Air 2S and Evo Lite+. D-log support is also absent, so video professionals might want to keep that in mind.

However, if you can live without D-log and don't mind the slower sensor, this drone is capable of flying in places where other drones can't. For certain applications, a smaller sensor may be preferable to having a great one.

**#3\. DJI Mini 3 Pro:** The Best Ultralight Drone for Most People

![dji mini 3 pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/dji-mini-3-pro.jpg)

The DJI Mavic Mini 3 Pro is the third version of the name, and it has been greatly improved from its original state. It features a 4K/60p footage with 1/1.3" sensor as well capture 12.1 megapixel RAW photographs. The Mini 3 Pro also has a 48-megapixel mode that improves image quality, but loses some camera functions. A faster F/1.7 lens is now on the front of the drone, and it also incorporates three-direction obstacle avoidance and a gimbal that allows for vertical shooting--all while weighing in at less than 250 grams. This number is important because, in many areas, a drone under 250 grams does not need to be registered (however, you should always check your local laws).

I was ecstatic about the performance of the Mini 3 Pro. It can fly in an impressive 45 minutes when using its extended battery--which is a dramatic improvement from the 32 minutes I got with the standard battery. Not to mention, it's delightful to fly because it maneuvers so effortlessly in even high winds. The only issue I have with it is that its price has risen since DJI released Mini 2; however, they still sell both models.

**#4\. DJI Mini 2:** Most Affordable Drone

![dji mini 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/dji-mini-2.jpg)

The Mavic Air 2S has advanced collision-avoidance tech, but at a high cost. Even the new Mini 3 Pro sells for $750\. If budget is more important to you than features, DJI's Mini 2 would be your best bet. It flies compared to its larger siblings, though wind gusts that wouldn't bother bigger drones like the Mavic 2 Pro will ground the Mini. The lack of collision-avoidance sensors makes it better suited for experienced pilots.

Even with those minor drawbacks, the Mini 2 is still a great beginner drone. It's enjoyable to fly, captures 4K video footage, and can be stored in smaller spaces than many smartphones. And that last part is essential because the best drones are ones that you'll actually bring with you instead of leaving at home. The Mini 2 only weighs 249 grams so it's easy to transport, and you don't even need to register it with the Federal Aviation Administration

**#5\. DJI Mavic 3:** The Most Luxurious Drone

![dji mavic 3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/dji-mavic-3.jpg)

The DJI Mavic 3 Pro is a cut above the rest. It's the finest drone on the market right now. The new 20-megapixel Four Thirds sensor produces outstanding image and video quality, and 45 miles per hour mobility allows you to follow and track objects without missing a beat.

If you're willing to spend the money, this drone is definitely worth it. It has a 45-minute flying time and can avoid obstacles in all directions. The Cine model also supports Pro Res video and comes with 1TB of storage space- perfect for filmmakers or anyone who wants to capture high-quality footage.

**#6\. Autel Evo Lite+:** Great for Long Flights

![autel evo lite](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/autel-evo-lite.jpg)

The Evo Lite+ is your best bet if you want to stay airborne as long as possible. Its massive battery provides a 40-minute flight duration, and the additional weight makes it more stable in the wind (though not by much). The Evo Lite+ features a fantastic camera with variable aperture controls, a 1-inch sensor, and night mode for better low-light photos.

The control does resemble an Xbox controller, which is nice, but it lacks the storage capacity for detachable joysticks that you get with DJI drones. It's still perfectly functional, and Autel's software will be familiar to anyone who has used a DJI drone.

## Some Final Suggestions

Drones can be used for a variety of purposes, from shooting landscapes and cityscapes to capturing footage of sporting events or outdoor activities. They can also be used for wedding videos, real estate videos, and other types of commercial work. And if you're just looking for some fun footage to add to your home movies, drones are the perfect way to do it.

Of course, not all drones are created equal. If you're looking for a drone that can shoot high-quality video on a budget, there are a few things you need to keep in mind.

* First, make sure the drone has a high-resolution camera.
* Second, make sure the drone has a long battery life so that you can get plenty of shots without having to recharge.
* Third, make sure the drone is lightweight and easy to control so that you can get the perfect shot every time.

So, what's the best drone for you? It depends on your budget and your needs. If you want a high-quality camera that can shoot in low light, the DJI Mavic 3 Pro is a perfect choice. If you're looking for a long-flight drone, the Autel Evo Lite+ is a great option. And if you're just starting out, the DJI Mini 2 is an affordable and easy-to-use drone that anyone can fly. With that said, happy flying!
