FLV is basically used to publish or distribute videos on the Internet. Many social platforms and web pages (such as youtube, Hulu, e.t.c.) use .flv files as it provide high-quality synchronized audio and video in compact file size. It was mostly used for embedded videos on these platforms. It is compatible with most browsers and devices even with older phones and computers.

**How to play .FLV files?**

To play .flv files a flash player is required. Which is pre-installed in almost most of the computers and browsers, if that's not the case. Then you need a good video player which supports .flv format. Therefore VLC media prayer is a good choice. It is quite easy to use and has some useful features like Speed, Adding subtitles, Audio sync, e.t.c.

If you don't want to stick with the .flv format for long enough and want to switch over to a more convenient format then you can try these converters.

Once the video editor has loaded, go to the Media tab's Import menu and select Import a Media Folder. Navigate to the folder containing the materials for your slideshow, select it with a click, then hit OK to import it into your project.

 **Step 2**: Position the Media Files on the Timeline

 Simply select a file to be added to the timeline and drag and drop it to the preferred location. Repeat this method for all of the images you'd like to include in your slideshow, then organise them in the same order as they'll appear in the presentation.

**Step 3**: Avoid Hard Cuts Between Slides by Using Transitions

A hard cut between two photographs can break the flow of your slideshow, but you can simply correct this by transitioning gently from one slide to the next.

If you double-click a transition after it's been added to the timeline, you'll be sent to the Transition Setting Window, where you can define the default duration for all transitions you add to a slideshow and choose your preferred transition mode.

Hundreds of motion graphics templates are available in the Elements tab, which you can rapidly add to the timeline.

**Step 6**: Creating Slideshow Soundtracks and Recording Voiceovers

Select the Record Voiceover tool from the Record drop-down menu on the Media tab. When the Record Audio window appears on the screen, select the microphone you'll use to record the narration and press the Record button.

You may use Filmora's large library of music and sound effects for free. Simply navigate to the Audio tab and browse the subcategories of Electronic, Young & Bright, and Rock until you select the perfect song for the slideshow's soundtrack.

**Step 7**: Exporting Slideshows from Filmora

The final step in the process of creating a slideshow in Filmora is to export the project. Click on the **Export** button and wait for the **Export window** to appear on the screen. You can then select the output file format, set a preferred frame rate or resolution for your slideshow, or export

Let your imagination run wild with editing tools that are both powerful and easy to use.

**Step 1**: Uploading Images and Videos to Filmora

Once the video editor has loaded, go to the Media tab's Import menu and select Import a Media Folder. Navigate to the folder containing the materials for your slideshow, select it with a click, then hit OK to import it into your project.

 **Step 2**: Position the Media Files on the Timeline

 Simply select a file to be added to the timeline and drag and drop it to the preferred location. Repeat this method for all of the images you'd like to include in your slideshow, then organise them in the same order as they'll appear in the presentation.

**Step 3**: Avoid Hard Cuts Between Slides by Using Transitions

A hard cut between two photographs can break the flow of your slideshow, but you can simply correct this by transitioning gently from one slide to the next.

If you double-click a transition after it's been added to the timeline, you'll be sent to the Transition Setting Window, where you can define the default duration for all transitions you add to a slideshow and choose your preferred transition mode.

Hundreds of motion graphics templates are available in the Elements tab, which you can rapidly add to the timeline.

**Step 6**: Creating Slideshow Soundtracks and Recording Voiceovers

Select the Record Voiceover tool from the Record drop-down menu on the Media tab. When the Record Audio window appears on the screen, select the microphone you'll use to record the narration and press the Record button.

You may use Filmora's large library of music and sound effects for free. Simply navigate to the Audio tab and browse the subcategories of Electronic, Young & Bright, and Rock until you select the perfect song for the slideshow's soundtrack.

**Step 7**: Exporting Slideshows from Filmora

It is important to point out that there are very many animation programs in the market and choosing the best one will depend on your needs, your style, the feature and tools you need, the cost of the program, and even the export options that each tool gives you.

Before we look at the best ways to create animated videos, let’s start by examining why you would need to use an animated video maker in the first place.

## When to Use an Animated Video Maker

**Improve Conversion and Sales**

Animated videos are engaging enough to improve your conversion and sales. Studies have shown that an animated video can increase both conversion and sales by up to 80%. It may therefore be a good idea to use an animated explainer video to show your potential customers how to purchase a product or service on your website.

**Increase Brand Awareness**

Because they can be very entertaining and engaging, animated videos can also be a great way to increase brand awareness. And since they can be created very easily and cheaply, they can be a good way to reach potential customers.

**Generate Online Leads**

Because of the engaging nature of animated videos, you can use them to introduce yourself to potential customers and generate online leads. They have a very high conversion rate, as we have seen before, making them one of the best ways to reach people who would otherwise have never heard of you and your brand.

**Explain Complex Processes**

It can be very difficult to try to explain very complex ideas such as the mechanical aspect of a certain tool using words. But a well-crafted animated video gives you the chance to explain complex ideas in a fun and engaging way, making it easier for your customers to understand and engage with your brand.

Part 1: Why Videos Posted on TikTok Need a Catchy Title

Every TikTok creator, from amateur to influencer, will tell you that a caption isn't just a few characters beneath your video; it's the cherry on top of your content sundae. Let's break down why:

1. **First Impressions Count:** TikTok videos autoplay, but captions immediately catch the eye. A clever, concise caption can convince viewers to stay, engage, or share.
2. **Sets the Mood:** Your video might be enigmatic or ambiguous. A caption gives it context. Whether you're aiming for humor, poignancy, or sheer absurdity, the caption anchors your content.
3. **Boosts Discoverability:** Strategic keywords in captions can make your videos more discoverable, especially as users search for specific content on TikTok.
4. **It's Your Brand's Voice:** Established TikTokers have a recognizable style. Your captions can become a part of your brand's unique voice, making you distinguishable in a sea of creators.
