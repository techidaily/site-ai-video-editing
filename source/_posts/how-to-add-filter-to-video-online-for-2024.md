**To Cut/Trim Videos with Wondershare Filmora:**

1. **Drag and Drop the Video**

Assuming that you have already downloaded and installed Wondershare Filmora app, click to open. There are two ways through which you can locate your video.

![cut-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cut-video-vlc-5.png)

After dropping the video on the timeline, it is likely to take up a lot of space, especially if it is long.

![cut-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cut-video-vlc-6.png)

![cut-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cut-video-vlc-7.png)

Trimming the video does not mean that you lose the parts. It is more like shortening it to fit in place.

Unlike trimming, cutting involves getting rid of a section of the video completely. To do so, you need to first of all isolate that section.

With the video on the timeline, move and point your cursor at the starting point of the video and click on the scissors icon at the top. Then move it to the end of the video section and click on the scissors icon again. By so doing, you will have selected that section.

Once the section has been selected, right click on the video, select and click to delete. You can then drag the remaining parts to make them one.
