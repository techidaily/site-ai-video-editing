![upgrade to filmora 11](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-audio-visualizer-in-filmora-easy-3.jpg)

## Add the music file

Next, you should click on the "Create New Project" button from the homepage. Then, tap on the "Click here to import media" section when it opens and add the file to the software window from your internal storage.

![drag the audio file](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-audio-visualizer-in-filmora-easy-4.jpg)

You can also add another pre-made background cover image that you created beforehand from the device, if available. Drag that to the editor timeline as well above the song clip you moved there and tap on the slider. Pull the slider to fit the full size of the audio length for the background alignment. Right-click on the file, and the editing window will open for basic video editing. Make changes like adjusting the Scale, Position, Opacity, etc. Press OK.

![make changes like adjusting the scale](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-audio-visualizer-in-filmora-easy-5.jpg)

## Add the Audio Visualizer Effects

Next, you should go to the Effects tab. When this window opens, you should tap on the Filmstock tab beside the Default one for advanced features like Audio Visualizer. Click on it next.

When you tap on it, you see a list of different visualizer effects in a collection. Please choose one of them that you prefer and download it.

![tap on the filmstock tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-audio-visualizer-in-filmora-easy-6.jpg)

After that, you must drag the visualizer effect selected from the collection to the editing timeline above the background image you added previously. Again, use the slider on the clip to drag it forward and fit the size of both the music clip and the image.

## Edit the Audio Visualiser

The next step of the process that you must focus on is editing the audio visualizer properly for the song and its background cover. For this, you must double-click on the audio visualizer effect you dropped in the timeline- this will open the editing window for the clip.

Here, make some changes to the quality of the audio visualizer as you prefer. Adjustment options available here include position, scale, Opacity, and Intensity. Drag the sliders for them to adjust the visualizer effect as needed. Change the color of the visualizer as well from here, and then use the slider on the visualizer effect on the timeline to see the effect change. Press the OK button after you are done.

## Add the Portrait Image

Go to the My Media tab next to get the Portrait image into the project. If you previously imported the image to Filmora, drag it to the timeline. Or, you can add it later by clicking on the Import Media button and adding the Portrait photo from your device.

When it is available on the media window, hold, drag, and then drop it above the visualizer. Like in the case of the previous parts, use the slider end of this image in the timeline to drag it and fit the size of the other clips.

![adding the portrait image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-audio-visualizer-in-filmora-easy-8.jpg)

![tap the ok button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-audio-visualizer-in-filmora-easy-9.jpg)

## Add the overlapping visualizer effect

After adding the portrait, you can add another audio visualizer effect to the project. For this, again, tap on the Effects tab and choose the Filmstock option. Select Audio Visualizer and click on the circular visualizer effect from the list. Repeat the dragging and dropping step for this effect as well.

On the timeline, you have to adjust the visualizer effect over the portrait photo to match the length of the previous clips. Then, please tap on the portrait photo in the timeline again and adjust its appearance, like reducing the image size to fit the second visualizer effect size.

![reduce size of image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-audio-visualizer-in-filmora-easy-10.jpg)

After fitting the image within the visualizer, click on the Mask tab in the same editor window. Choose the circular shape preset and scroll down to find the adjustment parameters like position, scaling, horizontal/vertical lining, etc. Keep making the changes per your needs, like fitting the image to the same size as the circular visualizer.

Move it to place the image inside the visualizer. After you are done, press the OK button.

## Add a Title

An attractive title is the next element you should add to the project. You have to click on the Titles tab from the top toolbar. Choose the titles option from the drop-down list and move it to the timeline below. As you did with the previous elements you added to the timeline, move the slider onward and fit it with the previous one's length.

![tap on the add text icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-audio-visualizer-in-filmora-easy-12.jpg)

Choose the Rectangle option, for example, and move it to the side of the screen. Click on the shape editing option and adjust the border size of it to three.

Next, you should click on the "Create New Project" button from the homepage. Then, tap on the "Click here to import media" section when it opens and add the file to the software window from your internal storage.

You can also click on the My Media tab and choose Project Media. Go to All Templates and download the audio track you will make changes to. Then, drag the audio file you have imported down to the editor timeline. Add a stock image from your Stock Media section.

You can also add another pre-made background cover image that you created beforehand from the device, if available. Drag that to the editor timeline as well above the song clip you moved there and tap on the slider. Pull the slider to fit the full size of the audio length for the background alignment. Right-click on the file, and the editing window will open for basic video editing. Make changes like adjusting the Scale, Position, Opacity, etc. Press OK.

## Add the Audio Visualizer Effects

Next, you should go to the Effects tab. When this window opens, you should tap on the Filmstock tab beside the Default one for advanced features like Audio Visualizer. Click on it next.

When you tap on it, you see a list of different visualizer effects in a collection. Please choose one of them that you prefer and download it.

![tap on the filmstock tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-audio-visualizer-in-filmora-easy-6.jpg)

After that, you must drag the visualizer effect selected from the collection to the editing timeline above the background image you added previously. Again, use the slider on the clip to drag it forward and fit the size of both the music clip and the image.

## Edit the Audio Visualiser

The next step of the process that you must focus on is editing the audio visualizer properly for the song and its background cover. For this, you must double-click on the audio visualizer effect you dropped in the timeline- this will open the editing window for the clip.

Here, make some changes to the quality of the audio visualizer as you prefer. Adjustment options available here include position, scale, Opacity, and Intensity. Drag the sliders for them to adjust the visualizer effect as needed. Change the color of the visualizer as well from here, and then use the slider on the visualizer effect on the timeline to see the effect change. Press the OK button after you are done.

## Add the Portrait Image

Go to the My Media tab next to get the Portrait image into the project. If you previously imported the image to Filmora, drag it to the timeline. Or, you can add it later by clicking on the Import Media button and adding the Portrait photo from your device.

When it is available on the media window, hold, drag, and then drop it above the visualizer. Like in the case of the previous parts, use the slider end of this image in the timeline to drag it and fit the size of the other clips.

Next, the editing window for that will open. Make changes to the size and placement of the portrait photo, with elements like scale, position, rotation, opacity, etc. Move the photo in the preview window to the section where you want the image to appear. Then, tap the OK button under the window.

## Add the overlapping visualizer effect

After adding the portrait, you can add another audio visualizer effect to the project. For this, again, tap on the Effects tab and choose the Filmstock option. Select Audio Visualizer and click on the circular visualizer effect from the list. Repeat the dragging and dropping step for this effect as well.

On the timeline, you have to adjust the visualizer effect over the portrait photo to match the length of the previous clips. Then, please tap on the portrait photo in the timeline again and adjust its appearance, like reducing the image size to fit the second visualizer effect size.

![reduce size of image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-audio-visualizer-in-filmora-easy-10.jpg)

After fitting the image within the visualizer, click on the Mask tab in the same editor window. Choose the circular shape preset and scroll down to find the adjustment parameters like position, scaling, horizontal/vertical lining, etc. Keep making the changes per your needs, like fitting the image to the same size as the circular visualizer.

Move it to place the image inside the visualizer. After you are done, press the OK button.

## Add a Title

An attractive title is the next element you should add to the project. You have to click on the Titles tab from the top toolbar. Choose the titles option from the drop-down list and move it to the timeline below. As you did with the previous elements you added to the timeline, move the slider onward and fit it with the previous one's length.

Next, you should click on the Title in the timeline you added for the Title editing window to open. Here, you have to tap on the Advanced button.

![tap on the advanced button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-audio-visualizer-in-filmora-easy-11.jpg)

In the next window that opens, tap on the Customize tab and add the song name in the title area. Make other font-related changes as you see fit, like the font size, font style, indentation, color, etc. Tap on the add text icon in this window to get another text field in which you can add the artist's name. Make sure to reduce the size of it to lower than that of the main song title text.

Following that, you can tap on the shape icon to add a shape to the project by adding the name of the streaming service provider, like Apple Music or Spotify. Choose the Rectangle option, for example, and move it to the side of the screen. Click on the shape editing option and adjust the border size of it to three.

If you want to create a rounded-off edge look to the rectangle shape, tap on the small yellow icon that you will see at its edge. Move it slightly to adjust. Then, type the information into the shape text field, like "Listen on Spotify," and make font and shape size adjustments. After you have completed this step, press the OK button below.

## Check and Export

After making the changes, you will return to the main editor timeline. Press the play button under the preview window to see how the final project looks, and tap on the Export button to download it offline. Make changes to the exporting file after clicking on the Local tab and choosing the file format you will download it as. Then, press Export again.
