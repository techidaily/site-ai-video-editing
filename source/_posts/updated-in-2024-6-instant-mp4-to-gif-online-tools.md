## Steps to Edit Facebook Video Ads for E-commerce Business

##### Step1Prepare your script for Video Editing

To make your Facebook video ad, you need to have a clear idea of what you want to say in the video. This can be done by creating a script for your video. Once you have a script, you can start planning out your video and editing it in Filmora.

##### Step2Save your video materials

To gather all photos and video materials, you can either use your own personal footage or find stock images and videos online. Once you have all the desired media, save them to a designated folder on your computer so you can easily access them while editing in Filmora.

##### Step3Open Filmora and click on "Create a New Project."

Now that you have your content ready, open Filmora and click on "Create a New Project." This will create a new project file for you to start editing in.

When selecting the project aspect ratio, make sure to choose Widescreen (16:9) or Instagram (1:10) to ensure that your video is in the correct format.
