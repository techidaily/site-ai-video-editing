## 3 Best Effects to Appear on Camera

We all want to improve our video editing skills and give them more of a wow factor. A fantastic method of achieving this is using different effects and tricks on [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

Appearance effects are optical illusions used to replicate imagined occurrences in a narrative or made-up universe. These effects can be effective narrative devices. As a result, they are widely employed in the theater, film, television, and video game industries. Here is what you need to do to add appearance effects to your videos:

## Part 1: Why are Appearance Effects Important?

A good branding and advertising strategy must include video. You can raise the caliber of clients who utilize your product by improving the image you provide.

How can video help you build your brand? How well do you look? Although there is no quick fix to seem nice on-screen instantly, you can employ several appearance effects to enhance the general flow of your videos. Appearance effects are significant because they add a slight twist to your videos. They can help you stand out, add some humor and draw attention from your audience. These simple tricks could add extra fun and Spark to your videos.

## Part 2: How to Make Cloth Appearance

Let's start with the first one. Before you start, make sure you put the camera on a tripod or a steady surface, so it doesn't move while filming.

Step1 For the first shot, you must throw a jacket on a stool. Make sure it lands on the stool or wherever your talent is going to sit.

![throw a jacket on a stool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_1.jpg)

Step2 Make a shot of your talent appearing from where the jacket landed. You can add some acting skills to make this shot more realistic.

![make a shot of your talent appearing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_2.jpg)

Step3 Download Filmora to edit your footage. You can get started by going to their official website.

![download filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_3.jpg)

Step4 Now split the first clip on the frame where your jacket lands on the stool. Place it on the first track.

![split the first clip on the frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_4.jpg)

Step5 Trim the second shot until the talents start acting and place it on the second track to match the first clip.

![trim the second shot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_5.jpg)

## Part 3: How to Make an Explosion Appearance

Step1 This effect is the easiest. You need to film the empty plate with just a background. Then let the talent enter the frame and jump into the place.

![let the talent enter the frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_6.jpg)

Step2 Now import the clip into Filmora and place it onto the first video track.

Step3 Freeze the frame of the empty plate with just the background and extend it as necessary. Place the clip onto the second video track and trim it until the action of the talent jump starts.

![freeze the frame of the empty plate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_7.jpg)

Step4 Delete the rest on the left. The trick is to use some explosion or smoke effect to hide the transition.

Step5 Use the green screen sample in the default menu here. Add some smoke effects available in film stock. Place it on the third video track and move it to hide the transition.

![use the green screen sample](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_8.jpg)

## Part 4: How to Make Roof Appearance

The last trick here is combining the techniques from the two previous effects.

Step1 First, record the empty plate with just a background. Let the talent jump in the frame and set up a green screen for the talent to jump in front of it. It will look like they're falling from the ceiling.

![record the empty plate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_9.jpg)

Step2 Now import the clip into Filmora again. Follow the steps from the second example so we have the subject appearing on the screen like this.

![import the clip into filmora again](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_10.jpg)

Step3 Add the green screenshot onto the third video track.

![add the green screenshot onto the third video track](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_11.jpg)

Step4 Double-click on it, activate the setting window and then key out the background using the chroma key feature.

![activate the setting window ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_12.jpg)

Step5 Move the clip until it covers only the first frame of the appearing clip. Now keyframe the following subject from the outer frame to the final position.

![move the clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_13.jpg)

Step6 Now search for some smoke effects and put it upside down. So it looks like the ceiling is broken when the subject falls. Then add some camera shake to the fall.

![search for some smoke effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_14.jpg)

Step7 Drag the camera shake effect back to the top track and shorten it to an ideal length. You can also add some sound effects if you want to this video.

## Part 5: Tips to Look Good in Your Next Video

**1\. Be Clear About the Topic**

Intellectuals frequently complain that everyone has attention deficit disorder due to the Internet. According to studies, we only have an attention span of 8 seconds today. You need a punchy, concise message to keep viewers watching your video.

**2\. Don't Forget to Smile**

Individuals who smile frequently are perceived to be more confident and successful. Therefore, showing your audience that you are confident in your company and services is the best method to gain their trust.

**3\. Look into the Camera**

Direct eye contact with the camera lens is essential. Although it may seem enticing, your sole audience is the person directly in front of you when you're speaking.

Be mindful of the camera's confined area. Bring it up to eye level and keep your gaze there rather than elsewhere.

## Summary

There are several fantastic camera effects that you can experiment with in your videos. While some are well-known, others are less well-known and often used. We have mentioned the three fun ways to appear on camera above. We suggest using video editing software like Filmora to use these effects more effectively. You can use these appearance effects to create an atmosphere, make your story more understandable, or spice up the video.

## Ultimate Guide on How To Plan and Storyboard a Music Video

Do you want to bring your music to life on the big screen? Do you want to create something visually striking? Making a music video seems like a big task. Sometimes, the artist you're working with might not have a clear idea for their music video. It's your job to help guide the creative process.

But don't worry! This guide is going to make it easy for you to plan and storyboard your music video step by step with the help of [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). So let's get started and make an amazing music video together!

## Plan and develop initial ideas

The first and essential step in creating a music video is planning. This is where you will lay the foundation of your music video. You need to figure out what your video is about and what you want to convey to the audience. It involves a concept or theme for the video, research, and reference material. You can also explore different ideas to make your video unique and engaging.

![graphical text of initial ideas](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/graphical-text-of-initial-ideas.jpg)

##### Step1Research and gather information

You can begin by researching and gathering information from other music videos. This will help you to know what has been done before and what is currently popular. You can also figure out how you can do it differently.

##### Step2Brainstorm and concept development

Once you understand the current trends and styles in the music video. It's time to start brainstorming ideas. You can do it alone or with the help of your team. But remember that you have to think out of the box to make it creative.

##### Step3Consider the lyrics and message

In the planning stage, it is also important to consider the lyrics and message of the song. It would be best if you plan according to the feel and vibe of the song. It will help you to create a concept tied to the song and will help enhance its meaning.

##### Step4Experiment and find the right direction

Once you have a general concept, it's time to develop it further. You can do it by creating rough sketches or storyboards. You can also film test footage to see how the concept will look on screen.

##### Step5Effort and attention to detail

Remember, this step is the foundation of your music video. So, take your time and don't rush through it. By putting in effort and attention to detail, you'll be able to create a visually stunning and closely tied to the song's music video.

## Choose a style for your music video

While creating ideas for the music video, it's also important to consider the style of the music video. There are two main styles of music videos:

![types of music video style](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/types-of-music-video-style.jpg)

### 1.Performance-style music video

If you want to showcase energy and charisma in your music video, go for a performance-style music video. This video style focuses on you and your band performing live in front of an audience. You can shoot a video in a single take with minimal cuts or feature different angles and shots. The key is to capture the raw energy and emotion of the performance.

### 2.Narrative-style music video

A narrative-style music video tells a story or conveys a message along with the music. The story can be a visual representation of the lyrics or a multi-layered narrative. You can choose this style to convey a deeper message or story.

You can shoot this video in different locations and can include different scenes. The main motive is to create a video that emotionally connects with the audience.

Once you have an idea of what you want your music video to be about, you can put together a treatment to show the artist what your initial plan for the music video is.

![treatment of the plan](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/treatment-of-the-plan.jpg)

If the artist approves the direction of the video, it's time to move on to storyboarding!

## Storyboard your music video

Once you are done with the style and concept of the video, the next step is storyboarding! It allows you to break down your music video visually and highlight key visual moments. It can save time and money and convey a clear idea to the team. You can do this on paper, a computer, or a tablet, whatever works best for you.

## How to Concatenate Videos Using FFmpeg

Video editing is a crucial aspect of creating content for many people. Whether you're a YouTuber, a marketer, or just someone who wants to share videos with friends and family, being able to edit and manipulate your videos is key. One of the most basic video editing tasks is concatenating videos, which combines multiple files to create one cohesive video.

FFmpeg is a powerful tool that allows you to do just that, and in this guide, we'll walk you through the process of FFmpeg concatenate videos. Whether a beginner or an experienced video editor, this guide will provide you with all the information you need to seamlessly merge your videos. From installation to execution, we'll cover it all so you can streamline your video editing process.

![concat videos with ffmpeg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ffmpeg-concat-videos.JPG)

## Overview and Installation of FFmpeg

FFmpeg is free, open-source project that allows you to record, convert, and stream digital audio and video. It is a command-line tool widely used in video editing and transcoding. FFmpeg can be used to concatenate videos and other tasks, such as adding subtitles, changing video resolution, and more. It is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux, making it a versatile and accessible tool for anyone to use.

Here's how to install FFmpeg:

Step1 **Log in** to your Ubuntu server via SSH and **update** the package index.

_$ sudo apt update_

Step2 **Install** FFmpeg and all the required dependencies

_$ sudo apt install ffmpeg_

Step3 **Verify** the version of FFmpeg that you've installed.

_$ ffmpeg -version_

## Prerequisite

Before we merge videos using FFmpeg, we must understand the various methods available to us. FFmpeg offers three ways to concatenate videos: a demuxer, a filter, or a protocol. However, each method has its own set of considerations, and the best method for you will depend on the properties of the videos you're working with.

It's crucial to ensure that all encoding-related properties align with your chosen method. This includes the timebase, height and width, codecs, and pixel format. Some methods require the videos you're merging to have the same encoding, while others allow for different encodings. It's essential to keep this in mind to ensure that the final video is seamless without any breaks. Remember that these prerequisites will help you have a smooth process.

### Concatenate Videos With Same Codecs Using FFmpeg

If the videos you want to concatenate have the same codec, you can use the FFmpeg "concat" demuxer or protocol to join them together. This simple and efficient method doesn't require re-encoding the videos, saving time and preserving the original quality. This section will review the steps to concatenate videos using the "concat" demuxer and "concat" protocols in FFmpeg.

**Merge Videos With the "Concat" Demuxer**

The concat demuxer in FFmpeg allows you to join together multiple video files with the same codecs by reading a list of file paths from a text file and demuxing them in sequence. Each video starts where the previous one finishes without needing to re-encode the videos. Here's how to do it:

Step1 **Create** a **.txt file and list** the paths of the video files you want to merge.

_Join\_video.txt_

_file /Users/Video/input1.mp4_

_file /Users/Video/input2.mp4_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You can add more than two video files.

Step2 **Run** the FFmpeg command:

_ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i join\_video.txt -c copy output\_demuxer.mp4_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note: _\-safe 0_** is added to accept any file name.

**_\-c copy_** will copy all the streams.

As this method allows you to "stream copy" the files instead of re-encoding them, the concatenation is very fast. This can be a good option if you have videos with the same codecs and want to join them quickly without losing quality.

**Join Videos With the "Concat" Protocol**

The concat protocol in FFmpeg allows you to join together multiple video files in a specific format that supports file-level concatenation, such as MPEG-2 TS. However, it cannot be used for other video formats like MP4 and WEBM.

Here's how to use the "concat protocol:

Step1 **Run** the FFmpeg command:

_ffmpeg -i "concat:input1.ts|input2.ts" -c copy output\_protocol.ts_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** The concat protocol allows you to "stream copy" the files by adding the option **_\-c copy_**.

Step2 **Input** the file name of the video using this code:

_ffmpeg -i "concat:input1.mp4|input2.mp4" -c copy output\_protocol.mp4_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** If you try to use this method on video formats that are not supported, only the first input video will be saved in the output video. And the video ends after the first video.

Although this method is limited in terms of supported video formats, it's very easy to use if you merge videos in the supported formats. It's a single command in the terminal without needing a text file. Additionally, using the -c copy option makes it efficient as it doesn’t require re-encoding, saving time.

### Concatenate MP4 Video Files of Different Codecs & Resolutions Using FFmpeg

If the videos you want to concatenate have different codecs or resolutions, you can still use FFmpeg to join them together. However, this method requires re-encoding the videos, which can take longer and may result in a loss of quality. This section will cover the steps to concatenate videos with different codecs or resolutions using FFmpeg.

Here's how to do it:

Step1 **Provide** the names of the input files to FFmpeg.

_ffmpeg -i file1.mp4 -i file2.mp4 -i file3.mp4 \\_

Step2 **Use** the **filter\_complex** filtergraph parameter to instruct FFmpeg from where to take the audio and video.

_\-filter\_complex "\[0:v\] \[0:a\] \[1:v\] \[1:a\] \[2:v\] \[2:a\]_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note: \[0:v\]\[0:a\]** means FFmpeg needs to take the video and audio from the 0th video (file1.mp4).

Step3 Tell FFmpeg to concatenate three files (n=3).

_concat=n=3:v=1:a=1 \[vv\] \[aa\]" \\_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** The **v=1:a=1** implies one stream for the audio and one stream for the video.

Step4 **Map** these audio and video outputs to the final video container. This is done as follows:

_\-map "\[vv\]" -map "\[aa\]" mergedVideo.mp4_

It is important to note that this method requires re-encoding the videos, which can take more time and may result in a loss of quality. However, it offers the flexibility of filtering the videos before concatenating them. The filter\_complex method in FFmpeg allows you to concatenate videos of different codecs and resolutions. The final step is to map the audio and video outputs to the final video container. This can be done using the -map command.

### Concatenate Videos With Multiple Audio Streams Using FFmpeg

Concatenating videos with multiple audio streams can be more complex than concatenating videos with a single audio stream. This section will cover the steps to concatenate videos with multiple audio streams using FFmpeg. We'll be using the filter\_complex method in FFmpeg, which allows you to manipulate and concatenate multiple audio and video streams in a single command. This method is more advanced but allows you to join videos with different audio streams and create a final video with multiple audio tracks.

Step1 **Specify** the input files and opening.mkv, episode.mkv, and ending.mkv:

_$ ffmpeg -i opening.mkv -i episode.mkv -i ending.mkv -filter\_complex_

Step2 **Use** the **filter\_complex** parameter in FFmpeg to specify the input streams for the video and audio.

_\[0:0\] \[0:1\] \[0:2\] \[1:0\] \[1:1\] \[1:2\] \[2:0\] \[2:1\] \[2:2\]_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note: Single video stream** (\[0:0\], \[1:0\], \[2:0\])

**Dual audio streams** (\[0:1\]\[0:2\], \[1:1\]\[1:2\], \[2:1\]\[2:2\])

Step3 **Use** the **concat** filter to specify that you want to concatenate 3 files (n=3) with 1 video stream (v=1) and 2 audio streams (a=2). Specify the output streams as \[v\], \[a1\], \[a2\]:

_concat=n=3:v=1:a=2 \[v\] \[a1\] \[a2\]_

Step4 **Use** the **\-map** option to map the output streams to the final video container:

_\-map '\[v\]' -map '\[a1\]' -map '\[a2\]' output.mkv_

## Conclusion

FFmpeg is a powerful tool that allows you to concatenate videos in various ways. Whether you're working with videos of the same codecs and resolutions or videos with multiple audio streams, FFmpeg can handle it. However, for users new to video editing or needing experience with command-line tools, using Filmora can be a more user-friendly option. It offers a simple drag-and-drop interface and a variety of features and effects to enhance the overall look of your video.

Step2 **Run** the FFmpeg command:

_ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i join\_video.txt -c copy output\_demuxer.mp4_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note: _\-safe 0_** is added to accept any file name.

**_\-c copy_** will copy all the streams.

As this method allows you to "stream copy" the files instead of re-encoding them, the concatenation is very fast. This can be a good option if you have videos with the same codecs and want to join them quickly without losing quality.

**Join Videos With the "Concat" Protocol**

The concat protocol in FFmpeg allows you to join together multiple video files in a specific format that supports file-level concatenation, such as MPEG-2 TS. However, it cannot be used for other video formats like MP4 and WEBM.

Here's how to use the "concat protocol:

Step1 **Run** the FFmpeg command:

_ffmpeg -i "concat:input1.ts|input2.ts" -c copy output\_protocol.ts_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** The concat protocol allows you to "stream copy" the files by adding the option **_\-c copy_**.

Step2 **Input** the file name of the video using this code:

_ffmpeg -i "concat:input1.mp4|input2.mp4" -c copy output\_protocol.mp4_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** If you try to use this method on video formats that are not supported, only the first input video will be saved in the output video. And the video ends after the first video.

Although this method is limited in terms of supported video formats, it's very easy to use if you merge videos in the supported formats. It's a single command in the terminal without needing a text file. Additionally, using the -c copy option makes it efficient as it doesn’t require re-encoding, saving time.

### Concatenate MP4 Video Files of Different Codecs & Resolutions Using FFmpeg

If the videos you want to concatenate have different codecs or resolutions, you can still use FFmpeg to join them together. However, this method requires re-encoding the videos, which can take longer and may result in a loss of quality. This section will cover the steps to concatenate videos with different codecs or resolutions using FFmpeg.

Here's how to do it:

Step1 **Provide** the names of the input files to FFmpeg.

_ffmpeg -i file1.mp4 -i file2.mp4 -i file3.mp4 \\_

Step2 **Use** the **filter\_complex** filtergraph parameter to instruct FFmpeg from where to take the audio and video.

_\-filter\_complex "\[0:v\] \[0:a\] \[1:v\] \[1:a\] \[2:v\] \[2:a\]_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note: \[0:v\]\[0:a\]** means FFmpeg needs to take the video and audio from the 0th video (file1.mp4).

Step3 Tell FFmpeg to concatenate three files (n=3).

_concat=n=3:v=1:a=1 \[vv\] \[aa\]" \\_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** The **v=1:a=1** implies one stream for the audio and one stream for the video.

Step4 **Map** these audio and video outputs to the final video container. This is done as follows:

_\-map "\[vv\]" -map "\[aa\]" mergedVideo.mp4_

It is important to note that this method requires re-encoding the videos, which can take more time and may result in a loss of quality. However, it offers the flexibility of filtering the videos before concatenating them. The filter\_complex method in FFmpeg allows you to concatenate videos of different codecs and resolutions. The final step is to map the audio and video outputs to the final video container. This can be done using the -map command.

### Concatenate Videos With Multiple Audio Streams Using FFmpeg

Concatenating videos with multiple audio streams can be more complex than concatenating videos with a single audio stream. This section will cover the steps to concatenate videos with multiple audio streams using FFmpeg. We'll be using the filter\_complex method in FFmpeg, which allows you to manipulate and concatenate multiple audio and video streams in a single command. This method is more advanced but allows you to join videos with different audio streams and create a final video with multiple audio tracks.

Step1 **Specify** the input files and opening.mkv, episode.mkv, and ending.mkv:

_$ ffmpeg -i opening.mkv -i episode.mkv -i ending.mkv -filter\_complex_

Step2 **Use** the **filter\_complex** parameter in FFmpeg to specify the input streams for the video and audio.

_\[0:0\] \[0:1\] \[0:2\] \[1:0\] \[1:1\] \[1:2\] \[2:0\] \[2:1\] \[2:2\]_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note: Single video stream** (\[0:0\], \[1:0\], \[2:0\])

**Dual audio streams** (\[0:1\]\[0:2\], \[1:1\]\[1:2\], \[2:1\]\[2:2\])

Step3 **Use** the **concat** filter to specify that you want to concatenate 3 files (n=3) with 1 video stream (v=1) and 2 audio streams (a=2). Specify the output streams as \[v\], \[a1\], \[a2\]:

_concat=n=3:v=1:a=2 \[v\] \[a1\] \[a2\]_

Step4 **Use** the **\-map** option to map the output streams to the final video container:

_\-map '\[v\]' -map '\[a1\]' -map '\[a2\]' output.mkv_
