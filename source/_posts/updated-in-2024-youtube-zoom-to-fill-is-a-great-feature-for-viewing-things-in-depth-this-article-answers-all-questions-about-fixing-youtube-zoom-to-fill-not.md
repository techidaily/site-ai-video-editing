## Easy Guide to Use a Stabilization Tool in Filmora

Does your video shake so much? Shaking movement on your camera is often inevitable, especially if you don't use a camera stabilizer or a camera with no built-in image stabilization. As a result, it can make your video look distracting and difficult to watch.

But you don't need to worry. You can use a stabilization tool in [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). A stabilization tool is a feature that can help to correct for camera shake and other types of movement. If you are a handheld shooter, you will find this tool extremely helpful.

## Part 1: When do you need to stabilize your video?

Now, let's talk about when you should stabilize your video. If you're shooting something that is moving, like people or animals, you will definitely want to stabilize your video. This will help ensure that the video is smooth and steady.

Another time you may want to stabilize your video is if you're shooting in a low-light situation. It will help to ensure that your video is not too shaky.

Finally, if you're shooting a video that's going to be displayed on a large screen, you may want to stabilize your video. Stabilizing your video will help ensure the output is crisp and clear.

## Part 2: How to stabilize your video with Filmora

Filmora has a stabilization feature that can help to smooth your video and make it look more professional. If you haven't installed Filmora yet, you can download it for free.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

So, should you have a wobble movement in your video, follow these steps to make it smoother in no time:

Step1 Launch Filmora 11 and **create a new project**.

Step2 Import your video to Filmora.

![import your video to filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/stabilization-tool-in-filmora-1.jpg)

Step3 After you import your video to Filmora, the Stabilization must have been off. So, **switch the Stabilization toggle on**, then a loading bar will start going up to analyze the clip.

![switch the stabilization toggle on](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/stabilization-tool-in-filmora-2.jpg)

Step4 Once it finishes analyzing, the smooth level will default to 10\. See the preview whether you like how it turns out.

**Before**

![before finish analyzing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/stabilization-tool-in-filmora-3.gif)

**After**

![after finish analyzing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/stabilization-tool-in-filmora-4.gif)

Please note that the center point of your image will always be the most stable. The more shaky a clip is, the more it will crop into that image.

If you are unsatisfied with the default setting, increasing the Smoothness Level will result in more cropping to the image. On the contrary, if you put the Smoothness Level down to zero, you are no longer cropping into the image, but the result won't be as smooth.

![adjust smothness level as byou like](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/stabilization-tool-in-filmora-5.gif)

Should the cropping bother you, such as it crops the subject's hair out of the frame, you can adjust it with **Edge Processing**.

If you change it to **None**, you will see the black bars that simulate how it stabilizes the clip. Try to hit play on the preview screen, and then you can see more clearly how the tool keeps the center of the frame to make it stable and less shaky.

![hit play on the preview screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/stabilization-tool-in-filmora-6.gif)

As **Reflect** is the default, the **Extend** uses artificial intelligence to extend the pixels, as you are often aware in Photoshop.

![extend the pixels](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/stabilization-tool-in-filmora-7.jpg)

Besides the three, there is also the **Tile** option. Each of them would give a different result. You can try and use the one that works best for you.

## Summary

When you're shooting a video, you must have wanted it to be as smooth and stable as possible. By stabilizing your video, you can help ensure it's smooth and easy to watch.

Filmora offers a Stabilization feature that allows you to easily improve your video's quality. Simply select the video clip you want to stabilize and click the stabilization button. Filmora will do the rest, giving you a smooth and stable video.

This is a highly neglected factor but users suffer a lot when the customer support team is not responsive.

## Part 8: Screen Recording Tips and Tricks

2\. Only record the required screen: Screen recorders offer you the option to record the entire screen, any specific application window or any specific tab of your browser. In fact, you can even customize the screen recording area as per your requirements for better focus and better visual experience.

3\. Keep it short: It is always necessary to keep the length of the video as short as possible without skipping the relevant points and important explanations. That is where a proper script before recording is crucial so that you can have a plan and execute it properly without stretching your explanation unnecessarily.

4\. Speak slowly and clearly: The way you speak in the video can attract as well as repel audiences. If you speak too fast and if you have a weird accent, it is going to repel audiences. That is why it is important for you to speak slowly and clearly so that everyone can understand everything you speak and negate your accent to a greater extent.

5\. Use screen drawing tools: If you are recording a video where you need to explain something, it is always better if you use screen drawing tools. In fact, it is important that you choose the screen recorder that offers drawing tools so that the video gets visually pleasing and impactful for audiences to understand effectively.

6\. Cut out dead moments: When you are recording screen videos, there are going to be a lot of dead moments and boring pauses. You have to cut out those boring and dead moments while editing so that the video stays interesting and the audiences do not lose concentration. This will also help to tighten the length of the video.

7\. End with a summary: Last but most importantly, you should offer a proper conclusion before ending the video. You need to summarize everything you have discussed in the video so that the audience can get a revision of all the important points. Besides, a proper ending rather than an abrupt ending can leave a positive impact regarding your video.

3\. Keep it short: It is always necessary to keep the length of the video as short as possible without skipping the relevant points and important explanations. That is where a proper script before recording is crucial so that you can have a plan and execute it properly without stretching your explanation unnecessarily.

4\. Speak slowly and clearly: The way you speak in the video can attract as well as repel audiences. If you speak too fast and if you have a weird accent, it is going to repel audiences. That is why it is important for you to speak slowly and clearly so that everyone can understand everything you speak and negate your accent to a greater extent.

5\. Use screen drawing tools: If you are recording a video where you need to explain something, it is always better if you use screen drawing tools. In fact, it is important that you choose the screen recorder that offers drawing tools so that the video gets visually pleasing and impactful for audiences to understand effectively.

6\. Cut out dead moments: When you are recording screen videos, there are going to be a lot of dead moments and boring pauses. You have to cut out those boring and dead moments while editing so that the video stays interesting and the audiences do not lose concentration. This will also help to tighten the length of the video.

7\. End with a summary: Last but most importantly, you should offer a proper conclusion before ending the video. You need to summarize everything you have discussed in the video so that the audience can get a revision of all the important points. Besides, a proper ending rather than an abrupt ending can leave a positive impact regarding your video.

1\. Recording options: An ideal screen recorder should have all the different options for recording your screen, webcam, system audio, and external audio from microphone. Besides, it should offer you the option to customize the recording area by selection. You should be able to record full screen, application window, and browser tab accurately.

2\. Price: If you are serious about recording your screen video and uploading the recorded video on online platforms, you have to opt for a premium screen recorder. While purchasing a proprietary screen recorder, you need to compare the software price with its peers and ensure that you are getting more features for the price you are paying.

3\. Customer support: You need to ensure that the screen recorder you are purchasing, they have a highly responsive customer support. This is a highly neglected factor but users suffer a lot when the customer support team is not responsive. Be sure that you will need to contact the customer support team at some time to learn more about certain features and troubleshoot in emergency situations.

4\. Sharing options: When your ultimate goal is to share your recorded video online, you should check for the sharing options available in the screen recorder. There are screen recorders that allow sharing recorded and edited videos on online platforms, cloud storage platforms, and video streaming platforms. It should also offer you options to let you export videos in different file formats.

5\. Video editing tools: You have to edit your recorded video to trim out unnecessary parts and add effects and filters to enhance your video content and video quality. Besides, you may need options to add music and voiceover as well as intro and outro. That is why you should opt for a screen recorder where a great video editor is available.

6\. Customer Reviews: Last but most importantly, you should check the customer review of the screen recording software. Even when a screen recorder has loads of features, if the customer reviews are not good enough, you should not choose you. Besides, the customer reviews reveal the pros and cons of a screen recorder for your better understanding.

## Part 8: Screen Recording Tips and Tricks

1\. Practice before recording: Unless you are a pro, you should practice at least once before the actual recording. This will help you to execute your plan according to your script smoothly when you actually start recording. Besides, you can check if the frame, the camera, the mic, and everything else are working perfectly.

2\. Only record the required screen: Screen recorders offer you the option to record the entire screen, any specific application window or any specific tab of your browser. In fact, you can even customize the screen recording area as per your requirements for better focus and better visual experience.

3\. Keep it short: It is always necessary to keep the length of the video as short as possible without skipping the relevant points and important explanations. That is where a proper script before recording is crucial so that you can have a plan and execute it properly without stretching your explanation unnecessarily.

4\. Speak slowly and clearly: The way you speak in the video can attract as well as repel audiences. If you speak too fast and if you have a weird accent, it is going to repel audiences. That is why it is important for you to speak slowly and clearly so that everyone can understand everything you speak and negate your accent to a greater extent.

5\. Use screen drawing tools: If you are recording a video where you need to explain something, it is always better if you use screen drawing tools. In fact, it is important that you choose the screen recorder that offers drawing tools so that the video gets visually pleasing and impactful for audiences to understand effectively.

6\. Cut out dead moments: When you are recording screen videos, there are going to be a lot of dead moments and boring pauses. You have to cut out those boring and dead moments while editing so that the video stays interesting and the audiences do not lose concentration. This will also help to tighten the length of the video.

7\. End with a summary: Last but most importantly, you should offer a proper conclusion before ending the video. You need to summarize everything you have discussed in the video so that the audience can get a revision of all the important points. Besides, a proper ending rather than an abrupt ending can leave a positive impact regarding your video.

1\. Recording options: An ideal screen recorder should have all the different options for recording your screen, webcam, system audio, and external audio from microphone. Besides, it should offer you the option to customize the recording area by selection. You should be able to record full screen, application window, and browser tab accurately.

2\. Price: If you are serious about recording your screen video and uploading the recorded video on online platforms, you have to opt for a premium screen recorder. While purchasing a proprietary screen recorder, you need to compare the software price with its peers and ensure that you are getting more features for the price you are paying.

3\. Customer support: You need to ensure that the screen recorder you are purchasing, they have a highly responsive customer support. This is a highly neglected factor but users suffer a lot when the customer support team is not responsive. Be sure that you will need to contact the customer support team at some time to learn more about certain features and troubleshoot in emergency situations.

4\. Sharing options: When your ultimate goal is to share your recorded video online, you should check for the sharing options available in the screen recorder. There are screen recorders that allow sharing recorded and edited videos on online platforms, cloud storage platforms, and video streaming platforms. It should also offer you options to let you export videos in different file formats.

5\. Video editing tools: You have to edit your recorded video to trim out unnecessary parts and add effects and filters to enhance your video content and video quality. Besides, you may need options to add music and voiceover as well as intro and outro. That is why you should opt for a screen recorder where a great video editor is available.

6\. Customer Reviews: Last but most importantly, you should check the customer review of the screen recording software. Even when a screen recorder has loads of features, if the customer reviews are not good enough, you should not choose you. Besides, the customer reviews reveal the pros and cons of a screen recorder for your better understanding.

## Part 8: Screen Recording Tips and Tricks

1\. Practice before recording: Unless you are a pro, you should practice at least once before the actual recording. This will help you to execute your plan according to your script smoothly when you actually start recording. Besides, you can check if the frame, the camera, the mic, and everything else are working perfectly.

2\. Only record the required screen: Screen recorders offer you the option to record the entire screen, any specific application window or any specific tab of your browser. In fact, you can even customize the screen recording area as per your requirements for better focus and better visual experience.

3\. Keep it short: It is always necessary to keep the length of the video as short as possible without skipping the relevant points and important explanations. That is where a proper script before recording is crucial so that you can have a plan and execute it properly without stretching your explanation unnecessarily.

4\. Speak slowly and clearly: The way you speak in the video can attract as well as repel audiences. If you speak too fast and if you have a weird accent, it is going to repel audiences. That is why it is important for you to speak slowly and clearly so that everyone can understand everything you speak and negate your accent to a greater extent.

5\. Use screen drawing tools: If you are recording a video where you need to explain something, it is always better if you use screen drawing tools. In fact, it is important that you choose the screen recorder that offers drawing tools so that the video gets visually pleasing and impactful for audiences to understand effectively.

6\. Cut out dead moments: When you are recording screen videos, there are going to be a lot of dead moments and boring pauses. You have to cut out those boring and dead moments while editing so that the video stays interesting and the audiences do not lose concentration. This will also help to tighten the length of the video.

7\. End with a summary: Last but most importantly, you should offer a proper conclusion before ending the video. You need to summarize everything you have discussed in the video so that the audience can get a revision of all the important points. Besides, a proper ending rather than an abrupt ending can leave a positive impact regarding your video.
