Once you know how QuickTime Player makes it easy for Mac users to play their video, it is time to understand the steps associated with the procedure. Two basic techniques can be implemented to play videos with QuickTime. The first method to play videos with QuickTime are featured as follows:

Step 1: You need to open QuickTime Player across your Mac. For that, proceed across Launchpad to access the application.

![select quicktime player](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/guide-about-quicktime-player-1.jpg)

![tap on open button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/guide-about-quicktime-player-2.jpg)

Sounds easy, right? However, if you have multiple videos to open or have other video players installed in your Mac, you should consider following this second approach. If QuickTime Player is not your default video player, it is important to follow the steps below for opening any video across QuickTime.

Step 1: Open Finder on your device and proceed to locate the video that you wish to open across QuickTime. On finding the video, click on the video while holding the “Control” button on the keyboard. This opens a drop-down menu.

![choose your video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/guide-about-quicktime-player-3.jpg)

Step 2: In the “Open With” section across the menu, you will find the option of QuickTime Player. Tap on the option to open the video across QuickTime.

## Part 4: How to Do Screen Recording with QuickTime?

Several functions can be performed across QuickTime. While the QuickTime video format allows you to play different videos across the platform, it also helps users record screens of their choice. To understand the step-by-step procedure, you need to follow the steps displayed below. Come along and learn more about it.

Step 1: Open QuickTime Player on your device and tap on the "File" tab on the top of the screen. Select the option of "New Screen Recording" from the available options to initiate screen recording.

![select new screen recording option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/guide-about-quicktime-player-5.jpg)

Step 2: The next window opens up, which involves managing the screen recording settings. You need to set up the screen area recorded in the process initially.

![choose your recording portion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/guide-about-quicktime-player-6.jpg)

## Part 5: How to Convert Video File to MOV Format in QuickTime?

QuickTime Player is not quite extensive when it comes to converting video files. Although there are several QuickTime format files that you may come across and play across the platform, it only converts any video file into MOV format, which is the dedicated file format potentially designed by Apple. To understand the method to convert any QuickTime video format to MOV format, follow the steps shown below:

Step 1: You need to open the appropriate video across QuickTime to convert it accordingly. Once opened, tap on the "File" tab, and select "Export as" across the available options.

![access export as option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/guide-about-quicktime-player-9.jpg)

Step 2: You need to select an appropriate resolution from the available options according to the video quality that you want the video to be saved in on the preceding menu. QuickTime player will show low-quality resolutions for the high-quality video but not vice versa.

![choose video quality](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/guide-about-quicktime-player-10.jpg)

Step 3: A new window opens that requires you to set up the name and location for the video. Add the file extension “.mov” at the end of the name of the video to convert it into MOV format.
