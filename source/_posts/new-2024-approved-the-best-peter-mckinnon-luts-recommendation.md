Variable mask feather in After Effects allows you to create masks with variable feathering. It means you can have different feather values for different parts of the same mask. This feature gives you greater control and flexibility over your masks, allowing you to easily create complex effects and transitions.

With variable mask feathers, you can create complex effects, such as a shape that feathers more in one direction than the other. Or you can create a mask with a soft transition in one area and a hard transition in another.

By experimenting with different feather values and mask shapes, you can achieve a wide range of creative effects in After Effects. To use variable mask feather in After Effects, you'll need to follow these steps:

Step1 Use the pen tool to create corner points.

## Takeaway

Adding scrolling text to your video should no more be an issue for you. If you are using After Effects, we have illustrated how you can create horizontal and vertical scrolling effect for text in your video perfectly. If you prefer a free video editor, you can use VSDC free video editor as well. But we recommend [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) where you can add scrolling effects to your text instantly, and there is a wide range of amazing scrolling effects available to apply to your video.
