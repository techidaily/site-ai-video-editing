## Part 3: Slow Motion Video Making and Wondershare Filmora: Make Videos Like Slow Mo Guys

All the above methods of [creating slow motion](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) are effective, but there is a drawback. You'll have to record the complete video in slow motion, and there are no custom options. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is a professional video editing software that can resolve this. This software will help you create videos similar to **Dan Slow Mo Guys**.

In addition, you can infuse your slomo with multiple visual effects, transitions, and more. Filmora displays two features to create a slow-motion video, one of which is Uniform Speed. The other feature is Speed Ramping with pre-assembled slow-motion presets. With its AI-backed technology, you can increase the video frame rate as well.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

### Using Uniform Speed to Create a Slow-Motion Video in Filmora

Uniform Speed is the basic method of creating slow motion in Filmora. It simply modifies the playback speed of video with the help of a slider. The procedure of slomo creation, like **The Slow Mo Guys** in Filmora, is given below:

##### Step 1Import Media to Start Slomo Creation

After downloading Filmora on your device, click the "New Project" button to start. From the editing interface, click the "Ctrl + I" keys, choose the video, and bring it to the timeline after import. Select the clip in the timeline and use your cursor to reach the settings panel. Go to the "Uniform Speed" section under the "Speed" tab and change the speed slider settings.

Once all is set and done, navigate towards the timeline panel to select this video again. With the help of your cursor, access the "File" tab at the top toolbar. Select the "Render Preview" option from the expanding menu. After rendering is complete, use the preview screen to observe the slo-mo and export it.

### Using Speed Ramping to Create a Slow-Motion Video in Filmora

The second method is also simple, but it has more precise options to create a slow-mo. It uses the velocity graph to rise or decline video speed at certain intervals. Gather the knowledge about how **The Slow Mo Guys** **YouTube** creates slow-mo here:

##### Step 1Access the Speed Ramping Feature

After importing and bringing media to the timeline, select it and reach the settings panel. Access the "Speed" > "Speed Ramping" option to start editing. There, you can find many custom speed presets for automated editing. However, you can also use the "Customize" preset to create from scratch. Then, reach the speed graph and move the slider downward to bring the slo-mo effect.
