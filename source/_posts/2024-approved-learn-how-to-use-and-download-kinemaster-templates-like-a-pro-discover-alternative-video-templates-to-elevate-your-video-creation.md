**Supported OS: Linux, BSD, Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows**

Avidemux offers three fundamental operations: cutting, encoding, and filtering.

Users of Avidemux can use this feature on videos they want to use for business or archive for personal use. They could also use this to convert a video that they intend to post online.

Users can also use Avidemux to filter their videos, which include incorporating subtitles and color profiles, deinterlacing, resizing and sharpening the image of a video, and increasing or decreasing the overall volume of the audio.

Meanwhile, Avidemux has task automation features that make video processing and editing quick and painless. A feature called Joblist allows users to organize their projects in a queue so that they can access their files from a single location. They can use this queue to handle videos in bulk as well.

**Supported OS: Linux, BSD, Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows**

Users of Avidemux can use this feature on videos they want to use for business or archive for personal use. They could also use this to convert a video that they intend to post online.

Users can also use Avidemux to filter their videos, which include incorporating subtitles and color profiles, deinterlacing, resizing and sharpening the image of a video, and increasing or decreasing the overall volume of the audio.

Meanwhile, Avidemux has task automation features that make video processing and editing quick and painless. A feature called Joblist allows users to organize their projects in a queue so that they can access their files from a single location. They can use this queue to handle videos in bulk as well.

**Supported OS: Linux, BSD, Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows**

Avidemux offers three fundamental operations: cutting, encoding, and filtering. Cutting allows users to copy, paste, save, or delete a specific part of a video and is incredibly beneficial when users are only interested in a small portion of a video or want to remove commercials from a TV show that they have recorded.

Encoding, on the other contrary, is the way of transforming a video to various formats so that it can be played on different players. Users of Avidemux can use this feature on videos they want to use for business or archive for personal use. They could also use this to convert a video that they intend to post online.

Users can also use Avidemux to filter their videos, which include incorporating subtitles and color profiles, deinterlacing, resizing and sharpening the image of a video, and increasing or decreasing the overall volume of the audio.

Meanwhile, Avidemux has task automation features that make video processing and editing quick and painless. A feature called Joblist allows users to organize their projects in a queue so that they can access their files from a single location. They can use this queue to handle videos in bulk as well.

Tip: After cutting is done, click the "Open Output Folder" button to open the destination folder to check the clippings. Click the "Done" button to go back to the main window.

**WHICH SHOULD I CHOOSE: FREE OR PAID VIDEO CUTTER ON MAC?**

Whether you choose Free or Paid Video Cutter, it still depends on your edit and navigation if the project will succeed like what you’re anticipating. Beginners in the industry can go for Free Video Cutters to practice the craft without worrying about the monthly subscription.

However, if you’re a professional, I highly suggest that you choose Paid Video Cutter to lessen the hassle and create amazing output.

**FAQS ABOUT CUTTING VIDEOS**

1. **How can I cut a video without losing quality?**

Trimming VLC through LosslessCut

LosslessCut is an open-source video cutter that runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac. Like Filmora, this software also allows you to cut videos without re-encoding, so there is no loss of quality.

1. **Who is the best video cutter?**

Filmora is one of the best video cutter software that allows you to change the aesthetic of your video with one click. It comes with a wide range of video effects that enable you to make clips look good. Features: This tool provides fast editing processing and adjustable preview quality.

1. **Why does trimming videos reduce quality?**

In most cases, trimming only causes a minor loss of video quality. And there is no clear causal relationship between trimming and losing video quality. The main factors that influence video quality are Resolution, Bitrate, and Frame size.

If you are longing to pick up the best video cutter for Mac, you are supposed to evaluate it from different aspects, like operating interface, cutting features, output quality, post-processing ability, etc. Frankly speaking, there is no fixed answer. Everything depends on your actual requirements. If you want to cut videos on Mac with the forthright method, iMovie can be your top priority. If you prefer top-leading editing features, Blender is competitive enough for you.

**Conclusion:**

There you have it! Here is the alternative software to cut/shorten your video without using FFmpeg. All these editors cater to different needs, so be sure to try them out, understand your requirements, and use the right one for your project!
