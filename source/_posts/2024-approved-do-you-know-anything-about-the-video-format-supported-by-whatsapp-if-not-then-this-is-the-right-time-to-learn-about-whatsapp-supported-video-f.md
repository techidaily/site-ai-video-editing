## Part 3: How to turn Normal Video to Slow Motion With VLC On Linux Computer?

The video speed may be controlled in two ways using VLC. Using shortcut keys or hotkeys is one method, while menus and buttons are another. Both methods are OK, but the shortcut option is the quickest and most efficient.

Speed up and speed down buttons appear on the upper right of the movie when you press them. Depending on how much you tweak it, the speed is represented as 1.50x or 0.80x. This option is available for those who like to use other shortcut keys.

**Step 1**: From the VLC menu bar, head over to the **Playback** for **Speed** and choose a speed option: _slower, slower (fine), normal, faster (fine), and faster_.

**Step 2**: Right-clicking is also possible to access these parameters from the Playback > Speed menu.

**Step 3:** The video's speed may be altered by selecting one of those options and then clicking the appropriate button.
