The ratio between the height and width of the screen or an image is called the **aspect ratio**. Different video posting platforms require different aspect ratios. For example, for YouTube, the commonly used aspect ratio is 16:9, which is a standard for almost all videos. However, for TikTok, the required aspect ratio is 9:16.

The video’s original aspect ratio is based on the default settings of the recording device. Some phones and tablets provide the option of changing your video’s aspect ratio before you start recording. But it can also be changed afterward with the help of editing software.

Social media apps and websites require you post images and videos of a specific size. And if you post your content in its original dimensions it most probably be will get cropped in the wrong places and will diminish the quality of your video or image.

To post that perfect video, it is better to resize it before posting it online. Several online editing tools are available on the market that you can use to change the dimensions of your content. iMovie has to be one of the most popular editing software used worldwide. So, if you use iMovie for editing videos, and you want to know how you can change the aspect ratio of your content, read on to find it out.

## FAQs About Changing Aspect Ratio in iMovie

**1\. What is the standard aspect ratio for YouTube Videos?**

On a computer, the standard aspect ratio for videos on YouTube is 16:9\. If your video has a different aspect ratio, YouTube will change it automatically to a size that is suitable for the website. But, it may ruin the quality of the video, or black bars might appear on the sides of the aspect ratio that is too small.

**2\. What resolution does iMovie support?**

The resolution of the first film or video clip that you add to your timeline will define the resolution of your entire iMovie project. The latest versions of iMovie can support 4K and videos with frame rates higher than 30 frames per second.

**3\. Can I crop a video in iMovie?**

Of course, you can crop a video in iMovie. To do so, open a project in iMovie and click on the “Crop to Fill” button. The video will appear in an adjustable frame. Now you can drag the frame and set it to the size you want.

**4\. How do I change movie dimensions in iMovie 10?**

You can only change the size of your movie/video when you share/export your project. Go to the “size” option after clicking on “File” to change the dimensions of your movie.

**5\. How do I compress videos in iMovie?**

Click on the “share” option after clicking on “File”. The video can be compressed for Facebook, Email, Vimeo, and more. Select the option for which you want to compress the file. You may have to make small changes for large videos.

### Final Word
