## Part 2: How to Set Slow Motion Settings in iMovie Video Making?

iMovie is a wonderful choice if you want to make slow-motion videos. Also, it allows users to change the speed of video clips per their needs. With **slo-mo in iMovie**, you can even fine-tune the speed of a single clip by splitting it into intervals, each with a different speed. You can set multiple ranges to cause a clip to speed up and down.

You can freeze a single frame in your film to create the illusion that time has stopped. The app is a fantastic option for Apple users who want to quickly add slow-motion effects to their videos. iMovie is a pretty straightforward tool that gives quick results. Follow the step-by-step guide below to **slow down video in iMovie**.
