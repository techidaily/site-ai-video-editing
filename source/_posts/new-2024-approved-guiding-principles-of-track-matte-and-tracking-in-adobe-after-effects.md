### Using Track Mattes in After Effects

In Adobe After Effects, a track matte is a layer that defines the transparency of another layer. It acts as a stencil, determining which parts of the underlying layer are visible and which are transparent. Track mattes are used for creating various effects such as text animations, transitions, and seamlessly composing multiple layers. After Effects offers four Track Matte options:

![alpha track matte](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-1.jpg)

* **Alpha Matte:** **Alpha matte in After Effects** allows white areas in the matte layer to become visible while black areas become transparent. Effectively, this helps the underlying layer to show through.
* **Alpha Inverted Matte:** In an alpha inverted matte, black areas in the matte layer are visible, and white areas are transparent. It reverses the transparency values to create unique effects.
* **Luma Matte:** A luma matte uses the brightness values of the matte layer to determine visibility. Bright areas in the matte layer are visible, while dark areas are transparent.
* **Luma Inverted Matte:** The luma inverted matte works opposite to the luma matte. The top layer’s dark areas are visible, while bright areas are transparent.

![luma track matte](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-2.jpg)

You can use any of the **track mattes in After Effects** according to your requirements. Following is a step-by-step guide on how to use track mattes:

##### Step 1

To apply a track matte to your video, you must work with two layers. The top layer acts as the alpha or the luminance layer. The bottom layer acts as the fill. Once you have identified the layers, you can proceed to the next step.

##### Step 2

Go to the "Modes" column and open the dropdown menu next to "Layer List." Here, select the layer you wish to use as the track matte.

![select track matte layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-3.jpg)
