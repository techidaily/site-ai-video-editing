## Here We Are, Now the Main Topic of Interest of This Article - How to Put Together Several Videos so that They Become One? This Case, Unlike Other Possibilities We Discussed Above, Is More Complicated, so We Will Study This Feature Step by Step

Sometimes, when working on a project, we really need to combine several videos - this way some content needs to be conveyed, there are shots that, when neatly sorted and merged together, really create visual and content value which we aspire to make; The process becomes more enjoyable if we work on the videos produced by ourselves, or if the work is to be done for our side project. People always take special care of their own work, and the same can be emphasized freely about the editing as well - about the packaging with which we have to deliver our videos to the audience. Even in the absence of an audience, maybe we want to make a kind of video collage for ourselves, our children, or in general, for the family to make delightful memories?

Of course, not everyone who has taken a camera or a mobile phone to take videos at least one time, even so, for family and friends, has the experience of editing and making various manipulations. However, the function of merging videos in various editing programs or on online platforms is so simple that it can be learned in just a few minutes, without the help of other people, and with a kind of small, though very useful result at the same time.

One of the programs where videos can be uploaded is VLC Media Player, which is a free-to-use, robust, and feature-packed software that plays a wide range of audio, image, and video files. It can play multimedia files directly from extractable devices or the PC. The program is unique, as it can stream from popular websites like Disney +, Hulu, Gaia, and Netflix. VLC Multimedia Player also accepts live video from PlayStation Live, Xbox Live, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. While most competing programs display advertisements, VLC Player does not, as it receives support from a non-profit organization.

![merge videos in vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/merge-videos-in-vlc-1.jpg)

Interestingly, we can, as though with the help of a magic wand, turn this particular video player into video editing software. When one computer program delivers too many functions, it might make us think of the situation where one person claims to serve ten professions at the same time - there is a mood that they will not be good in any of them. It's not true with VLC Player, which, from experience, seems to be both a good "player" as well as a fairly user-friendly editing software with many interesting features and functions.

Before we move on to video streaming, let's look at two features that we can use in VLC player:

* [Rotate a video in VLC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MxR2MnLomw)

In the player, right when our video clip starts to play, we may find that the footage is taken vertically instead of horizontally! This is not a nightmare just for video enthusiasts. If you don't know how to rotate the video, then you have to rotate your head 90 degrees, and at this time you can not even get pleasure from watching, not to mention that it can even cause your neck to lock up. VLC Player took care of that - in the top panel, just click on Tools, then select Effects & Filters. In the opened window, we find Video Effects, select Geometry and check the Rotate option - so, the whole 360 degrees are at our disposal!

* [Cut/trim video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtxpVJ5sX9M)

Sometimes it happens that we watch the video, we are crazy about one part of it, and the other part of it seems to spoil everything! Even if we are ready to publish the raw material on social media or just save it for ourselves, we just don't want some parts of the video to be there. So, it can be said - we are not satisfied with the full version and we wish to cut our clip and/or reduce its timeframe. VLC Player solves this problem "without any problem" - we find the View in the top panel, then we demand the cursor to aim for Advanced Controls button. As a result, a sort of video editor will appear, with its red record button on which we will click and the video will play until we reach the point where we want to split the footage. The cut video will be automatically saved in My Computer's My Video folder.

## How to Merge Multiple Videos in VLC Media Player

Here we are, now the main topic of interest of this article - how to put together several videos so that they become one? This case, unlike other possibilities we discussed above, is more complicated, so we will study this feature [step by step](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VioOE6tCg1g&t=1s).

That's it! In this article, we have tried to teach you how to use VLC Media Player as a video editor software, what features we can use and, most importantly, how to merge multiple videos in this dual program; We also learned an alternative way of how we can combine different video clips with the help of Wondershare Filmora. The choice is yours, the main thing is to know all the alternatives and find the most time and energy saving, preferable option for you personally!

Interestingly, we can, as though with the help of a magic wand, turn this particular video player into video editing software. When one computer program delivers too many functions, it might make us think of the situation where one person claims to serve ten professions at the same time - there is a mood that they will not be good in any of them. It's not true with VLC Player, which, from experience, seems to be both a good "player" as well as a fairly user-friendly editing software with many interesting features and functions.

Before we move on to video streaming, let's look at two features that we can use in VLC player:

* [Rotate a video in VLC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MxR2MnLomw)

In the player, right when our video clip starts to play, we may find that the footage is taken vertically instead of horizontally! This is not a nightmare just for video enthusiasts. If you don't know how to rotate the video, then you have to rotate your head 90 degrees, and at this time you can not even get pleasure from watching, not to mention that it can even cause your neck to lock up. VLC Player took care of that - in the top panel, just click on Tools, then select Effects & Filters. In the opened window, we find Video Effects, select Geometry and check the Rotate option - so, the whole 360 degrees are at our disposal!

* [Cut/trim video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtxpVJ5sX9M)

Sometimes it happens that we watch the video, we are crazy about one part of it, and the other part of it seems to spoil everything! Even if we are ready to publish the raw material on social media or just save it for ourselves, we just don't want some parts of the video to be there. So, it can be said - we are not satisfied with the full version and we wish to cut our clip and/or reduce its timeframe. VLC Player solves this problem "without any problem" - we find the View in the top panel, then we demand the cursor to aim for Advanced Controls button. As a result, a sort of video editor will appear, with its red record button on which we will click and the video will play until we reach the point where we want to split the footage. The cut video will be automatically saved in My Computer's My Video folder.

## How to Merge Multiple Videos in VLC Media Player

Here we are, now the main topic of interest of this article - how to put together several videos so that they become one? This case, unlike other possibilities we discussed above, is more complicated, so we will study this feature [step by step](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VioOE6tCg1g&t=1s).

In this article, we have tried to teach you how to use VLC Media Player as a video editor software, what features we can use and, most importantly, how to merge multiple videos in this dual program; We also learned an alternative way of how we can combine different video clips with the help of Wondershare Filmora. The choice is yours, the main thing is to know all the alternatives and find the most time and energy saving, preferable option for you personally!

Interestingly, we can, as though with the help of a magic wand, turn this particular video player into video editing software. When one computer program delivers too many functions, it might make us think of the situation where one person claims to serve ten professions at the same time - there is a mood that they will not be good in any of them. It's not true with VLC Player, which, from experience, seems to be both a good "player" as well as a fairly user-friendly editing software with many interesting features and functions.

Before we move on to video streaming, let's look at two features that we can use in VLC player:

* [Rotate a video in VLC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MxR2MnLomw)

In the player, right when our video clip starts to play, we may find that the footage is taken vertically instead of horizontally! This is not a nightmare just for video enthusiasts. If you don't know how to rotate the video, then you have to rotate your head 90 degrees, and at this time you can not even get pleasure from watching, not to mention that it can even cause your neck to lock up. VLC Player took care of that - in the top panel, just click on Tools, then select Effects & Filters. In the opened window, we find Video Effects, select Geometry and check the Rotate option - so, the whole 360 degrees are at our disposal!

* [Cut/trim video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtxpVJ5sX9M)

Sometimes it happens that we watch the video, we are crazy about one part of it, and the other part of it seems to spoil everything! Even if we are ready to publish the raw material on social media or just save it for ourselves, we just don't want some parts of the video to be there. So, it can be said - we are not satisfied with the full version and we wish to cut our clip and/or reduce its timeframe. VLC Player solves this problem "without any problem" - we find the View in the top panel, then we demand the cursor to aim for Advanced Controls button. As a result, a sort of video editor will appear, with its red record button on which we will click and the video will play until we reach the point where we want to split the footage. The cut video will be automatically saved in My Computer's My Video folder.

## How to Merge Multiple Videos in VLC Media Player

## Detailed Steps to Rotate Videos in Windows Media Player

Video Editing and the emotion the final product evokes is dependent on many aspects, be it the source clips, the cuts introduced or the way of presentation. But to get to the end, there are several steps involved in the production process, and not every instance of it is perfect. But we all know, editing does often help iron out any kinks, with its ability to solve basic problems, like footage that is askew, or upside down. Thus with the steps listed in this article we will help you understand how you can rotate videos to ensure your edited project looks as intended.

This particular article considers the pre-installed Windows Media Player and WonderShare Filmora.

**_Note:_** _We documented the steps in this guide with Windows Media Player_ _(on a device running Windows 10_ _) and WonderShare Filmora._

## How to Rotate Videos with Windows Media Player?

Imagine you’re in a situation where you have gone ahead and finished the filming portion of a project on your smartphone but realise that the capture footage is upside down. Fortunately, this sort of a scenario is a common occurrence and it has quite a simple fix. If you look around the gallery app on your phone, you should be able to rotate the footage there itself, but if you’ve already moved it over to your laptop, hopping into a video editor can get this done in a jiffy.

Unfortunately, if you were planning to do this with the pre-installed Windows Media Player, _you will not be able to rotate the clip_. The software is only capable of being used as a Media Player that can help keep track of stored videos in a neat and easy to view format. It also has the ability to burn inserted discs, although we doubt any modern laptop comes with a disc drive.

Hence, to rotate video and still ensure its compatible with Windows Media Player, you can use free tools like VLC Media Player or Wondershare Filmora. The steps on how to use Wondershare Filmora to rotate video clips have been elaborated ahead in this article.

### **TIPS FOR WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER**

In case you want to use Windows Media Player as your default software to manage stored content, read this section to understand how you can control displayed video libraries.

While Windows Media Player will pull all compatible files present in the Default Video Library, you can customise the information made available by using the Organises Function.

To configure the Videos Section to display specific content follow the steps listed below.

* Click on Organize.
* Then move onto Manage Libraries
* Now click on Videos.

## **An alternate way to** **Rotate** **Video with Wondershare Filmora**

With Windows Media Player only being a playback tool, we feel free software like [Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) are a great option to have installed on your device.

In Wondershare Filmora, footage rotation can only be done via the Edit Option — in my experience this straightforward approach felt quite simple and intuitive. And in case you wish to incorporate Keyframes into the rotation step, the feature is available near the Timeline.

_The emphasis on accessibility for every function in Filmora, provides a significant advantage. The use of modern iconography also betters the familiarity users may have with the software. These factors make Wondershare Filmora a great option to consider. If you do not already have Wondershare Filmora, you can download the software by visiting the official website._

## 8 Frame Rate Video Converters for a Professional Finish

One important aspect to consider when creating high-quality videos is the frame rate. The frame rate, measured in frames per second (fps), determines the smoothness and fluidity of your video. If the frame rate is too low, your video may appear choppy or stutter. On the other hand, a higher frame rate can provide a more cinematic experience.

However, not all cameras or devices record videos at the same frame rate. That's where frame rate video converters come in. These tools allow you to change the frame rate of your videos so they can be played back on different devices or platforms. With so many options available, it can be overwhelming to know which frame rate converters to use.

In this article, we'll look at 8 of the best frame rate video converters you must try. These tools will help you achieve the perfect frame rate for your videos, from free online options to paid software.

## Unknown Facts About Converting Frame Rates

When converting frame rates, there are a few things to keep in mind that you may need to be made aware of.

![facts about converting frame rates](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facts-convert-frame-rate.jpg)

### 1\. The Web Doesn't Care About Frame Rates

First, it's important to note that the web doesn't care about frame rates. Most online platforms, such as YouTube and Vimeo, automatically adjust the frame rate of videos to match the viewer's device or internet connection. This means that even if you have a video with a high frame rate, it may be automatically downgraded when it's uploaded to the web.

### 2\. Converting Frame Rates in Exact Multiples Is Easy

Another thing to remember is that converting frame rates in exact multiples is relatively easy.

For example, if you have a video recorded at 30 fps and want to convert it to 60 fps, it's a simple process as it is a 2x multiple. However, if you want to convert your video to a frame rate that is not a multiple of the original, such as 29.97 fps, the process can be more complex and may result in some loss of quality.

### 3\. Frame Rate Is Not "Cinematic"

Lastly, it's important to note that frame rate is not "cinematic" because a higher frame rate does not automatically make your video look more cinematic. While a higher frame rate can provide a more smooth and more fluid video, it's just one aspect of creating a cinematic experience. Other elements, such as lighting, composition, and sound design, also play a crucial role in creating a cinematic look.
