### Way 2: Undo the action (by pressing Command + Z)

You can either click **"Command + Z"** to reverse the process if you want to link the clips back together to repair a clip in the timeline.

### Way 3: merge 2 clips (by clicking &quot; Join Clips&quot;)

Choose two neighboring portions, then select **"Join Clips"** from the drop-down option under "Trim" to join the individual clips together into one.

**Tips:** These 3 ways only work if the two clips come from the same clip.

## Part 2\. How to split a clip in alternative to Final Cut Pro?

Final Cut Pro is a more complex user to understand; It can sometimes corrupt your file if it isn't saved properly, leading to all your work becoming lost. To save your work, you should do this every 5 minutes to ensure that your work doesn't corrupt. There are limited export settings; you are limited in the formats and sizes you can export from FCPX; whereas before, you could export many codecs and formats out of FCP, you must complete more specific encoding in a compressor.

Therefore, the alternative to Final Cut Pro is Filmora because it allows you to edit, split or merge clips in one go.

### Split a clip in the best alternative to FCP - [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)
