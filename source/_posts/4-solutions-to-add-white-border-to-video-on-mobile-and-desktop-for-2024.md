## Part 1: Top 10 Halloween-Themed Footage for Halloween Countdown Clock Video

Here we provide footage exclusively for horizontal videos, so that you can use them for your videos for YouTube, Vimeo, Twitch, etc. If you just want some clips for TikTok, Ins story, or anything else, go ahead Halloween footage for vertical videos.

### 1\. Fog Stones Halloween Dead

Spooky graveyard with scary tombstones is another good way to go about it when you are looking for vacation countdown clock videos. The mixture of the turbulent and serene environment is enough to set the Halloween mood and even scare some folks.

Remember the scene from the movie “The Fog” and its famous dialogues: When the fog rolls in the terror begin! If you do not, take a look at a scene and judge for yourself if scary enough or not.

![fog stones filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-1.jpg)

### 2\. Scary Sadako ghost

What’s better than the Sadako ghost 7-day video call threat on Halloween? Well, nothing! So, why not create a prank video for your friends and family, especially those afraid of Sadako? Plus, Sadako creates a perfect backdrop for the countdown. Look at this Philippines creator who went to great lengths to scare his friends via a Sadako video call.

But you do not have to go through all that costume and scenery setup. Instead, you can use the video footage on any premium video and apply Sadako ghost via Green Screen.

![sadako ghost filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-2.jpg)

### 3\. Transferring Halloween Cupcakes From The Tray To The Table Moments

Halloween is adored for its trick-or-treat, but what about the party? What will you serve? Cupcakes sound like a good idea. But how will you entice your guest with your Halloween cupcakes? Well, you can include the cupcakes in the invitation video. While you can find many Halloween creative and savory cupcake recipes on YouTube, you can use stock footage to have them in the video.

![cupcakes halloween filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-3.jpg)

### 4\. Skeleton breaking screen

The broken screen is the classic prank suitable for any event and day. But simply using apps or replacing the wallpaper on your friend's or spouse's mobile doesn’t cut in this age and day. With new technology coming in, you have to get creative. Plus, it’s for Halloween, meaning dead skulls are a must.

![skeleton breaking screen filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-4.jpg)

### 5\. Dark Monster Halloween Horror

Halloween house horror is another great backdrop for scaring your friends after a vacation countdown clock. You will find tons of videos on Halloween Horror houses on the internet. Look at how Jackie from Super Enthused (YouTube channel) gets scared while touring the 10 Halloween horror houses at the theme park. That was really scary, and this Halloween countdown effect can also help you do the same to your viewers.

Scary clowns against a kid’s window have been the long norm of scaring the small ones. No doubt, such pranks can scare anyone, not just kids. If you do not believe me, look at the reaction video from Infinite featuring scaring clowns’ pranks.

But how about dropping such a scary face bomb in a vacation countdown clock video? You can easily get your hands on creepy clowns’ portraits for videos via premium stock libraries like Filmora’s Filmstock.

![scary clown portrait filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-6.jpg)

### 7\. A Family Wearing Handmade Halloween Mask At Home

Another not-so-fancy, subtle, and understated appeal for the Halloween vacation countdown clock video is a family together with Halloween masks. Given everyone will be in their costumes, you can also consider distributing self-made masks for everyone. You can take ideas from any of the numerous videos about Halloween mask design ideas.

![face mask family filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-7.jpg)

### 8\. Halloween Buckets Stacked Together

What’s the simplest and most fitting footage for the Halloween vacation countdown clock? Well, it is the scary pumpkins. Carving out Jack-o’-lantern has long been the Halloween “tradition,” and featuring it in your countdown timer at the party is the most classic way to go about it. The vibe from simple Halloween buckets stacked together is on the next level; if you do not believe me, look at Angie Bellemare’s Halloween Bucket ideas and creativity:

![halloween bucket stacked filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-8.jpg)

### 9\. Carving Of Pumpkin For Halloween

Another Jack-o’-lantern idea for the vacation countdown clock video is the DIY Pumpin projects in the video. It doesn’t sound like much, but it really is enough to give the best feeling about Halloween without really indulging in the scary stuff. Take a look at how Jenn designs her Pumpkin Stack Fall Planter:

![halloween bucket carving filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-9.jpg)

### 10\. Dough Halloween Cookies Bakery Products

If Halloween is more about spending time with friends and family, a bunch of laughter, fun, and creating memories, then it cannot get better than focusing on the sweet stuff, like the dough used to cook the Halloween cookies. When you imagine the scenario of dough mixing for the Halloween countdown timer video, it does not sound like much! But they are cool-looking and set the perfect backdrop for a countdown timer video:

You can use such clips individually or mix them with other stock video footage mentioned here to create a perfect Halloween vacation countdown clock video clip.

**Halloween Footage for Vertical Videos \[TikTok/Instagram Story\]:**

The above list discusses the panoramic footage suitable for big screens. If your screen is rather a vertical one, then you might be looking for vertical stock footage for the Halloween vacation countdown clock clip. Here are some vertical footage ideas and links to stock footage to create the perfect vertical vacation countdown clock video for Halloween:

### 1\. Woman Decorating for Halloween \[TikTok\]

Another simple backdrop for the Halloween countdown timer video is the decorations process to transform your indoors or outdoors for Halloween. And while you can use your own footage of decorating the house, chances are you may have missed filming yourself while decorating the house, given not everyone films themselves decorating the house and use it for their TikTok video. Here’s a video from Spooky Bones featuring the indoor decoration process for Halloween.

![women decorating for halloween filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-11.jpg)

### 2\. Girl Blonde Portrait Halloween

Another simple idea for a vertical countdown timer for Halloween is a scary face. In fact, if you are looking for the users to focus on the timer instead of footage is to use a slo-mo video, like this one from Tay. Tay tells a story about a real haunted house in her neighborhood while wearing scary Halloween makeup.

Of course, you can replace the story; and instead, use a clock with a girl wearing Halloween makeup.

![women wearing makeup filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-12.jpg)

### 3\. An Outdoor Table With Halloween Theme Settings

If you are looking to feature the vacation countdown clock outdoors in a vertical setup, then a table with a Halloween theme might create the perfect setting. After all, Halloween is all about setting the perfect theme, and featuring a non-relevant indoor or scary video outdoors spoils the theme. Take a look at how Stephanie Cunningham on TikTok showcases her outdoor table decoration setup for Halloween.

![table setting filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-13.jpg)

### 4\. A Kid In A Mummy Costume Holding A Halloween Bucket

If you are going for the classic mummy theme on Halloween, then how can you include any other footage than an actual mummy in the vertical countdown timer video? There are many ways to go about when looking to feature a mummy in the countdown clock; one idea is to show you made the mummy costumes, like Vina’s getup video on TikTok.

![mummy costume filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-14.jpg)

### 5\. Stop Motion Of Halloween Candy

Hosting a Halloween party for kids and in search of the perfect vertical footage for a Halloween vacation countdown clock video? It cannot get better than simply featuring a bunch of candy to lure the kids toward the countdown clock. When you look at this video and imagine using a clock for the countdown clock.

## Part 1\. What is Motion Blur Effects

Let's start with a little introduction before learning how to apply motion blur. The visual result of an item moving while being photographed in conjunction with the shutter speed of the camera is called motion blur. When we swiftly move our heads from side to side, this effect also naturally occurs with our eyes, but we aren't aware of it since our brains "edit" it for us. It may be startling and awkward to watch when items are moving on the screen, particularly rapid motion, without any kind of blurring effect.

Motion blur was introduced into animation to aid in the blending of frames and replicate the blurring that was seen in earlier cameras as a result of fast-moving objects. When a moving item keeps moving while light is still reaching our eyes, motion blur results. The goal of Motion Blur in After Effects is to replicate this phenomenon. After Effects will duplicate your layer several times when it changes in size or location. Then, it will offset it in various ways. This is closely related to the direction and pace of your layer's animation.

These days, we have cameras with fast shutter speeds, which allows us to almost completely remove motion blur. Without motion blurring, each frame of your animation is like a flawless still image, making the action seem a little disorienting. Each picture captures the exact moment in time, despite the fluid motion. However, the absence of motion blur is what viewers do notice. Because of this, visual effects creators often use artificial motion blur in their effects to replicate what the viewer would experience if the element were really there in the picture.

## Adobe Lightroom Color Grading Tutorial

The main focus of color grading is changing the colors and tones in your photographs. Recent updates to Lightroom and Photoshop's color grading functionality have improved its use and increased its capabilities. Color grading is ideal for giving your photograph a bit extra interest and improving the lighting.

All forms of photography benefit from and depend on color grading. The color grading tools in Lightroom and Photoshop will be especially appreciated by landscape and portrait photographers. If you're wondering what happened to split toning, it was replaced by the Color Grading module, which is why split toning is now referred to as color grading.

## 1\. Getting to Color Grading

Select the photo you want to modify and go to the develop module in Lightroom to access the Color Grading tool. Then, move your cursor down to the Color Grading menu on the right side of the screen. To see three separate color wheels, choose this.

The same choices are available in Photoshop's Camera Raw Filter. Simply scroll down on the right side of the screen once you've opened a photo in the Camera Raw Filter until you see Color Grading. The process of color grading is identical in Photoshop and Lightroom. I'll be using Lightroom to demonstrate the example photographs for the purposes of this blog article.

## 2\. How to Use Color Grading

The first thing you'll notice is that there are actually three identical color wheels. Each color wheel, though, has a distinct purpose. Midtones are controlled by the top wheel, shadows, and highlights by the left and right wheels, respectively.

Before moving on to the color grading stage, it's crucial to notice that you should balance the temperature and tint of your image. Instead of balancing the colors to create the image, color grading is a technique for enhancing the colors in the image.

Avoid using the midtones color wheel when using the Color Grading tool for the first time. First, try modifying only the highlights and shadows wheel. Warm hues in the highlights and cold colors in the shadows appear great in the majority of photographs. However, when using these sliders to create some truly incredible photos, you may let your creativity run wild!

I've added some yellow (warmth) to the highlights and some blue (coolness) to the shadows in this particular example. As a result, the sunlight in my image appears to be very warm and inviting, and the shadows take on a colder, bluer appearance.

The color wheels are actually fairly easy to use. To select a color, merely click and drag it anywhere on the color wheel. The color will become stronger the further you are from the circle's center. Each circle has a hidden slider bar underneath it. This modifies the related color wheel's brightness value. In other words, you can brighten or darken the highlights by adjusting the bar underneath the highlights color wheel. The ability to quickly change the brightness levels in the highlights, shadows, or midtones is a convenient feature.

Blending and balancing are the other two parameters that you can modify. You can alter how well the color in the highlights, midtones, or shadows blend with one another with the blending slider. The colors will blend in more naturally by moving the blending slider higher.

The amount of the image that is judged to be in the highlights, shadows, or midtones can be changed with the balance slider. For instance, if I move the balance slider to the right, less of the highlights will show the adjustment. Only the highlights with the highest brightness will be affected by the change.

## 3\. HSL/Color Panel

Move to the HSL/Color Panel, which stands for Hue, Saturation, and Luminance, after your image is ready to use. It is located under Tone Curve in the Develop Panel. This adjustment panel, in contrast to the ones stated before, will let you change different colors in your image independently of one another. Hue, Saturation, and Luminance are the three modifications that each color will receive.

## 4\. Hue

Hue is measured in terms of the color wheel's degrees. It's possible to change the color's real shade in this panel. For instance, you can modify the turquoise or blue to a more greenish tone if your scenario is a beach (as in our example photo). It's advisable to begin making adjustments to your panel's Hue before moving on to the others.

## 5\. Saturation

The strength of the hue is known as saturation. (Remember that this HSL panel modification only affects the saturation of individual colors, not the saturation of the entire image.) In order to achieve a more subdued, muted appearance for this example, I reduced the Saturation on the aqua, blue, and green hues. To increase the intensity of your shot, you can do the exact reverse. Find the tweaks that suit your photo and the appearance you want to achieve best.

## 6\. Luminance

Each color's luminance measures how brightly it reflects light. Use this tool to brighten or darken specific areas of your image (it works especially well to provide contrast to black and white images). To make the water and sky behind the model darker in this example photograph, I decreased the Luminance setting on the aqua panel.

## 7\. Adjustment Brush

Further isolate a section of your image using the Adjustment Brush so that you can change the Hue and any other parameters you like. Your Adjustment Brush is the final brush icon on the top of your editing panel. Adjust your Hue and begin painting on your image where you wish to change the color to begin color grading.(At the bottom of the Adjustment Brush Panel, you can adjust the brush's size or feathering.)

This is perfect if you only want to edit one part of your shot. You can keep using the adjustments after you've painted your image to witness more changes as they happen in real time.

Here are a few tips to set you on the correct course because color grading might take some time and practice to master. Shooting in RAW will give you the most dynamic control over your colors, so be sure to do this. Try your best to start with a good photograph and to alter your default settings so that the canvas is even. Use color psychology to visually transmit the mood or feeling you wish to portray through color grading.

Utilize each panel to practice and experiment. There is no right or wrong method to color grade; it all depends on how you want your photographs to look stylistically. Press the Reset button in the right -hand corner of your panel to return to your original image.
