## How to Create and Use Adjustment Layers in After Effects

Adobe After Effects is a significant video editing software that is used to add animating effects, transitions, intros, outros, and visual effects. You can launch this software on Windows and Mac effectively. Using this high-end software allows you to work on team projects as it consists of auto-saving features.

Moreover, you can add adjustment layers on After Effects to make your video editing more efficient. If you don’t know **what the adjustment layer in After Effects is**, this article will help you.

## Part 1: What is the Adjustment Layer in After Effects?

The adjustment layer can save you time and energy from adding effects to multiple clips individually. It does not alter the composition of your video clip until you start applying the effects. Once you add the effect in the adjustment layer, it will replace the effect on all the layers under it.

You can add the adjustment layers in your timeline for creating visual effects such as film grain or color grading. Using the adjustment layer, you can produce transition effects by adding effects to shorter compositions. However, if you want to use the adjustment layer properly, you should select its position carefully in the layer’s stack.

![adjustment layer in after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/adjustment-layers-in-after-effects-2.jpg)

Moreover, always keep in mind that anything placed under the adjustment layer will have a direct effect. In contrast, anything above the adjustment layer won’t get affected. Hence, you can use adjustment layers in After Effects for your convenience to apply all kinds of effects from color to distortion.
