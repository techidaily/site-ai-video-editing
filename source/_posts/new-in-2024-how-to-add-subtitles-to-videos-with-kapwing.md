### **Step 3: Adjust the Speed with Filmora**

Filmora for Android offers two methods to edit the speed of your video. You can use the speed slider for direct editing or the Speed Ramping feature for a more creative approach.

##### Method 1Use the Uniform Speed Slider

Tap the video that you have imported. Then, select the speed slider at the bottom of the screen. Adjust the speed of the video by dragging the speed slider to the left or right. Once satisfied, tap the Check button and save your video.

##### Method 2Use the Speed Ramping Feature

With the Speed Ramping feature, adjust the speed of your Android video gradually in a more creative manner. You may slow it down at the beginning or the end while accelerating the middle. This makes the video fun and more engaging to your audience.

To use this feature on Filmora for Android, tap on the video clip and select the Speed Ramping icon at the bottom of the screen. Use the graph that appears to adjust how you want the video to slow down or speed up when playing it back. Tap on the Check button once done and save your video.
