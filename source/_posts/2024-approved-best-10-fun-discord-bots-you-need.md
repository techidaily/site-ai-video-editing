![Control playback speed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/1-step-by-step-guide-control-playback-speed-in-premiere-pro.png)

In terms of video editing, Adobe Premiere Pro is one of the most powerful applications on the market, and it's well-known for its versatility. Speeding up movies is one of the program's many features required for the insertion of special effects and transitions. A lot of ways are there for you to pick from while using premiere pro to speed up the film as desired.

![speed up the film as desired](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/2-step-by-step-guide-control-playback-speed-in-premiere-pro.png)

You can't overwrite or replace your media files by doing anything in Premiere Pro, which means that nothing you do will have an effect on your media files. The point remains: a copy of your project and all its media assets should always be kept on hand just in case.

Adobe Premiere Pro is an excellent editing tool in terms of its functionality and capabilities. Still, it has a steep hill to climb that makes it difficult for newbies and users without previous editing experience. To get the most out of Adobe Premiere Pro, one must thoroughly understand the product.

![Adobe Premiere Pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/3-step-by-step-guide-control-playback-speed-in-premiere-pro.png)

No need to worry, folks; as in this article, we will be looking at how we can alter premiere pro speed.

## Fast Forward or Speed up Playback Speed in Premiere Pro

On analog editing systems, the speed of film could permanently be altered; but, because of the limitations of the technology, if you slowed anything down too much, the frame rate at which it was taken may become evident, and the image quality would begin to suffer as a consequence.

Adobe Premiere Pro is a feature-rich and professional video editor designed for the Macintosh platform. It has a variety of editing features built-in. Adobe Premiere Pro lets you change and control the speed at which movies are played back.

Premiere provides three choices for adjusting the tempo of a movie or speeding it up. We'll go over them one by one as we scroll down the page.

![Speed up the film in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/4-step-by-step-guide-control-playback-speed-in-premiere-pro.png)

### Method 1

* Download and Install Adobe Premiere Pro. Launch the application on your system.
* Once you've set up a new project in Adobe Premiere Pro, import the video you want to edit.
* In order to place the video where you want it, drag the necessary video clips into the timeline. In the end, you'll have a new series to call your own.
* Using the right-click menu, you may choose the whole movie or only a portion of it that you wish to edit.
* The popup dialog box will display if you choose Speed/Duration from the context menu list.
* Choose Clip> Speed Duration instead from the program's drop-down menu.
* The Speed field should be raised, and then the OK button should be pressed to accept the change.

### Method 2: Rate Stretch Tool

Adobe Premiere Pro has a Rate Stretch feature that lets you manually alter the movie's tempo by sliding the trim bar along the timeline. To utilize the Rate Stretch tool to speed up a video clip, you must first divide the movie into pieces.

Here's a quick method for altering the video speed so that it fits under the time limit:

* Launch the application on your respective systems.
* Drag and drop the selected video onto the timeline in Premiere Pro.
* Then, choose the Ripple Edit Tool from the toolbar, followed by the Rate Stretch Tool by clicking and holding the Ripple Edit Tool. Click the Rate Stretch button on the timeline's left side to begin a timer.
* You may also use the R key on your keyboard to activate the Rate Stretch Tool, which is a shortcut key.
* Drag the video's start and endpoints to their respective ends on the right and left sides to prolong or reduce the duration. As a consequence, the video speed will be improved. The bigger the period of time the video is dragged inwards, the faster it rises.

### Method 3: Time Remapping Tool

In Adobe Premiere Pro, the time remapping tool is where you go to speed up a selected video section. With a video clip, this function may be utilized to create the illusion of speed and slowness.

* It's time to fire up Adobe Premiere Pro and start fiddling with your footage.
* Simply right-click on it to bring up the context menu, and then choose Show Clip Keyframes from the display list. Afterward, choose Time Remapping from the context menu that opens.
* Click on it to make it go faster. The video will be colored blue, and a horizontal rubber band line will be drawn down its center if this option is selected. One of the video's frame rate lines may be found here.
* A white speed-control track may be seen just below the title bar in the upper part of the video. If you can't see it well when zooming in, you may try again. The rubber band may be dragged higher in Premiere Pro to speed up the video.

The tooltip will show how long it has been since the change happened compared to the original speed. As the movie progresses, so does the speed at which it is shown, and the duration of the video fluctuates as well. The audio remains unaltered and tied to the video when using Time Remapping.

## How to Slow Down A Video in Premiere Pro?

Now, let’s discuss how to slow down a video in premiere pro

### Time stretch

A one-second video clip at 60 frames per second is an example of this situation. When the game is being played at a reasonable speed on any given platform or software, 60 frames will be shown. Because of this, each frame will take twice as long to play at a 0.5X slower pace.

To put it another way, you'd see 30 frames in a second that weren't repeated. A second has been added to the video's duration, which will now be 2 seconds instead of 1\. There will be no deterioration in quality in this situation.

* Create a new project in Premiere Pro on your PC.
* To import a video file, choose Import from the File menu at the top of the screen. After that, drag the video into either the timeline or the project panel, whichever you like.
* Right-clicking and choosing the Duration/Speed option causes the video to begin playing.
* This stage necessitates a decrease in speed from 100% to a lower percentage.

### Using Keyframes

When you attempt to slow down a video by adjusting the frame rate, you are essentially eliminating frames from the video stream. This procedure will allow you to slow down a movie to your desired speed without sacrificing quality.

* After downloading and installing Adobe Premiere Pro, the first step is to launch the program. Later, you'll need to choose a specific video that you'd want to have slowed down.
* After you've chosen it, you may upload it to Premiere Pro. After importing the video, you must drag and drop it into the timeline in Premiere.
* By right-clicking the mouse, choose Modify > Interpret from the drop-down menu.
* You'll need to make some changes to the frame information now. Hit the Assume this frame rate button and input a value that is lower than the original video frame rate.

### Utlizing Time Remapping

The remapping tool is a very common tool for creating slow-motion videos. It may be found in many video editing programs. It gives you the option of selecting a particular section of a video clip and then slowing down the video clip.

* Launching Adobe Premiere Pro is the initial step once it has been downloaded and installed on your computer. A particular video that you'd want slow-motioned will need to be selected later on in the process.
* After dragging the video to the timeline, you'll need to choose the area of the movie that you want to slow down.
* Now you must choose the Key Frames and Speed from your video by clicking on the video's right-click menu.
* Only the "Pen Tool" must be used to lock the specific region you wish to slow down in order to push the Speed Line through the Selection tool to slow down the video during this phase.

## Why Is Premiere Pro Playback Fast?

If this issue arises in your program, you'll notice choppy playback, a character that speaks too rapidly, and audio that skips frames in the narration.

The multimedia editor Premiere Pro is one of the best currently available on the market. In addition to creating YouTube videos, feature films, music videos, and other sorts of content, many professionals turn to it.

It is said that Adobe Premiere Pro suffers from a playback issue. It has the ability to make the video creation process more complicated and demanding than it should be. Let me show you how to fix this easy error in just two simple steps.

* Start the program on your computer's operating system.

* Select Edit from the drop-down menu.

* Look towards preference

* Afterward, choose audio hardware.

* No input should be used as the default input, regardless of what it is currently set to.

* When you click on Playback your film, you will notice that the issue has been rectified.

No need to worry, folks; as in this article, we will be looking at how we can alter premiere pro speed.

## Fast Forward or Speed up Playback Speed in Premiere Pro

On analog editing systems, the speed of film could permanently be altered; but, because of the limitations of the technology, if you slowed anything down too much, the frame rate at which it was taken may become evident, and the image quality would begin to suffer as a consequence.

Adobe Premiere Pro is a feature-rich and professional video editor designed for the Macintosh platform. It has a variety of editing features built-in. Adobe Premiere Pro lets you change and control the speed at which movies are played back.

Premiere provides three choices for adjusting the tempo of a movie or speeding it up. We'll go over them one by one as we scroll down the page.

![Speed up the film in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/4-step-by-step-guide-control-playback-speed-in-premiere-pro.png)

### Method 1

* Download and Install Adobe Premiere Pro. Launch the application on your system.
* Once you've set up a new project in Adobe Premiere Pro, import the video you want to edit.
* In order to place the video where you want it, drag the necessary video clips into the timeline. In the end, you'll have a new series to call your own.
* Using the right-click menu, you may choose the whole movie or only a portion of it that you wish to edit.
* The popup dialog box will display if you choose Speed/Duration from the context menu list.
* Choose Clip> Speed Duration instead from the program's drop-down menu.
* The Speed field should be raised, and then the OK button should be pressed to accept the change.

### Method 2: Rate Stretch Tool

Adobe Premiere Pro has a Rate Stretch feature that lets you manually alter the movie's tempo by sliding the trim bar along the timeline. To utilize the Rate Stretch tool to speed up a video clip, you must first divide the movie into pieces.

Here's a quick method for altering the video speed so that it fits under the time limit:

* Launch the application on your respective systems.
* Drag and drop the selected video onto the timeline in Premiere Pro.
* Then, choose the Ripple Edit Tool from the toolbar, followed by the Rate Stretch Tool by clicking and holding the Ripple Edit Tool. Click the Rate Stretch button on the timeline's left side to begin a timer.
* You may also use the R key on your keyboard to activate the Rate Stretch Tool, which is a shortcut key.
* Drag the video's start and endpoints to their respective ends on the right and left sides to prolong or reduce the duration. As a consequence, the video speed will be improved. The bigger the period of time the video is dragged inwards, the faster it rises.

### Method 3: Time Remapping Tool

In Adobe Premiere Pro, the time remapping tool is where you go to speed up a selected video section. With a video clip, this function may be utilized to create the illusion of speed and slowness.

* It's time to fire up Adobe Premiere Pro and start fiddling with your footage.
* Simply right-click on it to bring up the context menu, and then choose Show Clip Keyframes from the display list. Afterward, choose Time Remapping from the context menu that opens.
* Click on it to make it go faster. The video will be colored blue, and a horizontal rubber band line will be drawn down its center if this option is selected. One of the video's frame rate lines may be found here.
* A white speed-control track may be seen just below the title bar in the upper part of the video. If you can't see it well when zooming in, you may try again. The rubber band may be dragged higher in Premiere Pro to speed up the video.

The tooltip will show how long it has been since the change happened compared to the original speed. As the movie progresses, so does the speed at which it is shown, and the duration of the video fluctuates as well. The audio remains unaltered and tied to the video when using Time Remapping.

## How to Slow Down A Video in Premiere Pro?

Now, let’s discuss how to slow down a video in premiere pro

### Time stretch

A one-second video clip at 60 frames per second is an example of this situation. When the game is being played at a reasonable speed on any given platform or software, 60 frames will be shown. Because of this, each frame will take twice as long to play at a 0.5X slower pace.

To put it another way, you'd see 30 frames in a second that weren't repeated. A second has been added to the video's duration, which will now be 2 seconds instead of 1\. There will be no deterioration in quality in this situation.

* Create a new project in Premiere Pro on your PC.

* After you've chosen it, you may upload it to Premiere Pro. After importing the video, you must drag and drop it into the timeline in Premiere.
* By right-clicking the mouse, choose Modify > Interpret from the drop-down menu.
* You'll need to make some changes to the frame information now. Hit the Assume this frame rate button and input a value that is lower than the original video frame rate.

### Utlizing Time Remapping

The remapping tool is a very common tool for creating slow-motion videos. It may be found in many video editing programs. It gives you the option of selecting a particular section of a video clip and then slowing down the video clip.

* Launching Adobe Premiere Pro is the initial step once it has been downloaded and installed on your computer. A particular video that you'd want slow-motioned will need to be selected later on in the process.
* After dragging the video to the timeline, you'll need to choose the area of the movie that you want to slow down.
* Now you must choose the Key Frames and Speed from your video by clicking on the video's right-click menu.
* Only the "Pen Tool" must be used to lock the specific region you wish to slow down in order to push the Speed Line through the Selection tool to slow down the video during this phase.

![Control playback speed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/1-step-by-step-guide-control-playback-speed-in-premiere-pro.png)

In terms of video editing, Adobe Premiere Pro is one of the most powerful applications on the market, and it's well-known for its versatility. Speeding up movies is one of the program's many features required for the insertion of special effects and transitions. A lot of ways are there for you to pick from while using premiere pro to speed up the film as desired.

![speed up the film as desired](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/2-step-by-step-guide-control-playback-speed-in-premiere-pro.png)

You can't overwrite or replace your media files by doing anything in Premiere Pro, which means that nothing you do will have an effect on your media files. The point remains: a copy of your project and all its media assets should always be kept on hand just in case.

Adobe Premiere Pro is an excellent editing tool in terms of its functionality and capabilities. Still, it has a steep hill to climb that makes it difficult for newbies and users without previous editing experience. To get the most out of Adobe Premiere Pro, one must thoroughly understand the product.

![Adobe Premiere Pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/3-step-by-step-guide-control-playback-speed-in-premiere-pro.png)

No need to worry, folks; as in this article, we will be looking at how we can alter premiere pro speed.

## Fast Forward or Speed up Playback Speed in Premiere Pro

On analog editing systems, the speed of film could permanently be altered; but, because of the limitations of the technology, if you slowed anything down too much, the frame rate at which it was taken may become evident, and the image quality would begin to suffer as a consequence.

Adobe Premiere Pro is a feature-rich and professional video editor designed for the Macintosh platform. It has a variety of editing features built-in. Adobe Premiere Pro lets you change and control the speed at which movies are played back.

Premiere provides three choices for adjusting the tempo of a movie or speeding it up. We'll go over them one by one as we scroll down the page.

![Speed up the film in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/4-step-by-step-guide-control-playback-speed-in-premiere-pro.png)

### Method 1

* Download and Install Adobe Premiere Pro. Launch the application on your system.
* Once you've set up a new project in Adobe Premiere Pro, import the video you want to edit.
* In order to place the video where you want it, drag the necessary video clips into the timeline. In the end, you'll have a new series to call your own.
* Using the right-click menu, you may choose the whole movie or only a portion of it that you wish to edit.
* The popup dialog box will display if you choose Speed/Duration from the context menu list.
* Choose Clip> Speed Duration instead from the program's drop-down menu.
* The Speed field should be raised, and then the OK button should be pressed to accept the change.

### Method 2: Rate Stretch Tool

Adobe Premiere Pro has a Rate Stretch feature that lets you manually alter the movie's tempo by sliding the trim bar along the timeline. To utilize the Rate Stretch tool to speed up a video clip, you must first divide the movie into pieces.

Here's a quick method for altering the video speed so that it fits under the time limit:

* Launch the application on your respective systems.
* Drag and drop the selected video onto the timeline in Premiere Pro.
* Then, choose the Ripple Edit Tool from the toolbar, followed by the Rate Stretch Tool by clicking and holding the Ripple Edit Tool. Click the Rate Stretch button on the timeline's left side to begin a timer.
* You may also use the R key on your keyboard to activate the Rate Stretch Tool, which is a shortcut key.
* Drag the video's start and endpoints to their respective ends on the right and left sides to prolong or reduce the duration. As a consequence, the video speed will be improved. The bigger the period of time the video is dragged inwards, the faster it rises.

### Method 3: Time Remapping Tool

In Adobe Premiere Pro, the time remapping tool is where you go to speed up a selected video section. With a video clip, this function may be utilized to create the illusion of speed and slowness.

* It's time to fire up Adobe Premiere Pro and start fiddling with your footage.
* Simply right-click on it to bring up the context menu, and then choose Show Clip Keyframes from the display list. Afterward, choose Time Remapping from the context menu that opens.
* Click on it to make it go faster. The video will be colored blue, and a horizontal rubber band line will be drawn down its center if this option is selected. One of the video's frame rate lines may be found here.
* A white speed-control track may be seen just below the title bar in the upper part of the video. If you can't see it well when zooming in, you may try again. The rubber band may be dragged higher in Premiere Pro to speed up the video.

The tooltip will show how long it has been since the change happened compared to the original speed. As the movie progresses, so does the speed at which it is shown, and the duration of the video fluctuates as well. The audio remains unaltered and tied to the video when using Time Remapping.

## How to Slow Down A Video in Premiere Pro?

Now, let’s discuss how to slow down a video in premiere pro

### Time stretch

A one-second video clip at 60 frames per second is an example of this situation. When the game is being played at a reasonable speed on any given platform or software, 60 frames will be shown. Because of this, each frame will take twice as long to play at a 0.5X slower pace.

To put it another way, you'd see 30 frames in a second that weren't repeated. A second has been added to the video's duration, which will now be 2 seconds instead of 1\. There will be no deterioration in quality in this situation.

* Create a new project in Premiere Pro on your PC.
* To import a video file, choose Import from the File menu at the top of the screen. After that, drag the video into either the timeline or the project panel, whichever you like.
* Right-clicking and choosing the Duration/Speed option causes the video to begin playing.
* This stage necessitates a decrease in speed from 100% to a lower percentage.

### Using Keyframes

When you attempt to slow down a video by adjusting the frame rate, you are essentially eliminating frames from the video stream. This procedure will allow you to slow down a movie to your desired speed without sacrificing quality.

* After downloading and installing Adobe Premiere Pro, the first step is to launch the program. Later, you'll need to choose a specific video that you'd want to have slowed down.
* After you've chosen it, you may upload it to Premiere Pro. After importing the video, you must drag and drop it into the timeline in Premiere.
* By right-clicking the mouse, choose Modify > Interpret from the drop-down menu.
* You'll need to make some changes to the frame information now. Hit the Assume this frame rate button and input a value that is lower than the original video frame rate.

### Utlizing Time Remapping

The remapping tool is a very common tool for creating slow-motion videos. It may be found in many video editing programs. It gives you the option of selecting a particular section of a video clip and then slowing down the video clip.

* Launching Adobe Premiere Pro is the initial step once it has been downloaded and installed on your computer. A particular video that you'd want slow-motioned will need to be selected later on in the process.
* After dragging the video to the timeline, you'll need to choose the area of the movie that you want to slow down.
* Now you must choose the Key Frames and Speed from your video by clicking on the video's right-click menu.
* Only the "Pen Tool" must be used to lock the specific region you wish to slow down in order to push the Speed Line through the Selection tool to slow down the video during this phase.

## Why Is Premiere Pro Playback Fast?

If this issue arises in your program, you'll notice choppy playback, a character that speaks too rapidly, and audio that skips frames in the narration.

The multimedia editor Premiere Pro is one of the best currently available on the market. In addition to creating YouTube videos, feature films, music videos, and other sorts of content, many professionals turn to it.

It is said that Adobe Premiere Pro suffers from a playback issue. It has the ability to make the video creation process more complicated and demanding than it should be. Let me show you how to fix this easy error in just two simple steps.

* Start the program on your computer's operating system.

* Select Edit from the drop-down menu.

* Look towards preference

* Afterward, choose audio hardware.

* No input should be used as the default input, regardless of what it is currently set to.

* When you click on Playback your film, you will notice that the issue has been rectified.

## What Is Motion Blur in the Game? Do You Really Need It?

Video games, as a whole, have developed exceptionally in the market over the past two decades. With new technology taking charge, different effects and enhancements have risen and introduced contemporary gaming designs. Amidst this transition, the development of games with the motion blur effect is also present. But does a gamer need a motion blur effect in their games?

Although motion blur is present in many game settings, it has not been acknowledged in the gaming community. However, there are still doubts about this effect. In this article, we will discuss **motion blur gaming** in detail. We will also decide whether gamers require a motion blur effect in their games. Read this article to know if motion blur is beneficial or problematic for gamers.

![motion blur in games](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-games-1.jpg)

## Part 1: What is Motion Blur?

The motion blur effect has been a part of many movies and videos. It has been used as a source to display objects moving at high speed. This effect is bridged in situations where the objects moving in speed are directed in a single direction. However, this effect is not adjusting the object in a frame but creates an apparent blur.

If you tend to pause that video or movie during the motion blur effect, you will find the picture blurred in a specific direction. This is because the camera records the blur as the motion information, providing a realistic effect. Many filmmakers and videographers utilize this feature and tend to develop a sense of fast-moving objects. This advancement has turned out to be quite successful.

![what is motion blur](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-games-2.jpg)

With the help of the information recorded through motion blur, the high-speed objects moving within the frame are coherent within the 24 frames, which is the standard frame rate per second. However, motion blur has also been tested at 29.97 and 30fps, which does show diversity in its functionality.

### An Overview of Stop-Motion Animation Effect

If you tend to display the cohesive effect of the object within the image, you will have to cut short the particular clip. It should be done in 24 frames to achieve a frame-by-frame display of the object with changing direction. This removes the dynamic blur within the video. However, it displays another effect generally referred to as stop-motion animation.

Talking about this principle, stop-motion animation is quite common in old animated films. The movement was displayed by taking snapshots of every frame with the object displaced within each frame. Combining these snapshots, a complete stop-motion effect was created, making footage. The animation is captured one frame at a time, with a sequenced display. However, no blurring is present within the animation, making both discussed effects different.

![stop-motion animation effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-games-3.jpg)

## Part 2: What is Motion Blur in Games? Why Do Games Have It?

Once you understand the concept of motion blur, it is time to figure out **what motion blur is in games.** This particular effect has not only been used in films but is now taking place within games for a realistic effect. Unfortunately, the use of stop-motion animation within the games is not effective. Although it has a standard frame rate of 24fps, the screen always lags.

Since the recorded action is manually adjusted within the frames, the motion is inaccurate, indicating the need for a motion blur effect in games. Talking about motion blur in games, this particular effect was not observed for a long time. The use of motion blur increases the quality of the game, but it also enhances the size of the game, which requires better equipment.

The games did not include the effect for quite a long time. Every frame was clear since the stop-motion animation runs under this principle. The clarity in frames, if operated at 24fps, the standard rate for stop-motion animation, will show screen lags. This is why the games were operated at least 30fps to be almost smooth.

When these screens were to display high-speed movement, the game had 30fps displayed lag on screen. Rapid changes in cameras led to the need for games to include **motion blur gaming.** This was based on smoothening the fast-moving effect covered in 30fps or less. Motion blur has improved the overall video output effects of the game. Due to motion blur, you can observe better transitions with a smooth flow at a lower fps rate.

![what is motion blur in games](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-games-4.jpg)

## Part 3: Should Motion Blur in Game Be On or Off?

The question that arises, in this case, is whether you should keep **the motion blur on or off.** To answer this question, you will have to observe why gamers dislike motion blur in games. As this effect is most prominent in conditions where the screen's frame rate is 30fps or lesser, it becomes redundant if the screen's frame rate is less than it.

Although you have heard that motion blur makes a screen smooth, this goes the other way in such situations. The display gets sticky for screens with lower frame rates, making the user dizzy. A good gaming engine provides the function of automatically adjusting the motion blur effect against the screen's frame rate. However, if the user is not playing such quality games, they will face this issue.

It is better to turn off the motion blur effect for games without this adjustment or conditions where the output video remains sticky. For smoother results, the motion blur effect is preferred. It clarifies that the problem generally ranges from player to player. This clearly explains that motion blur is not the culprit in this situation.

![condition of using motion blur](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-games-5.jpg)

## Part 4: Is Motion Blur Good for FPS? Does it Increase FPS?

Motion blur, as explained above, is pleasing if it makes your results smoother. Generally, this is the reason why **motion blur gaming** was considered. Thus, motion blur is good for FPS; however, it does not increase the frame rates of your computer’s screen. The explanation above shows that motion blur has nothing to do with increasing the frame rates. It blurs the object's trail by sustaining the video within the same frame rates.

The brain corrects the pictures the eye observes since it is being observed in natural circumstances. The use of motion blur improves the experience. Along with that, the results are always considered realistic under dynamic blur. In conclusion, motion blur is considered much more effective in video games.

## Bonus Tips – How to Add Motion Blur to Your Gaming Video
