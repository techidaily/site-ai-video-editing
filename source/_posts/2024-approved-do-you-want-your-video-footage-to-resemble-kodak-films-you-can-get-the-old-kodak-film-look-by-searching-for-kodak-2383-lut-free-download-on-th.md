For example, for YouTube, the commonly used aspect ratio is 16:9, which is a standard for almost all videos. However, for TikTok, the required aspect ratio is 9:16.

The video’s original aspect ratio is based on the default settings of the recording device. Some phones and tablets provide the option of changing your video’s aspect ratio before you start recording. But it can also be changed afterward with the help of editing software.
