Artificial Intelligence is the replacement of human processes by machines and computer systems. It can replicate intelligent human behaviors, including facial expression recognition, problem-solving, and learning.

**AI video interviewing**, an increasingly popular assessment tool driven by artificial intelligence, is being incorporated by many large companies that receive thousands of job applications. AI electronically analyses many aspects of a video interview, including the candidate's body language, facial expressions, word choices, and tone of voice. It can also track eye movements to determine whether candidates are looking at resources around them.

With the introduction of artificial intelligence, many tech companies and individuals have taken a likeness of it and have grown to utilize it to carry out tasks. Reconsider your position as applicants get selected by assessing their performance in the **AI-based video interview** against a large inventory of facial and linguistic information.

#### In this article

01 [How AI is Being Used in a Job Interview](#Part 1)

02 [How to Ace an AI Video Interview](#Part 2)

03 [Role of AI in a Video Interview](#Part 3)

04 [Role of AI in Video Making](#Part 4)

## Part 1 **How AI is being used in a job interview.**

In most cases, **an AI video interview** is the initial stage in the hiring process, in place of or in addition to a typical cover letter and CV. It functions similarly to a face-to-face interview. Candidates get a series of job-specific interview questions, after which they have to record their responses on video with their smartphone or computer.

You'll have a few minutes to answer each question as a candidate before going on to the next. Each exam takes about 20 minutes to complete and can be in any location convenient for you, whether in your living room, a quiet coffee shop nook, or somewhere else.

Each interview follows the same format, ensuring a similar experience for all individuals seeking that particular position.

The algorithm (also known as an assessment model) will assist the recruiter in making a more informed judgment if AI is in the process. It accomplishes this by identifying which candidates are most likely to succeed in the post based on data sets that predict job performance.

## Part 2 **How to Ace an AI video interview.**

Planning ahead of time might make you feel less anxious and appear more confident, at ease, and relaxed. Here are some ideas for using artificial intelligence in video interviews.

It would help if you first determined whether you are going for an **AI-based video interview,** i.e., if you get an invite to a pre-recorded video interview via a platform. Massive firms are now using this type of interview to interview many possible employees without bias.

### 01**Prepare for the interview differently.**

![Prepare for the
        Interview Differently](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-1.jpg)

When in an **AI interview**, you need to prepare differently. It's not the same as a human-to-human interview. There will be no feedback from the person at the other end of the interview. Research the use of **AI in interviews** to know how it works. Remember to research the company in question as well.

### 02**Go straight to the point.**

![Go Straight to
        the Point](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-2.jpg)

Remember that you're having an interview with a robot and not a human, so skip the small talk and hit the nail on the head. It is better to state your point clearly and straight to the end.

### 03**Find a suitable environment for your interview.**

![Find a Suitable Environment](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-3.jpg)

Most **artificial intelligence video interviews** take place through your webcam in the comfort of your home. So, it's essential to use an appropriate background. Your interview background should be clear of objects and distractions. It should also have enough lighting and be free from background noises since AI algorithms are designed to scan your environment and make deductions about you.

### 04**Dress well for your interview.**

![Dress well](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-4.jpg)

There won't be a human at the other end of the camera, so there's no need to dress up, right? That's wrong. You still need to dress well when attending a formal human job interview. Wear business casuals with plain colored clothes.

Another reason you want to dress professionally is that it can increase your self-confidence, making you relaxed and feel good about yourself.

### 05**Practice before the interview.**

![Practice Before the Interview](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-5.jpeg)

To ace an **AI interview**, practice in front of a friend or mirror in advance of your interview. You can do a mock interview or record yourself to identify likely mistakes and correct them. Practice by recording yourself and then replaying the video to see where you are making mistakes and need improvement.

### 06**Share your real-world experiences and provide proof.**

![Share Real World Experience](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-6.jpg)

Use real-world experiences to showcase your skills when responding to questions during an **AI interview**. To determine and ensure candidates' suitability, AI looks for specific soft skills like communication, the ability to take the initiative, and lots more. So, talk about them, use a practical example to illustrate your skills, and generally talk about your interview experience.

### 07**Smiling**

![Smiling](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-7.jpg)

Wear a pleasant smile as you answer. It is easy to forget to smile when focusing so hard on the questions, but remember to relax and act natural. Facial expressions such as smiling are criteria that **artificial intelligence interviewers** watch for. Remember to smile, nod, and Use Gestures During Your Interview to show that you are attentive.

### 08**Maintain eye contact and a neutral voice tone.**

![Maintain Eye

03 [Role of AI in a Video Interview](#Part 3)

04 [Role of AI in Video Making](#Part 4)

## Part 1 **How AI is being used in a job interview.**

In most cases, **an AI video interview** is the initial stage in the hiring process, in place of or in addition to a typical cover letter and CV. It functions similarly to a face-to-face interview. Candidates get a series of job-specific interview questions, after which they have to record their responses on video with their smartphone or computer.

You'll have a few minutes to answer each question as a candidate before going on to the next. Each exam takes about 20 minutes to complete and can be in any location convenient for you, whether in your living room, a quiet coffee shop nook, or somewhere else.

Each interview follows the same format, ensuring a similar experience for all individuals seeking that particular position.

The algorithm (also known as an assessment model) will assist the recruiter in making a more informed judgment if AI is in the process. It accomplishes this by identifying which candidates are most likely to succeed in the post based on data sets that predict job performance.

## Part 2 **How to Ace an AI video interview.**

Planning ahead of time might make you feel less anxious and appear more confident, at ease, and relaxed. Here are some ideas for using artificial intelligence in video interviews.

![Prepare for the
        Interview Differently](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-1.jpg)

Research the use of **AI in interviews** to know how it works. Remember to research the company in question as well.

### 02**Go straight to the point.**

![Go Straight to
        the Point](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-2.jpg)

### 03**Find a suitable environment for your interview.**

![Find a Suitable Environment](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-3.jpg)

To determine and ensure candidates' suitability, AI looks for specific soft skills like communication, the ability to take the initiative, and lots more. So, talk about them, use a practical example to illustrate your skills, and generally talk about your interview experience.

### 07**Smiling**

![Smiling](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-suggestions-for-ai-video-interviews-7.jpg)
