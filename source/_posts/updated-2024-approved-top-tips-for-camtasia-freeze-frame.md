## Create a Music Video Without a Keyboard

Let us get started! Whether you have a real mouseless experience or want to take it as a challenge, let's get the things clear first.

* We need to create a **20 seconds** music video.
* We will only be using the footage from the **stock library**.
* We will be using music from the **Wondershare** Filmora **library**.
* We will have 5 minutes to **review** the footage and the music available.
* And most importantly, we don’t have a **keyboard**.

Step 1\. Review your footage

Our first and most crucial step will be to use our imagination and creativity. So get those neurons firing, and let us go!

![reviewing the footage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-use-mouse-only-with-filmora-team-3.gif)

* Head to the **stock media** folder on the bar mentioned above, the Wondershare Filmora.
* Or you can simply look towards the left window, where you will find the sample **videos tab.**
* Click on the sample videos tab, and a new **window** will appear on the library screen.
* Here you will find almost more than **20 videos.**
* So apart from using the actual recorded footage, we will work our way with what we have from **default**.
* For the music, we would be scrolling in the **stock audio library.**
* Click on the **audio tab** above and start **scrolling**.
* You will also find some categories in the **left window**.
* Choose the category of your choice and **listen** to the audio.

Do whatever suit you best. Keep in mind you only have 5 minutes.

* After picking the song, move on to the sample videos tab and search for videos that match a **classic vibe.**
* Now random **close-up shots** of a piano, cinematic footage of a big **orchestra**, or simple landscapes with minimalistic movement while focusing on a single object, consider the example below.

## How to Create an Alternate Reality Effect

Ditch boring one-dimensional videos and create a mesmerizing video with this alternative reality effect you can easily create using Wondershare Filmora.

This cool effect enables you to show a dream-like scene where two mirrored footages appear within the same frame using the Masking feature. But why stop there?

Keep reading to find out how you can use this style of effect to spice up your daily vlog bumper intro or even for your upcoming sci-fi content.

## Preparing the footage

There are not many restrictions on preparing the footage for this effect. However, depending on the results you're aiming for, you might need to consider a few things.

First, a wider view and some camera panning, or tilting will deliver a better result as it provides angle variations. This will later enhance the dynamic of the scene, making it feels even more uncanny.

Then, while you're at it, you need to also figure out the purpose of the video itself. If you want to upload it to certain platforms where vertical videos are more popular, you will want to work on that as well. When you're shooting your footage, make sure that you're taking it at the correct angle that would fit the ratio you're aiming for.

Last but not least, consider the length of the footage. If you're planning to make a bumper video, you might want a quick yet comprehensive shot of the objects you want to highlight. You can always trim and adjust the timing later, but it is better to also plan it early.

## Editing the video

If you have your footage or stock video ready, then you can start editing. Follow this simple step-by-step guide to create your own alternate reality using [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

Step 1: Drag and drop the video footage into the timeline - this will be the bottom part of the scene. Go to **Effect > Utility > Image Mask**. Drag and drop it onto the video footage.

![open the utility menu to insert an image mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/alternate-reality-effect-2.gif)

Step 2: Adjust the mask by double-clicking the video footage. Go to **Setting > Mask Setting** and choose any shape you like. Set the feather number to 100.

![go to mask setting and adjust the feather number](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/alternate-reality-effect-3.jpg)

Step 3: Scroll up the **Setting > Transform**. Adjust the position of the video footage on the x and y-axis to ensure that the mask shows the bottom of the landscape view. Click Ok.

![adjust the position using the x and y-axis](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/alternate-reality-effect-4.jpg)

Step 4: Drag and drop the same video footage onto the timeline next to the first video footage. Place an Image Mask as well on this footage. This will be the upper part of the scene.

![drop the same footage on the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/alternate-reality-effect-5.gif)

Step 5: Double-click the second footage to open the Setting menu on the top left. Choose **Transform > Vertical Flip**.

![opt for a vertical flip transformation to the footage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/alternate-reality-effect-6.jpg)

Step 6: Scroll down the Setting menu to find the mask settings. Choose an opposing mask shape for this second footage then set the feather number to 100 as well.

![select an opposing mask shape](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/alternate-reality-effect-7.jpg)

Step 7: Adjust the video footage position by dragging the second footage to the second video track and aligning it with the first video footage.

![drag the second footage so that both overlap each other](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/alternate-reality-effect-8.jpg)

Step 8: Double-click to open the **Setting > Transform**, then, adjust the x and y-axis numbers to ensure that the mask reveals only the top half of the landscape. Click Ok.

You can recheck the preview at this stage and just save it as it is if you're already satisfied with the result. However, if you want a more dynamic alternate reality scene, continue reading to see advanced tips you can follow to make your video looks even more otherworldly.

## Enhancing the effect with rotation keyframes

If you're using stock videos or encountering limitations when making your footage, chances are your alternate reality is not looking as dynamic as you want it to be. Go all out by adding the rotation keyframes to the video footage so that the alternate reality looks more unreal.

Step 1: Double-click the video footage on the first video track to open the **Animation Settings > Customize**.

![open animation settings to customize keyframe rotation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/alternate-reality-effect-10.jpg)

Step 2: Move the playhead to the beginning of the first video footage and add a keyframe by clicking on the Add button. Set the rotation of this keyframe at 0 and the scale at 100.

![move the playhead to the beginning and click add](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/alternate-reality-effect-11.gif)

Step 3: Now move the playhead to the end of the video footage and add another keyframe. This time, set the rotation to 20 and adjust the scale number to 115.

![move the playhead to the end and click add](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/alternate-reality-effect-12.jpg)

Step 4: Do Steps 1 to 3 to the second video footage. Don't forget to preview the result to see if both footages are rotated properly.

![previewing the result](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/alternate-reality-effect-13.gif)
