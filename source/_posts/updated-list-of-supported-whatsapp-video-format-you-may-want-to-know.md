To apply the rotate filter...

Step 1: Import your video clip into Filmora.

Step 4: Select ‘Rotate 90 CCW’ or click Ctrl + Alt + Left to rotate the video 90 degrees counterclockwise.

Step 5: Repeat the steps until you are satisfied. Note: It can only rotate the video in the degrees of multiples of 90.

Filmora's rotate filter is very similar to Kdenlive's. However, there are a few differences. For example...

\- you can use the rotate filter on clips that are already rotated

\- you can change the rotation orientation of your clip.

If you need to rotate your video clip in a different direction, or if you want to create a 360-degree rotation, follow the below steps:

Click on the ‘Edit’ option in the tool above the timeline.

![rotate-video-kdenlive](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-kdenlive-13.png)

Select the ‘Transform’ option, then go to ‘Rotate’

![rotate-video-kdenlive](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-kdenlive-14.png)

Use the slider to set the amount of rotation you need.

![rotate-video-kdenlive](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-kdenlive-15.png)

![rotate-video-kdenlive](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-kdenlive-16.png)

The project settings allow you to rotate your video clip in any direction you need.

Both Filmora and Kdenlive offer a rotate filter that allows you to rotate your video clip by a certain amount. However, only Filmora offers the ability to rotate your video clip in any direction you need. Additionally, Filmora offers a wide range of features that can be used to create professional-quality videos.

Step 1: To get started, log into your Clipchamp account or create a free account.

![fake-facetime-call-video-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/fake-facetime-call-video-12.jpg)

Step 2: Click the 'Create a video' button on the left sidebar. There are five different forms from which to pick. First, choose the video aspect ratio that works best for your project. For example, if you wish to upload to YouTube, we recommend shooting in widescreen 16:9.

![fake-facetime-call-video-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/fake-facetime-call-video-13.jpg)

Step 3: Click 'Add media' and drag and drop your films, audio, and photographs into the media box if you already have filmed footage you'd like to utilize in your project. You may also add media by clicking 'Browse my files.' If you wish to use free stock footage, go to 'Stock' and upload your films to the project by clicking the '+' button. All your films will be saved in your library.

![fake-facetime-call-video-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/fake-facetime-call-video-14.jpg)

Step 4: You can now find your videos in your media library. Drag and drop the picture-in-picture videos you want to alter to the editing timeline. As shown in the sample below, arrange the two videos one over the other. Make sure both clips are precisely underneath one another.

![fake-facetime-call-video-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/fake-facetime-call-video-15.jpg)

Step 5: Now that your movies are aligned, select the one you want to shrink. The video you're reducing must be at the top of the screen. To move it from the bottom to the top, drag and drop it. A small box will appear on the timeline in the bottom left corner of the clip. The clip will shrink when you click the box once. When you click the box once again, modifying choices will appear. You can move the smaller video around and increase or decrease its size.

![fake-facetime-call-video-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/fake-facetime-call-video-16.jpg)

Step 6: Export your project once you've completed editing your video. Save to your preferred place or folder. You can share the video straight on social media or embed it in a document.

### 5\. Movavi

Compatibility: Windows/Mac

Movavi Video Editor is a video editing tool for Windows that is powerful and simple to use. Apply stunning video effects and filters, add music and titles, and more! Yet, despite its enormous features, Movavi's video editing program is quite simple to use: add a sprinkle of fantasy and some spare time, and you'll have a Hollywood-style video with far less effort.

#### Steps

**Step 1: Download the software.**

 Download the installation file and run it. Follow the on-screen directions. Following the setup, the PiP editor will launch.

**Step 2: Import files**

Select two files: the one you want to use as a background and the one you want to display over it by clicking Add Files.

![fake-facetime-call-video-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/fake-facetime-call-video-18.jpg)

**Step 3: Create a video track**

Make an extra video track before you begin video editing. To do so, go to the Plus menu and select Add Video Track. Then, drag one of the videos to the secondary track and the other to the primary track.

From the menu, select the Picture in Picture option. To change the size of the video, drag the boundaries. Then, drag it to the desired location on the background video by clicking and holding.

![fake-facetime-call-video-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/fake-facetime-call-video-19.jpg)

**Step 4: Export and Save**

Save your PiP video once you've finished editing it. First, select the video format, quality, and folder where the file will be saved by clicking Export and adjusting the parameters in the display popup. Then press the Start button. The picture-in-picture video editor will open the folder holding the file after the Export is complete.

## FAQs

### 1\. How do you make a facetime video call?

Tap New FaceTime towards the top of the screen in FaceTime.

Tap to make a video call or an audio call after typing the name or number you wish to call in the top field (not available in all countries or regions). You can also tap instead.

### 2\. How do you add a virtual background on Facetime?

To change the background, use a filter: s

1. Tap your tile, then tap during a FaceTime video call (supported models).
2. Open the filters by tapping.
3. Select your look by tapping a filter at the bottom of the screen (swipe left or right to preview them).

### 4\. Does Facetime have virtual backgrounds?

No. Facetime does have virtual backgrounds, but it allows the users to blur the background.

### 5\. Can you get fake facetime calls?

There is less probability of getting fake facetime calls, but you might spam FaceTime calls from random numbers.

### 6\. Can you Facetime a random number?

FaceTime isn't any different. A caller could try their luck by FaceTime a random phone number or email address, and if they belong to an iPhone user or an Apple ID, the FaceTime call will be accepted.

### 7\. Can you Facetime from an unknown number?

Switching to your email address for FaceTime audio and video chats is the way to go if you always want to keep your phone number private. You may even go a step further and only receive FaceTime calls via email, with your phone number serving as your FaceTime caller ID.

### 8\. How do I call someone on Facetime?

Launch FaceTime. In the search field, type the names, phone numbers, or email addresses of the persons you wish to contact. Then, click the video or audio icon, depending on the type of call you wish to make. To begin the call, press the video or audio button in the screen's bottom-left corner.

### 9\. Can you create a background on Facetime?

No. However, FaceTime allows you to apply camera effects on video calls.
