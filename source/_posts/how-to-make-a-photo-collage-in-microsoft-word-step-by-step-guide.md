## Part 4 How to Customize PowerPoint Slideshow Icon in 8 Simple Ways

Here are the eight different ways in which you can customize the PowerPoint Slideshow Icon.

### 01Using sketchy lines

### 02Adding Simple Shapes

Through this step, you can add some additional details and make the icons of PowerPoint even more enhanced and attractive. You have the option of including a simple and basic shape. Or you can also add some detailing to the icons. You have the freedom of letting your creativity flow to the fullest.

**●** Group your icon

**●** Make it effortless to copy and paste and move around all over the slide.

### 03Adding Animations

You can present your icons in the PowerPoint presentation in the form of animations. You can make them appear through different animation speeds and variations. You can resize them and add layers for animating the icons in PowerPoint.

### 04Changing the properties of the icons

You can also change the icons' brightness, contrast, or colours to make them look more enhanced and engaging.

### 05Adding entrances and exists

You can make your icons enter and leave the presentation in many unique ways.

### 06Select the icon you prefer to customise

**●** Match your design and change the fill colour.

**●** Use the "Align" tools to make circles.

**●** Animate the icons according to the way you prefer.
