![buying wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-use-mouse-only-with-filmora-team-2.gif)

## Create a Music Video Without a Keyboard

Let us get started! Whether you have a real mouseless experience or want to take it as a challenge, let's get the things clear first.

* We need to create a **20 seconds** music video.
* We will only be using the footage from the **stock library**.
* We will be using music from the **Wondershare** Filmora **library**.
* We will have 5 minutes to **review** the footage and the music available.
* And most importantly, we don’t have a **keyboard**.

Step 1\. Review your footage

Our first and most crucial step will be to use our imagination and creativity. So get those neurons firing, and let us go!

![reviewing the footage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-use-mouse-only-with-filmora-team-3.gif)

* Head to the **stock media** folder on the bar mentioned above, the Wondershare Filmora.
* Or you can simply look towards the left window, where you will find the sample **videos tab.**
* Click on the sample videos tab, and a new **window** will appear on the library screen.
* Here you will find almost more than **20 videos.**
* So apart from using the actual recorded footage, we will work our way with what we have from **default**.
* For the music, we would be scrolling in the **stock audio library.**
* Click on the **audio tab** above and start **scrolling**.
* You will also find some categories in the **left window**.
* Choose the category of your choice and **listen** to the audio.

Do whatever suit you best. Keep in mind you only have 5 minutes.

Step 2\. Pick music for your clips

Suppose you have found audio that speaks your vibe. The next step would be to find a video that tallies that audio. Let us suppose we have audio that is of the hip-hop genre. Let that creativity shine now!

![drone shot of rooftops](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-use-mouse-only-with-filmora-team-4.gif)

If you like to add a more **classical vibe**, pick a classical song or audio from the audio library.

* After picking the song, move on to the sample videos tab and search for videos that match a **classic vibe.**
* Now random **close-up shots** of a piano, cinematic footage of a big **orchestra**, or simple landscapes with minimalistic movement while focusing on a single object, consider the example below.

![still shot of a bench](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-use-mouse-only-with-filmora-team-5.gif)

Now that a scenario is constructed, our next step is to arrange these clips in the Wondershare Filmora timeline.

Step 3\. Download the clips and audio

**You have 15 minutes to create the music video. Start the timer!** Once you have selected a sample video and audio that matches your scenario, you can **download** them from the bottom right icon on the thumbnail. Only if you still need to download them.

Step 4\. Insert the audio into the timeline

* The first step is to drag the audio to the **timeline**.
* Now play the **audio** from the start. If you can work with the audio as a whole, then it's perfect.

If you want your audio to **start** at a certain point. You have to follow the below-mentioned steps. It is as simple as that!

![splitting the audio on wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-use-mouse-only-with-filmora-team-6.gif)

* **Add** your audio to the timeline.
* Then move the **timer** or the slider where you want your audio to start.
* **Right-click** on the audio file. Select split.
* Your audio file will split into two parts.
* Delete the prior file and drag the file ahead to the start of the timeline.

The next step is to add the videos to the timeline.

Step 5\. Add the video to the timeline

When you have your audio in the timeline, your next step is adding the video. After you have trimmed or split your audio to your wish, follow the below steps.

![adding sample videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-use-mouse-only-with-filmora-team-7.gif)

* Simply drag your video and drop it into the timeline.
