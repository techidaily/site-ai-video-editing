There are 3D effects, social media effects, and different genres of effects that can go well with your video content.

**Judicious** – There is a difference between transition effects and video effects. Transition effects should last only for a fraction of a second so that there is no aftereffect in mind. On the contrary, a video effect can last as long as required in the video. Therefore, do not stretch the duration of a transition effect and keep it as short as possible. Similarly, you should not use transition effects here and there unnecessarily. It should be used only when there is a proper scope such as scene cuts, mood changes, and subject changes.

## How to Become a Youtuber

I'm Sheila and I'm a Youtuber for five years in a row. I'm editing my vlogs using my cellphone only, not until I found this Wondershare Filmora for Personal Computers. Not like any other video editor that you need to crack your brain understanding each and every feature, this video editor that I'm talking about on the other hand, made it simple and very handy to use.

![Why I Become a Youtuber](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/how-to-become-a-youtuber-06.jpg)

Why I Become a Youtuber

## 1\. How I Decided to Start from Uploading the Video

But before we move forward for more details about the video editor itself, let's get back first five years ago. It all started when I filmed a certain place during a trip and somebody told me to upload it on YouTube. At first, I was hesitant doing that because I have no clue of what is YouTube. So, I did research and got curious, so I decided to upload the video. Time went by and I started to learn how to vlog.

![Uploading the Video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/how-to-become-a-youtuber-07.jpg)

Uploading the Video

## 2\. The Necessary Things a Vlog Should Have

* A teaser – wherein your aim is to caught the attention of your viewers.
* An intro – what is your channel all about.
* The body of the vlog – the part wherein you're explaining everything in depth, elaborating things about the topic you chose to share. In this part, you can insert the so called **"**call of action**"** \- wherein you can tell your viewers to subscribe, to like and comment something about your vlog you're tackling. And last is the
* Outro – closing session of your vlog.

![Vlog](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/how-to-become-a-youtuber-08.jpg)

Vlog

## 3\. What Have I Encountered on the Way

As the saying goes by, **"**The beginning is always the hardest part**"** and really it was. My YouTube journey was not as easy that even my friends didn't recognize my endeavors. But still, I continue what I'm doing because I love it. It's a hobby that at the same time, I'm learning something new on the process. And also, with the help of vlogging, I'm starting to gain my self-esteem that I forgot for many years back.

![What Have I Encountered on the Way](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/how-to-become-a-youtuber-09.jpg)

What Have I Encountered on the Way

It's not easy to become a Youtuber, because you, yourself is the only one that you've got. You are the director – managing everything all at once. The artist (youtuber) - the one who's going to talk in front of the camera. The scriptwriter – the one who's in charge of the whole story of the video and even the editor- the one who'll edit the video afterwards.

On YouTube platform, you have to be consistent. It doesn't mean that you need to upload a video thrice in a week, but even a video will do. After all, it's quality over quantity. You'll have to think what kind of video you'll upload because you need to give your viewers or audiences something significant out of your vlog. YouTube is the second largest search engine next to Google, so most of the people are searching for answers to their questions. Or even searching solutions to their problems. So, if you have something to offer, why not share it for free.

If you're a new YouTuber, you don't need to have high-end equipment's for vlogging. Anyone can start up by using his/her mobile phone. I used to vlog using my Samsung S-6\. Mobile phone nowadays, can record a high-definition resolution. You can add a tripod so that your phone can be sturdy during your filming session. Just film during day time so that you can minimize yourself from buying a ring light. A lavalier microphone can be a useful add-on so that your viewers or audiences can hear your voice clearly.

## 4\. What to Do As a YouTuber

As a Youtuber, you should find your own niche. Something that you're passionate about. Something denoting products, services, or interests that appeal to a small, specialized section of the population. Something that you're a hundred percent that you can deliver to them loud and clear.

![What to Do As a YouTuber](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/how-to-become-a-youtuber-10.jpg)

What to Do As a YouTuber

As a YouTuber, you should be yourself in front of the camera. At first it will be awkward, but in time you'll get used to it. Speak with your heart and not with your mind because when you start to think of the things that you need to say, you'll get distracted. But when you speak whatever is in your heart at that very moment, you can create miracles and wonders.

It's okay that you stutter once in a while. Even a reporter experiencing that kind of phenomena and besides, no one is perfect. Everything that you said unnecessarily can be omitted during the editing process. During editing, the first thing that you need to do is to put all the raw videos in your video editor's timeline. Cut all the unnecessary part specially the so called, **"**dead air**"** or the part that you're starting to think and not to talk at all. And your viewers can only see are all dead silence. After that you can add your personal touch. You can add your watermark (your trademark in other words), lower third green screens, subtitle if necessary (the hardest part to be honest) if you're doing it manually. Some cool stickers, effects and transitions.

## 5\. How I Started Video Editing

As I've told you at the start of this article, I'm a phone editor not until I found **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**. And I must say that, this video editor is the best video editor for beginners. It has a user-friendly interface that even a person with zero experience on editing can fully understand it's incredible features easily.

Wondershare Filmora 11 | More Than Just You

It also has new features that I personally not encountered with my previous video editor like Instant Mode and from the word itself, this mode can make your video in a blink of an eye. There's Creator Academy wherein you can watch very interesting tutorials that can be a big help in your editing skills in the future.

If we're going to dig in, there are lots of features that's a game changer when it comes to editing indeed! Like bunch of Title styles that you can choose from. You can insert green screen videos (that I personally love to use in my vlogs) and there's a Motion Tracker if you want to focus in an object or person in action.

## Step-By-Step Guide To Creating Halftone Effects In Photoshop

Halftone is a technique that uses dots to create a deliberate screen-like image and textured effect. In recent years, it has become trendy in digital design.

This effect is often used in magazines, newspapers, and other printed materials. When applied correctly, it can add depth and dimension to an image, resulting in a softer, more pleasing, and appealing look.

So, if you have ever wanted to add interesting effects and textures to your images, but weren't sure where to start, then keep on reading to discover and learn everything you need to know regarding **creating the halftone printing effect in Photoshop.**

Without further ado, let’s get started!

## What Are Halftone Effects?

Before we know [how to create a halftone effect in Photoshop](#%5FHow%5FTo%5FUse), let's have a basic understanding of it first.

In the 19th century, William Henry Fox Talbot introduced the **halftone screen printing** effect to create the illusion of tones in black and white images.

The halftone originated from printers who previously only worked with cyan, magenta, yellow, and black ([CMYK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMYK%5Fcolor%5Fmodel)). The solid colors were tiny dots placed together closely with continuous tones that remained unchanged. From the mixing and matching of these four colors, a wide range of colors emerged.

The effect is usually created by putting dots of ink on paper in different sizes and positions. This illusion uses optical bleeding to make the desired impression on the human eye. These color dots act like analog **pixels** that result in a recognizable image.

For instance, when you look at a pixelated picture and zoom it, you will see missing details. When you zoom out, the photo gets more minor and back to its original form.

### Modern Definition and Usage

In the 21st century, the halftone is a static-visual technique applied in print and digital images to create continuous tone imagery using dots that vary in spacing and size to create a gradient effect.

Halftone produces a deliberate screen-like image distortion in different fields, such as pop art, graphic designing, and screen printing, to create nostalgic or vintage effects and make the images more captivating.

## How To Use Photoshop To Create Halftone Printing Effect

Below we’ve provided detailed step-by-step guidance on creating a color halftone effect as well as black and white halftone printing effects in Photoshop:

### 1\. How to Create Color Halftone Effect

If you want to create a color halftone effect in Photoshop, do the following steps in a sequence:

Step1 Launch the **Photoshop** software on your laptop/desktop, and drag and drop the image file on which you want to apply the Halftone effect.

Step2 Click **“Filters”** in the top toolbar and select the **“Pixelate”** option from the drop-down menu.

Step3 Click the **“Color Halftone”** option from the menu. On the new pop-up window, adjust the radius and channel to configure the appearance of the effect.

### 2\. How to Create Black and White Halftone Effect

Follow these steps to **create black and white halftone printing effect:**

Step1 Open your image in **Adobe Photoshop** and click the **“Image”** option from the top taskbar.

Step2 Now, click the **“Mode”** option from the drop-down menu and select **“Greyscale”** to convert your RGB image.

Step4 A dialogue box will open. Set the resolution to 1000, 1,500, or 2,000ppi to create smooth edges on your halftone. Next, click **“Halftone Screen…”** under the **“Method”** header and click **“OK”** to proceed further.

Now, you can adjust the frequency (Lines/Inch), angle (Degrees), and shape (Circle, Line, Cross, etc.) to determine how big your halftone dots are at the maximum diameter and their direction.

Step5 Finally, click **“Files”** from the top taskbar, scroll down, and select **“Save As…”** Save your file as **PSD or TIFF** and import it to **InDesign** to apply color.

### Video Tutorial - How To Create Halftone Effect | Photoshop 2022

To help you better put the guidance into practice, we have prepared a video tutorial to deepen your understanding.

## Two Concepts You Should Know In Creating Halftone Effect

Apart from the practical guidance, there are two important concepts you need to be aware of: radius and channels. Below, we’ve discussed both of them in detail to make things more understandable to you:

### 1\. Radius

Radius refers to the size of the dots that make up the halftone image and is an important factor in determining the overall look of the photo.

You can adjust the sizes of the dots to change the gradient, spacing in between, and blur of the color and image. However, if you want a more subtle effect, you will need to use a smaller radius. For a more dramatic effect, like vintage comics, old ads, or DIY grunge zines., you will need to use a larger radius.

### 2\. Channel

Channel refers to the number of values that are used to create the image. The more values you use, the more details will be visible.

The Channel setting of halftone effects affects how the dots are positioned and overlap. Each Channel is governed by a Screen Angle setting, which is listed in degrees. Changing the value modifies the angle at which Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black dots are added to the pattern. When the dots overlap, a new color is created depending on the combination of the primary colors and black.

## Conclusion

In this comprehensive guide, we've explored the halftone effect, how it originated and discussed its modern definition and usage. We've also provided step-by-step processes to help you create the halftone effect in Photoshop, both colored and black and white.

Furthermore, we discussed two important concepts (radius and channel) of the halftone screen printing effect to help you understand the technique in detail.

Hopefully, you’ve found this article helpful and can now add a new level of creativity to your images using the halftone effect in Adobe Photoshop.
