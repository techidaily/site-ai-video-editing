Price: $499.99

The first and foremost model that may come into our mind is the GoPro Hero10 Black, which is, without any discussion, the most advanced model in GoPro cameras. Taking the features to the next level, GoPro Hero10 Black is available with a 5.3K resolution, which is the smoothest resolution in videos you can ask for. It provides faster processors than its predecessors, with features that make it the top-of-the-line choice.

You can find improved stabilization across Hero10; however, the price tag across the camera is as much as a mirrorless camera. Absolutely stunning, it is!

### 2\. GoPro Hero9 Black

Price: $399.99

Another impressive model in the GoPro products is the Hero9 Black model, referred to as the previous iteration of the Hero10\. Although it is not as remarkable as the Hero10, it takes up videos with 5K Ultra HD resolution, with a 1080p live streaming facility. Talking about the stabilization of this camera, it isn’t as proficient as the Hero10; however, it still performs better than the previous iterations.

A heavier camera's multifunctional characteristics are a few major points that need to be considered for Hero9 Black. Do you wish to buy this?
