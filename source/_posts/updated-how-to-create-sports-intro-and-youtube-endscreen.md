2\. Price: If you are serious about recording your screen video and uploading the recorded video on online platforms, you have to opt for a premium screen recorder. While purchasing a proprietary screen recorder, you need to compare the software price with its peers and ensure that you are getting more features for the price you are paying.

3\. Customer support: You need to ensure that the screen recorder you are purchasing, they have a highly responsive customer support. This is a highly neglected factor but users suffer a lot when the customer support team is not responsive. Be sure that you will need to contact the customer support team at some time to learn more about certain features and troubleshoot in emergency situations.

## Part 8: Screen Recording Tips and Tricks

1\. Practice before recording: Unless you are a pro, you should practice at least once before the actual recording. This will help you to execute your plan according to your script smoothly when you actually start recording. Besides, you can check if the frame, the camera, the mic, and everything else are working perfectly.

2\. Only record the required screen: Screen recorders offer you the option to record the entire screen, any specific application window or any specific tab of your browser. In fact, you can even customize the screen recording area as per your requirements for better focus and better visual experience.

3\. Keep it short: It is always necessary to keep the length of the video as short as possible without skipping the relevant points and important explanations. That is where a proper script before recording is crucial so that you can have a plan and execute it properly without stretching your explanation unnecessarily.

4\. Speak slowly and clearly: The way you speak in the video can attract as well as repel audiences. If you speak too fast and if you have a weird accent, it is going to repel audiences. That is why it is important for you to speak slowly and clearly so that everyone can understand everything you speak and negate your accent to a greater extent.

5\. Use screen drawing tools: If you are recording a video where you need to explain something, it is always better if you use screen drawing tools. In fact, it is important that you choose the screen recorder that offers drawing tools so that the video gets visually pleasing and impactful for audiences to understand effectively.

6\. Cut out dead moments: When you are recording screen videos, there are going to be a lot of dead moments and boring pauses. You have to cut out those boring and dead moments while editing so that the video stays interesting and the audiences do not lose concentration. This will also help to tighten the length of the video.

7\. End with a summary: Last but most importantly, you should offer a proper conclusion before ending the video. You need to summarize everything you have discussed in the video so that the audience can get a revision of all the important points. Besides, a proper ending rather than an abrupt ending can leave a positive impact regarding your video.

This will also help to tighten the length of the video.

7\. End with a summary: Last but most importantly, you should offer a proper conclusion before ending the video. You need to summarize everything you have discussed in the video so that the audience can get a revision of all the important points. Besides, a proper ending rather than an abrupt ending can leave a positive impact regarding your video.

Besides, it should offer you the option to customize the recording area by selection. You should be able to record full screen, application window, and browser tab accurately.

2\. Price: If you are serious about recording your screen video and uploading the recorded video on online platforms, you have to opt for a premium screen recorder. While purchasing a proprietary screen recorder, you need to compare the software price with its peers and ensure that you are getting more features for the price you are paying.

3\. Customer support: You need to ensure that the screen recorder you are purchasing, they have a highly responsive customer support. This is a highly neglected factor but users suffer a lot when the customer support team is not responsive. Be sure that you will need to contact the customer support team at some time to learn more about certain features and troubleshoot in emergency situations.

4\. Sharing options: When your ultimate goal is to share your recorded video online, you should check for the sharing options available in the screen recorder. There are screen recorders that allow sharing recorded and edited videos on online platforms, cloud storage platforms, and video streaming platforms. It should also offer you options to let you export videos in different file formats.

5\. Video editing tools: You have to edit your recorded video to trim out unnecessary parts and add effects and filters to enhance your video content and video quality. Besides, you may need options to add music and voiceover as well as intro and outro. That is why you should opt for a screen recorder where a great video editor is available.

6\. Customer Reviews: Last but most importantly, you should check the customer review of the screen recording software. Even when a screen recorder has loads of features, if the customer reviews are not good enough, you should not choose you. Besides, the customer reviews reveal the pros and cons of a screen recorder for your better understanding.

## Part 8: Screen Recording Tips and Tricks

1\. Practice before recording: Unless you are a pro, you should practice at least once before the actual recording. This will help you to execute your plan according to your script smoothly when you actually start recording. Besides, you can check if the frame, the camera, the mic, and everything else are working perfectly.

2\. Only record the required screen: Screen recorders offer you the option to record the entire screen, any specific application window or any specific tab of your browser. In fact, you can even customize the screen recording area as per your requirements for better focus and better visual experience.

3\. Keep it short: It is always necessary to keep the length of the video as short as possible without skipping the relevant points and important explanations. That is where a proper script before recording is crucial so that you can have a plan and execute it properly without stretching your explanation unnecessarily.

4\. Speak slowly and clearly: The way you speak in the video can attract as well as repel audiences. If you speak too fast and if you have a weird accent, it is going to repel audiences. That is why it is important for you to speak slowly and clearly so that everyone can understand everything you speak and negate your accent to a greater extent.

5\. Use screen drawing tools: If you are recording a video where you need to explain something, it is always better if you use screen drawing tools. In fact, it is important that you choose the screen recorder that offers drawing tools so that the video gets visually pleasing and impactful for audiences to understand effectively.

6\. Cut out dead moments: When you are recording screen videos, there are going to be a lot of dead moments and boring pauses. You have to cut out those boring and dead moments while editing so that the video stays interesting and the audiences do not lose concentration. This will also help to tighten the length of the video.

7\. End with a summary: Last but most importantly, you should offer a proper conclusion before ending the video. You need to summarize everything you have discussed in the video so that the audience can get a revision of all the important points. Besides, a proper ending rather than an abrupt ending can leave a positive impact regarding your video.

Besides, it should offer you the option to customize the recording area by selection. You should be able to record full screen, application window, and browser tab accurately.

2\. Price: If you are serious about recording your screen video and uploading the recorded video on online platforms, you have to opt for a premium screen recorder. While purchasing a proprietary screen recorder, you need to compare the software price with its peers and ensure that you are getting more features for the price you are paying.

3\. Customer support: You need to ensure that the screen recorder you are purchasing, they have a highly responsive customer support. This is a highly neglected factor but users suffer a lot when the customer support team is not responsive. Be sure that you will need to contact the customer support team at some time to learn more about certain features and troubleshoot in emergency situations.

4\. Sharing options: When your ultimate goal is to share your recorded video online, you should check for the sharing options available in the screen recorder. There are screen recorders that allow sharing recorded and edited videos on online platforms, cloud storage platforms, and video streaming platforms. It should also offer you options to let you export videos in different file formats.

5\. Video editing tools: You have to edit your recorded video to trim out unnecessary parts and add effects and filters to enhance your video content and video quality. Besides, you may need options to add music and voiceover as well as intro and outro. That is why you should opt for a screen recorder where a great video editor is available.

6\. Customer Reviews: Last but most importantly, you should check the customer review of the screen recording software. Even when a screen recorder has loads of features, if the customer reviews are not good enough, you should not choose you. Besides, the customer reviews reveal the pros and cons of a screen recorder for your better understanding.

## Part 8: Screen Recording Tips and Tricks

1\. Practice before recording: Unless you are a pro, you should practice at least once before the actual recording. This will help you to execute your plan according to your script smoothly when you actually start recording. Besides, you can check if the frame, the camera, the mic, and everything else are working perfectly.

2\. Only record the required screen: Screen recorders offer you the option to record the entire screen, any specific application window or any specific tab of your browser. In fact, you can even customize the screen recording area as per your requirements for better focus and better visual experience.

3\. Keep it short: It is always necessary to keep the length of the video as short as possible without skipping the relevant points and important explanations. That is where a proper script before recording is crucial so that you can have a plan and execute it properly without stretching your explanation unnecessarily.

4\. Speak slowly and clearly: The way you speak in the video can attract as well as repel audiences. If you speak too fast and if you have a weird accent, it is going to repel audiences. That is why it is important for you to speak slowly and clearly so that everyone can understand everything you speak and negate your accent to a greater extent.

5\. Use screen drawing tools: If you are recording a video where you need to explain something, it is always better if you use screen drawing tools. In fact, it is important that you choose the screen recorder that offers drawing tools so that the video gets visually pleasing and impactful for audiences to understand effectively.

6\. Cut out dead moments: When you are recording screen videos, there are going to be a lot of dead moments and boring pauses. You have to cut out those boring and dead moments while editing so that the video stays interesting and the audiences do not lose concentration. This will also help to tighten the length of the video.

7\. End with a summary: Last but most importantly, you should offer a proper conclusion before ending the video. You need to summarize everything you have discussed in the video so that the audience can get a revision of all the important points. Besides, a proper ending rather than an abrupt ending can leave a positive impact regarding your video.
