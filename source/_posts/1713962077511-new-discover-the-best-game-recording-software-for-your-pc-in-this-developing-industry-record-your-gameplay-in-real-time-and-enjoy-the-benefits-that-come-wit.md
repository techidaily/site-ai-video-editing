### 02**Adobe After Effects**

When it comes to video editing, Adobe After Effects is the most widely used tool as it comes packed in with all needed features. Using the software’s Remove Grain feature, the variables of the video can be changed for fixing the noise and the grain. Though the software smooths out the noise artifacts, the downside is that it also leads to blurring of the footage along with reduced sharpness. Using the right variables may help to maintain the details and the quality of the footage.
