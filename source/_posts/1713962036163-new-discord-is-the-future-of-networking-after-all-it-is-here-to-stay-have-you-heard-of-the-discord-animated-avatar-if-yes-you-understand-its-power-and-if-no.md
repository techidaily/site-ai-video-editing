## Part 1 Why is Discord Becoming Popular Recently?

How often do you visit social media? You probably know that the current trending networking platform is Discord if it is frequent. After all, it has risen to fame with millions of users in no time. Plus, the introduction of the **GIF Avatar Discord** has left many fans amazed with the application. You can also confirm its popularity with the many friends using it.

Discord features multiple good points that explain why most people love it, including the **avatar Discord GIF.** However, many people still question its popularity and its rise recently. As a result, this section will answer this question using relevant facts.

**●** **It is suitable for gaming communication:** Discord is primarily popular among gamers. The platform is new, but it has quickly overtaken its competitors, Skype and TeamSpeak. Why? Many gamers consider it a revolutionized application that solves all their worries making gaming communication bigger and better. Before Discord, gaming communication was difficult and dangerous. After all, you need to share personal Skype details that connect with your phone, making it a not-safe option. When we consider TeamSpeak, you realize that it is limiting with the option available since you only have a voice call. Discord brings out the best network channel; gamers and friends have quickly started using it.

**●** **Most services are free: Discord includes multiple benefits that make** communication straightforward and convenient. Luckily, most of the services available are free, meaning that almost everyone can access them. As a result, many people would quickly settle for Discord compared to other platforms since you can get so much at no cost. Currently, they have the **Discord Nitro gif avatar**, which is affordable and multiplies the fun.

**●** **Create Discord bots are no cost:** Discord allows users to create bots for free without including any hosting fee hence an affordable option.

**●** **Constant updates that match the audiences' needs: Things change in no time for Discord**. Why? The developers are active and listen to the community's opinion of what they want and why they need it. Therefore, it delivers the show that people urgently need leading to popularity rise.

**●** **It rarely includes ads in private chats:** A platform can become frustrating, mainly when it features multiple ads every minute. However, Discord is different since it almost has no ads. Therefore, people can freely chat with friends and other gamers.

**●** **Discord is safe:** The settings under Discord are safe since they include suitable privacy options and monitoring. Thus, it is a safe option. But many people often raise the question of open chatting in apps and the security issues that come with them. Many people can confirm that Discord is a safe option and if you feel otherwise, ensure that you only add friends you know.

## Part 2 Why Discord Emojis?

From the information above, you can tell that Discord's primary role is communication. And we all know that emojis are the real deal in every conversation since emojis easily communicate our feelings. Currently, most platforms with messaging options include emojis to multiply the fun. The same case happens for Discord emojis. They are there to make communication appealing, interesting, funny and reveal how you feel about a situation.

**Importance of Discord emojis**

**●** **Emojis help you to communicate the right emotions**. Sometimes, it's impossible to express the right feelings using words, and emojis come to the rescue in such situations. Of course, they are useless for formal communication, but Discord holds a considerable weight for various issues.

**●** **They are fun and exciting**. Sometimes you can choose to use an emoji instead of writing some phrase, and this option works for all. Besides, it feels good to see different emojis instead of a long paragraph that tells the same story.

**●** **Emojis make communication easy**. We are in the 21st century with multiple revolutionary changes with our communication channels. Young people prefer emojis for different conversations.

**●** **It offers a sense of presence in a conversation**. People believed that they could only hold exciting discussions when they were together. Over time, this statement has been proved impossible since we can't always be there to hold serious talks. We need Discord emojis since they give a sense of physical presence.

**●** **They liven up a serious conversation**. Have you ever noticed, people tend to include emojis when having serious talks making them more casual and creating a friendly environment that suits everyone? And this trick often works.

Discord emojis are conversation aids that every communication channel need. Why not, when it gives a sense of friendliness. Try out the Discord emojis and discover the simplest ways to make a conversation lively.

## Part 3 How to Create Discord Emoji GIF

There are two popular ways to create an emoji **Discord GIF avatar, Discord Nitro animated avatar** and **Discord GIF avatar without Nitro.** The emoji GIF you make depends on the Nitro version you are using.

Creating a Discord account is simple and free, not even considering the hosting cost. However, the developers include the Discord Nitro version, which contains multiple features that make conversations bigger and better. However, the Nitro version is a paid subscription of $4.99 monthly. Creating a discord emoji GIF is quite simple if you are under the later version. After all, it includes the available GIF options that you can choose from depending on your taste. However, if you are under the free option, you won't have this option.

## The Complete Guide to Making Fortnite Montage

If you're skilled at playing Fortnite, you'll probably want to share your gameplay clips as montages with other players. The popularity of Fortnite montage videos is rapidly growing because millions of people play the game. Tons of people also like watching their peers play this online video game in the form of gaming montages. We'll explain how to make a montage Fortnite that will get views when you upload it on social media platforms.

## What Is Fortnite?

Fortnite is a popular online game developed by the American game studio Epic Games. The video game was released in 2017, and it's available in three-game mode versions with the same game engine and gameplay. These are:

* Fortnite: Save the World: Set on contemporary Earth, Save the World is a co-op hybrid third-person shooter (TPS), tower defense (TD), and survival game. The game allows a maximum of four players to fight off creatures that look like zombies and defend objects with traps or fortifications they have built.
* Fortnite Battle Royale: This is a free-to-play (F2P) battle royale video game that allows up to one hundred players to fight against each other until only one person remains.
* Fortnite Creative: Released in 2018, Fortnite Creative allows players to create battle arenas and worlds. They can then share these predetermined structures with up to 16 other players for a range of multiplayer game modes that have customizable rules.

Since its release, Fortnite has become a worldwide phenomenon, with more than 350 million people playing the game across the globe. In the first year of Fortnite's release, players downloaded its mobile version 78 million times.

The game became such a global hit because it's free to play. It's also available on most gaming platforms and features an engaging theme. Additionally, because Battle Royale allows up to 100 gamers to fight it out until they find the last man standing, this means the replayability of this online video game is infinite. What's more? Each game is unique.

Fortnite has also become popular because users can purchase DLC (downloadable content) to enhance their gaming experience.

## Things to Prepare before making a Fortnite Montage video

You have to prepare several things if you want to make an epic Fortnite montage video that will keep your audience watching. These include:

### 1\. Fortnite Gaming Clips

To save the beautiful moments of the game, you have to know where to find the Replays videos; this is how to find them:

1. Head over to Career and select the Replays option. You'll see all the replay clips, including their date, finish, and length.

### 2\. Pick the Right Background Music

To make your Fortnite montage video engaging, you'll need to choose background music that fits your montage videos. Music is one of the key elements in creating an exhilarating viewing experience for your audience.

Make sure you pick royalty-free music that fits the genre of your Fortnite montage video. Choose a song that expresses the themes and personality of the game.

You cannot use your favorite song from the radio, as your copyright law prohibits people from using the work of others without permission or paying a royalty.

If you are caught using copyrighted music, you might have to pay the music owner monetary damages. You can also go to jail because of copyright infringement.

There are loads of platforms that offer non-copyrighted music that you can use in your montage Fortnite. These include YouTube, Twitch, and Pixabay.
