## Preparation

Are you ready to master the art of merging audio and video? Then let's dive into the world of FFmpeg, a powerful and versatile tool that can help you achieve professional results.

With FFmpeg, you can record, convert, and stream audio and video files in any format, making it a complete and cross-platform solution. It's also a great tool for decoding, encoding, transcoding, muxing, demuxing, streaming, filtering, and playing any media type.

But before we start merging video files using FFmpeg, it's important to understand the basics of container formats and video codecs. These are the building blocks of your videos, and the specific types you're working with will determine the method you'll use to merge them. So, buckle up, and let's get started!

### How To Combine Video With Two Audio Using FFmpeg

Are you looking to add multiple audio tracks to your video? With FFmpeg, you can easily combine video with two audio streams. Whether creating a foreign-language version of your video or adding an alternate audio track, this method will help you achieve professional results. This section will guide you through combining video with two audio streams using FFmpeg's command-line interface. So, let's get started!

**Mixing Two Audios Into a Video**

Combining multiple audio tracks into one video can be done easily with FFmpeg's command-line interface. In this example, we will combine two audio tracks into one video so that the voiceover will play over the background music. Here's the step-by-step process:

Step1 **Open** your command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where your video and audio files are located.

Step2 **Replace** "**video1.mp4**" and "**audio1.mp3**" with the names of your actual video and audio files.

_ffmpeg \\_

_\-i video1.mp4 -i audio1.mp3 \\_

Step3 The **\-c:v copy** flag tells FFmpeg to copy the video stream from the source file without re-encoding it. This helps to speed up the process and avoid quality loss.

_\-c:v copy \\_

_\-filter\_complex " \\_

Step4 The command "**amix=inputs=2:duration=longest**" tells amix to accept 2 inputs (**0:a and 1:a**) and **combine** them into an output stream called **audio\_out**, with the duration of the longest input.

_\[0:a\]\[1:a\] amix=inputs=2:duration=longest \[audio\_out\] \\_

Step5 **Map** the video stream **(0:v)** and the mixed audio stream **(audio\_out)** into the final output video.

_\-map 0:v -map "\[audio\_out\]" \\_

Step6 The **\-y flag** tells FFmpeg to overwrite the output file if it already exists.

_\-y output.mp4_

Once complete, you'll find the newly created video file with the mixed audio in the specified output location.

**Mixing Two Audios Into a Video Adjusting Volume**

We will be taking a step further and show you how to merge two audio tracks into a video while adjusting the volume of one of the audio tracks. This can be useful when you want to emphasize one audio track over the other, for example, to make the voiceover more prominent in a video.

And here's the step-by-step process:

Step1 **Start** the command by specifying the input files.

_ffmpeg \\_

 _\-i video1.mp4 -i audio1.mp3 \\_

Step2 **Use** the **filter\_complex** option to specify a filter graph.

 _\-filter\_complex " \\_

 _\[0:a\] volume=0.5 \[music\];_

Step3 **Use** the **amix** filter to take the "**music**" stream and **audio1.mp3** and **mix** them.

 _\[music\]\[1:a\] amix=inputs=2:duration=longest \[audio\_out\] \\_

 _" \\_

Step4 **Use** the **map** option to **specify** which streams from the input files should be included in the output file.

 _\-map 0:v -map "\[audio\_out\]" \\_

Step5 **Specify** the output file name as "**output.mp4**" and the **\-y flag** to overwrite the output file without asking for confirmation if it already exists.

 _\-y output.mp4_

**Mixing Two Audios Into a Video With Delay**

When creating videos, sometimes the audio needs to be synced with the video, or you want to add a delay to the audio track. Here's how to add delay to an audio track using FFmpeg.

Step1 **Use** the **adelay filter** to add delay to the audio track.

_\[1:a\] adelay=2100|2100 \[voice\];_

Step2 **Mix** the delayed audio track with the original audio track

_\[0:a\]\[voice\] amix=inputs=2:duration=longest \[audio\_out\]_

Step3 **Map** the video and audio tracks to the output file

_\-map 0:v -map "\[audio\_out\]"_

Step4 **Use** the **\-y flag** to overwrite the output file

_\-y output.mp4_

The final command would look like this:

_ffmpeg \\_

 _\-i video1.mp4 -i audio1.mp3 \\_

 _\-filter\_complex " \\_

 _\[1:a\] adelay=2100|2100 \[voice\]; \\_

 _\[0:a\]\[voice\] amix=inputs=2:duration=longest \[audio\_out\] \\_

 _" \\_

 _\-map 0:v -map "\[audio\_out\]" \\_

 _\-y output.mp4_

This command will delay the audio track by 2100 milliseconds and then mix it with the original audio track, resulting in a new video file with the delayed audio.

![merge-video-handbrake-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-6.jpeg)

It is because gaps will create a dark blank space between the clips when you export the clips, like this:

![merge-video-handbrake-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-7.jpeg)

Therefore, slide the second video right next to the first video without leaving any gaps with your mouse.

![merge-video-handbrake-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-8.jpeg)

And guess what? You have already merged the two clips.

**Step 4: Save Video on Your PC**

Now, hit the “Export” button and save the merged video on your computer.

## Part 1: What is HandBrake?

Before you gear up for HandBrake to merge videos, it would be wise to know a few essential details about this software.

[HandBrake](https://handbrake.fr/) is a free tool for Windows, Linux, and MAC operating systems. The basic purpose of this software is to convert videos from any format in MKV, WebM, and MP4\. It is an open-source program that allows users to convert their videos to play them on multiple devices, such as TV media players, computers, tablets, mobile phones, etc.

Moreover, this platform gives you the power to turn your low-quality videos into high-quality screen time. That is why most professional videographers use this tool to polish videos captured with old cameras.

A few more interesting features of HandBrake are:

* Combing artifacts removal due to interlacing
* Convert videos without negatively affecting the audio quality
* Volume and range adjustment
* Addition, removal, and preservation of soft subtitles

However, one vital thing to understand is that although HandBrake takes a tiny little space of your hard drive, the interface is complicated for beginners.

![merge-video-handbrake-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-1.jpeg)

## Part 2: Using HandBrake to Merge Videos – Possible or Not?

There is a great misconception about HandBrake among the newbies that HandBrake is primarily a video merger software. But, in reality, that is not true at all. Or, at least, the latest HandBrake version 1.5.1 lacks such features.

Even the official website states that [HandBrake cannot combine](https://handbrake.fr/docs/en/latest/introduction/about.html#:~:text=does%20not%20do-,HandBrake%20does%20not%3A,video%20clips%20into%20one,-Pass-through%20video) two or more clips to make them whole.

So feel yourself lucky to read this article if you haven’t downloaded HandBrake yet. Congratulations! You are saved from another heartbreak.

But wait! If the software is not meant to merge clips, it doesn’t mean that you can’t use it to prepare your videos for the real deal. HandBrake can still be a helpful tool, permitting you to convert videos in a similar format before you start merging them on any other video editor.

For example, suppose you have two video clips in different formats. In that case, you can use HandBrake to convert all of them in a similar format so that they can be easily be merged when imported on any video merger tool.

But, again, the question is, if not HandBrake, then what?

Frankly, you will find hundreds of video editing tools with a combining clips feature, but not all of them deserve your attention and time. While software like DaVinci Resolve includes characteristics to merge two or more clips in a single shot, beginners and mid-level users may still find them a bit difficult at the start.

That is why professionals and experts prefer Filmora by Wondershare to merge videos without banging their heads on the screen.

So, how to merge videos in Filmora with simple clicks? Focus on the next part of the article to learn the step-by-step method within a few minutes.
