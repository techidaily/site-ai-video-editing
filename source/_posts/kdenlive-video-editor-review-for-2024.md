Multi-track editing – Kdenlive comes with a versatile timeline where you can have multiple tracks consisting of video clips, audio files and different effects and objects. You can lock the tracks as well as mute them so that you can experiment as you edit your video.

Effects and Transitions – Even though limited, there are eye-catching effects and transitions available. You can also go for color correction as well as minor adjustments in your audio. Besides, the titler lets you create amazing 2D texts and titles.

Proxy Editing – Kdenlive uses proxy editing technique to lower the resolution of high-resolution videos while you edit them. This takes away the pressure on the CPU resources, but when it renders, the original resolution gets restored back. That is why Kdenlive has been effective in low-end computers as well.

Flexible User Interface – Kdenlive comes with a customizable user interface. This means you can arrange the layouts of your workflow as per your requirements. Besides, there are configurable keyboard shortcuts. There are also different themes available for the user interface.

Keyframing – One of the advanced features of Kdenlive is that you can keyframe any effect. This means you can change the parameters of the effects with time using curves. Besides, the software supports green screen effect.

## Part 4\. Best Kdenlive Alternative to Edit Videos

## [Tutorial] How To Add Motion Blur in Blender?

Motion blur effect, as a terminology, holds great significance in multiple industrial uses. From filmmaking to basic photography, the motion blur effect is consumed as a reality-setting standard, which defines its significance. Many platforms are providing this effect to enhance the creativity of their users. Blender is also known among these software providing such services while designing animations.

We will target a comprehensive guide on **adding motion blur in Blender** using the right way. Therefore, if you seek the appropriate way of adding motion blur in Blender, the following description is for you.

## Part 1: What is Blender?

As we start our discussion, we will review [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) as a free and open-source software. Following this, we will continue realizing the benefits of adding motion blur through Blender:

### Introduction to Blender

For those unaware of Blender, it is an open-source, free creativity software. You can find it as the perfect designing platform for your 3D content. This software has made itself accessible to the market with ease. This has made it quite famous among professionals, and is recommended for its high-quality, feature-rich design. From modeling to sculpting, Blender provides some great options to work with.

If you are up for editing some videos through Blender, it offers a great course of features, including motion blur. This **Blender motion blur tutorial** intends to bring you a similar insight into this great software. This will help you know the procedure of executing such facets to perfection.

![blender interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-blender-1.jpg)

### Benefits of Using Motion Blur Effect

There are many benefits of using the motion blur effect in creative work. The following points are the highlights and benefits of adding the motion blur effect:

**· Perfect For Idolizing Speed**

The use of the motion blur effect is the best way to show the speed of the object. Using such effects gives the viewer an experience of the swiftness that is contained in the object.

**· Resolves Flickering**

Rather than trying out fast motion, you can add such effects to your 3D content to enhance the motion blur. This also helps get over problems, including strobing and flickering clips.

**· Attenuates Real-Effect**

One great thing about our human eye is its ability to bring motion blur in fast-moving objects. Since this is a real-life experience, the motion blur effect highlights this particular effect and brings the edited content closer to reality.

## Part 2: How Do You Motion Blur An Object in Blender?

As stated before, Blender can be a great option for adding motion blur to objects. Many properties are involved in setting up the motion blur effect on an object. It includes defining the position, shutter, separation, and several other parameters. In this part, we will be looking for a guide on **how to add motion blur in Blender**:

Step1 With the video opened on Blender, proceed to the "Render Properties." Look to enable "Motion Blur" from the available options. Click on the arrowhead adjacent to it to access its advanced blur options.

![enable the motion blur option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-blender-2.jpg)

Step2 Start by setting its "Position" in the start, center, or end, according to the requirements. For those who are not sure of it, they can use "Center on Frame." If the objects rapidly move in the video, reduce the "Shutter" value or vice versa.

![adjust the shutter value](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-blender-3.jpg)

Step3 Following this, define the "Background Separation" according to how you require the foreground and background. Next, you will have to increase or decrease the "Max Blur" pixels to define the blur intensity in the video.

![set background separation and max blur](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-blender-4.jpg)

Step4 For objects with complex topology, you might have to increase the “Steps,” hence the “Shutter” time. For simple objects, the value remains unity. To apply the motion blur effect, use the F12 key for rendering the video.

![set the value for steps](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-blender-5.jpg)
