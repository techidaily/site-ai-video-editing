## Part 1 What Is Augmented Reality?

Augmented Reality is a technology that uses the real-world environment where virtual objects reside. This process involves an experience where the real or physical world interweaves with virtually created objects. It interweaves so perfectly that the artificial seems a part of the natural. This is an artificial experience, and it adds to the real environment. AR gained popularity in the fields of entertainment and video games.

You might think that AR (Augmented Reality) is the same as VR (Virtual Reality). They are not the same. When someone looks through a VR, everything, including the object's environment, is virtual or an illusion. When AR is used, the object is virtual, but the environment is real. Suppose you want to buy an item of furniture and you do not know whether it would match your home décor; here, you can use AR to see whether the furniture would fit your décor or not.

Nothing is more satisfying than seeing the final cut of a video and realizing that everything we filmed is crystal clear, with vibrant colors and balanced light. Unfortunately, whether you are editing on your own or collaborating with a team, this can be difficult to achieve because color problems often occur. Unlike photo editors, where one photo can easily be fixed without affecting the rest of an album, video editing requires adjusting to fix one problem. We'll look at three different methods to correct color distortion in videos.

#### In this article

01 [What Is Color Distortion](#part1)

02 [How will Color Distortion Affect Your Videos?](#part2)

03 [Different Methods to Correct Color Distortion in Videos](#part3)

## What Is Color Distortion

Color distortion, also called chromatic aberration (CA), happens when the camera's lens cannot resolve the wavelengths of light that it is recording. It occurs due to dispersion, which is when the lens elements' refractive index varies with the light wavelength.

The refractive index of transparent materials often reduces with increasing wavelength. Because a lens' focal length depends on the index of refraction, this variation in refraction index affects focusing.

There are two types of CA: transverse (lateral) and axial (longitudinal). Axial aberration happens when different wavelengths of light focus at different distances from a lens (focus shift). Essentially, longitudinal aberration is often at long focal lengths.

On the other hand, transverse aberration happens when different wavelengths focus at different places in the focal plane due to the magnification or distortion of the lens varying with wavelength. Ideally, transverse aberration is often at short focal lengths.

The two types of CA have different characteristics, and they may occur together. Axial chromatic aberration occurs throughout an image, and you can reduce it by stopping down, hence increasing the depth of the field so that although the different wavelengths are focusing at different distances, they're still in acceptable focus.

When it comes to transverse chromatic aberration, it doesn't occur in the middle of the image, and it increases towards the edge. What's more? Stopping down does not affect it.

## How will Color Distortion Affect Your Videos?

Colour distortion displays itself as "fringes" of color on the boundaries separating bright and dark parts of the image in a video. Color distortion can also occur when adding effects to a video, such as the use of a green screen. By using the green screen to replace the real thing, the colors in the video can appear a little off.

## Different Methods to Correct Color Distortion in Videos

There are several methods to correct color distortion in your video. They include.

### Method 1: Correct Color Distortion in Videos Using Filmora

Filmora is user-friendly software with powerful tools that allow users to tweak the color settings and correct color distortion. Follow the steps below to learn how to correct color distortion in videos using Filmora.

Nothing is more satisfying than seeing the final cut of a video and realizing that everything we filmed is crystal clear, with vibrant colors and balanced light. Unfortunately, whether you are editing on your own or collaborating with a team, this can be difficult to achieve because color problems often occur. Unlike photo editors, where one photo can easily be fixed without affecting the rest of an album, video editing requires adjusting to fix one problem. We'll look at three different methods to correct color distortion in videos.

## What Is Color Distortion

Color distortion, also called chromatic aberration (CA), happens when the camera's lens cannot resolve the wavelengths of light that it is recording. It occurs due to dispersion, which is when the lens elements' refractive index varies with the light wavelength.

The refractive index of transparent materials often reduces with increasing wavelength. Because a lens' focal length depends on the index of refraction, this variation in refraction index affects focusing.

There are two types of CA: transverse (lateral) and axial (longitudinal). Axial aberration happens when different wavelengths of light focus at different distances from a lens (focus shift). Essentially, longitudinal aberration is often at long focal lengths.

On the other hand, transverse aberration happens when different wavelengths focus at different places in the focal plane due to the magnification or distortion of the lens varying with wavelength. Ideally, transverse aberration is often at short focal lengths.

The two types of CA have different characteristics, and they may occur together. Axial chromatic aberration occurs throughout an image, and you can reduce it by stopping down, hence increasing the depth of the field so that although the different wavelengths are focusing at different distances, they're still in acceptable focus.

When it comes to transverse chromatic aberration, it doesn't occur in the middle of the image, and it increases towards the edge. What's more? Stopping down does not affect it.

## How will Color Distortion Affect Your Videos?

Colour distortion displays itself as "fringes" of color on the boundaries separating bright and dark parts of the image in a video. Color distortion can also occur when adding effects to a video, such as the use of a green screen. By using the green screen to replace the real thing, the colors in the video can appear a little off.
