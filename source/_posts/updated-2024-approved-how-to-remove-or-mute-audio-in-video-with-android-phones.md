Once the video editor has loaded, go to the Media tab's Import menu and select Import a Media Folder. Navigate to the folder containing the materials for your slideshow, select it with a click, then hit OK to import it into your project.

 **Step 2**: Position the Media Files on the Timeline

 Simply select a file to be added to the timeline and drag and drop it to the preferred location. Repeat this method for all of the images you'd like to include in your slideshow, then organise them in the same order as they'll appear in the presentation.

**Step 3**: Avoid Hard Cuts Between Slides by Using Transitions

A hard cut between two photographs can break the flow of your slideshow, but you can simply correct this by transitioning gently from one slide to the next.

If you double-click a transition after it's been added to the timeline, you'll be sent to the Transition Setting Window, where you can define the default duration for all transitions you add to a slideshow and choose your preferred transition mode.

## Create Motion Effect with Path Blur In Photoshop

There are different kinds of blur effects that redefine the movement and intensity of an image. By applying a suitable blur effect, you can increase the visual appeal of your still photo by emphasizing a certain motion. Path blur is one of the trending motion blur effects that people use to enhance their photos instantly. Through this article, you can learn how to use **path blur in Photoshop** conveniently.

## Part 1: What is Path Blur and How Does It Work?

Path blur is a kind of motion blur that highlights a motion and speed in a certain direction. It helps to create a sense of movement by adjusting the blur intensity and central point. If you want to display a stimulating motion in an image, path blur can assist you in this regard.

Path blur works by adjusting two variables: Speed and Taper. By adjusting the speed slider, you can specify the amount of path blur. In addition to speed, you can adjust the taper value accordingly to determine the blur trail.

![what is path blur](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/path-blur-in-photoshop-1.jpg)

This effect can instantly add new dimensions to your captured photo. For instance, if you have captured a photo of a racing car, you can add a path blur effect to give a sense of speed to it. You can easily find this special effect in Adobe Photoshop. By using the selection tools, you can effectively add a path blur effect to your image in the selected area. To know more about path blur in Photoshop, continue reading this article.

## Part 2: How to Use Path Blur in Photoshop?

Photoshop is undoubtedly the most commonly used tool to edit pictures with great configuration options. After uploading the image, you can quickly transform it by adding new effects, filters, and layers.

![create background layer copy](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/path-blur-in-photoshop-2.jpg)

Step2 Now proceed to the "Filter" section and locate the option "Blur Gallery". From there, choose the "Path Blur" option. Now you would be able to see an arrow on your screen. Using this arrow, you can specify the path blur motion. Drag and close the arrow where you want to show the speed. Also, set a higher value for the speed given on the right side. Once done, hit the "OK" button.

![choose the path blur](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/path-blur-in-photoshop-3.jpg)

### Create a Long Exposure Picture

Step1 Navigate to the Adobe Photoshop tool and begin by uploading a picture. Afterward, go to the "Filter" tab and select "Convert for Small Filters."

![select convert for the smart filters option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/path-blur-in-photoshop-4.jpg)

![delete the blue dot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/path-blur-in-photoshop-6.jpg)

Step4 Utilize the noise section to add a grainy effect in the blurred area. Once done, click on the "OK" button. Now select the masking tool to select the area in your picture. Afterward, choose the "Smart Mask" filter and then navigate to the "Fill" option given in the "Edit" section.

![select the fill option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/path-blur-in-photoshop-7.jpg)
