## 1\. What is YouTube live chat?

Every day, more than 30 million individuals use YouTube to upload and watch entertaining videos. Many individuals are interested in having a conversation with the video's producer or later on discussing these films with others. You can now have live video chats on YouTube using the Google+ Hangouts On Air service because Google's YouTube has opened up its live streaming service to all users in good standing.

The live chat box appears to the right of the video player as soon as the live stream starts. Both the video and the live chat's material will be archived once the live stream stops. People can rewatch the video with live chat if necessary.

On YouTube, there are two different live chat views:

* Best chat: The messages that may hurt you are filtered out in this display.
* Live chat: No messages are filtered in this display.

Additionally, the live chat will not be available if the channel or live stream is intended for children.

## 2\. How to comment on YouTube live chat?

YouTube users would like to comment on the live chat when the stream starts. Here are the steps for posting a comment in the YouTube Live Chat

Step1Create a YouTube account and sign in using your username and email. You cannot post any messages at tall if you are not signed into your YouTube account.

Step2Join the live stream. Click the live stream that you want to watch after selecting it.

Step3Click where it says, "Live Chat" and start typing anything you want to publish in the chat box. Next, select the

send button.

Additionally, a number of YouTube viewers frequently lament their inability to comment on livestreams or the fact that their messages keep disappearing. Because certain comments are flagged as spam and filtered, this is the cause. There is no other option but to post constructive criticism. If the streamer is one you enjoy or if you don't want to miss the author's next live stream. Then choose "HIDE Chat" if you don't want to see any comments at all. The procedures below can be used if you simply want to have a private conversation or reply to someone.

A perfect example is writing a chat about something very empowering. When you choose to correspond this type of content through text, it could take a little more effort and a bit of intricately used language to build up the reader and get the desired effect of empowering the reader. Emojis are very accurate in passing out the meaning and are shorter than words. That is the primary reason why all-in-all emojis can save effort and time to create your Discord chat.

Select “Create New Project” to start the editing. At first, you have to choose both the overlay clip and background clip and add them to the timeline. You can either import from the library or drag the files to the timeline in the positions shown in the picture.

You can edit the overlay clip individually by adding animation, effects, filterers, mask frame, and blending modes (multiply, darken, or color burn). Let us move to the next step, how to put the background on the green screen.

##### Step2 Make a Green Screen

Let’s get into the first step to add background to the green screen video. In this part, you will be using a green screen to remove the background. So, import the green screen clips to the media library. Now, add the background green screen to the timeline above the video track as shown in the picture.

![import green screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/place-green-screen-background-videos.jpg)

● Move the cursor to the green screen on the timeline and double-click on it.

● The settings box will appear on the left.

● You have to tick the Chroma key there.

The green screen effects will be applied automatically.

![refine video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/green-screen-overlay-video-chroma-key-settings.jpg)

The video can be refined with many additional tools like Tolerance, Offset, and Alpha channel to make the video background clear. Once satisfied with the results, click on OK. Now that we have discussed how to add background to green screen video with the help of Filmora let’s now discuss how to add a background to a video without a green screen.

## Part 2 Add background to video without a green screen

Let us learn how to add a background to a video without a green screen. In Filmora, there is a special effect called the Human segmentation effect to isolate people from the backgrounds without a green screen. All it takes is a few clicks. Once you remove the surround, you can add an image or a video clip to go well with your original video. Another unique feature is that after removing the background from the video clip, you can add it to the overlay of another video clip. It works well when it has a natural and single person in front of the camera.

### 2\. Baby and Kids Videos

Who doesn't like babies? One idea for funny videos is sharing your baby's or kid's activities. Babies and kids are very cute, adorable, and innocent. They always do cute little disasters, which are fun to watch. You can share their funny and cute moments with everyone. Kids and babies can easily make everyone laugh. Their cuteness will attract the audience.

### 3\. Challenge Videos

Challenge videos are another type of video which are fun to watch. Simple challenges which do not harm anyone in any way are encouraged. Challenge videos automatically become funny. Things get funny when someone can't complete the challenge and is desperate to get it done. Completing the challenge and struggling to get things done seems funny.

### 4\. Plan a Skit

Skits are very successful. The factors that help in making unique skits are the idea and the humor. If both things are amazing and well presented, your skit will shine. The fact because skits are short comedy films, they effortlessly attract the audience. So, creating skits is another fantastic idea for funny YouTube content.

### 5\. Blooper Videos

Blooper videos are naturally funny. You don't have to put extra effort to make them funny. Bloopers are the funny things that take place while you try to record something. Bloopers never make it to the final video, but they are always fun to watch. So instead of watching and enjoying them alone, you can share them on YouTube so that everyone can enjoy the fun behind the scenes.
