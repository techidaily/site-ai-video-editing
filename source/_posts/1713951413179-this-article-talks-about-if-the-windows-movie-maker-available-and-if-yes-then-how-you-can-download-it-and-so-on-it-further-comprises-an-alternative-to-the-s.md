## How Long Does It Take To Edit Videos

If you want to put together the pieces for online videos the number one thing most of the time takes is **editing.**

**Why does editing take so much time and what to do for that?**

* **Too many choices.**

It completely depends upon how many choices you are giving yourself while editing a video. It takes time to make choices. For example, if your friend asks you to buy a card (any card) from the store. You go into the store and start searching cards from more than 50000 cards, it takes time. On the other hand, if your friend asks you to buy a card for his uncle’s pet dog. This time it becomes easier for you to go straight and choose from the pet cards without moving around the birthday and anniversary cards.

* **Amount of footage.**

It depends upon how much footage you have on your edit and what kind of content you are editing. Some of the content is really complex and takes a lot of time like V-logging but at the same time, you may have content that requires very less edit or zero edit.

The video editing will become a slit and a quick process for you compared to what it was a few years back. But there are a few key things that really speed up the editing process.

I am going to discuss from beginning to end how to edit a video.

1. **Outline**

You should take a paper and write down what you are going to say about your video. It would make your editing easy because you have already structured your content.

1. **Avoid distractions**

While editing you make a **flow state** in which the editing process becomes easier. But when you got distracted it takes a lot of time to get back to that flow state.

* My **kids** are my big distraction so, I usually start my editing process after they go to bed. (You can set yours).
* Keep your **phone** away because it is another distraction that consumes most of your time.
* Don’t keep **re-watching** your video all the time. Usually, people edit the first clip and before starting to edit the second clip they watch the first clip. After that, they edit the second clip and then re-watch the first and the second clip. It is also wasting a lot of your time. Do it at the end.

## **3\.** **Davinci Resolve for Mac.**

The Davinci Resolve is the most professional video editing software on Mac. It is absolutely ridiculous that it is giving access to you for free. Along with this, it is very professional video editing software that people used to create Hollywood movies and that kind of stuff. It provides a very easy and professional interphase that anyone can use without having training.

* The controls and features in the software are amazing and can edit videos **frame by frame.**

![video-editing-spend-time](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-editing-spend-time-12.jpg)

* There is also a dedicated area for **audio creation**.

![video-editing-spend-time](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-editing-spend-time-13.jpg)

* The **motion graphics** and

![video-editing-spend-time](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-editing-spend-time-14.jpg)

* A specific area just for **color grading** and **color correcting.**

![video-editing-spend-time](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-editing-spend-time-15.jpg)

That’s why the Davinci Resolve has got its name as a **finishing application** of movies. People come in and color grade their videos. As it is a very powerful software hence if you are working with an old computer and that’s not really a powerful computer, the Davinci Resolve would not be going to work properly for you.

It completely depends upon how many choices you are giving yourself while editing a video. It takes time to make choices. For example, if your friend asks you to buy a card (any card) from the store. You go into the store and start searching cards from more than 50000 cards, it takes time. On the other hand, if your friend asks you to buy a card for his uncle’s pet dog. This time it becomes easier for you to go straight and choose from the pet cards without moving around the birthday and anniversary cards.

* **Amount of footage.**

It depends upon how much footage you have on your edit and what kind of content you are editing. Some of the content is really complex and takes a lot of time like V-logging but at the same time, you may have content that requires very less edit or zero edit.

The video editing will become a slit and a quick process for you compared to what it was a few years back. But there are a few key things that really speed up the editing process.

I am going to discuss from beginning to end how to edit a video.

1. **Outline**

You should take a paper and write down what you are going to say about your video. It would make your editing easy because you have already structured your content.

1. **Avoid distractions**

While editing you make a **flow state** in which the editing process becomes easier. But when you got distracted it takes a lot of time to get back to that flow state.

* My **kids** are my big distraction so, I usually start my editing process after they go to bed. (You can set yours).
* Keep your **phone** away because it is another distraction that consumes most of your time.
* Don’t keep **re-watching** your video all the time. Usually, people edit the first clip and before starting to edit the second clip they watch the first clip. After that, they edit the second clip and then re-watch the first and the second clip. It is also wasting a lot of your time. Do it at the end.

## **How to Edit Video Faster with the Best Video Editor**

Here is an important feature you should know.

![video-editing-spend-time](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/video-editing-spend-time-4.jpg)

* You can match the reference frame with the current to match their colors.

Here are a few simple methods for combining two or more videos into one and posting them on Instagram (IG).

Using the Instagram official app

There is no simple way to combine many videos into one on Instagram. You can, however, utilize the Story technique.

1) Create an Instagram Story with two or more videos. You can add stickers, text, and other elements if you like.

2) Tap the three dots icon on your Instagram Tale > Save > Save story. Your current Instagram Stories films and photos will be saved to the Photos app as a single video file.

3) Upload the resulting Video to Instagram!

1. Wondershare Filmora is an easy-to-use video merger.

Before I detail online video joiners, I'd like to mention Wondershare Filmora, which can automatically merge video files without or with transitions.

Part 2: Using Filmora to combine, merge, and join clips

To join videos, first, import them.

You can drag the files from Windows File Explorer to the User's Album or click the "Import" button on the window and choose files from your computer. All imported files will appear in thumbnail format in the User's Album. To preview a file in the right-hand preview window, double-click it.

1. To merge video files, drag & drop them.

Move videos from the User's Album to the video track on the Timeline after that. All video files will be combined into a single video with no transition. However, you can use the following method to add transitions between video clips.

1. Add transitions in the third step (optional)

Add transitions between clips for a smooth transition from one to the next to make the linked videos look like a complete movie. Go to the Transition tab and drag the desired change to the intersection of two clips. You can also right-click any transition to bring up a menu with choices such as "Apply to All" and "Random to All" for your convenience.

Step 4: Combine video files into a single file.

Now that you've seen the merged Movie click the "Export" option to save the several video segments to a single file. Select any format from the list under the Format tab. All of the most common video formats are supported. Choose "Device" and choose the thumbnail of your device to play the combined video file on iPod, iPhone, or iPad. You may also publish the combined Video on YouTube or burn it to DVDs to watch on television.
