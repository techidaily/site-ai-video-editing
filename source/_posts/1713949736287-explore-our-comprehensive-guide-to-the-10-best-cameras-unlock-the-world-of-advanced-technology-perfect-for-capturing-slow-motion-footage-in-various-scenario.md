## Part 1\. How to Add Text Animation in After Effects

You may roughly follow the instructions in this article and produce a similar effect with After Effects if you are familiar with that application and prefer it for graphics and animations. Using Adobe AE, let's demonstrate how to make a text animation effect.

### 1\. After Effects' Fly-in Text Animation

Fortunately, creating this type of effect inside of Adobe AE is really fairly simple and doesn't need downloading and installing any other templates. For those who are knowledgeable with AE and want to create the effect, that is a significant bonus.

**Steps to Add Fly-in Text Animation in AE:**

Step1 The first step is adding your Title Layer to a Comp that has a colorful backdrop and create a route for the text to follow using the Pen tool.

![title layer styles premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/title-layer-styles-premiere.jpg)

Step2 In the next step, rotate the Text menu, Path Options, and Layer down. Using the Pen Tool, change the path to the mask you just created. To advance a few frames, use your keyboard's directional keys.

![select pen tool premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/select-pen-tool-premiere.jpg)

Step3 Afterwards, set a Keyframe for First Margin at frame 0; reduce the value to whatever is appropriate for your Path and change the First Margin value to 0 at frame 30 to center the text on the path's length.

![key frmae margin premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/key-frmae-margin-premiere.jpg)

Step4 Lastly, give this keyframe an Easy Ease to setup the Fly-in text animation.

### 2\. After Effects Typewriter Animation

While the classic typewriter effect could seem a bit antiquated, combining it with additional text effects will result in something fresh and interesting.

**Steps to Add Typewriter Animation in After Effects:**

Step1 In the Media Viewer, choose the Text tool and enter your title. Then, use the Character panel to change the font, color, and size.

But most crucially, speed and quality are not sacrificed with any of these choices. It's about coding. When using other people's code, also label the author. Using FFmpeg, you can separate the audio. The audio in video files may be removed, added, extracted, and added again with the help of this powerful utility.

You will only need to [**install FFmpeg**](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) on your computer after you have purchased it. Removing video is straightforward, so you won't have to put in much effort to achieve this goal. Let's look at the many methods available.

**Use the Command Line**

Step1 The command to extract audio from your video file is visible for your review.

![ffmpeg use the command](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/remove-audio-from-video-ffmpeg-2.jpg)

Step2 It would be helpful if you updated the extension and the name of the file that was entered, but other than that, you won't need to do anything else.

![ffmpeg audio command](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/remove-audio-from-video-ffmpeg-3.jpg)

The preceding command is successful if the input file certifies. This is why you need to find the codec for the audio stream. If you obey this order, you will accomplish what you set out to do. A user might sometimes use an audio format returned by the previous command. However, this will only occasionally be successful.

The storage format that FFmpeg employs is determined by looking at the output file's extension. It would help if you knew that a storage format, a container, and an audio format are distinct. You will encounter a scenario where the audio format does not have a container named after it. Two problematic formats are among the most common formats; they are PCM and Vorbis. OGG is compatible with Vorbis, whereas WAV is compatible with PCM.

Let's investigate another approach to extract audio from a video using FFmpeg if the prior one was too difficult for you to grasp.

**Use the Terminal**

Step1 Verify that the format remains the same.

You will need to locate the video in its original format to be able to extract the audio from it. If you are unfamiliar with the primary format, you will be unable to determine the appropriate file extension. Because of this, you are going to need to make use of the ffprobe command.

![ffmpeg check the original format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/remove-audio-from-video-ffmpeg-4.jpg)

Now, change "myvideo.mp4" to the name of the video file you want to use. This will verify that you are familiar with the video's original file format.

After learning about the original audio's format, you can reencode a video clip to remove the audio from it.

![ffmpeg reencoding](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/remove-audio-from-video-ffmpeg-5.jpg)

Step2 Modify the format, please.

You might try replacing myvideo.mp4 with the directory and filename to see if it helps. Additionally, it would be helpful if you updated the name of the audio.ogg file with the name you want to use.

Therefore, if you follow the two approaches discussed above, you can extract audio from your video files with little to no work. To completely comprehend the stages, you must examine them in great detail.
