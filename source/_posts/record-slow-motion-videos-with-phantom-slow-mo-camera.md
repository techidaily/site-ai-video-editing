**Frame blending** is a video editing technique used to create smooth transitions between two video frames. This process is often used to create special effects or transition between two different video clips. Frame blending can be done manually or with the help of software.

When **frame blending** is done manually, the editor will take two consecutive frames and blend them. This is done by using a process called cross-fading. Cross-fading is when the first frame gradually fades out while the second frame gradually fades in. The result is a seamless transition between the two frames.

Frame blending can also be done with the help of software. Many software programs offer frame blending capabilities Like Adobe Premiere Pro and more. These software programs typically have a user interface that allows the user to select the two frames that they want to blend. The software will then perform the cross-fading process automatically.

03 [How to use Frame Blanding in Adobe Premiere Pro?](#part3)

## What is frame blending in Premiere Pro?

In Adobe Premiere Pro, frame blending is a built-in feature that can be used to create smooth transitions between two video frames. This feature can be accessed by selecting the "Effects" tab and choosing the "Frame Blending" option.

When using frame blending in Premiere Pro, the user will first need to select the two frames they want to blend. The user can then specify the amount of cross-fade they want to apply. The software will then automatically perform the frame blending process.

![what is frame blending in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/frame-blending-premiere-pro-2.jpg)

## How to Choose from Frame Blending/ Frame Sampling/ Optical Flow

The different types of frame blending are:

* **Frame Sampling:** best for smooth movements, no image distortion.
* **Optical Flow:** smoother results but can cause image distortion.
* **Frame Blending:** a mix of the two, some image distortion but smoother results.

So, choosing which type of frame blending to use depends on the footage and the desired results. If you want smooth results with no image distortion, frame sampling is the best option. However, if you don't mind some image distortion in exchange for smoother results, optical flow or frame blending would be better choices.

How to decide which option is the best for your use? Let's explain more, and It depends on the footage and the desired results. If you want smooth results with no image distortion, frame sampling is the best option. However, if you don't mind some image distortion in exchange for smoother results, optical flow or frame blending would be better choices.

**Frame blending** is a video editing technique used to create smooth transitions between two video frames. This process is often used to create special effects or transition between two different video clips. Frame blending can be done manually or with the help of software.

When **frame blending** is done manually, the editor will take two consecutive frames and blend them. This is done by using a process called cross-fading. Cross-fading is when the first frame gradually fades out while the second frame gradually fades in. The result is a seamless transition between the two frames.

Frame blending can also be done with the help of software. Many software programs offer frame blending capabilities Like Adobe Premiere Pro and more. These software programs typically have a user interface that allows the user to select the two frames that they want to blend. The software will then perform the cross-fading process automatically.
