## Part 3\. Film Shots of Underwater

Filming underwater is always a dream of any videographer, but we were limited to get shots from the water's surface. So now it's time to add more creativity to your video.

First, you need to take a transparent container or any glass container. Pour water according to your need in it.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Ensure the container is light enough to put on the phone.

Then, place the container on the lens of the phone to make a video. Then, take care of the phone from the water.

**Pro Tip:** You can also shine light source in water and add glitter or colors to get more astonishing shots.

## Part 4\. Make Colourful Shots Without Coloured Lights

All filmmakers love party lights and want to add colors like that in the video. Different colored lights in videos usually represent different mood swings and enhance the creativity of storytellers.

Professional videographers use expensive lights to give these effects. But you don’t need to purchase any expensive gear. Because you can make colorful shots easily with colored plastic binder dividers, or you can also use cellophane wraps.

First, wrap the colored divider around the LED light or any light you use to shoot video.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Check the light temperature after short intervals because it melts or burns the dividers when the light source gets hot.

![wrap the led light with a green divider](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/mimic-professional-filming-gears-4.png)

Now make the video and try with different colors to add suspense, horror, and happy effects to the video.

The interesting thing is that if light has more shape, it will precisely describe more about the scene's backstory, location, and context. Give it a try!

##### Step1 Cutting of cardboards

Cut the cardboard in any shape, whatever you want. We will experiment by cutting cardboard in window blinds shape.

Become more creative and make more shapes with cardboard because the audience always prefers new content in the market.

## Part 6\. Create Point of View Shots

After adding colors and shapes, now it's time to get some Point of View (POV) shots. Most of the time, viewers become bored by watching framing and filming coverages.

POV shots are mostly captured from a specific angle to show an object's characters. They are mostly seen in food commercials, and videographers of snacks just love to make these shots.

To make POV shots, there is nothing specific required. You just have to make a suitable position for the lens. Follow the below guidelines and capture it!

##### Step1 Cut ends of packet

To create POV shots of your favorite snack, first of all, cut down both ends of the packets.

##### Step2 Attach packet on a camera

After cutting, attach the packet of snacks to the camera lens or phone with the help of old-fashioned tape.

Ensure the camera is turned on, and then make a POV shot. Now, it's time to enjoy the rest part with the audience. Check out the final results, as shown below!

What if we add the rotatory shots, too, in the video? For this, check out the last tip and try that!

## Part 7\. Create a Barrel Roll Shot

Barrel roll shots are the full axial shot by spinning the camera lens. Epic shots that formerly required costly gimbals and sophisticated techniques are now as simple as strolling.

It’s pretty easy to make a rotatory shot at 360° by using equipment easily available at home. Rolling may feel anxiety and disorientation. Filmmakers utilize it to confuse or unnerve audiences in movies.

There is no need to purchase expensive gambles to make barrel roll clips. Instead, try this hack by utilizing a power drill present at your home. Then, follow the below steps to give it a professional look!

##### Step1 Take equipment

First, take a camera lens or smartphone, whatever you are using to make a video, and a power drill as a gimbal.

##### Step2 Camera with drill

![smartphone attached to the power drill](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/mimic-professional-filming-gears-9.png)

**Supported OS: Linux, BSD, Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows**

Avidemux offers three fundamental operations: cutting, encoding, and filtering. Cutting allows users to copy, paste, save, or delete a specific part of a video and is incredibly beneficial when users are only interested in a small portion of a video or want to remove commercials from a TV show that they have recorded.

Encoding, on the other contrary, is the way of transforming a video to various formats so that it can be played on different players. Users of Avidemux can use this feature on videos they want to use for business or archive for personal use. They could also use this to convert a video that they intend to post online.

Users can also use Avidemux to filter their videos, which include incorporating subtitles and color profiles, deinterlacing, resizing and sharpening the image of a video, and increasing or decreasing the overall volume of the audio.

Meanwhile, Avidemux has task automation features that make video processing and editing quick and painless. A feature called Joblist allows users to organize their projects in a queue so that they can access their files from a single location. They can use this queue to handle videos in bulk as well.

**Supported OS: Linux, BSD, Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows**

Avidemux offers three fundamental operations: cutting, encoding, and filtering. Cutting allows users to copy, paste, save, or delete a specific part of a video and is incredibly beneficial when users are only interested in a small portion of a video or want to remove commercials from a TV show that they have recorded.

Encoding, on the other contrary, is the way of transforming a video to various formats so that it can be played on different players. Users of Avidemux can use this feature on videos they want to use for business or archive for personal use. They could also use this to convert a video that they intend to post online.

Users can also use Avidemux to filter their videos, which include incorporating subtitles and color profiles, deinterlacing, resizing and sharpening the image of a video, and increasing or decreasing the overall volume of the audio.

Meanwhile, Avidemux has task automation features that make video processing and editing quick and painless. A feature called Joblist allows users to organize their projects in a queue so that they can access their files from a single location. They can use this queue to handle videos in bulk as well.

**Features:**

* Multiple Formats
* Video Filters
* Advanced Interlacing
* Full Editing Control
* Simple Interface
* Open Source

**Pros:**

* Covers standard formats.
* All essential features are present.
* Surprisingly advanced filtering, processing, editing, and filtering controls.

* No longer updated
* No support

![cut-video-ffmpeg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/cut-video-ffmpeg-25.jpg)

**Supported OS: Linux, BSD, Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows**

Avidemux offers three fundamental operations: cutting, encoding, and filtering. Cutting allows users to copy, paste, save, or delete a specific part of a video and is incredibly beneficial when users are only interested in a small portion of a video or want to remove commercials from a TV show that they have recorded.

Encoding, on the other contrary, is the way of transforming a video to various formats so that it can be played on different players. Users of Avidemux can use this feature on videos they want to use for business or archive for personal use. They could also use this to convert a video that they intend to post online.

Users can also use Avidemux to filter their videos, which include incorporating subtitles and color profiles, deinterlacing, resizing and sharpening the image of a video, and increasing or decreasing the overall volume of the audio.

Meanwhile, Avidemux has task automation features that make video processing and editing quick and painless. A feature called Joblist allows users to organize their projects in a queue so that they can access their files from a single location. They can use this queue to handle videos in bulk as well.

More notably, this is a capable all-in-one video cutter. In addition to cutting videos and audio, it can convert all popular video formats, extract audio from video files, and merge video and audio files from the same source into a new one.

**Features:**

### Convert to Any File Format

**Pros:**

* Offers an easy way to cut, merge, and convert video files
