## Part 1\. Popular text effects in Filmora

There are unlimited text effects available in Filmora but some of them are extremely popular that video creators regularly use in their videos. Here is the list of the popular Filmora video editor text effects that you should be aware of.

### 1\. Text Swipe Effect

Text swipe effects are the most commonly used in today’s videos on social media and video streaming platforms. In this effect, the text slides into the video frame from a particular direction. The entire text can swipe in if it is a one-liner and it can even swipe in word by word or sentence by sentence.

If you want to show short texts and you do not want to experiment with text animations, the text swipe effect is the safest option. For example, if you want to display your social media handles, your location, a coupon code, or a correction phrase that you have uttered wrongly, text swipe effects should be on your video.

### 2\. Type Text Effect

The type text effect in Filmora is referred to as the typewriter text effect in Premiere Pro and After Effects. The effect displays the text as if it is being typed in real-time as it is done in a typewriter. The characters will appear on the screen with a cursor on the screen and therefore, it takes more duration than most other text effects.

The type text effect is particularly useful when you are displaying a large size of text on the screen. It is also widely used when showing a paragraph of text instead of a simple line. This helps in drawing the attention of the audience to the paragraph and retaining the attention for a longer duration of time.

### 3\. WordArt Effect

WordArt is synonymous with MS Word where large words have 3D effects and highlighted background. Apart from 3D effect, text can have a thick stroke or outline as well as a gradient color style when WordArt effect is applied. In Filmora, you will find a plethora of WordArt effects and some are them are modern while others have a retro feel to them.

The WordArt effect is particularly popular while displaying titles and funny texts on the entire screen or covering a large part of the video. These are mostly used in the opening or ending scenes of the video. Besides, some video creators use them while making transitions from one scene to another.

### 4\. Keyframe

If you want to create text animations as per your requirements, you have to use keyframes in any video editor. You can always apply the ready-made video editing text effects but if you want to customize and personalize, you can add keyframes in between two timestamps. Thereafter, you need to change text styles and parameters for each frame so that it looks like an animation.

If you want to add uniqueness to text animations so that you can make the audience wonder and appreciate, keyframes are the way. Adding keyframes in the text layer on Filmora is super easy and you can get effects like texts slowly scaling up, dancing randomly, changing fonts, and much more.

### 5\. Color Text Effect

The color text effect is becoming extremely popular and it is widely used for opening and ending credits. Flashing different colors through your texts and titles against a darker background can act as a feast for the human eyes. There are different types of color text effects available that can make your text stand out.

When you are using color text effect, you need to maintain a large font size for your text so that it is widely visible. Even if your background is not dark, you can use a darker box in the background of the text or a darker frame around the text to amplify the effect.

### 6\. Bounce to Zoom Effect

The bounce to zoom effect is widely used during a transition from one scene to another. It is regarded as a funny text effect where the text can swipe in and bounce and enlarge in size. Alternatively, the characters can bounce individually and zoom in and out with the motion as if they are dancing.

Apart from transitions, you can use the bounce to zoom effect to showcase a few important texts at the bottom of the video so that the viewers notice your text. Generally, the effect lasts for a few seconds before the text disappears. When you are using it for a larger text, you can use it for promotions and advertisements as well.

## Part 2\. Smooth Camera Movement with A Door

With a simple mobile camera, you can make smooth shots of any action, like walking, running, and playing. There is no need to get any professional gear.

## Part 3\. Film Shots of Underwater

Filming underwater is always a dream of any videographer, but we were limited to get shots from the water's surface. So now it's time to add more creativity to your video.

First, you need to take a transparent container or any glass container. Pour water according to your need in it.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Ensure the container is light enough to put on the phone.

Then, place the container on the lens of the phone to make a video. Then, take care of the phone from the water.

![filming underwater](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/mimic-professional-filming-gears-3.jpg)

**Pro Tip:** You can also shine light source in water and add glitter or colors to get more astonishing shots.

## Part 4\. Make Colourful Shots Without Coloured Lights

All filmmakers love party lights and want to add colors like that in the video. Different colored lights in videos usually represent different mood swings and enhance the creativity of storytellers.

Professional videographers use expensive lights to give these effects. But you don’t need to purchase any expensive gear. Because you can make colorful shots easily with colored plastic binder dividers, or you can also use cellophane wraps.

First, wrap the colored divider around the LED light or any light you use to shoot video.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Check the light temperature after short intervals because it melts or burns the dividers when the light source gets hot.

![wrap the led light with a green divider](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/mimic-professional-filming-gears-4.png)

Now make the video and try with different colors to add suspense, horror, and happy effects to the video.

![final results after making colorful shots](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/mimic-professional-filming-gears-5.png)

The video still needs more creative effects and designs; scroll more to read exciting tips.

## Part 5\. Different Shapes of Light with Cardboard

To add a fantasy location in the video and make light effects in the form of shapes, try out easily available cardboard. Most of the time, aesthetic videos are made by these hacks, giving viewers different vibes.

Only a professional photographer and videographer know how to attract the audience to the shots by doing these simple hacks.

The interesting thing is that if light has more shape, it will precisely describe more about the scene's backstory, location, and context. Give it a try!

##### Step1 Cutting of cardboards

Cut the cardboard in any shape, whatever you want. We will experiment by cutting cardboard in window blinds shape.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** There is no specific recommendation for the cardboard, you can use any size or shape which suits you the best.

![shaping of cardboard](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/mimic-professional-filming-gears-6.png)

##### Step2 Make shots in different shapes of light

After giving shape, now move the cardboard around the light source and make a video. It seems like the subject is sitting near the window and has aesthetic vibes.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** The more precise the cutting of cardboard, the more professional it looks.

![final preview](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/mimic-professional-filming-gears-7.png)

Become more creative and make more shapes with cardboard because the audience always prefers new content in the market.

## Part 6\. Create Point of View Shots

After adding colors and shapes, now it's time to get some Point of View (POV) shots. Most of the time, viewers become bored by watching framing and filming coverages.

POV shots are mostly captured from a specific angle to show an object's characters. They are mostly seen in food commercials, and videographers of snacks just love to make these shots.

To make POV shots, there is nothing specific required. You just have to make a suitable position for the lens. Follow the below guidelines and capture it!

##### Step1 Cut ends of packet

To create POV shots of your favorite snack, first of all, cut down both ends of the packets.

##### Step2 Attach packet on a camera

After cutting, attach the packet of snacks to the camera lens or phone with the help of old-fashioned tape.

Ensure the camera is turned on, and then make a POV shot. Now, it's time to enjoy the rest part with the audience. Check out the final results, as shown below!

![final preview of pov shot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/mimic-professional-filming-gears-8.gif)

Due to this, the food seems good, and you can notice the number of spices too. This one actually looks amazing!

What if we add the rotatory shots, too, in the video? For this, check out the last tip and try that!

## Part 7\. Create a Barrel Roll Shot

Barrel roll shots are the full axial shot by spinning the camera lens. Epic shots that formerly required costly gimbals and sophisticated techniques are now as simple as strolling.

It’s pretty easy to make a rotatory shot at 360° by using equipment easily available at home. Rolling may feel anxiety and disorientation. Filmmakers utilize it to confuse or unnerve audiences in movies.

There is no need to purchase expensive gambles to make barrel roll clips. Instead, try this hack by utilizing a power drill present at your home. Then, follow the below steps to give it a professional look!

##### Step1 Take equipment

First, take a camera lens or smartphone, whatever you are using to make a video, and a power drill as a gimbal.

##### Step2 Camera with drill

Attach the camera to the power drill with the help of old-fashioned tape.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You should have a piece of square foam or soft block placed between the camera and drill to assist.

![smartphone attached to the power drill](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/mimic-professional-filming-gears-9.png)

Now, it’s time to turn on the drill and ensure that the video option is **“Turn On”** in the camera. Then, enjoy the shots of 360° with your audience!

![final result of barrel roll shot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/mimic-professional-filming-gears-10.gif)

## Conclusion

Finally, you get a filmy video after performing above mentioned 6 DIY hacks without expensive gear. More creativity in a video attracts more audience, which makes you more prior in the videography industry.

You can also try more tools at home and share your ideas with others to get reviews on them and make better changes. Make sure that you are taking all safety measures and precautions.

Then, place the container on the lens of the phone to make a video. Then, take care of the phone from the water.

Professional videographers use expensive lights to give these effects. But you don’t need to purchase any expensive gear. Because you can make colorful shots easily with colored plastic binder dividers, or you can also use cellophane wraps.

First, wrap the colored divider around the LED light or any light you use to shoot video.

**Note:** Check the light temperature after short intervals because it melts or burns the dividers when the light source gets hot.

![wrap the led light with a green divider](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/mimic-professional-filming-gears-4.png)

Now make the video and try with different colors to add suspense, horror, and happy effects to the video.

The video still needs more creative effects and designs; scroll more to read exciting tips.

## Part 5\. Different Shapes of Light with Cardboard

To add a fantasy location in the video and make light effects in the form of shapes, try out easily available cardboard. Most of the time, aesthetic videos are made by these hacks, giving viewers different vibes.

Only a professional photographer and videographer know how to attract the audience to the shots by doing these simple hacks.

The interesting thing is that if light has more shape, it will precisely describe more about the scene's backstory, location, and context. Give it a try!

##### Step1 Cutting of cardboards

Cut the cardboard in any shape, whatever you want. We will experiment by cutting cardboard in window blinds shape.

**Note:** There is no specific recommendation for the cardboard, you can use any size or shape which suits you the best.

##### Step2 Make shots in different shapes of light

After giving shape, now move the cardboard around the light source and make a video. It seems like the subject is sitting near the window and has aesthetic vibes.

**Note:** The more precise the cutting of cardboard, the more professional it looks.

![final preview](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/mimic-professional-filming-gears-7.png)

Become more creative and make more shapes with cardboard because the audience always prefers new content in the market.

## Part 6\. Create Point of View Shots

After adding colors and shapes, now it's time to get some Point of View (POV) shots. Most of the time, viewers become bored by watching framing and filming coverages.

POV shots are mostly captured from a specific angle to show an object's characters. They are mostly seen in food commercials, and videographers of snacks just love to make these shots.

To make POV shots, there is nothing specific required. You just have to make a suitable position for the lens. Follow the below guidelines and capture it!

##### Step1 Cut ends of packet

To create POV shots of your favorite snack, first of all, cut down both ends of the packets.

##### Step2 Attach packet on a camera

After cutting, attach the packet of snacks to the camera lens or phone with the help of old-fashioned tape.

Ensure the camera is turned on, and then make a POV shot. Now, it's time to enjoy the rest part with the audience. Check out the final results, as shown below!

![final preview of pov shot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/mimic-professional-filming-gears-8.gif)

Due to this, the food seems good, and you can notice the number of spices too. This one actually looks amazing!

What if we add the rotatory shots, too, in the video? For this, check out the last tip and try that!

## Part 7\. Create a Barrel Roll Shot

Barrel roll shots are the full axial shot by spinning the camera lens. Epic shots that formerly required costly gimbals and sophisticated techniques are now as simple as strolling.

It’s pretty easy to make a rotatory shot at 360° by using equipment easily available at home. Rolling may feel anxiety and disorientation. Filmmakers utilize it to confuse or unnerve audiences in movies.

There is no need to purchase expensive gambles to make barrel roll clips. Instead, try this hack by utilizing a power drill present at your home. Then, follow the below steps to give it a professional look!

##### Step1 Take equipment

First, take a camera lens or smartphone, whatever you are using to make a video, and a power drill as a gimbal.

##### Step2 Camera with drill

Attach the camera to the power drill with the help of old-fashioned tape.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You should have a piece of square foam or soft block placed between the camera and drill to assist.

![smartphone attached to the power drill](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/mimic-professional-filming-gears-9.png)

Now, it’s time to turn on the drill and ensure that the video option is **“Turn On”** in the camera. Then, enjoy the shots of 360° with your audience!

## Conclusion

Finally, you get a filmy video after performing above mentioned 6 DIY hacks without expensive gear. More creativity in a video attracts more audience, which makes you more prior in the videography industry.
