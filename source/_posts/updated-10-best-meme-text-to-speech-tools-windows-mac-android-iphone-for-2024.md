### 01Identify the audience

Before creating a slideshow, you first need to ascertain who is your target audience. The slideshow can be created for your friends, family, relatives, or YouTube or social media platform viewers. Depending on the target audience, the content and other slideshow elements will vary.

### 02Choose a travel story

Next, you need to decide upon the story of your travel slideshow. Depending on the story, you can pick up the content to be included. The story can be based on the places you visited, food, local shopping, and others. Also draft a story that has an introduction, a middle part, and an end.

### 03Sort the pictures and videos

Next comes the trickiest part of selecting the pictures and videos to be added to the slideshow. For any trip, there are hundreds of images but you cannot add them all to your slideshow. So, depending on the target audience and your travel story, pick up the most appropriate ones. Pick up the number of images and videos so that the total slideshow length is around 5-7 minutes.

Next, choose the transitions you want to add between the images and the videos. There are slideshow-making tools where you can check out different types of transition effects and use them.
