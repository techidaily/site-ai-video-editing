## Green Screen Is a Widely Used Effect in After Effects. Many Professional Photographers Use It to Make Creative Video Effects. This Guide Will Show You How to Use Green Screen to Videos in After Effects

You'll probably get the finest results in After Effects out of all the editing programs. Working with green screen footage in After Effects can be done in a variety of ways. Utilizing a built-in preset that combines three effects is advised by Adobe. Due to its ability to deliver speedy (and typically excellent) outcomes, this strategy is great for both beginners and specialists. We'll demonstrate how to do easily for you.

Let’s start off!

## 1\. Importing your footage

After you have imported your material into the After Effects project, you should next create a new composition using the footage. In the following stage, you have the option of either adding each plugin one at a time or doing it all at once. You may find them grouped together as Keylight, Key Cleaner, and Advanced Spill Suppressor in the Animation Presets box, which is located under the "Image Utilities" heading.

## 2\. Remove the green color

After Effects users can get rid of a green screen by going to the "Animation Presets" window, searching for the "Keylight" preset, dragging, and dropping it over the clip, and then shifting their focus to the "Effects Controls" window. Make sure the Screen Colour is set to the color of your screen's background (which, in this case, is green). You may do this with the color selector.

## 3\. Clean up the shot

You have no doubt observed that some of the remaining parts do not have the correct keying installed in them. In order to get rid of them, you need to put the view into the Combined Matte mode and turn the Screen Gain up a notch.

Because everything that is not transparent is turned white by Combined Matte, any remaining debris can be seen very clearly after it has been applied. After you have finished cleaning the frame, you should change the view to Intermediate Result. Your footage may become contaminated with artifacts if the Final Result view is inadvertently switched on.

![clean up green screen shot ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/clean-up-green-screen-shot-ae.jpg)

You can go to the "Screen Matte" area if you feel like the frame still needs more tweaking after you've applied the previous ones. You can accomplish that with the assistance of Clip Black and Clip White. Feel free to turn the Clip Black dial all the way to the right and turn the Clip White dial to the left. You can also adjust the other settings, if necessary, but based on my observations, everything should be working properly at this point.

## The Bottom Line

After completing this lesson, you should have a better understanding of what a chroma key is, how to get rid of a green screen in After Effects, and how to adjust some settings if something goes wrong. Keep in mind that if the footage is not captured properly, you will not be able to successfully key out the green screen in the final video. Extra caution should be taken with the lights, and spills should be avoided at all costs!

Everything is represented in this article, from the camera movement to the setting of the lights in the studio. You will also learn about aspect ratio and framing while making shots from the DSLR.

## What Is Cinematography?

Cinematography covers all aspects of how a movie or music video is made, including choosing the lighting for the scene. The type of camera equipment to use, how to frame your photographs, and how to decide on camera movement are also included in this. Let's move toward the next lines to get the cool cinematography on display.

## Light a subject

Although you may assume that cinematography is just concerned with the usage of the camera, lighting plays an equally important role. While planning your photographs, you should think about how the scene is lit and how your subject is illuminated.

![lighting a subject](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/lighting-a-subject.jpg)

The cinematographer should consider the hard and soft lights for perfect illustrations during shooting. These are depicted with the following requirements!

### Hard light and soft light

The cinematographers mainly focus on the hard and soft lights during filmmaking. The **hard lights** give a softer look to the subject. They are pointing to the light sources which are closer to the subject in the video. It makes the photographs and shots harsher and more dramatic.

![hard light on the subject](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/hard-light-on-the-subject.jpg)

The **soft light** is trying to wrap around the subject. It gives diffused shadows and soft edges to the character of the music video.

**Note:** To get better results of the soft look, you need to add diffusion to lower the intensity.

## Create Atmosphere

You need a haze machine to create the atmosphere and give the environment true vibes. The haze machine gives a foggy appearance in every shoot and scene.

## Light a Set

To give proper lights in the set is illustrated with the help of an example as shown below!

### Examples

In this music video of the 3lau's, the main prop used is a bus, which is presented in the middle of the set and lit very well. The bus is rounded by many tungsten lights, which give a resemblance to those street lights. They are set up automatically in such a way that this stimulates the real movement of the bus on the road.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![lighting a set](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/lighting-a-set.gif)

The three projectors are set to give the street footage at the back scene to add more realism.

The three lights are set in the queue by the production team to get the memory of the protagonist. In the setup, soft lights are also added on top of all the upper windows of the bus to give blue interior light to the bus.

### Prime lenses

The foremost and most helpful lenses in filming are called prime lenses, which have fixed focal lengths. There is no Johns to zoom out and zoom-in in prime lenses.

For filming, we need to choose the right level of zoom, which the DP does by picking the right lens for the footage.

![prime lens of the camera](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/prime-lens-of-the-camera.jpg)

In the close-up scenes, there is a requirement for a wider field of view which also depends on the aspect ratio of shooting.

## Aspect Ratio

In filmy view, the most appropriate aspect ratio is 2.35, which is also a cinematic ratio. There is also another ratio of 16:9, which is a wider ratio. While 2.35 gives a more narrow perspective as compared to the prior one.

![note](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** The narrow ratio is helpful in showing the relationships between the subjects.

![aspect ratio of the filming](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/aspect-ratio-of-the-filming.jpg)

Whenever we use a microscope, we are dealing with the aspect ratio and narrowing down to the required point where we want to look, and this is all about framing, which is discussed as shown below!

## Framing

Framing is a way used to illustrate the concepts such as the rule of thirds and leading lines. To give customized headroom to the subject, the framing is used from the top of the head and the top of the frame.

## Camera Movement

The camera movement actually shows the real story presented in the music video. The camera movements used for filming are mainly the pedestal, truck, pan, tilt, and roll.

![camera movements](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/camera-movements.jpg)

Whenever the protagonist looks out the bus's window, the camera operator will use the "Dolly" and "Trucking" movements.

### Trucking Movement

The trucking movement of the camera is done in left-to-right motion in the filming. This is used for emotional purposes and whenever the subject is in a pull-out shot.

### Dolly Movement

The dolly movement of the camera is done by moving towards or away from the subject. This often gives a sense of importance to the character.

## Final Words

The above article gives the exact preferences of the "Tokyo" song by which you learned a lot of techniques for your future use. By following the above rules and tips, you'll obviously come up with a viral music video.
