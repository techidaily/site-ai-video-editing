## Part 1 How to Create a Custom Slide Show in PowerPoint?

PowerPoint presentations are an already elusive and captivating media of information delivery and content sharing, be it a personal entertainment need or a high end professional requirement, PowerPoint presentations can do it all! Responding to the day to day IT upgrades of modern times, the aforesaid MS Office utility program has introduced its custom slideshow feature, which you can work upon to expand your creative skills in graphic design.

Custom slideshows are a convenient means of abstracting a required set of contents from a rather detailed slideshow presentation to address the needs of a specific audience, instead of distracting them with showcasing the entire content, most of which turns irrelevant to their exclusive requirements.

Talking about the knowhow to work with the feature, the following section encompasses a comprehensive understanding of the **custom slide show** creation process with the finest details:

**User's Guide to Create Custom Slideshows in PowerPoint**

 **Step 1: Launch the PowerPoint Tool**

Start the **custom slide show PowerPoint** creation process with launching the PowerPoint tool in any of your preferred devices. It would be better to work on a desktop or a PC. Proceed to open the presentation that you wish to create a custom slideshow from.

**Step 2: Custom Slide Show Option**

In the welcome interface of PowerPoint, navigate to the ribbon at the top and hit the ‘Slide Show' tab, followed by clicking on the ‘Custom Slide Show' button from the ‘Options Panel' that appears.

## How to Add Echo Effect to Video

If you are alone in a large empty room and you speak something, your words get echoed across the room. It will seem as if you are speaking the same words multiple times but with less volume every single time. When you have a video where you are reading out poems or giving an important message, adding an echo effect to the video makes the audio impactful and engaging.

You will need a video editor where you can add echo effect to video in simple steps. Not many video editors are available where you can add the echo effect instantly from the available sound effects and presets. That is why we have handpicked the best video editors for Windows PC and Mac users. You can also add echo effect to video online from any device directly from your web browser.

## Part 1\. How to Add Echo Effect to Video Online

If you want to add echo effect to your video one time only, there is no need to download any video editor uselessly. You can use an online audio editor to add echo effect and combine the modified audio and video files together. TwistedWave is one of the few online video editors that allow you to add echo effect to your video. Here are the steps how to add echo effect in video online.

Step 1Open your web browser and visit “twistedwave.com/online”. Click on Upload a file button to upload your video file.

![upload file twisted wave](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/upload-file-twisted-wave.jpg)

Step 2After successful uploading, TwistedWave will separate the audio portion from the uploaded video file and open it on its editor to add sound effects.

![separate audio twisted wave](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/separate-audio-twisted-wave.jpg)

Step 3On the new editor window, go to Effects> VST Effects and click on mdaDelay.so.

![download audio twisted wave](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/download-audio-twisted-wave.jpg)

## Part 2\. How to Add Echo to Video on Windows PC

If you are a Windows PC user, there are only a few video editors available where you can add echo effect instant from the built-in option. Even the most popular video editors do not have the echo effect preset in the audio effects. We recommend [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) where you can add echo effect in a few steps instantly from the built-in echo effect.

Trimming the video does not mean that you lose the parts. It is more like shortening it to fit in place.

1. **Cutting the video**

Unlike trimming, cutting involves getting rid of a section of the video completely. To do so, you need to first of all isolate that section.

With the video on the timeline, move and point your cursor at the starting point of the video and click on the scissors icon at the top. Then move it to the end of the video section and click on the scissors icon again. By so doing, you will have selected that section.

Once the section has been selected, right click on the video, select and click to delete. You can then drag the remaining parts to make them one.
