## Want to Make a Fun and Cinematic Video with an Introductory Text Title? Learn the Stages of Editing with Filmora for This Effect Here

Have you ever seen videos on social media apps or movies and seen a video in text like the title as the intro? The highly appealing and unique style makes the video introduction stand out. Not to mention, it creates an illusion of almost-transparent titles that showcase the video playing in a subdued manner in the background, thereby showcasing a modern, funky intro.

![the example of text intro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-video-in-text-intro-0.gif)

Now, are you planning to create an effect such as that on your own video project? Worry not; you do not have to hire video editing experts at enormous costs or opt for a video editing course, to name a few. With [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you can create the effect at more than half the cost and effort. Let's learn how that works.

## 1\. Accessing the software

The first step to kickstart the whole process is downloading the software into your system. For this, visit the official website of Filmora and click on the Download button at the top of the page or the description. This will automatically download an installer for the app on your device.

![click on the download button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-video-in-text-intro-1.jpg)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

From the Downloads section of your Mac or Windows-based device in the browser, double-click on the installer. It will ask you to confirm the terms and conditions and press the Install button on the next pop-up prompt. Then will start the overall downloading process of the software into your device, and it will take some seconds, after which Filmora will automatically open to the homepage.

Click on the "Create New Project" button on the homepage, and that will launch the software to the editor window.

![launch to the editor window](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-video-in-text-intro-2.jpg)

## 2\. Add Sample Color

On the main editor window of Filmora, you have to go to the My Media section. From the drop-down list, click on the folder full of Sample Colors. Next, click on the black sample color option and drag it down to the editing timeline. Finally, drop it in the place of the Track 1 section on the timeline.

![drop it in track 1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-video-in-text-intro-3.jpg)

## 3\. Put the Title tile into the video

After you add the sample color to the timeline, you have to click on the Titles tab from the top main toolbar of Filmora. Out of the options you find here, choose the Default Title. Then, hold it and drag the title template onto the Track 2 section of the editing timeline, and drop it in place.

Then, double-click on it to open the editing panel for the text. You will see a text field where you can update the title wording instead of "Your Title Here". Then, you have to change the size of this title text to 280\. Make sure to adjust the font style to whichever option you prefer, but typically a blocky style works. Click on the Bold icon to change the structure of the title text.

Scroll downward among the text editing parameters until you see the Text Spacing option. Whatever the default value here is placed as, you have to turn it to 10\. After that, click on the OK button.

![change the title](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-video-in-text-intro-4.jpg)

## 4\. Take a Snapshot

After adjusting the size and dimension of the title you added, click on the Snapshot icon to take a screenshot of the Track 2 title clip that has been changed. Then, select both of the clips on Tracks 1 and 2 and remove them from the timeline.

## 5\. Insert the background video

Next, go to the My Media tab again and choose the Project Media option. Right-click on the library section and tap on the Import button. This will open you to the device storage of your computer. From there, please search for the video clip you want to insert into your project as the main video background and import it into Filmora.

![search for the video clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-video-in-text-intro-5.jpg)

Then, when that is available in your media library section, hold it and drag and drop the clip onto the timeline in the Track 1 section.

## 6\. Add the Black and White Effect

Move the playhead forward to the 15-second mark on the added clip in the timeline. Then, tap on the scissor icon to split this clip. Please tap on the excess amount of the video clip and delete it.

Following that, click on the Effects tab on the top toolbar of Filmora. Out of the list of various effects that you will find, tap on the Black and White category and choose the Willow effect. If you cannot find the Willow effect easily, you can directly search for it in the text search field above and select from there.

Then, drag the willow effect to the video clip in the timeline below, keeping a watch on the preview window. The effect will turn the video into its format of Black and White.

![drag the willow effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-video-in-text-intro-6.jpg)

## 7\. Add the Screenshot to the Edit

Again, scroll up to the My Media section and tap on the screenshot you created earlier. Then, drag it down onto Track 2 of the editing timeline. Then, use the playback to mark the beginning of the video two frames off of the beginning of the video. Then, move the clip to that position so that it starts from that point onward.

Next, move the playback to the 14-second mark and adjust the Track 3 clip to fit that section perfectly.

![move the playback to 14 second mark](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-video-in-text-intro-7.jpg)

## 8\. Use the Chroma Key Effect

Now, double-tap on the Snapshot clip and choose the Video tab. Activate the Chroma Key option and go to the color picker section. Choose the black color from the clip shown on the preview window.

![choose the black color from preview](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-video-in-text-intro-8.jpg)

You must now click on the Crop option from the function bar. On the top, you will get the option for Pan and Zoom. Click on it and shorten the visible bright window by dragging it towards the center. Move this cropped rectangle to an all-white position. This will determine the end point of the text to be shown at the starting position of the video.

Move the playhead ahead in the timestamp and again click on the Chroma Key button from the function bar. When it opens, click on the Chroma key option in the editor and change the edge thickness value to a -7 number.

## 9\. Export the Clip

Once done, you need to export this clip. To do so, tap on the Export button at the top of the screen. On the Export page, change the name of the video to the intro title text and go to Settings to see its resolution condition. For the best effect, you should choose the higher bit rate of the file while exporting. After you are done, tap on the Export button.

![click on the export button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-video-in-text-intro-9.jpg)

Once the video gets exported, delete the screenshot clip you took from the timeline.

## 10\. Add the Effect on the Video Clip

Double-click on the background video clip on the timeline to open the text editor window. Tap on the Effects tab in this section and remove the Willow effect from your video.

You must extend the video duration to 20 seconds in the lowermost editing window. After that, import the exported video clip from where you stored it after downloading.

![extend the video to 20 seconds](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-video-in-text-intro-10.jpg)

## 11\. Drop the Exported Video Version Next

Following this, you must import the video you exported into the timeline. For this, you have to click on the My Media section and go to Project Media. Then, right-click on the library section here and tap on Import. Choose the file and import it from the location where you saved it.

Then, drag and drop the file back into the timeline. Here, the next step for you is to adjust the playhead position for the new video clip. Move the play head to the 14th second and the 14th frame position to synchronize it with the Track 3 video clip.

Then, double-click on the video, and under the video tab, choose the Chroma Key option. Then, tap on the color picker and choose to add white color from the preview window. After this, select the Edge Thickness parameter on the editor window and increase it to a value of 1.5.

![select the edge thickness parameter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-video-in-text-intro-11.jpg)

## 12\. Render Preview and Export Final Intro

Once you are done, click on the Render Preview icon to watch how your edited video stands out. If you are unsatisfied with the outcomes, you can easily roll it back and make the changes. Export the file after you see the preview and are fully satisfied with the effect.

## How To Mirror a Video Clip in Premiere Pro

Video editing is a crucial part of filmmaking, and it can make or break the outcome of a project. Adobe Premiere Pro is a widely used video editing software that provides a vast range of tools for professional video editing. One of the features that Premiere Pro offers is the ability to mirror video clips, which can add an interesting visual element to your footage.

In this article, we will look at how to mirror a video clip in Premiere Pro in a few simple steps. Whether you're a seasoned video editor or just starting, this guide will help you achieve the desired effect in your videos. From basic mirroring to advanced techniques, we will cover everything you need to know to create a symmetrical and visually appealing look in your projects.

![mirror videos in adobe premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-premiere-pro-mirror-video.JPG)

## What Is To "Mirror" a Video?

Mirroring a video in Adobe Premiere Pro refers to reflecting the footage along either the horizontal or vertical axis. This results in the composition being flipped and reversed, creating a reflection-like effect. Flipping a video is distinct from rotating it, as the orientation of the elements is changed, but their position remains the same.

Flipping can serve both creative and practical purposes. On the one hand, it can add a unique and visually interesting element to a project, creating a form of self-reflection or self-analysis. On the other hand, flipping can also be used to correct videos accidentally captured upside down. For example, flipping a video recorded with a selfie camera along the horizontal axis will correctly display the right side up.

It is important to note the distinction between flipping and rotating a video. A flipped video will look like a mirror image, whereas a video rotated 180 degrees will not. By understanding the differences between these techniques, you can effectively use mirroring to achieve the desired result in your projects.

## Ultimate Guide on How to Film Better in Public

Filming in public and different locations can add a new dimension to any video. The possibilities are limitless, from the hustle and bustle of a busy city street to the tranquil beauty of a remote beach.

Suppose you're a new vlogger and want to capture the perfect scene in public. Then this blog is for you. It will explain various tips and tricks to help you create the best videos, regardless of location. So let's start and learn more about how to film better in public!

## Part 1\. What Gear Will You Need to Record a Better Video in Public?

While recording in public, you want to avoid setting and holding unnecessary camera gear. That's why you should keep your gear as low-key as possible. The essential shooting gears that you are going to need are as follows:

### A Good Camera

A good camera is essential to record a video in public because it will provide quality footage. It will also allow you to capture more detail and create more engaging videos. But if you use a phone instead, make sure it is the latest iPhone or other with high pixels camera.

![a dslr camera](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/create-better-film-footage-1.jpg)

### A Tripod

A tripod is essential when recording video in public to ensure that your shots are stable and steady. Without a tripod, your camera can shake and create a distorted, blurry image that can ruin a shot. So having a secure tripod will help you capture professional-looking footage.

![a tripod](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/create-better-film-footage-2.jpg)

### A Microphone

A microphone is essential for recording a video in public because it captures the sound in the environment, allowing the video to be recorded with better-quality audio. Without a microphone, the video would be recorded with distorted sound and would likely be challenging to understand.

![a vlogging microphone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/create-better-film-footage-3.jpg)

Apart from the gear mentioned above, you can also bring an ND filter, extra batteries, and SD cards. Because If the battery runs out or the SD card becomes full, the video recording could be lost. The spare batteries and SD cards help to ensure that the video can be captured uninterrupted. Let's see what we need further.

## Part 2\. What Do You Need to Accomplish With Your Video?

While recording a video in a busy location, you need to accomplish three things with your video to record it better. Which are as follows:

### 1\. Clean Shots

When recording in a busy location, it is essential to try and capture clean shots. It can be done by using a wide-angle lens to get the full shot or zooming in to focus on a particular element.

### 2\. Clean Audio

Getting a clean and clear sound when recording audio in a busy location is essential. A good quality microphone, an audio recorder, or external noise reduction can help minimize background noise and capture the desired audio.

### 3\. Decent Lighting

In a busy location, decent lighting is as important as the other two factors. Look for natural light sources that can provide good light, even illumination. If these are unavailable, consider using portable lighting equipment or lamps to create a more flattering environment.

Now that we know what we need let's see how to make a video.

## Part 3\. How to Get the Best Shot While Filming Outdoor?

Whether you are a vlogger, a YouTuber, or a student filmmaker, shooting a video in a busy area is always a challenge. You must be able to plan and execute your production in a way that minimizes disruption and produces quality footage. By following these instructions, we hope you can make a difference in a shot you record:

##### Step1 Scout the Location

Before recording, visit the location in advance to plan your shots. Take note of potential distractions or noise sources and plan your angles accordingly.

![scouting the location](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/create-better-film-footage-4.png)

##### Step2 Choose the correct shooting time

The best time to record a video in a busy location is when the area is less crowded, such as early in the morning or late at night. Avoiding peak times and holidays is also a good idea.

##### Step3 Choose the right angle

Once you get to the location, you must find the right angle.

**Select Background**

Try to find a background that will best capture the atmosphere of the area and minimize any background noise.

![select the background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/create-better-film-footage-5.png)

**Set the frame**

If your frame is too broad, you will face potential distractions that could interfere with your video, such as people walking in and out of the frame.

![setting the frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/create-better-film-footage-6.png)

**Set your position**

Instead of getting closer to your talent, get further away and zoom in this way, you leave space for other people in the location, and you can still get your shot!

![zoom in the talent](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/create-better-film-footage-7.png)

Try to get your shot and then get out quickly so you don't bother other people trying to get their photos.

## Part 4\. Best Way to Record Audio While Filming Outdoor

Audio is essential to any video production, and recording audio while filming outdoor scenes can be challenging.

Outdoor environments come with more variables to consider, such as wind, traffic noise, and other background noise, that can make capturing clear audio more difficult. Even if you use a high-quality mic, you still have chances of interruption.

If you get any such variable in the video you recorded, you can re-record the audio with the help of **[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).** Let's see how you can do it:
