What Are The Stages Of Film Production

## 1\. Pre-Production

The pre-production phase comes early in the process, it usually comes after the development and before the production itself. This stage includes finalizing the scripts, bringing together the actors and crew, browse for locations, deciding which equipment is needed, and deciding on the budget. Pre-production is a planning stage of the movie, where you confirm all the details of the project before starting on production.

Pre-production

## 2\. Production

Now the fun part begins. It is time to get the movie on camera. All the producers and directors finished making the plans from the use of all the production assets that are needed to make the movie. Once the cast and locations are set, the actual filming process can begin and this can take from days, weeks, to months depending on how many locations are used, how much scenes are being filmed and if there are any problems that occur that delays the filming process.

## 3\. Post-Production

![Post-Production](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/what-are-the-stages-of-film-production-04.jpg)

Post-Production

After the filming process, any re-taking, and other filming phases the entire crew has to go through, it is time for post-production. This stage is when the audio and visual materials are combined together to create the movie. An editor, or multiple editors are using the following procedures to create the film:

### A. Cutting and Trimming Shots

Tips

###### ▷ What's a Cut

In the film and video industry, a cut is described by when one clip ends and another one starts. For example, say you have a wide shot clip of a car driving as well as clip of a man’s eyes watching.

###### ▷ When Would the Cut Happen

The cut would happen when the first shot has ended and is followed by the second shot. Repeating that will have an impact on how the viewer sees the movie and follows the story.

### B. Adding Music and Sound Effect

Tips

###### ▷ Sound Effects

Depending on what kind of movie it is, sound effects can make a huge difference in the viewing experience. No matter if it’s an explosion, an extra wind sound, a door crackle, or laughing people in the background.

###### ▷ Deliver the Emotion

Many sound effects are placed into the film to deliver the emotion and get the viewer onto the edge of their seat as it amplifies the moment.

### C. Adding Visual Effects

Tips

###### ▷ The Benefit of Post-production

When there are visual effects showing in the movie, these are not made physically on set. The benefit of post-production is that there are unlimited choices of adding visual effects to strengthen a moment and the impact on the viewer.

###### ▷ Visual Effects

A lot of results are accomplished by visual effects because they would be impossible to re-create on set.

## 4\. Distribution

Distribution is the final stage of production, which happens after the film has been edited, and is ready for release. Many film makers and production companies will advertise the movie’s trailer on social media and the general internet to target the audience that loves the type of movie that has been made. They will either see it on social media or on television to drive people to theaters to watch the movie and get them into the story. A lot of movies have follow-ups when it’s been received really well creating a storyline.
