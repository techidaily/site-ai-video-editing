While there are numerous subtitle formats, two of the most commonly used formats are SRT and Web VTT. SRT is also known as SubRip. The format got its name from a DVD ripping software that extracted subtitles from DVDs.

Web VTT stands for Web Video Text Track. Web VTT is a W3C standard that allows you to display the text in sync with the HTML 5 <track> element.

Both of them are quite similar; however, slight differences might make you choose one over the other.

## Is Web VTT the Same as SRT?

While SRT is a popular text file used for captions, Web VTT is not far behind. Web VTT is similar to SRT but includes more styling options and editing. Web VTT works exceptionally well with media players but might not work efficiently on social media platforms.

Besides that, it also contains metadata making it more robust than SRT. But this is not all that is different between SRT and Web VTT. Let's dive into the details of how both are different even though they are sometimes used interchangeably:

### What Does It Look Like

Mostly, SRT and Web VTT files are similar, so one can easily be converted to another or edited. A Web VTT file starts with Web VTT at the top and the file's title next to it. An SRT file does not have any of that. Then the caption sequences are separated with blank lines in Web VTT files. The SRT file is messy, with captions not separated by lines but all clustered together.

| **Advanced Styling Fonts**                     | Simple                               | More robust styling including bold, italics, etc |
| **Support Changing the position of subtitles** | No                                   | Yes                                              |

### Timecode Format

The timecode format for an SRT file begins with hours:minutes: seconds. milliseconds. On the other hand, the timecode format for a Web VTT file is minutes: seconds. milliseconds. This difference in timecode is extremely important to keep in mind while manually editing SRT or Web VTT files.

### Metadata

A web VTT file includes metadata, unlike an SRT file. This means that a web VTT file includes extra information like author, title, and additional comments.

### Basic Text Formats (Bold, Italic, Underline)

Web VTT is equipped with basic styling formats like bold italic and underline, which makes it more robust than SRT. Its styling formats are supported by all browsers. On the other hand, SRT files do not support any styling.

### Advanced Styling Fonts

Web VTT supports a more robust format that includes whistles and bells, distinguishing it from the simpler SRT format. This adds a very nice touch, especially if the text file is for a tv episode.

### Support Changing The Position Of Subtitles

Along with all its other fantastic features, Web VTT files also allow you to change the position of the subtitles easily. SRT files do not give you the liberty to do that.

### Summary

So, in short, Web VTT is more user friendly offering a lot more than what a simple SRT file may offer. Apart from differences in styling, time, and text formats, Web VTT files are incredibly easier to read and edit. You can also add comments which will remain hidden from the display.

## How to Color-Correct an S-Log Footage

S-Log is a gamma curve optimized for digital cameras to maximize the image sensor's performance. Although these videos may look flat and washed out, they contain lots of color information. Even better, video creators can use color correction to edit the S-Log videos and make them look as natural as possible. That's what this article is all about.

## How to Color-Correct an S-Log Footage

This tutorial assumes that you already have an S-Log footage. If not, you can record S-Log footage using most Canon, Sony, and Panasonic cameras.

![how to color-correct an s-log footage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/record-s-log-footage.gif)

Let's get to the steps!

##### Step1 Adjust the color settings

Start by adding your video to the timeline on [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and then double-click the video track. Then, click on the **Color** tab before tapping **Advanced**.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

![adjust the color settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/color-correction-basics-1.jpg)

##### Step2 Read and study the histogram

Now you'll see the Advanced Color Correction pop-up window. Here, you'll see a histogram with the brightest point on the right and the darkest point on the left. From our example, you can see that the video has more dark pixels than bright ones. Horizontally, the histogram shows you how many pixels are in a certain range of brightness.

![read and study the histogram](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/color-correction-basics-2.jpg)

##### Step3 Adjust the image colors

Once you've understood the histogram, look for pure black and white parts on the video clip. For example, in this video, you can see that the roofs are pure black and the boat at the bottom-right corner is pure white.

![adjust the image colors](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/pure-blacks-and-whites.gif)

After finding the white and black parts in the video, go to the **Light** section, then adjust the **Highlights** to see if you can get a pure white on the boat. If the boat or any other image of your choice doesn't look pure white, increase the **Whites** slide to make it whiter.

![go to the light section](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/color-correction-basics-3.jpg)

Now adjust the **Shadows** settings to reduce the effect and make the roofs look closer to pure black. If you want the roofs to look darker, drag the **Blacks** slider to the left.

**Pro tip**: Ensure that the darkest and brightest points don't cross the broken lines on the edge, or the video will start losing details.

##### Step4 Adjust the color saturation

Does your video still look a little flat? Probably yes! In that case, click the **Color** section and adjust the **Saturation** slider to the right to make the video less flat. Saturation simply means how colorful a video clip is to the viewer. Apart from the color saturation, you can also adjust the **Vibrance** to make your video objects look more colorful.

![adjust the color saturation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/color-correction-basics-4.jpg)

##### Step5 Preview and compare the video

Now it's time to check and compare the results. To make it easier, click the **Eye** icon at the top-right corner to switch between the original S-Log video and the color-corrected clip. You can also tap the **AB** icon and choose **Split View-Left/Right** to view the clips in the side-by-side mode.

![preview and compare the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/color-correction-basics-5.jpg)
