## [Step by Step] to Rotate Video in Google Photos

Google photos let you store, view, edit and share your videos and photos and are automatically organized. It is a very great cloud storage service and most people use it. Google Photos has introduced an artificial intelligence technology into the app. That’s why it can automatically organize and rotate.

You have videos on google photos that are automatically rotated, others are not.

How do you rotate them manually?

It’s is so simple and will not take much of your time.

Let’s dive in…

## **Rotating videos in google photos**

Rotating a video in google photos is pretty simple and will not take much of your time. You can easily fix the rotation and aspect ratio of your videos. But it’s a little tricky.

I'm going to show you how to flip your videos from portrait mode to landscape mode or from landscape mode to portrait mode.

You need to open up your google photos app and choose the video you want to flip, then you're going to pick the button in the bottom middle with the levers on it and in the bottom right hand corner.

![rotate-video-google-photos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/rotate-video-google-photos-1.png)

You will see a diamond with a circular arrow on it. You're going to hit that until you find the way you want it to be.

3. Click on F10 to stop the recording. The program will save the file on your PC.

##### Step2Choose Background Music that Fits Your CSGO Montage

The capability of music conveying emotions, authentic interactions, and a sense of realism is crucial to the viewers' watching experience. It holds the attention of viewers and makes them want to continue watching your gaming montage.

Make sure the music you choose fits the theme of your CSGO montage video. The right music will provide a constant through-line that ties numerous CSGO gameplay clips together. What's more? It can lend your montage a level of professionalism while giving it a polish.

Only use royalty-free music in your montage video, as this means you won't pay any ongoing royalties when you use the music track. There are loads of royalty-free music libraries online, where you can find non-copyrighted montage music. These include StoryBlocks, FreeSound, and SoundCloud.

Once you've found the music you like, download it and use it in your CSGO montage video.

##### Step3Download Video Editing Software

You'll need video editing software to put your series of CSGO gameplay clips together and make a montage video. While you'll find numerous desktop-based video editing programs available, choose the best one.

A reliable video editing software should be user-friendly. The last thing you want is to get a video editing program that will make you spend months trying to learn how to edit your first montage video.

Pick a program with video editing templates; this will allow you to create CSGO montage videos swiftly because you only have to substitute the existing placeholder media with the content you are making. It should also have special effects and music.

If you're tired of the plain and common video editing effects, check out Filmora. This video editing software has tons of cool effects that you can add to your CSGO montage videos.
