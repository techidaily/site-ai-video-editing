## Part 1\. What is Fade to Black

You will become a better filmmaker if you expand your vocabulary in video editing by learning about transitions. The dissolve-to-black, or fade-to-black (a fade to black in premiere pro), works well in part because it has a certain theatrical feel to it. A fade-out/fade-down, often known as a fade-to-black in theater, occurs in total darkness. One of the key components of video editing is using transitions in Adobe Premiere Pro.

The fundamental elements of many other transitions are fades. Effective use of Fades is a crucial skill in your video editing repertoire since it is subtle to the point of practically being undetectable. A video transition called a "fade to black" causes a scene or clip to gradually conclude with a black backdrop. It dates back to the time when the stage curtains were drawn and the lights were dimmed during a theatrical performance. The stage therefore went completely black while the team behind hurriedly changed into new clothing and stage items for the following action.  

Those that seem to take place close together chronologically are edited together, while scenes that occur at separate periods or locales are faded out. These are recognizable features of the film. They alert us to the fact that the tale is moving to a later time or place, either thematically, chronologically, or geographically. In a practical sense, this is the time when the cast and crew switch out the set and clothes. But the fade-to-black marks the end of the scene in a symbolic and narrative sense.

## Part 2\. How to Fade to Black in Premiere Pro

### How do you keyframe colors in Premiere?

You can find other color problems in Premiere Pro that you need to fix. Therefore, it makes sense to adjust your highlight, mid, and black points first and have them dialed in before addressing saturation and color temperature. Open the Color panel on the right side of the screen while your adjustment layer is highlighted in the sequence. Make your color adjustments while keeping in mind that the effect will be applied to every clip below it in the timeline.

We only stop feeling immersed when we notice abrupt cuts. It makes sense to know when to color correct your footage throughout the video editing process. If you color correct your film too early, you can be wasting your time by color grading footage that you might eventually cut out or never use. We hope that this article will assist you in streamlining your editing process if you're just starting started using Premiere Pro's adjustments layers.
