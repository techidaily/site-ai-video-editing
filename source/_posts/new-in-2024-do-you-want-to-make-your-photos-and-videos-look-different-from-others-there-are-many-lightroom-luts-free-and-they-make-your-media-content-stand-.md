1. **Edit and perform desired modifications (Optional)**

If you are just looking to resize the FLV video file, then you can skip this step and move to step no. 4\.

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-3.jpg)

1. **Resize the video by changing the aspect ratio**

Aspect ratio defines the shape of your video like if you want the video to be horizontal, vertical, square, or custom. Generally, the term ‘**resizing video**’ refers to changing the aspect ratio of the video. For that, go to the **_File_** and then to the **_Project Settings_**_._ Then on the Aspect Ratio box, select the one that you prefer or you can try custom scaling. You can choose your preferred resolution of the project too while you’re at it.

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-4.jpg)

1. **Resize the video by cropping**

When you change the aspect ratio of the project, some parts of your flv video might not fit or it might be shrunk small to fit. So you need to resize the flv video by cropping so that you can crop and focus on the part of the video you like. To crop the video, select the flv video clip in the timeline and click on the crop icon in the timeline toolbar. Now choose the ratio you want to crop and select the part you’d like to keep. Then click OK and your flv video will be resized.

1. **Resize the video by changing the aspect ratio**

1. **Edit and perform desired modifications (Optional)**

If you are just looking to resize the FLV video file, then you can skip this step and move to step no. 4\. Otherwise, you can do various editings on the video like cropping, muting, trimming, animating, etc. before resizing the video. Filmora provides a wide range of features for editing and adding effects to the video.

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-3.jpg)

1. **Resize the video by changing the aspect ratio**

Aspect ratio defines the shape of your video like if you want the video to be horizontal, vertical, square, or custom. Generally, the term ‘**resizing video**’ refers to changing the aspect ratio of the video. For that, go to the **_File_** and then to the **_Project Settings_**_._ Then on the Aspect Ratio box, select the one that you prefer or you can try custom scaling. You can choose your preferred resolution of the project too while you’re at it.

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-4.jpg)

1. **Resize the video by cropping**

When you change the aspect ratio of the project, some parts of your flv video might not fit or it might be shrunk small to fit. So you need to resize the flv video by cropping so that you can crop and focus on the part of the video you like. To crop the video, select the flv video clip in the timeline and click on the crop icon in the timeline toolbar. Now choose the ratio you want to crop and select the part you’d like to keep. Then click OK and your flv video will be resized.

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-5.jpg)

1. **Adjust the file size of the video through export settings**

After you’ve cropped and resized the Flv video, you need to export it by clicking the **_Export_** button on the top center part. There are different settings available for exporting the video. Click on the **_Settings_** button near the resolution and you’ll be shown some detailed preferences for exporting. Every setting here like frame rate, resolution, bitrate, etc. can affect the size of the output video.

## Part 1\. How to put a background on a green screen to video?

The first thing you need to do is shoot your video with high-quality green screen in the background. Make sure that it is evenly spread and lit up so that there are no light and dark patches. Now that you have green screen video, you will need a professional video editor to replace the green screen with any background as per your requirements. Here are the three ways on how to add background to green screen.

### Way 1\. Use Filmora

[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is the easiest video editor to add a background to green screen video instantly. Filmora is a professional video editor with an intuitive user interface. There are loads of tools to add visual effects and perform basic to advanced editing. Filmora is available for Windows and Mac users and you have to transfer your recorded green screen video to your computer. You can replace green screen with a video as well as photo as per your preference. Here are the steps to put a background on green screen video using Filmora.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

Step1 Download and install [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Launch the application and click on New Project. You should have the green screen video as well as the background replacement video or photo ready with which you want to replace green screen background.

iMovie is one of the most preferred video editors among Mac and iPhone users.

Step3 Drag and drop them into Timeline and place the green screen video above the replacement background video/photo. Make sure that the duration of both videos is the same.

## Part 1\. How to put a background on a green screen to video?

The first thing you need to do is shoot your video with high-quality green screen in the background. Make sure that it is evenly spread and lit up so that there are no light and dark patches. Now that you have green screen video, you will need a professional video editor to replace the green screen with any background as per your requirements. Here are the three ways on how to add background to green screen.

### Way 1\. Use Filmora

[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is the easiest video editor to add a background to green screen video instantly. Filmora is a professional video editor with an intuitive user interface. There are loads of tools to add visual effects and perform basic to advanced editing. Filmora is available for Windows and Mac users and you have to transfer your recorded green screen video to your computer. You can replace green screen with a video as well as photo as per your preference. Here are the steps to put a background on green screen video using Filmora.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

Step1 Download and install [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Launch the application and click on New Project. You should have the green screen video as well as the background replacement video or photo ready with which you want to replace green screen background.

Step2 Import your green screen video as well as the background video or photo under Project Media folder. Drag and drop both of them to Timeline. Make sure the green screen video is on top of the replacement background video or photo.

![import green screen video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/filmora-chroma-key-remove-selected-color.jpg)

Step3 Double-click on the video clip that you have dropped on Timeline. Go to Video tab and turn on Chroma Key option.

### Way 2\. Use iMovie

iMovie is one of the most preferred video editors among Mac and iPhone users. This is because the app comes from Apple, and there are ample features to enhance your video content and quality with effects. Adding a background to a green screen video using iMovie is quite easy. But replacing a background of a video without green screen is rather tough.

Step1 Launch iMovie from Applications folder on your Mac as it comes pre-installed.

Step2 Import your green screen video as well as replacement background video or photo to Project Media folder.

Step3 Drag and drop them into Timeline and place the green screen video above the replacement background video/photo. Make sure that the duration of both videos is the same.
