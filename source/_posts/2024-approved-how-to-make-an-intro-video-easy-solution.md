## Part 2 **How Does the AI Video Maker Work**

Professional AI video editors, are trained by showing them various examples and then providing them feedback by telling them what is wrong and good. The machine then takes note of it and remembers it. However, as the machine continues to learn, it picks the results and then improves itself based on the feedback.
