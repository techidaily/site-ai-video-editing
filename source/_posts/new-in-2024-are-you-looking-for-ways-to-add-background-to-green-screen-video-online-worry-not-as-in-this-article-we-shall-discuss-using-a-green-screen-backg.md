![perform color correction](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/import-and-adjust-video-clips-in-filmora-11.jpg)

##### Step 4Add Multiple Adjustment Layers

Additionally, you can apply different effects at different durations and drag the adjustment layer to the end of the layer. Further, split the adjustment layer using the "Playhead" slider at the desired duration to add a new effect. To make your slideshow better, you can also add transition effects by dragging and dropping them between two clips.

![add more layers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/import-and-adjust-video-clips-in-filmora-12.jpg)

##### Step 5Save as a Preset

You can also save your adjustment layer as a preset. Select your adjustment layer, locate the "Save as Custom" option in the right panel, and click on it. This will save the adjustment layer as a preset. Your preset will be in the "Adjustment Layer" section of the "Media" tab.
