FEATURES

After reviewing both versions (Android and iOS) of CapCut, we found that the app is indeed easy to use and includes a ton of attractive features designed for TikTok users. Would we recommend it to you? Yes, definitely, but with some caveats.

* Split function: This is similar to trimming where you have to separate the clip in order to define your desired part of the clip. Your clip can be further extended after splitting, so it’s just a process of simple trimming in editing.

* Speed control: This feature aids speed ramping. You can slow down your video and increase the speed just as you want. One thing to have in mind is when you plan to edit such a video, you have to shoot in a high resolution and high frame rate like 30-60fps so as to avoid the amateurish look.
* Reverse video: The reverse feature helps you to rewind your clip to create the effect you have pictured in your mind while shooting.

There are color-based and season-based filters, as well as a range of beautification tools to enhance video quality. Filters can also be used effectively if you have multiple clips that have color variations or different contrast and brightness levels. Since you can't edit most of these in CapCut, you can avoid having to use a desktop editor by choosing the right filters and applying them to all your clips to bring some uniformity.
* Effects: There’s a collection of effects you can select from to appeal to the visual cravings of your audience. This will add colour to your content as it makes your viewers involved in the video. These effects include split-screen, retro, comic, party, dreamy, and so on. These effects will make your video look fresh and professionally edited.
* Stickers and text: Stickers could be fun to use due to their expressive nature. Your choice as a content creator will go a long way in determining the fascination of your content. CapCut has therefore had you covered when it comes to adding fun features to your content to make it more interactive and exciting.

FEATURES

After reviewing both versions (Android and iOS) of CapCut, we found that the app is indeed easy to use and includes a ton of attractive features designed for TikTok users. Would we recommend it to you? Yes, definitely, but with some caveats.

* Split function: This is similar to trimming where you have to separate the clip in order to define your desired part of the clip. Your clip can be further extended after splitting, so it’s just a process of simple trimming in editing.
* Video overlay: This feature helps you place a video on another video. Those who do this often are those who have reaction channels, online teachers and gamers. This feature helps the viewers to simultaneously comprehend explanations the main video content alongside the reaction or explanation.
* Speed control: This feature aids speed ramping. You can slow down your video and increase the speed just as you want. One thing to have in mind is when you plan to edit such a video, you have to shoot in a high resolution and high frame rate like 30-60fps so as to avoid the amateurish look.
* Reverse video: The reverse feature helps you to rewind your clip to create the effect you have pictured in your mind while shooting.
* Music library: CapCut comes with an impressive collection of royalty-free music and sound effects that can really make a huge difference to your videos. The tracks have a high quality and you can effortlessly insert them into your video to create the feel you desire.

There are color-based and season-based filters, as well as a range of beautification tools to enhance video quality. Filters can also be used effectively if you have multiple clips that have color variations or different contrast and brightness levels. Since you can't edit most of these in CapCut, you can avoid having to use a desktop editor by choosing the right filters and applying them to all your clips to bring some uniformity.
* Effects: There’s a collection of effects you can select from to appeal to the visual cravings of your audience. This will add colour to your content as it makes your viewers involved in the video. These effects include split-screen, retro, comic, party, dreamy, and so on. These effects will make your video look fresh and professionally edited.
* Stickers and text: Stickers could be fun to use due to their expressive nature. Your choice as a content creator will go a long way in determining the fascination of your content. CapCut has therefore had you covered when it comes to adding fun features to your content to make it more interactive and exciting.

Text-to-speech (TTS) is a type of assistive technology that reads digital text aloud. It’s sometimes called “read aloud” technology. This technology has evolved to the point of being inculcated or introduced directly to some video editing applications without having to visit a separate text-to-speech application or software for support. This article therefore aims at discussing ten video makers that have inbuilt the text-to-speech feature.

LUMEN5

![text-to-speech-video-maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/text-to-speech-video-maker-1.jpg)

Lumen5 is a video creation platform that is driven by artificial intelligence machine learning. Using this platform, you can easily turn any blog post into a video. To create a video, you simply enter your link to your blog post or article. Using natural language processing, Lumen5 will automatically create a storyboard for you. Machine learning is used to match each scene with media files that are relevant to your content. The length of each scene is basically dependent on the amount of text to display, and the text position is intelligently placed according to the scene composition to make sure everything is in order. Furthermore, important keywords are highlighted to draw audiences’ attention to key facts in the content. Lumen5 has helped over 200,000 businesses create over a million videos.

FEATURES

After reviewing both versions (Android and iOS) of CapCut, we found that the app is indeed easy to use and includes a ton of attractive features designed for TikTok users. Would we recommend it to you? Yes, definitely, but with some caveats.

* Split function: This is similar to trimming where you have to separate the clip in order to define your desired part of the clip. Your clip can be further extended after splitting, so it’s just a process of simple trimming in editing.
* Video overlay: This feature helps you place a video on another video. Those who do this often are those who have reaction channels, online teachers and gamers. This feature helps the viewers to simultaneously comprehend explanations the main video content alongside the reaction or explanation.
* Speed control: This feature aids speed ramping. You can slow down your video and increase the speed just as you want. One thing to have in mind is when you plan to edit such a video, you have to shoot in a high resolution and high frame rate like 30-60fps so as to avoid the amateurish look.
* Reverse video: The reverse feature helps you to rewind your clip to create the effect you have pictured in your mind while shooting.
* Music library: CapCut comes with an impressive collection of royalty-free music and sound effects that can really make a huge difference to your videos. The tracks have a high quality and you can effortlessly insert them into your video to create the feel you desire.
* Filters: Choose from various filters to soften or sharpen your videos and make them more professional-looking. There are color-based and season-based filters, as well as a range of beautification tools to enhance video quality. Filters can also be used effectively if you have multiple clips that have color variations or different contrast and brightness levels. Since you can't edit most of these in CapCut, you can avoid having to use a desktop editor by choosing the right filters and applying them to all your clips to bring some uniformity.
* Effects: There’s a collection of effects you can select from to appeal to the visual cravings of your audience. This will add colour to your content as it makes your viewers involved in the video. These effects include split-screen, retro, comic, party, dreamy, and so on. These effects will make your video look fresh and professionally edited.
* Stickers and text: Stickers could be fun to use due to their expressive nature. Your choice as a content creator will go a long way in determining the fascination of your content. CapCut has therefore had you covered when it comes to adding fun features to your content to make it more interactive and exciting. Stickers and texts are therefore engaging tools you can employ to drive the fantasy of your audience.

## How to Shoot Cinematic Footage with Phone

Creating cinematic videos is easy if you have expensive equipment like a film set with high-quality cameras. But many of us can’t afford this, so read this article to get an alternative.

You can use smartphones to record cinematic shots if you don't have expensive lenses. You’ll learn about filming and editing those shots into Wondershare Filmora to get professional results in the below lines.

But before we get into the filming process, having a general idea about the topic can help a lot. So first, let’s understand what cinematic videos are!

## Part 1\. What Is a Cinematic Video?

The world of cinema has developed and has high recording quality. A cinematic video is a video that is recorded to look more like a movie. These shots excel in all aspects of a video, such as Color, aspect ratio, and lighting techniques.

Most of the cinematic footage required unique cameras, i.e., **IMAX** cameras for movies. But these cameras are really costly and only suitable for large-scale production.

With the understanding of cinematic videos, you can now use alternative ways to record a cinematic video without an expensive camera. You can also record a cinematic video using only a smartphone with a few requirements.

Scroll below to learn more about what you need to record a cinematic video!

## Part 2\. Requirements to Record a Cinematic Video

To record a professional video with cinematic effects, you must have the following equipment in your studio:

### 1\. A Gimbal Stabilizer

When you are recording footage from your smartphone, a significant issue that can disturb your video quality is the shaking of your phone. You may have to record while walking, or it could even be a static shot.

If the phone is held in your hands without support, you will end up with shaky footage. This will eventually ruin your video.

A gimbal stabilizer allows you to stabilize your footage with a handheld stand. Many gimbal stabilizers are available in the market, but for reference, we would be looking at the **Q3** Gimbal from **Zhiyun**.

![zhiyun q3 gimbal stabilizer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-1.png)

You can also connect the Gimbal from its app. Scroll below to learn more about the app!

**Zhiyun Cami App**

**Zhiyun Q3** stabilizer also connects with the Zhiyun cami app. This app will allow users to access the filming features more intuitively and comprehensively. You can connect your Gimbal with the app via Bluetooth.

![zhiyun cami app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-2.png)

**Zhiyun Stabilizer Shooting Modes**

There are many modes on different Gimbals, but the Locking and the POV mode are the most useful, which are illustrated as shown below:

* **The Locking mode:** This mode allows you to lock all three motors of the Gimbal and allows your phone to remain fixed at a certain angle. Due to this, you can shoot your footage from multiple positions while keeping the camera fixed at one angle.
* **The POV mode** will allow you to unlock all the axes. This mode will also adjust in all three axes when moving around. This feature gives you more freedom of movement.

![the different modes of zhiyun q3 stabilizer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-3.png)

**Extra Features of Zhiyun Q3 Stabilizer**

When you are shooting a video using the Gimbal stabilizer, you come across a point where you want extra light. Thus, the Q3 stabilizer comes with a built-in **flashlight.**

This flashlight will not only light up those small corners of a dark room but also make a huge difference. If you are recording to focus on an object, such as a product, this flashlight will greatly help you.

![zhiyun q3 gimbal flashlight](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-4.png)

You can also turn the flashlight towards yourself if you are recording a Vlog or taking a selfie. The light’s temperature is 4300K, giving a relatively warm light on the subject.

![spectrum of light indicating 4300k](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-5.png)

### 2\. A Good Smartphone

Most smartphones these days are equipped with cameras with varying powers of recording. Some smartphone cameras focus on **Mega Pixels,** while others focus on the capture sensor. You need a smartphone camera that balances out all these qualities to record cinematic footage.

The recently released iPhone 14 pro camera is an excellent example of a good quality camera you can use to record cinematic videos.

![smartphone attached to gimbal](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-6.png)

### 3\. Video Editing Software

There is no better software in the video editing field than the infamous Wondershare Filmora. It allows you to edit high-quality videos with creative features.

Wondershare Filmora allows access to the range of effects and filters you can apply to your videos to give them a more cinematic look. It also allows you to access the vast library of audio to utilize in your videos. Moreover, its engaging UI allows beginners to access to features of Wondershare Filmora easily.

![wondershare filmora website](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-7.png)

Now that we have learned about the requirements for recording a cinematic video. Let’s look at the different cinematic movements you can use to record from your Smartphone.

## Part 3\. Top 3 Cinematic Movements to Record From a Smartphone

You may have watched many movies or TV shows, but the general audience usually ignores the effort put into a shot. Only an experienced videographer can detect the difference between a great cinematic shot and a poor one.

Of the great cinematic shots, some are described in this article. These shots can easily record by using a smartphone. The cinematic movements explained below are the best choice. Here we will look at the three camera movements you can record on your smartphone.

* The Reveal Movement.
* The 180° Presentation Movement.
* The Following Movement.

First, let’s take a look at the Reveal movement.

### 1\. The Reveal Movement

This is the most popular movement used in cinematic shooting from your smartphone. With a Gimbal, the Reveal movement is one of the easiest shots to master. But for this, you will need to learn it first.

The Reveal Movement is a shot taken with an object as a perspective. The shot starts from a static object in the foreground. It could be focused at first, but as the camera moves, the focus will be diverted to reveal our target object. This is known as the Reveal Movement.

To shoot the reveal movement, follow the steps mentioned as shown:

* First, ensure your phone is connected properly to the **Gimbal**.
* **Align** your Smartphone camera behind the static object.
* Guide the target individual to be ready as you move the camera to reveal them.
* Slowly move the camera, focusing on the static object to change its focus on your main object.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Make sure to practice and experiment a lot with the steps. Try to be more creative and innovative. With every video you shoot, you gain experience with the errors.

Another thing to remember is that when you are shooting a Reveal movement using the Gimbal, it is best to put it in **Locking mode**. This mode works the best as it allows the camera to stay fixed in one frame making your footage seem balanced and of quality.

![gimbal fixed in locking mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-9.png)

### 2\. The 180° Presentation Movement

The next movement we will be looking at will be the 180° presentation movement. The 180° presentation will move in a half-circle fashion. It will move from one side of the subject to the other side. This will allow you to cover the overall subject’s view.

Apart from that, it will allow you to capture the background with much clarity and detail to maintain a general sense of the ambiance. Making a 180° presentation shot is fairly easy to do so. With its multiple uses, you can use this method in any scenario.

As we will move from one side to the other in a circular manner, we need to fix the frame of our video to move along. Using the **POV** **mode** of the Zhiyun Gimbal stabilizer will be the best option in this sense.

![gimbal fixed in pov mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-10.png)

Setting the Gimbal in POV mode will allow you to shoot the video from more than one angle while keeping the video balanced. Follow the steps mentioned to shoot a 180° presentation video:

* First, start recording from one side of the subject while keeping the Gimbal in the POV mode.
* Slowly start moving in front of the subject in an arch.
* When you face the subject, do not stop and keep moving to complete the arch.
* When you reach the end of the arch, close the video.

![the 180° presentation movement](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-11.gif)

By following the steps mentioned, you can create the 180° presentation movement using a smartphone. Now, move forward to learn about “The Following movement.”

### 3\. The Following Movement

You can use “The following movement” when recording a scene in which the object moves in random directions. Or when there is a high degree of movement of your object in the video, and you want to fix the focus of your footage to that object.

The Following movement is not technically a movement, but a setting that will allow you to record the footage while keeping the object and the video frame focused. In this type of footage, we will use the Zhiyun Cami app to focus on our target object.

![drawing a square to focus the subject](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-12.png)

To focus on our subject in the video by Cami app, follow the steps mentioned below:

* When recording the video, make sure to put the Gimbal on a tripod stand.
* After that, open the **Cami** app and draw a square over the object you want to keep in focus.
* Now, the camera will shift its angle to its perspective wherever the object goes.

![the following movement](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-13.gif)

This is how you will create the following movement.

Although it might seem strange initially, but the time is close when everyone will create cinematic videos from their smartphones.

Another thing to remember is that when you are shooting a Reveal movement using the Gimbal, it is best to put it in **Locking mode**. This mode works the best as it allows the camera to stay fixed in one frame making your footage seem balanced and of quality.
