If you want to perform speed ramping in videos, first access Adobe Premiere Pro. Many users find video editing difficult in Adobe. For their ease, this section will explain the **slow-mo Adobe Premiere** in simple steps:

##### Step 1

After getting into the Adobe Premiere Pro, enter to its editing screen. Import your video clip and move towards its timeline section. There, right-click on the FX icon and choose “Time Remapping” to go to “Speed.” Now, you can see the white speed ramping line.

##### Step 3

Click on the middle of the keyframe and pull it down slowly. To add a slow ramp instead of an abrupt change in speed, hit on the start and drag towards the right. Repeat the same to the other end of the keyframe. You can see a slow shift in speed. Later, you can adjust the speed and the ramp.

## Part 3: What Are Some Potential Disadvantages of Using Adobe Premiere Pro for Performing Such Operations?

Many people might initially find the above steps intense and difficult to understand. [**Slow motion**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) **in Premiere Pro** is useful in speed ramping, but you can face some issues using it. As everything has some bad side, this operation also does. You should read forward and know such disadvantages to avoid any inconvenience:

* **Playback Lagging**: Adobe causes lagging and major issues in playback. If you don’t use optical flow and render frames freeze, you cannot make any speed ramps.
* **System Compatibility Issues:** Speed ramping requires a system with a good GPU. Otherwise, problems might occur when it doesn’t interact well with the computer’s GPU.
* **Complex Processing:** This feature will interrupt your workflow if you are not a professional editor. As you will have to watch several tutorial videos to use just one feature.
* **Frame Rate Adjustment Problems:** Premiere Pro can show bugs if you use a high frame rate. It will start troubling when you use 120fps slow motion in clips.

Generally, it also requires strong computer specs and uses RAM of at least 8GB. The majority of editors look for an alternative due to its high learning curve and system requirements.
