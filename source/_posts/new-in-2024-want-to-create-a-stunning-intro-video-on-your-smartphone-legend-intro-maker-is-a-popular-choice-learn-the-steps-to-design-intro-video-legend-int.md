You can add a rectangle highlighter in the background. Experiment with font and text of the text. Apply a text effect from the different templates available. Customize the effect to get the desired result.

#### 2\. How do you add typing effects in Premiere?

Add your text to your video so that a text layer appears on the timeline. Animate the text Effects> Video Effects> Liner Wipe and double-click to get the typing effect. Tweak the parameters like transition completion, wipe angle, and others to smoothen out the animation. Draw a cursor icon using rectangle tool and animation it to move with the text using keyframes.

#### 3\. How do I open text effects controls in Premiere Pro?

Select the text layer from the timeline of the project. From the main menu, go to Windows> Effects Control option to open effect controls for text. Otherwise, you can directly go to Effects Control tab located below the menu bar after selecting your text layer.

## The Bottom Line

Adding text effects in Premiere Pro can be slightly overwhelming for an amateur video editor who does not have enough experience with Premiere Pro. We have stated the simple steps to apply Premiere Pro text effects to your video project. However, we recommend [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) as the best and the easiest alternative to Premiere Pro where you get more text effects and add them instantly and effortlessly.
