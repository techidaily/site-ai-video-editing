![loop video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-1.gif)

## Shots recording for loop masking

The first and most crucial step for creating a good loop video is to record perfect shots. Here are the steps to record video shots for loop videos.

### How to create a loop video

Step1 Set your camera or phone on a tripod. Make sure it stands still and does not move.

![set up a camera](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-2.png)

Step2 Set it so that you have a door on one side and enough room for the subject to walk through the door and move out of the frame.

![move out of the frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-3.png)

Step3 Make sure all your outfits are ready.

![outfits ready](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-4.png)

Step4 Start recording on your camera. Walk through the door wearing the first outfit. Change your outfits and repeat the step with all your dresses. It would help if you kept the camera rolling while recording all these clips. Turning the recording on and off with every shot will result in many small movements.
