## What Is HDRI? Everything You Need to Know About HDRI

Photography is like art itself. Photographers must carefully select the setting and use the right camera to capture images with lossless quality. However, you'll realize that some photos appear darker or brighter than in actual life.

In that case, use **free HDRI** software to change that straightway. But HDRI being a relatively new technique, beginners might struggle to edit the photos, let alone find the perfect HDRI software.

So, in this simple guidepost, we'll learn how to create an HDRI 3D picture using **HDRI for Blender**. But first, let's understand what an HDRI file is and the difference between HDRI and HDR.

## Part 1: What is HDRI?

HDRI (High Dynamic Range Image) is simply an image created using multiple image overlays of the same background but with varying exposures. The exposures can range from the brightest highlights to the darkest shadows. So, in short, HDRI expands an image's dynamic range to brighten or darken it and make it look more natural.

Having said that, HDRI is a raster image created using color pixels. HDRI photos are generally significant in size, so they won't quickly lose quality like other raster photos such as PNG and JPG. Many formats can store HDRI images, although the most common are OpenEXR (.exr) and Radiance RGBE (.hdr).

 Pros

* You can easily create one using HDRI for Blender, Photoshop, EasyHDRI, etc.
* HDRI photos are compatible with many image editing programs.
* Produces crisp images with excellent detail and lighting control.

 Cons

* 32-bit HDRI files have significant sizes.
* HDRI can quickly be poorly done without prior experience.

## Part 2: What's the difference between HDR and HDRI

According to Wikipedia, HDR and HDRI are the same things. But is it true? For starters, HDRI is basically a photo with High Dynamic Range qualities. So, yes, HDR and HDRI can mean the same thing in digital image editing.

However, some photo editors argue that there is a difference between these two regarding basic workflow. First, HDR technology increases brightness to show more image details. On the other hand, HDRI performs unique optimization of content and lighting to deliver crisp images. In other words, HDRI brightens the dark shadows without necessarily overexposing the bright image areas.

Some photographers can also consider HDR as images with pixel values higher than 1 or 255\. That means that the pixels can be much higher than pure white. But technically speaking, HDR and HDRI can be used interchangeably.

## Part 3: When to use HDRI

Now that you have all the information about HDRI, let's learn about some industries where HDRI is applicable.

### 1\. HDRI for 3D visualization and 3D animation

**HDRI 3D** is commonplace these days. 3D animation creators can use programs like **HDRI Blender** to add HDR environments and make the content look detailed and more realistic in high lighting reflections. To put it simply, HDRI makes 3D scenes look lighter, less cartoonish, and more professional. This technology can also be used in interior visualizations in animations.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\. HDRI for architect rendering

Creating HDRI environments is a common practice in 3D architectural designs. For example, designers can create panoramic house designs with varying light tones and interior moods. HDRI helps them give a natural 3D lighting effect on scenes and objects.

### 3\. HDRI monitors and TVs

You've probably heard of **HDRI 4K** when shopping for a smart TV or computer monitor. These TVs offer a lot more than just a wide color gamut, high brightness, and advanced contrast ratio. In addition, HDR TVs and monitors can recognize HDR signals, allowing viewers to watch the content with all studio quality. In short, viewers can see more color details in shadowy and lighter scenes, making them perfect for avid gamers.

## Part 4: How do you open an HDRI?

Because HDRIs use low dynamic range rendering, a standard display panel won't open HDR images. So, to open an HDRI file on a non-HDR display, you'll need to convert it to a different low dynamic range format using tone mapping technology. For example, you convert HDRI to JPEG or PNG and enjoy regular bitmaps while maintaining the HDRI properties. You can also open and edit HDRI using desktop programs like EasyHDR, Photoshop, and Blender.

## Part 5: How to set up an HDR environment background?

Before wrapping up this blog post, let's discuss how to use [HDRI for Blender](https://www.blender.org/) to apply HDR effects to an image's background. Blender is a 100% free program for creating jaw-dropping 3D rendering and animations on Mac and Windows computers. With Blender, you'll get an advanced modeling toolset like retopology, curves, sculpting, and more. But in this post, we'll learn how to create an HDR environment or add lighting to your image project. Let's get started!

Step1Install and run Blender and then tap the World Properties tab. Then, click the Color icon and add Environment Texture.

##### Step 5 Use the masking tool

Go to Effects > Utility > Image Mask, then drag and drop it onto the latter half of the top video clip.

![use the masking tool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/text-reveal-effect-6.jpg)

Make more cuts on the top latter clip, frame by frame, starting from the first cut you have made.

![make more cuts on the top latter clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/text-reveal-effect-7.gif)

Double-click on each of the smaller clips and find the mask settings.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![double-click on each of the smaller clips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/text-reveal-effect-8.jpg)

Since the subject in this tutorial is moving from side to side, we are going to match the mask's y-axis setting, which is also the revealed text portion, with the subject's movement. Starting from the first clip, adjust the y-axis number to a smaller/bigger number.

![adjust the y-axis number](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/text-reveal-effect-9.gif)

There we go! The final look should look like this:

## How to Create Vintage Film Effect 1990S

In the 90s, movie production technology improved a lot. This decade saw horror movies become much more fun and immersive than in the 80s and 50s because they were more psychological. In fact, we can say that the horror movies of the 90s laid the foundation for current horror movies. So, without wasting time, let's create a 1990s horror movie similar to The Blair Witch Project.

## Preparation

![1990s vintage scene](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/1990s-vintage-scene.gif)

The preparation for this horror film production is relatively self-explanatory if you've watched The Blair Witch Project. Simply shoot footage inside a dark room and apply some light to your face. It's even better if you can shoot the video inside the woods. Just add some drama and a few screaming scenes to evoke emotions.

##### Step1 Add the horror video to the timeline

<a href="https://vapordna.pxf.io/c/5597632/1496243/17238" target="_top" id="1496243"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17238-1496243" border="0" alt="" width="1000" height="1221"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1496243/17238" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![add the horror video to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1990s-1.jpg)

Open Wondershare Filmora on your computer, then load the video you want to edit. After adding the video, drag it to the editing timeline, then move it a few keyframes to the right. The idea is to apply some black screen to add drama and fear before the film starts playing.

##### Step2 Apply color grading

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://modlily.sjv.io/c/5597632/2072819/17059" target="_top" id="2072819"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17059-2072819" border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2072819/17059" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![apply color grading](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1990s-2.jpg)

Next, double-click the horror clip and go to the **Color** menu. Then, click the **Tone** arrow before lowering the **Saturation** to -50%. This will give us a less saturated look popularly used in horror films.

![double-click the horror clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1990s-3.jpg)

Now click the **3D LUT** option and choose a LUT that works for your film. For this horror film project, we'll select the **Dark Film** option.

##### Step3 Add creepiness to the video

![add creepiness to the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1990s-4.jpg)

Obviously, you'll want your horror film to look as creepy as possible. To achieve that, click the **Elements** tab, then search for the **Smokescreen 1** effect. Move the effect to the timeline above the video track before trimming the effect clip to fit with the original horror video.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082541/7443" target="_top" id="2082541"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082541" border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082541/7443" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![click the elements tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1990s-5.jpg)

We'll now change the size and positioning of the smokescreen effect to match the feature video. To do that, double-click the effect track. You can also reduce the opacity to around 30% to make the smoke more visible.

##### Step4 Add a retro filming effect

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087394/7443" target="_top" id="2087394"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087394" border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087394/7443" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![add a retro filming effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1990s-6.jpg)

Now we'll make the film more believable by adding a retro overlay. Click the **Effects** tab, then search for **Retro Film Overlay 15** before dragging and dropping the effect above all the tracks in the editing timeline.

![add creepiness to the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1990s-4.jpg)

Obviously, you'll want your horror film to look as creepy as possible. To achieve that, click the **Elements** tab, then search for the **Smokescreen 1** effect. Move the effect to the timeline above the video track before trimming the effect clip to fit with the original horror video.

![click the elements tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1990s-5.jpg)

We'll now change the size and positioning of the smokescreen effect to match the feature video. To do that, double-click the effect track. You can also reduce the opacity to around 30% to make the smoke more visible.

##### Step4 Add a retro filming effect

Open Wondershare Filmora on your computer, then load the video you want to edit. After adding the video, drag it to the editing timeline, then move it a few keyframes to the right. The idea is to apply some black screen to add drama and fear before the film starts playing.

## How to Color Grading in Final Cut Pro

Have you ever questioned the purpose of those odd video scopes or how to build super grades from the start in Final Cut Pro? In contrast to editing talents, color grading is a technical and difficult ability that takes practice.

In order to help, we decided to compile a thorough beginner's article to color grading in Final Cut Pro.

With that said, let's begin!

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://bluetties.sjv.io/c/5597632/2039292/17094" target="_top" id="2039292"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17094-2039292" border="0" alt="BLUETTI NEW LAUNCH AC240" width="954" height="1020"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2039292/17094" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />

## 1\. Discover how you color grade in Final Cut Pro

Color grading may be a tedious and time-consuming operation, therefore it's a skill set that calls for a lot of patience. Some editors won't conduct any color grading or correction beyond the bare minimum. But even mundane-looking film may look remarkable if you know how to give it a dramatic touch.

A more cinematic grade requires a number of procedures, and there is no one method that works for all situations. We'll therefore walk you through the process of creating a cinematic color grade in Final Cut Pro, but depending on your material, you might need to add or omit some phases.

##### Step1Filming

Since the raw video is essential for producing a cinematic image, an outstanding grade begins with the camera.

Use the greatest quality settings your camera offers while recording your video; the more information in your picture, the more you can manipulate it during grading.

While it may seem preferable to shoot with as much color as you can, using a duller color profile is very necessary. Your camera will have color settings, and although the washed-out, drab appearance may not inspire confidence in you, it will offer you a lot more editing possibility.

##### Step2Create a color profile

After importing your film, you may be concerned about the general dull look of your recordings. The reason for that is because you have not yet matched the color profile of your sequence to the one of your camera. To start on this process, it goes as follows.

* Drag your clip onto your timeline and make sure it is selected. Click on the Inspector icon.
* Then click on the Information tab of the clip.
* Navigate all the way down through the options to find the Color LUT option.
* Then choose the Color profile that matches your clip based on the camera it is filmed with.
* You're done!

##### Step3Checking the scopes

The Scopes in Final Cut Pro are panels that display the color information of your shots. They are quite complicated and can be difficult to comprehend if you did not use them ever before. You can activate Video Scopes by clicking View > Show in Viewer > Video Scopes from the View menu. The three components of grading are the highlights, mid-tones, and shadows. Your highlights are shown at the top and your shadows are at the bottom in all grading tools and scopes.

## 2\. Include Color Wheels

Now that your setup is complete, you can begin grading your footage. Grading is done in multiple layers stacked on top of each other. It may take multiple levels to create the desired look. Follow the instructions below to modify your settings to match your clip if you want to give your footage a cinematic look.

You may access a wider range of color manipulation tools with the built-in color wheels, exposure adjustments, including isolation of color selection, RGB modifications across tone ranges, and simple masking.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 3\. Color board

A vertical color spectrum is shown on the Color Board, and it is intersected by a horizontal line that features four nodes. These are the ranges of the footage that are designated as the Highlights, Midtones, and Shadows, respectively.

Adjusting a node to a new color space has an immediate and noticeable impact on the corresponding section of the image. If you move above the horizontal line, it will increase, and if you go below the line, it will decrease.

You also have control over the Saturation and Exposure settings. These are wonderful to have if you want to increase the contrast in your photographs and make particular colors more vivid or muted.

## 4\. Masks

Using the Shape Masks feature, each of these individual effects can be perfect for particular regions of your footage. In addition, by utilizing a Color Mask, you can alter the appearance of a specific color. It is possible to apply multiple iterations of each color adjustment to a clip and find it listed under the Effect heading.

The order can be changed by dragging and dropping, and either method can be disabled or enabled. Utilizing keyframes allows for the effects of color grading to be specifically timed as well. Last but not least, keep in mind that the quality and color sample depth of the clips determine how much of an overall adjustment you are capable of making to a color.

## 5\. Color Curves

If you are experienced with more advanced picture editing software, such as Adobe Photoshop, you will benefit greatly from using color curves. Adjustments can be made independently to both the Luma (the brightest areas) and the primary composite colors (red, blue, and green).

## 6\. Match Colors

Match Color is an additional choice that may be made from the improvement's menu. This function will try to replicate the visual style of one video clip in another. First, choose the clip whose color you want to change, click on that clip that has the desired appearance, and last, choose Match Color.

You will still be able to utilize these settings as shortcuts even after you have gained more experience with manual grading and are comfortable making finer adjustments manually. It is important to keep in mind that while using Final Cut Pro X for color grading, effects can be layered on top of one another.

It's not likely that a single tool or adjustment will solve an issue or produce the desired result; rather, it's more likely that a number of different impacts will be required. In the same way that different visual effects in Final Cut Pro X may be toggled on and off, any layers that you add to a clip can have their visibility controlled from the Inspector window.

## Conclusion

In Final Cut Pro X, you may choose from a wide variety of grading plugins, ranging from more affordable solutions like FCPeffects to more expensive ones like Magic Bullet Looks, which are designed specifically for feature film-style grades.

Additionally, there is a variety of stand-alone applications for color grading, such as DaVinci Resolve and FilmConvert. You might be comfortable with their gear, but you should also know that their professional-grade color package includes some rather complex editing options.

Beginning to experiment with all of Final Cut Pro X's functions and determining which ones are most useful to you is the best method to gain an understanding of the program's color grading capabilities. If you don't currently have a project that requires your attention, you can download stock footage and experiment with it.
