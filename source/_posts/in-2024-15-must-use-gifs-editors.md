### New Features

* **Separates the Object:** RSMB Pro has the additional capability to isolate the background and foreground effectively. It utilizes a specified matte that can help in object separation to create motion blur with great precision. (Not available with Movie Studio, Vegas Pro, Catalyst Edit, Smoke, Media Composer, Flame, or Nucoda)
* **Blur with Motion Vectors:** If you have imported a 3D animation video, the pro version can blur the motion vectors provided by you. Thus, it can work on a 3D animation system perfectly. (Not available with Vegas Pro, DaVinci Resolve, Movie Studio, Media Composer, Catalyst Edit, or Nucoda)
* **RGB+A Tracking:** This option is used to recognize and track dark images with mattes by using the alpha channel. You can use this option for masked or CG stuff. (Not available with Media Composer)
* **Use of Tracking Points:** To help the RSMB’s calculation of motion vectors, you can provide tracking points. By defining the tracking points, you can tell RSMB about the movement of one pixel from one frame to another efficiently. (Not available with Vegas Pro, Media Composer, Catalyst Edit, DaVinci Resolve, Smoke, Flame, Movie Studio, or Nucoda)
* **Spline Guidance:** If RSMB encounters problems related to tracking, you can draw and animate shapes to tell about the object's movement. Thus, it can help the RSMB find the object movement easily. (Not available with Premiere Pro, Nucoda, Vegas Pro, HitFilm, Movie Studio, Smoke, Sihouette, Flame, Scratch, Nuke, Motion, Media Composer, DaVinci Resolve, Catalyst Edit, FCPX)

### Rating

* 7 out of 5

### Our Verdict

The new features in the pro version of RSMB are really compelling and beneficial. However, there are various restrictions when it comes to the supported hosts of the pro version. So, if you are using any common software for video editing that is not recognized by the pro version, we will recommend you use the regular version of RSMB. The regular version of RSMB is cost-effective and works proficiently.
