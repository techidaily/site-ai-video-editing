## Part 1 The Aim of YouTube’s Algorithm

YouTube’s algorithms work with 2 major aims. Its first aim is helping the viewers easily get what they want to watch. The second aim of YouTube’s algorithm is to maximize the satisfaction rate of viewers which ultimately leads to long term engagement.

## Part 2 How the YouTube Algorithm Works

YouTube has a well defined AI-based algorithm. The working of the **YouTube algorithm AI** depends on several factors. It decides the position of videos at 6 different places as per the viewer’s interest. These locations include:

Notifications, Channel subscriptions, Trending streams, YouTube’s homepage, Recommended streams, and Search results.

Let’s understand some more facts about the working of the YouTube algorithm.

### 01How YouTube Determines The Algorithm

The traffic source for each video might be different. But YouTube’s approach to determine the algorithm for video recommendation is decided by:

**●** External factors i.e. the overall audience or market

**●** Performance i.e. the success rate of video

**●** Personalization i.e. the history and preferences of viewers

### 02How YouTube Determines Its Homepage Algorithm

You might have found a large array of videos when you type Youtube.com or open the app. YouTube shows these videos thinking that person might be interested in watching any video from the list. The selection of these videos is based on performance and personalization. Performance is measured depending on the metrics such as viewer surveys, likes, dislikes, average percentage viewed, average view duration, and click-through rates. Personalization means the selection of videos based on the past behavior of the viewers.

### 03How YouTube Determines Its Suggested Video Algorithm

When a person watches any video on YouTube, they always find some video options to watch on the right side. These videos are decided by the suggested videos algorithm. Such videos are decided by AI based on the viewer's interest in a particular visit. The recommendations for these videos are decided by the following:

**●** Performance

**●** Personalization

**●** Videos watched by the user in the past

**●** Topically related videos

**●** Videos that are often watched together

**●** Keywords used on the metadata of video

**●** Performance of the video

## Detailed Guide to Resize Your Video in VLC

Videos are one of the most popular types of content on the internet. There are millions of videos uploaded to YouTube, Facebook, and other video-sharing sites each day. Sharing your videos with others is possible when you know how to resize them in VLC. VLC is a free media player that allows you to convert or compress your videos in order to make them smaller for uploading or downloading.

Videos are a great way to showcase your business, company, or product on social media sites like Facebook and Twitter. But what happens when you use the wrong size for your video? The whole thing looks distorted and low quality. It's not very appealing.

Luckily, resizing videos in VLC is simple. All you need is the right software and the right steps.

This blog post will walk you through how to resize videos using VLC. We'll cover what the default settings are for video resolutions, how to change them, and why it's important to know what size of video you're uploading before uploading it.

So without further ado, let's get started!

## Step by step to resize your video in VLC

Anyone who has a lot of videos on their computer knows how frustrating it can be to find the video you want among the hundreds of ones you have. Well, VLC makes it possible to resize your videos so they'll fit onto your desktop. Here's how:

### Resizing by converting to a smaller file size

Because some video formats, such as MKV and AVI, take up too much space, it's a good idea to convert videos to smaller formats, such as FLV, WMV, and so on. To lower the video size, you'll be pleased to learn that VLC allows you to convert video/audio files without the need to install any other software. The video conversion guide for VLC can be found below.
