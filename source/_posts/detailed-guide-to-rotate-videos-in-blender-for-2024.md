In this tutorial, we have shown you two different ways to rotate a video in Blender. The first way is by using the Transform Properties window, and the second way is by using the 3D Viewport.

Which method you use is up to you. However, we recommend using the 3D Viewport method, as it is more accurate.

Rotating a video in Blender can be used for other purposes than just rotating it.

Here are some other things that you can do with a rotated video:

\- Scale the video up or down

\- Flip the video horizontally or vertically

\- Change the position of the video in the 3D Viewport

## Add Stylish Text to Videos

Create your style. Let it be unique for yourself and yet identifiable for others – Anna Wintour. Adding Stylish Text to your video helps to communicate the clarity of the story's message, tone, and sentiment. But how much text on video is enough? This article will teach you how and when to add stylish text to your video and its importance.

## What is Stylish Text

In general, Stylish text is preset animations that you can use to the text in your video with just one click, adding an efficient plan to grab your viewers' attentiveness. From bold to essential, stylish text can help give your video a clear look while also increasing the accessibility of your videos. Text styles offer a monochrome highlight on your text and added movement to make your videos more engaging to the audience.

Most of the video editing software released offers different text style presets that you can use to accomplish the look you're aiming. In [Wondershare Filmora 11](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), browsing the Title menu, there are a lot of Text categories available that you can use depending on the type of video you are working with, whether it's all about events like Mother's Day, Valentine's day, or gaming text style, travel, sports, everything in one total package.

## What is the importance of Adding Stylish Text?

As a Youtuber, creating thumbnails is one of the essential aspects of getting the attention of your audience. A thumbnail is a small image inserted into a video that exemplifies larger content inside the video or article. Millions of videos are produced and uploaded on the Internet every single day, so it's essential for yours to stand out. Text on videos has several different added benefits as well. In this video, we'll give four reasons why you should start adding text to your videos.

### **1\. Content becomes easy to remember**

Viewer Retention (sometimes referred to as "Audience Retention") is the average percentage of a video that people watch. Videos with high Viewer Retention scores tend to sell more. Adding some Text/Title in your video is one of the critical factors to remember because the viewers get multiple cue points (example: audio and text on video) to confirm their understanding and retain the essence of the messaging.

### **2\. Make sense even without sound**

A lot of people watch videos on mute mode. A recent study indicates that 85% of Facebook videos are watched without sound. A lot of us consume videos while in transit and sometimes at work as well :).

Text is very expository for most of these videos since it'd help in building the proper context for the viewer.

### **3\. It Helps Summarize Key Points**

Some audiences are looking for a summary of the video in an instant to save more time. As Youtuber, it is very helpful if you will add Text/Titles as caption perse in a video. For example, one needs to remember 2-3 tips for driving. If the captions or text show up on the video when the driver talks about this and that, that's better!

### **4\. Aesthetics**

Some people don't care much about the graphics; they just go through the textual content. This is because texts are the major sources of information. Adding Styling Text/Titles can make a video engaging and attractive. The audience wants to see some color and action in the videos to grasp the storyboard easily.

## How to use Stylish Text

As mentioned, Styles help you add dynamic effects that make your videos exceptional, whether you use a template or start from scratch.

For this example, we'll walk you through using text styles on the Short video clip that I made using [Wondershare Filmora 11](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

##### Step1 Open your Wondershare Filmora 11 Video editing software

1. Launch Wondershare Filmora 11 from your system and select New Project.
2. Import the selected videos and open them in the program to enhance the speed and duration of the video. The video can also be dragged and dropped to the interface.

![drag and import video filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/drag-and-import-video-filmora.jpg)

##### Step2 Imported Video Clips

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![imported video clips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/imported-video-clips.jpg)

In using the Title or the Stylish Text, you can add your video clip on Timeline Panel, or you can first add the Title text.

##### Step3 Add Stylish Text

Let's first add our selected Stylish text/title, or you can search in the Search box above for any related text you want.

1. Go to Title Menu above, click the Title category that you want, and drag it to the Timeline Panel below. Once added, you can check if this will fit the story of your video.

![select desired titile travle video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/select-desired-titile-travle-video.jpg)

##### Step4 Change Stylish Text Duration and Effects

You can also modify or change the Duration of the Title you've added in the Timeline panel. The default length of a text effect is 5 seconds. There are two ways to change the course of a text effect.

1. Drag the text on the timeline directly and adjust the duration either on the left or right side.
2. Or you can select the text in the timeline panel and click the duration icon to set a new duration. The duration setting will pop out then you can input your desired period.

![set new duration](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/set-new-duration.jpg)

##### Step5 Edit Text Effects

1. In Editing the Added Stylish Text, you can double click on it in the timeline to open the Text editing panel. From here, you can change the style (color, font, size, alignment, transform, and compositing) and choose the Word Art type and animation of your text.
