### Using Uniform Speed to Create a Slow-Motion Video in Filmora

Uniform Speed is the basic method of creating slow motion in Filmora. It simply modifies the playback speed of video with the help of a slider. The procedure of slomo creation, like **The Slow Mo Guys** in Filmora, is given below:

##### Step 1Import Media to Start Slomo Creation

After downloading Filmora on your device, click the "New Project" button to start. From the editing interface, click the "Ctrl + I" keys, choose the video, and bring it to the timeline after import. Select the clip in the timeline and use your cursor to reach the settings panel. Go to the "Uniform Speed" section under the "Speed" tab and change the speed slider settings.

![drag the slider to adjust speed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/secret-to-slomo-videos-with-the-slow-mo-guys-5.jpg)

##### Step 2Start AI Frame Interpolation Settings

This is the AI feature that increases the video frame rate for a smooth, slow-motion effect. You can access this option at the bottom of Uniform Speed settings. Expand it and select the “Optical Flow” option for your purpose.

![enable the optical flow option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/secret-to-slomo-videos-with-the-slow-mo-guys-6.jpg)

##### Step 3Enable Render Preview to See Results

Once all is set and done, navigate towards the timeline panel to select this video again. With the help of your cursor, access the "File" tab at the top toolbar. Select the "Render Preview" option from the expanding menu. After rendering is complete, use the preview screen to observe the slo-mo and export it.
