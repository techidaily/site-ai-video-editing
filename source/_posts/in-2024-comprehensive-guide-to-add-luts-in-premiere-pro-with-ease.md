## Easy Guide to Overlay Videos in Premiere Pro

In order to make it simple to combine the shot's components into a sequence, video overlays are pieces of film that are often recorded in a dark studio. Using image overlays on a video production is fairly frequent. However, adding pictures to every video you export might be tiresome and time-consuming if you have several films to send. For instance, an overlay video in Premiere Pro might be preferred by you rather than a manual addition of the overlay media.

There is a quick and easy method to know how to overlay a video on a video in Premiere Pro and we’ve got it covered. However, depending on the kind of element, there may be some color blending that affects the components themselves. Overlays may be filmed on either a green screen or a blue screen. Snow components photographed against a green screen may have a green hue shift, necessitating further color grading before the footage might be used.

## Part 2\. How to add filters on Mac iMovie

If you are someone who regularly makes videos for social media account or video streaming channel, you are more likely to record your video using a video camera and transfer the recorded video to you Mac for editing purposes. iMovie comes pre-installed on Mac, and therefore, once you have transferred the video, you can get started with editing and adding filters immediately. Here are the steps on how to add filters to iMovie on your Mac.

Step1 Launch iMovie from Applications folder. Click on Create New option to start a new Project.

## Conclusion

If you are an iPhone user or a Mac user, you can add filters to your video using iMovie app. You have to install iMovie app on your iPhone, but iMovie comes pre-installed on Mac. But there are limited filters available on iMovie and there is a lack of face filters which are trending in today’s viral videos. That is why we recommend [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) where there is a wide range of filters available to apply to your video conveniently as per your requirements.
