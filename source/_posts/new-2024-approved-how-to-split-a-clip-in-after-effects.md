**Step 2: Make Your Film Ready**

Before beginning to remove the black background in After Effects template, make sure that your footage is ready to take up the action. The tool you are about to use is known to eliminate black pixels from your clip proportional to the luminous intensity variation in the scene under consideration.

Check for any areas you would like to remain untouched and mask them to retain the dark elements. To ensure effective masking, it is recommended to use the ‘Levels and Curves’ effect for a convenient tweak to the final key at the end.

![After Effects Template- Footage Preparation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Hard-to-remove-black-background-in-after-effects-here%E2%80%99s-the-best-way-to-deal-with-it-2.JPG)

**Step 3: Luminance Adjustments**

While continuing with the ‘Shift Channels’ effect, navigate to the ‘Take Alpha From’ checkbox and set ‘Luminance’ as the ‘Reset’ parameter.

## Part 2 How to Export After Effects Transparent Background

Videos with transparent backgrounds are trending examples of motion graphic designing and video editing artworks. The cue behind these backgrounds is that they exclusively permit the object of focus to have an opaque or colored pixelation, while leaving the remaining pixels as transparent or colorless. This is beneficial in adding an extra spotlight to the main elements of your creation, while rendering the less important parts behind the scene.

Having known the credibility of transparent backgrounds in video crafting, you may feel motivated to try hands on experimenting with transparent backgrounds to uplift your graphic motion artwork.

Considering the most affordable picks of video editing software to choose from, you can rely on the ‘After Effects’ motion graphic template to kick start the creation process. When using the aforesaid template to export videos with transparent backgrounds, you need to adhere to the following steps:

**Step 1: Launch the After Effects Template**

Start with downloading the graphic template from its official website and launching the same on your system.

**Step 2: Select Your Video**

On a successful launch, the template welcomes you with its composition timeline and project panel. Here, you need to select a desired video from either of the two places to export with a transparent background.

**Step 3: Add to Queue**

Once you have made your choice, navigate to the top toolbar in the composition panel and hit the ‘Composition’ tab. From the drop down menu that follows, choose ‘Add to Render Queue’. You can alternatively use the ‘Ctrl + M’ shortcut to carry out the above task.

"
