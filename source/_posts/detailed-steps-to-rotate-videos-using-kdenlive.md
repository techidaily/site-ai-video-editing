## This Article Will Explore in Detail How You Can Use the Features Available in Wondershare Filmora to Export the Video by Changing the Resolution of the Footage

With the vast number of devices available in the market today, storing data and video files has become difficult. Frequently in cases where the devices share different forms of resolution, it makes sharing videos a hassle.

In those situations, changing the resolution of your video can be a great idea. It will also allow you to save storage. In this article, you'll adjust the resolution in just a few clicks by Wondershare Filmora. But before we learn how to change a video's resolution, let's look into what a video resolution is!

## Part 1\. What Is a Video Resolution?

A video resolution, in short, is the quality of the video visible. A video is rendered at a specific rate whenever you watch a movie or go to a cinema. A screen is made up of **tiny pixels** and arranged in an order that determines the resolution of a screen.

Video resolution is rendered in a **vertical** and **horizontal** orientation. Therefore, whenever you play a video on YouTube, the resolution scale is available for you to choose from, i.e., **480p**, **720p**, **1080p,** etc.

In most cases, a resolution is dictated by the full abbreviation. So, for example, a **720p** video is **1280 x 720,** and a **1080p** video is a **1920 x 1080** resolution.

![a video resolution dimensions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-1.png)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** The number written before is the number of horizontal pixels in a video. And the number written after is the vertical pixels in a video.

Before we adjust the resolution of a video, let's look at a comparison between different types of video resolution.

## Part 2\. 7 Different Types of Video Resolution

It has been established that a video resolution is not a constant number and changes according to the screen. Scroll below to look at the different forms of video resolutions available!

### 360p

The full resolution is **480 x 360**. This resolution is a minimal video resolution. On a big screen, **360p** will look blurry. That is why a **360p** resolution is the best for smaller devices such as Mobile phones.

### 480p

The full resolution is **853 x 480**. Although an upgrade from the latter, this resolution is available on many devices. It's mainly used in devices such as smaller **TVs**, **laptops,** and **Desktop** computers. It is also available for Burn-in **DVDs**.

### 720p

The full version of the resolution is **1280 x 720**. This resolution is called **HD**, short for High Definition. **720p** quality looks good almost on every device and is also reasonably available.

Most modern devices, such as **Mobile phones**, **Touch Tablets**, **Laptops,** and **PCs,** are calibrated in **720p** Resolution.

![high definition resolution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-2.png)

### 1080p

The resolution in its complete form is **1920 x 1080**. This resolution is also known as **FHD**, short for **Full High Definition. 1080p** resolution is the quality in which many high-quality devices are constructed. As a result, the screens of these devices have a clear and clean display.

![a youtube video in fhd resolution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-3.png)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** It is usually recommended to share videos on social media in 1080p resolution.

### 1440p

This resolution is also called **QHD (Quad HD**). The length and width of this resolution are **2560 x 1440**. As the name suggests, its quality is quad (four times) than that of a standard **720p** resolution.

The screens of devices constructed in this resolution usually have a high-end purpose. For example, this resolution is commonly used in **Gaming monitors** and **High-end smartphones**.

![a gaming monitor in 1440p resolution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-4.png)

### 2160p

The screens constructed in this resolution are considered among the best available in the market. **2160p (3840 x 2160)** is also known as **UHD**, which is short for **Ultra High Definition**. It is also known as **4K** because it offers four times the power of **1080p** or **FHD** (Full High Definition.)

These screens are usually available for high-end competitive gaming monitors or big screen **LCD** and **LED** Television. In addition, some of the flagship smartphones are also built with **4K** resolution.

![difference between hd fhd and 4k resolution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-5.png)

### 4320p

This resolution is also known as **8K**. The length and width of the pixel arrangement are **7680 x 4320**. The pixels are arranged in these screens to offer sixteen times the average power of a **1080p** (FHD) monitor.

This resolution is only available on several devices, such as commercial TVs and monitors. However, this is the most significant resolution available in the modern market. Therefore, even if your monitor cannot support a larger resolution, you can test whether your PC can render an **8K** resolution.
