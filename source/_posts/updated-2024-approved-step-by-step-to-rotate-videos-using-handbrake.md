## Step by Step to Rotate Videos Using Handbrake

Handbrake is a video editing tool that allows you to rotate videos. It is a free and open source software that is available on Windows, Mac, and Linux. It is used to convert video files from one format to another. You can use it to compress videos, add subtitles, or create chapters. It also allows you to rotate videos in different directions. You can use it to fix videos that are not aligned properly or that have been filmed upside down. A handbrake is a popular tool because it is easy to use and it has a variety of features.

## Step-by-step on how to rotate videos using Handbrake

When you import a video into the Handbrake software, it will by default be in a "landscape" orientation, with the long edge of the video oriented horizontally. If you want to rotate the video 90 degrees counterclockwise so that it appears "vertical," or if you want to rotate it 180 degrees so that it is upside down, you can do so by following these two steps:

Step 1: Open the Handbrake software and import your video.

![rotate-video-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-handbrake-1.png)

Step 2: Click on the "Dimensions" tab at the top of the Handbrake window.

![rotate-video-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-handbrake-2.png)

Step 3: Under the "Orientation and Cropping" section, click on one of the options in the "Rotate" menu.

![rotate-video-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-handbrake-3.png)

Step 4: If you want to rotate a video 90 degrees counterclockwise, select "90 Degrees CW (Counter-Clockwise)." If you want to rotate the video 180 degrees so that it is upside down, select "180 Degrees."

![rotate-video-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-handbrake-4.png)

Step 5: Click on the "Preview" button at the bottom of the Handbrake window to see a preview of how your rotated video will look. When you are satisfied with the rotation, click on the "Start Encode" button to begin the encoding process.

![rotate-video-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-handbrake-5.png)

The Handbrake software also offers a "Flip" option which you can do after rotating it, which allows you to slip the video after rotating it. To use this option, follow these steps:

Under the "Orientation and Cropping" section, Go to Rotation and choose the degrees that best is best for your rotation requirements.

![rotate-video-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-handbrake-6.png)

Click on "Flip" to flip your video horizontally.

![rotate-video-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-handbrake-7.png)

## How Do You Find a High-Quality Video Marketing Company?

It is difficult to spot a high-quality agency because most promise a lot but deliver very little. With so many video marketing companies ready to scam you, the question boils down to how to find a high-quality agency that can provide the expected results. Here are some crucial steps to judge if a marketing video agency is worth your time and money.

##### Step 1 Be Clear About Your Objective

Before you start finding video content marketing companies, you should be clear about the goals you want to achieve through video marketing. For some brands, the goal could be increasing brand awareness and visibility by driving website traffic. For others, it could be generating leads and boosting sales. Once you are clear about your goals and expectations, you can start finding agencies that specialize in fulfilling your objectives.

![be clear about your objective](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/03/image_1.jpeg)

##### Step 2 Assess Overall Quality

On your journey of finding video marketing companies, you will come across many agencies that will look very promising, apparently. But you cannot take their promises for granted. Instead, evaluate their capabilities by reviewing their portfolio consisting of their past projects. You can assess their quality by judging their creativity, work style, production value, and marketing techniques from their past works. Once you are convinced of their skills and capabilities, you can shortlist them.

![assess overall quality](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/03/image_2.jpg)

##### Step 3 Give Priority to Experience

Selecting a marketing video agency without past experience with companies in your industry will be a blunder. This is because their past experience will help them understand your objectives and targeted audiences better. They are likely to be aware of the things that work and do not work with the audiences in your industry. Besides, they will be capable of finding opportunities and identifying challenges faster during the marketing process. Therefore, agencies with experience in your industry should get priority on your list.

![give priority to experience](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/03/image_3.jpg)

##### Step 4 Check Customer Testimonials

Checking out the reviews of past clients and customers is an essential part of selection. Customer testimonials can reveal insights for you to judge the strengths and weaknesses of the agency. You can form an opinion on their professionalism, communication style, operational techniques, and customer satisfaction. You should check the reviews and feedback on their websites and ask for references from their past customers.

![check customer testimonials](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/03/image_4.jpg)

##### Step 5 Watch out for Creativity

Creativity differentiates between excellence and average in the video marketing world. Every company invests in video marketing, but only a few are successful in their efforts. The key to their success lies in their creative thinking and innovative approach. Creativity makes video content attention-grabbing, long-lasting, and highly sharable.

Similarly, innovative marketing techniques will give you a significant edge over your competitors. You can judge a video marketing agency's creativity if they pitch unique ideas, creative storytelling, and innovative marketing approaches. Watch out for the reviews to determine if the company has a proven record of creativity in their field.

![watch out for creativity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/03/image_5.jpg)

##### Step 6 Take Optimization Seriously

Creative video content is useless if it cannot reach the most targeted audiences. The reach in the digital world depends on optimization. That is why when you choose a **marketing video agency** near you, ensure they understand optimization principles. Proper search engine optimization helps a video rank higher in search results and get more organic audiences.

Optimization techniques vary for search engines, video streaming websites, and social media platforms. A video marketing agency should have expertise in optimization for organic reach and generating leads.

![take optimization seriously](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/03/image_6.jpeg)

##### Step 7 Dive Into the Process

You should choose a video agency that is more open about its operation and process of execution. They must explain the entire process, from concept development to final delivery. Similarly, they should be open to suggestions, flexible in approaches, and adaptable during challenges.

Understanding the execution process will help you determine instinctively if the agency is worth your investment. There should be clarity in the thought process and executive plan with deadline and budget for your peace of mind and satisfaction.

![dive into the process](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/03/image_7.jpeg)

##### Step 8 Focus on Communication

Communication is a highly underrated skill in the professional world, especially when outsourcing your work to an agency. Without proper communication, there cannot be a proper collaboration with the **video marketing company**. If you cannot share your feedback or get involved in the required process, your goals and objectives will stay unachieved.

Therefore, while discussing the execution plan, you should emphasize communication. For example, you can check how often you will get updates and how responsive and proactive the agency will be with suggestions and feedback. Communication enhances transparency in execution and boosts customer satisfaction.

![focus on communication](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/03/image_8.jpg)

##### Step 9 Request a Proposal

You must have shortlisted a few high-quality video marketing companies following the steps mentioned so far. It is time to request a proposal or quotation from the interested agencies. You should reiterate your goals, objectives, expectations, and requirements so the agencies can provide tailored proposals accordingly.

You can also clarify any doubts and assess their professionalism and communication well. The proposals can reveal the level of service you will get. The more detailed the proposal, the deeper you can evaluate the service and make the final selection accordingly.

![request a proposal](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/03/image_9.jpg)

##### Step 10 Evaluate Return on Investment

Last but not least, you should compare the prices to evaluate which proposals offer more value for your money. You should also calculate your return on investment so that your investment brings in the expected results without damaging you monetarily. You will also get to know the hidden charges and deliveries, and you should consider an agency that mentions them upfront for transparency. Finally, trust your assessment and instinct and select the best promotional video production company to take your business to the next level.
