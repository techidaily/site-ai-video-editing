However, Kapwing only allows the first 3 projects to be free, after that the image or video will be automatically watermarked, and you need to purchase kapwing premium access for the best image or video quality.

## Part 3\. Other 3 ways to convert image to video online

Even though an online image-to-video maker is not as powerful as photo and video editing software products like [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you can still use this online image-to-video maker to create videos effortlessly. However, to save time, you should prepare all the material you want to use in your video in advance so that you can upload it to the platform of your choice and have your video ready in minutes. Let's take a look at the image-to-video maker that you can use to create captivating social media videos.

### 2\. Image to video

![image to video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/kapwing-image-to-video-3.jpg)

This website offers a lot of different tools that you can use to create videos from your photos, crop videos, or add 3D transitions between frames. Keep in mind that the maximum number of photos you can use in one video is limited to thirty. Once you get to the home page of this platform, just upload your photos and arrange them in any way you want.

You can also add text, music, or your company logo to the video, then follow the on-screen instructions to complete the process. You can preview the video after the platform has generated it and decide whether you want to download it or start over if you didn't like the result.

### 3\. Mp3Care

![mp3care](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/kapwing-image-to-video-4.jpg)

This web application makes converting JPEG files to MP4 video files a simple two-step process that only requires uploading photos and then selecting the time between the two images. The maximum number of photos you can use in a video is limited to just twenty, with the maximum duration of each image in the video not exceeding the 20-second mark. Adding transitions between images is also on the list of options this platform provides, but Mp3 Care Photo to Video lacks any other video editing features. Despite some obvious drawbacks, this online photo-to-video maker is still a great choice if you want to convert your photos to videos quickly and for free.
