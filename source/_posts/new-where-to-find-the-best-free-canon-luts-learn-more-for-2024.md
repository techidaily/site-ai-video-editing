## Part 2 How to Convert JPG to Transparent PNG

Ever wondered how logos in a graphic match with the background image color? It’s possible with transparent PNG images only. The transparent PNG images format contains superior quality and no background. Hence, it is pretty helpful for the designers to add them to graphics and videos.

In case you have some JPG images but you want it in PNG images format, don’t worry. You can use Kapwing as it’s a trusted content creation and video editing platform. It can bring your idea to life. It can convert JPG to PNG transparent easily. With the AI-powered facility, you can enjoy a seamless editing and conversion experience. Kapwing makes it really simple and fast, but the best part is that you can get it done for free.

Step 1: Add Your JPG

Launch Kapwing in any browser of your choice. Log in using your account or sign up with a new one. Now, you will be redirected to the Kapwing studio, where you can do all the editing and conversion. Upload your image to the "Kapwing Studio" and use the "Remove Image from Background" tool.

![kapwing interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/things-you-need-to-know-about-transparent-png-remove-and-convert-4.jpg)

If the image is already saved on your device, simply hit "Click to Upload" or, if you wish, drag and drop the JPG image to initiate the conversion. On the other hand, in case the image is not available, you can copy and paste from a URL in the "Paste an image or video URL" box.

Step 2: Pick a Tool

After the image upload finishes, the next thing is to start removing its background. Go to the right side of the "Image" tab and click on the "Erase" button. Otherwise, you can use the "Remove Background from Image" tool to start.

![pick the tool kapwing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/things-you-need-to-know-about-transparent-png-remove-and-convert-5.jpg)

You have two options to choose from – Erase and Magic Wand. The first tool gives you full control over what you want to remove or keep. Adjust the "eraser size" by sliding right on the dial. This way, you can remove the background precisely.

Apart from that, the Magic Wand tool is amazing for removing a particular area at once. You can remove the picture background in less time and effort. If you want to remove a certain area of the same color, then the Magic Wand is the best tool to use. It eliminates similar groups of pixels together. To modify the sensitivity, move the same dial to the right as you did while selecting the "Erase" tool.

For some impressive results, adjust the zoom and choose "Move" to select the pixels you want to remove.

Step 3: Make the PNG and Download

After everything has been set, it’s time to download your PNG transparent file. Click "Done" and then move back to the Kapwing Studio for additional features. You can add watermarks, text, and a lot more. Finally, hit the "Publish" button placed at the top right and "Download" to save the PNG file to your desktop.

Have you ever tried to extract images from a video file? Well, many of us wish to do so but lack the right tools or don’t have any idea of how to do it. Some people just take a screenshot of the video and crop it for use in memes, images, etc. However, doing this will reduce its overall resolution and quality.

If you want to preserve quality during the extraction of images from a video, use Wondershare Filmora. It lets you take images out of a video file frame by frame without any compromise on quality. It features many other tools to show your creativity.

It's the latest update. Filmora V11 is here! Find out what's new in this latest video editing software release and how it can help you create incredible videos and images. You can remove any unwanted object from an image, add filters and overlays, all on the go.

## **●** Ending Thoughts **→**

**●** So there you have it: the full story on transparent PNGs, removing background, and conversion from JPG to PNG file format. As you can see, it’s not too hard to combine one image in your design. However, we don’t want you to forget anything. Hence, remember these things when you try to convert JPG to PNG transparent.

**●** Whichever method you choose to turn a PNG image into a JPG, make sure you are familiar with the tool. If not, first spend time figuring out the features. Seek out what suits you and then start. We would recommend following the above tips carefully instead of using any other tool.

**●** Beware of using third-party websites for background removal from a PNG. Many will store your pictures, which can be accessed by other users. They are not safe for you by any means.

**●** It’s not an easy job to convert JPG to transparent PNG using PowerPoint, especially when an image contains multiple images and colors. For such pictures, you can use Kapwing. It has plenty of additional features that you can use for creative work.

**●** If you have any questions or have different ways of accomplishing this, feel free to comment below. Thanks for reading.
