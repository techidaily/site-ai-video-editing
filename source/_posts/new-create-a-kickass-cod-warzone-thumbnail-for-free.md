Without further ado, here are the steps that you should follow:

##### Step1 Download & Install an Excellent Warzone Thumbnail Maker

Of course, the first step is to find good software for making thumbnails. But there is no thumbnail maker specifically made for Warzone. So, the best choice is a thumbnail maker that is also a video editor - like [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

Let us help you with that. Here are 5 Call of Duty: Warzone thumbnails you should check out.

### 1\. Call of Duty Warzone: THE BATTLE OF VERDANSK GAMEPLAY! (No Commentary)

![warzone thumbnail by noannoyingcommentary](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/warzone-thumbnail-1.JPG)

This video from the channel [NoAnnoyingCommentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3pBdi2Cf9Y) has 3.3 million views. It shows the player pointing their gun upwards. Flying in the sky are many fighter planes (obviously edited.) Then, a sepia filter is applied to make it look like a shot from past real-world wars. It is cool and sure to attract the attention of the COD: Warzone demographics.

### 2\. TOP 300 FUNNIEST FAILS IN WARZONE

![warzone thumbnail by red arcade](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/warzone-thumbnail-2.JPG)

This video is made by [Red Arcade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1UFojIiiK8). It has attracted more than 12 million views. Admittedly, the title and the video concept are already enough to attract many viewers. But we can't say that the thumbnail did not help. It's actually really good.

The thumbnail shows a screenshot from Warzone. A player's character is in the middle, with his back facing the camera. The words "AFK. Don't shoot!" are written on the wall he is facing. The character is viewed through a sniper scope. It's more "funny" than cool. But for what the video is about, it works fantastic.

### 3\. Clean House \[PS5 UHD 4K\] Next-Gen Ultra Realistic Graphics PlayStation 5 Call of Duty Gameplay

![warzone thumbnail by hedgehog](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/warzone-thumbnail-3.JPG)

This video from [HEDGEHOG ヅ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQlxN49jn6Y) has a whopping 12 million views. Again, the title likely is the main reason why it got that many views. But for sure, people did not read that long title at first. They were drawn to it by the thumbnail.

The thumbnail shows a clear-as-crystal screenshot of a team of 4 players on the battlefield. At the top left corner is the PS5 logo. Then, at the bottom left is an icon that says the video is in 4K UHD. If you're also uploading 4K Warzone videos, you can try doing this. Users are attracted to videos that are eye-pleasing.

### 4\. Call of Duty: Warzone Battle Royale | RTX 3080 10GB ( 4K Maximum Settings Ray Tracing OFF )

![warzone thumbnail by gtx 1050 ti](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/warzone-thumbnail-4.JPG)

The thumbnail for this video (made by [GTX 1050 Ti](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fU9zMSBcius)), with 5.2 million views, is just an in-game screenshot. At the top-right is a large logo of GEFORCE RTX 3080 and at the bottom left is an Intel logo. Like the previous one, it attracts viewers by stating the visual appeal of the video.

### 5\. NEW RECORD! 64 KILL GAME in CoD WARZONE! (Best Classes / Loadouts)

Like most Warzone thumbnails, this thumbnail from a [Vikkstar123](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5VNeLLs2yM) video features a gun. At the top right is the victory banner, and at the bottom is the logo for kills with the number 64 next to it. The top right shows the logo of COD Warzone.

Players are attracted to amazing gameplay. Unsurprisingly, the player who got 64 kills got 3.1 million views in his video. The gist is that if you have achieved something amazing, try to incorporate it into the thumbnail.
