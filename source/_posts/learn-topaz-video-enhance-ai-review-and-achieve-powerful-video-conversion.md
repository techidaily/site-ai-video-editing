## **Alternative Way to Edit FlV Video on Windows**

### **1\.** **VSDC**

VSDC is a free video editor along with a lot of advanced features. Cut, combine, trim, crop, and other editing capabilities are available to help you polish your FLV films.

Although it may not look logical, learning the editing capabilities hidden within modular boxes is simple. One noteworthy aspect of VSDC is its ability to produce good visual effects using many trendy video effects, transitions, and filters.

Furthermore, strong chroma keys, color correction, object modification, and other editing tools can be utilized to edit FLV videos. It not only creates excellent FLV videos, but it also supports a wide range of media conversion, allowing you to convert FLV files to various formats and export them without a watermark.

Therefore, follow the below mentioned steps to edit FLV video using VSDC:

Step 1: Install the software on the Windows. Open the application and import the video.

![edit flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-5.jpg)

Step 2: Use cutting and splitting tools to edit the video.

The first icon is a picture of a pair of scissors, which is a cutting tool. It's very useful when you need to cut the beginning or end of a film. Place the cursor exactly where you want to cut, then select "Trim start" or "Trim finish" from the dropdown cutting menu (the small triangle next to the scissors icon).

 ![edit flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-6.jpg)

Cropping is also simple. If you have too much additional space around the scene object recorded, just choose the file you want to trim and select the cropping icon from the "Cutting and Splitting" option. A new window will appear, allowing you to select the region of the scene that should stay.

![edit flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-7.jpg)

Step 3: Apply effects and transitions.

To use one, first select the video file you wish to edit, then go to the Video effects tab and select the effect you want to use. On the timeline, a new tab will appear, containing all of the effects done to the selected object. You can alter the effect's duration and position in time by dragging it with the mouse there. The properties pane on the right-hand side can be used to change other parameters.

Transitions follow the same rule. Place your cursor where you want the transition to begin, then choose a transition from the Video effects dropdown menu and manually adjust the duration.

![edit flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-8.jpg)

Step 4: Save changes and export video.

Make sure your movie appears exactly how you want it to before exporting it. If the video appears choppy, use the red preview button and lower the preview quality. When the PC's resources are insufficient to process the video in real time, lagging can occur. Keep in mind that it has no bearing on the outcome. When you're finished, navigate to the Export project tab and select an export format.

![edit flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-9.jpg)

### **2\.** **Adobe Premiere Pro:**

Professional video editors use Premiere Pro to make everything from YouTube videos to Hollywood films like Mank, a 2021 Oscar candidate. It's also widely utilized in the workflows of designers, animators, and VFX artists, and we can see why after lengthy testing.

We found the software's UI to be simple to use, and it increased our productivity by separating things into various workspaces, such as editing, effects, and audio. When we tested it on both Mac and PC, we discovered that each workspace helps handle a specific activity while minimizing distraction.

Edit the FLV video with Adobe Premiere Pro using the following steps:

Step 1: Import the video and create initial sequence.

![edit flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-10.jpg)

Step 2: In the Timeline, trim and rearrange clips, add audio, and transitions.

![edit flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-11.jpg)

Step 3: Add title and graphics.

In Premiere Pro, you may make onscreen titles, as well as stylize and animate your images.

Step 4: Export your video.

## **Alternative Way to Edit FlV Video on Mac**

### **1\.** **Blender:**

Under the GNU General Public License, Blender is a free, open-source 3D content production program that runs on all major operating systems. Blender is one of the greatest video editors for both Windows and Mac, with advanced features such as modifier-based modeling tools, powerful character animation capabilities, a node-based material, etc.

Because it is developed for professionals, it is tough to use as a beginner. However, it is unrestricted in its use and distribution. In addition, color options are changeable and versatile in the UI.

 In contrast, this free video editor is perfect for semi-pros or those who want to enhance their video editing skills. However, you'll need a lot of time and effort to learn it.

Step 1: Open the application.

![edit flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-14.jpg)

Step 2: Then, go into File->New->Video Editing to open the video editor.

### **2\.** **Final Cut Pro:**

When it comes to video editing software, Apple's Final Cut Pro is one of the industry standards. As a result, it's widely utilized in the television and film industries - at least among Mac users. However, one of the truly convincing reasons to choose it over Premiere Pro is because it is subscription-free: you only pay once.

The software's Magnetic Timeline, grouping tools, a vast selection of effects, solid organizational capabilities, and simple ways to add and edit audio make it a favorite among professional video editors. 360° video, HDR, and powerful color correcting tools are among the other capabilities. It's a strong software with a lot of features.

Follow the steps to edit FLV video using Final Cut Pro:

Step 1: Create Project.

To make a movie in Final Cut Pro, you must first establish a project, which keeps track of your editing selections and the media you utilize.

![edit flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-18.jpg)

Step 2: Select and add clips to the timeline:

Step 3: Cut and trim video:

Final Cut Pro has a number of features for altering the start and stop points of clips in the timeline, as well as regulating the pacing of shots from one to the next.

Step 2: Use cutting and splitting tools to edit the video.

The first icon is a picture of a pair of scissors, which is a cutting tool. It's very useful when you need to cut the beginning or end of a film. Place the cursor exactly where you want to cut, then select "Trim start" or "Trim finish" from the dropdown cutting menu (the small triangle next to the scissors icon).

![edit flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-5.jpg)

Step 2: Use cutting and splitting tools to edit the video.

The first icon is a picture of a pair of scissors, which is a cutting tool. It's very useful when you need to cut the beginning or end of a film. Place the cursor exactly where you want to cut, then select "Trim start" or "Trim finish" from the dropdown cutting menu (the small triangle next to the scissors icon).

 ![edit flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-6.jpg)

![change the number on the y axis](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-falling-text-effect-in-filmora-5.gif)

Next, you must move the play head to the 1-second position in the timeline. Here, you must change the number Y axis to a lower position and adjust the Rotate element as per your preference. After that, move the playhead again to 15 frames from the 1-second mark. It would be best if you changed the Y-axis position digit to 0 and adjusted the Rotation value slightly.

Following that, move the playhead again by 15 frames ahead. Rotate the letter again and change the Y-axis value until the letter rests at the bottom of the screen.

![move the playhead on the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-falling-text-effect-in-filmora-6.gif)

## Repeat for the next letters

After you are done with this editing process for the first letter, hold the default title in the library and drag and drop it into Track 2 on the timeline. Adjust the starting point for this layer to frame five from the beginning, and move the file to that starting point. In the end, cut the title length at the same position as layer one was, at 3.15 seconds.

Follow the process explained in the previous section for the first letter, i.e., moving the playhead at specific frames and changing the Y-axis and Rotation value multiple times.

After editing the second letter in the title, repeat the process of holding and dragging the default title to Track 3 in the timeline and adjusting starting position at the 10th frame. Again, follow the process of animating the letter like for Letter 1 and Letter 2\. Continue doing this process for multiple more letters in your title text.

![follow the process for letters 1 and 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-falling-text-effect-in-filmora-7.gif)

![tap on the snapshot icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-falling-text-effect-in-filmora-8.gif)

## Adjust Keyframing

Follow the animation process for all of the title clips and screenshots you did before. Move the play head to the point where the Tracks end and the Screenshots on the timeline start. Choose the first letter and click on the Keyframe icon in the editing window under Animation. Then, make adjustments to the values of Position, Rotation, etc.

Continue this keyframing step for all of the letters in sequence. After you are done here, click on the Render Preview icon on the right-hand side of the toolbar above the editing timeline. See how the falling text effects line up.
