You can use it to trim videos or create your own home movies and slideshows. You can even have it create videos automatically by taking photos as you go.

## Does Windows 10 have built-in video editing software?

The answer is yes. Windows 10 has an easy-to-use video editing app. This is handy for simple home video editing, but it doesn't work well for professional movie making. Windows Movie Maker was how we edited video in the old days of Windows XP and Vista. Today, Movie Maker is still available on Windows 10, but the new video editor is built-in to the operating system.

You can use it to trim videos or create your own home movies and slideshows. You can even have it create videos automatically by taking photos as you go. Forget about buying expensive editing software. With Windows 10, you have a free video editor built into the operating system where you can trim videos, create home movies, and even create automatic montages. You'll be surprised at what you can do without ever leaving the Windows 10 Photos app.

Some people say that windows video editor has a very simple interface and it only has very basic features. In this case, having something is more important than not having anything at all. Also, you should keep in mind that not everyone needs a fully-fledged [video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).
