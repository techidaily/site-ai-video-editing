##### Step2Change the Speed Or Duration of Your Clip

1) Now that your video is in the timeline, right-click it and select the custom "**Speed & duration**" button.

2) In the new window, change the speed value greater than **1**, just like you did in the case of Eizgif. You can also adjust the speed slider for better coverage.

3) After finishing, click "**Ok**" and preview your clip to see the fast video effect in-placed.

##### BONUS STEPEnable the Speed Ramping Effects

Speed ramp is a unique feature in Filmora which allows you to apply acceleration or deceleration at any point in your clip, creating unique effects. To use these settings, you need to:

1) Select your timeline video and choose the "**Speed**" button on the bottom bar. After that, click on "**Speed Ramping**."

2) You can now apply multiple speed ramping effects based on your preference. Select it (for example, flash-out effect), and it will be used for your whole video.

##### Step3Export the Final Speed-Up Video

1) After changing the video speed in Filmora, save it on your desktop. For that, move to the top left corner and select "**File<Save Project**."

2) You can also use the "**Export**" option to move it to a local folder.

## Conclusion

This was our two cents on how you can speed up a video on Canva. In the end, speeding up a video is a great way to keep your audience engaged in video production. It lets you make your content short and precise or introduce dramatic effects. If you want to use such features in your videos, then Filmora is a great way to start. Not only do you get fast video effects, but you can also save them without any internet access. So, give it a try and see the difference yourself!
