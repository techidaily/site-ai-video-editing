## How to Use Kahoot! On Zoom

In the educational game Kahoot! participants respond to multiple-choice questions based on trivia. Each participant uses their own controller to answer questions in the online game. There are several question kinds to pick from, allowing for complete customization of the test. Each player needs their own controller for Kahoot! The game questions will be shown in the Zoom/Google Meet window, but the answers must be entered using the controller. With the Kahoot!! app for Zoom, presenters may use play and friendly rivalry to increase participant engagement. Users may organize knowledge- and feedback-gathering pulse checks with staff members, encourage original thought with word clouds, and empower participants' voices with surveys, open-ended questions, and other tools. Utilizing the brainstorm tool, organizations may crowdsource ideas and advance teamwork.

Engagement has emerged as a crucial component of successful learning, collaboration, and connection as the globe has increased the use of video communications in social and professional situations. Users may access, host, and play Kahoot!! games and educational information with other meeting participants using the Kahoot!! app for Zoom without ever leaving the Zoom Meeting or requiring a second device. Corporate executives may motivate their staff via speeches, meetings, and online activities. Meeting hosts will have immediate access to data and statistics from their Kahoot!! experience, allowing them to respond in real time to audience engagement with the material. Additionally, hosts may email the Kahoot!! games to all participants so they can practice and improve their scores, which will increase participant engagement and learning retention. Hosts can also distribute the Kahoot!! games as self-paced challenges with individuals who couldn't attend in person.
