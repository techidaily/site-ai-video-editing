There are a few apps that you can use to create Minecraft pixel art, for example:

### 1\. Scriptolab.com

In this small web application, you are able to transform your image or any photo of your choice into Minecraft pixel art and blocks.

It's very easy to use. All you have to do is go to the website and pic your image. Resize the image or picture to the desired size to correspond to the number of blocks in the game.

It also has an easy-to-contact platform to communicate with the website owner that can guide you through the steps if you are ever in doubt.

### 2\. Filmora

This is an application that you can download onto your PC or Mac for free. It is a powerful tool that does more than pixel art, but we will use it for such.

With Filmora, you can use a range of tools to create your Minecraft pixel art, like posterize effect to add a different gradient to the pixel art.

Or even an animation effect for your wallpapers.

![filmora box](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box-right-side.png)

### 3\. Pixel Art Builder

In this mobile app, you can create Minecraft pixel art from the palm of your hand.

You can draw on grids rather than in real pixels to help you be more precise with your art. It has a very easy-to-use interface, and it is completely free.

Many of its key features are, for example, exporting images, dynamic size adjustment of the ability to save in several different formats. Its tools range from the regular pencil to eraser, paint bucket, line and circle drawer, move/zoom function, color wheel, and eyedropper.

## Part 4: How to Make Pixel Art Minecraft In-game?

It is very easy to create pixel art Minecraft in-game. Of course, each artist's ability differs, and so does art as well, but to start out, you do not need much. You need, though, careful planning and knowing the exact scale of your art.

You can break the creation of pixel art in Minecraft into four different steps:

### 1\. Choose an image that you like

It is important that you reference the original work and can easily access it, as you might need to peek often while building your own art. The best thing to do is when you are starting to copy an image and work on it, rather than start it from scratch, as it takes an enormous amount of time and you need to be an expert to do it.

### 2\. Break the image down into single-color sections

This is the part where "careful planning" comes in. You need to be looking at your original piece constantly to know if you are going in the right direction. Also, take all the colors and try to group them. Deconstructing the original image into colored shapes is a process that will help you outline the shape and color of the original design.

### 3\. Obtain the necessary resources

You can start this step by opening Minecraft and start collecting blocks that you think will be useful for your pixel art. It does not matter if you play in Survival, Hardcore, or Adventure mode. The process is the same. It is ideal, though, that you work on creative mode when making pixel art, as the game gives you unlimited resources. You are also able to fly in this mode, making it easier to pick up blocks, and there is no risk of your art being destroyed.

### 4\. Start building

Now you can start building your masterpiece. Start with the foundation and build from there; although you can virtually start anywhere, these blocks can float, unlike art or buildings outside the game. The time the process takes depends on the amount of work that needs to be done and the piece's complexity.

## Part 5: Tips for Creating a Wonderful Minecraft Pixel Art

There are many ways to draw Minecraft pixel art, but here are some tips to help you out.

* Have a clear idea of what kind of art you want to do. And start with something pre-made if you are only starting out. It is extremely hard to start something from scratch.
* Plan the pixel art you are going to do. Gather around all the block materials and colors that you'll need to make your pixel art.
* Use creative mode. Because with the creative mode, you are not limited to the number of blocks you can find, and also, no one can come and destroy your art.
* If it is easier, you can first draft your pixel art on another app to help you map out your own project.

### Conclusion

Minecraft pixel art is a growing trend in the video games world. It can range from easy and accessible to beginners to extremely complicated pieces of art. Players are becoming more engaged with this type of art in-game, and the future only predicts a bigger expansion. There are several tools that you can use to start out in your pixel art, as well as many tutorials.

### 3\. Pixel Art Builder

In this mobile app, you can create Minecraft pixel art from the palm of your hand.

You can draw on grids rather than in real pixels to help you be more precise with your art. It has a very easy-to-use interface, and it is completely free.

Many of its key features are, for example, exporting images, dynamic size adjustment of the ability to save in several different formats. Its tools range from the regular pencil to eraser, paint bucket, line and circle drawer, move/zoom function, color wheel, and eyedropper.

## Part 4: How to Make Pixel Art Minecraft In-game?

It is very easy to create pixel art Minecraft in-game. Of course, each artist's ability differs, and so does art as well, but to start out, you do not need much. You need, though, careful planning and knowing the exact scale of your art.

You can break the creation of pixel art in Minecraft into four different steps:

### 1\. Choose an image that you like

It is important that you reference the original work and can easily access it, as you might need to peek often while building your own art. The best thing to do is when you are starting to copy an image and work on it, rather than start it from scratch, as it takes an enormous amount of time and you need to be an expert to do it.

### 2\. Break the image down into single-color sections

This is the part where "careful planning" comes in. You need to be looking at your original piece constantly to know if you are going in the right direction. Also, take all the colors and try to group them. Deconstructing the original image into colored shapes is a process that will help you outline the shape and color of the original design.

### 3\. Obtain the necessary resources

You can start this step by opening Minecraft and start collecting blocks that you think will be useful for your pixel art. It does not matter if you play in Survival, Hardcore, or Adventure mode. The process is the same. It is ideal, though, that you work on creative mode when making pixel art, as the game gives you unlimited resources. You are also able to fly in this mode, making it easier to pick up blocks, and there is no risk of your art being destroyed.

### 4\. Start building

Now you can start building your masterpiece. Start with the foundation and build from there; although you can virtually start anywhere, these blocks can float, unlike art or buildings outside the game. The time the process takes depends on the amount of work that needs to be done and the piece's complexity.

## Part 5: Tips for Creating a Wonderful Minecraft Pixel Art

There are many ways to draw Minecraft pixel art, but here are some tips to help you out.

* Have a clear idea of what kind of art you want to do. And start with something pre-made if you are only starting out. It is extremely hard to start something from scratch.
* Plan the pixel art you are going to do. Gather around all the block materials and colors that you'll need to make your pixel art.
* Use creative mode. Because with the creative mode, you are not limited to the number of blocks you can find, and also, no one can come and destroy your art.
* If it is easier, you can first draft your pixel art on another app to help you map out your own project.

### Conclusion

Minecraft pixel art is a growing trend in the video games world. It can range from easy and accessible to beginners to extremely complicated pieces of art. Players are becoming more engaged with this type of art in-game, and the future only predicts a bigger expansion. There are several tools that you can use to start out in your pixel art, as well as many tutorials.
