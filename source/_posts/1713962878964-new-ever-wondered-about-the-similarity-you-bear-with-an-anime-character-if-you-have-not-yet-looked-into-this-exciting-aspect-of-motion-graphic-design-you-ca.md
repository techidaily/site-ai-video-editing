**●** It can be concluded that Canva is a fantastic graphic designing tool for all the non-professionals and newcomers in the field of design. It helps people create attractive and creative designs with less effort and less time consumption.

**●** No doubt, everything has its pros and cons. Similarly, Canva also has certain limitations compared to the other professional graphic designing tools like Photoshop, Illustrator, etc.

**●** But still, it is continuously updating and removing those limitations. For example- the new **color match tool** is introduced to this platform for easy and convenient graphic designing.

**●** This **color match tool** (eyedropper tool) was demanded by the designers who use Canva for their graphics and creating attractive social media posts, infographics, video editing, etc.
