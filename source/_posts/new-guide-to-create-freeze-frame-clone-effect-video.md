## Tips for Editing Your Music Videos

Now that you have the ideal editing tool to take your videos from drab to fab, here are a few tips to help you along the way.

* Ensure you set the output file to the appropriate resolution to avoid lowering the quality of the video you edit.
* Resist the temptation to insert the artsy shots before you lay a basic framework. It would be wise to focus on the musician's performance before you insert shots of the beautiful scenery.
* As you edit, it would help to create a storyline that matches the lyrics. You could create a simple story or a complex one.
* Since your computer might struggle to process numerous 4k videos, it would help to create proxy files as early as possible so you can save your progress along the way.
* During filming, create and collect your favorite b-roll shots. These clips provide extra information or context to anyone watching your music video.
* Ensure you match the video to the beat and look out for areas where the performer sings along. We guarantee your fans will notice the slightest delay between the song and the performer in the video.
* Once the music video looks polished and synchronized, you can adjust brightness, contrast, and exposure and change the white balance.
* Lastly, you could begin or end the video with the artists' credits, such as their names or logo. Since it is a relevant piece of information, ensure this segment of the video grabs the viewers' attention.

## Conclusion

If you want your song to go viral, you ought to put in the work and make the video as good as the soundtrack. Nothing is as bad as a good song with a poorly executed video. Your fans will definitely criticize you for it, making the ratings go down.

Fortunately, the guidelines in this article will set you on the right path and help you make a polished-looking music video in no time.
