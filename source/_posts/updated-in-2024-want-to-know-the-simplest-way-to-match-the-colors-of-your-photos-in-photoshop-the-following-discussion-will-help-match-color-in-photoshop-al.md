## Part 1 What Scene is Photoshop's Color Matching Generally Used For?

You can **match color in Photoshop** in just a few simple steps. And as far as the question of what scene can be used for it, you can use any and every photo you want to match the colour for. And the following steps will be noting how you can adjust the color of an image in Photoshop.

**Step** Open both the images, the one you want to alter and the one you want to change it with. And if it is just one image, open and select that one image.

**Step** Choose the "Image" and then select the "Adjustment" option. And after you choose the "Adjustment" option, go to the "Match Colour" option. You will be noticing the target photo that you have opted for.

**Step** You will find the "Image Statistics" portion in the dialogue portion. Opt for the "Source" list and select the image name consisting of the shades and hues you would want your image to be altered. You will notice a thumbnail appearing in the dialogue as you do so. And you will automatically see the colours of the photo have changed.

**Step** Now use the "Preview" feature to see the **photoshop match colour tone**, and then you will be done with adjusting the colour!

## Part 2 How to perfectly match colors in Photoshop when combining photos

Now, we will be discussing the different steps that will help you **match color from photo** in Photoshop, with absolute precision and effortlessness. Here is the list of steps that you would need to follow to **match skin tone in Photoshop** most perfectly.

**Step 1 Duplicate the background of the original photo**

The first and the most essential step to **match lighting photoshop** or the colour or any other editing task is to duplicate the background of the original image. The reason for this is that without this step, we might lose out on the original background information, which is essential for the image.

And to duplicate the background of an image in Photoshop, you need to use a few shortcuts of your keyboard. If you are using a Windows device, then the shortcut for this will be "Ctrl+J", and if you are using Mac, then the shortcut will be " Command+J".

![photoshop duplicate layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-1.jpg)

**Step 2 Select the Image whose colour you want to change.**

Photoshop has several selection tools. Choose one of the many selection tools. You might choose the "Pen Tool" or the "Lasso Tool" or anything else. Select the image with the tool by drawing along the image with the tool. And when you are done with tracing the image with the selection tool of your choice, you will see a border marching around the image.

![selection tool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-2.jpg)

**Step 3 Select the area of the second image**

You will need the selection tool again. The second image is the one that consists of the colour you would want the original image to match with. So, use the selection tool again to trace out an area in the second picture with the colour you want.

Ensure that you trace out a substantial area with the colour you need. You need not be highly precise with selecting the area. Instead, focus on covering a large area so that you can cover up the different shades and hues of the colour.

![select purple](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-3.jpg)

**Step 4 Move back to the original picture**

We will proceed with the "Colour Match" feature in Photoshop, but before that, you must make sure that you have the original image selected. The technical term to use here is "Focus". So, ensure that the original image is in focus.

You can bring the original image into "focus" by clicking anywhere inside the document's window where the original image is present. And that will automatically bring back the focus to the original image.

**Step 5 Bring the "Colour Match" command into function**

After selecting the original image, reach out to the "Image" option and click on the "Adjustments" option. You will find the "Match Colour" option; click on it.

There are two sections of the "Color Match" option. One is the "Image Statistics" portion, and the other is the "Destination Image". The "destination Image" portion consists of the name of the original image and a few image settings as well. The options include "luminescence", "color intensity", "fade", and "neutralize".

**Step 6 Head to the "Image Statistics" portion**

The "Image Statistics" portion consists of the "Source" option. It is present in the bottom down part of the "Image Statistics" box. It is a drop-down box, and you will have to click on it. Tap on the small downward arrow beside the "Source" option and then choose the second image where you traced out the area of the colour you would want your original image to have.

![match color source](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-5.jpg)

Your image might have more than one layer, and if so, you will have to opt for the correct layer from the "Layer" option of Photoshop.

**Step 7 Select the correct options in the "Image Statistics" area**

In the "Image Statistics" portion, you will find some options, such as "Use Selection in Source to Calculate Colours" and "Use Selection In Target To Calculate Adjustment". You will have to click on this option and agree to them. It will instruct Photoshop to follow these instructions and colour match photos accordingly.

![match color](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-6.jpg)

Click on "OK" after doing the changes mentioned above and exit the dialogue box to proceed with the next step.

**Step 8 Add "Adjustment Layer"**

Go to the "Layers" option and then opt for the "Layers Palette" present at the bottom. Then select "New Adjustment Layer" and click on the "Levels" option.

![choose levels](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-7.jpg)

**Step 9 Adjust the Pointers**

You will find two pointers, one black and the other white. You will have to bring both the pointers to the centre of the line.

Then click on "OK" and exit the box to proceed with the next step.

![level adjustment layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-8.jpg)

**Step 10 Select "Luminosity"**

You will find the "Blend Mode" in the "Layers palette". Select the "Blend Mode" from there. You will find it reflecting "Normal", which is the default setting. You need to click on the small drop-down arrow and change the option from "Normal" to "Luminosity".

![luminosity blend mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-9.jpg)

Now, use the keyboard shortcut "Ctrl+D" if you are using windows and "Command+D" working on a Mac device. And this completes the entire process of colour matching in photoshop.

## Part 1 What Scene is Photoshop's Color Matching Generally Used For?

You can **match color in Photoshop** in just a few simple steps. And as far as the question of what scene can be used for it, you can use any and every photo you want to match the colour for. And the following steps will be noting how you can adjust the color of an image in Photoshop.

**Step** Open both the images, the one you want to alter and the one you want to change it with. And if it is just one image, open and select that one image.

**Step** Choose the "Image" and then select the "Adjustment" option. And after you choose the "Adjustment" option, go to the "Match Colour" option. You will be noticing the target photo that you have opted for.

**Step** You will find the "Image Statistics" portion in the dialogue portion. Opt for the "Source" list and select the image name consisting of the shades and hues you would want your image to be altered. You will notice a thumbnail appearing in the dialogue as you do so. And you will automatically see the colours of the photo have changed.

**Step** Now use the "Preview" feature to see the **photoshop match colour tone**, and then you will be done with adjusting the colour!

## Part 2 How to perfectly match colors in Photoshop when combining photos

Now, we will be discussing the different steps that will help you **match color from photo** in Photoshop, with absolute precision and effortlessness. Here is the list of steps that you would need to follow to **match skin tone in Photoshop** most perfectly.

**Step 1 Duplicate the background of the original photo**

The first and the most essential step to **match lighting photoshop** or the colour or any other editing task is to duplicate the background of the original image. The reason for this is that without this step, we might lose out on the original background information, which is essential for the image.

And to duplicate the background of an image in Photoshop, you need to use a few shortcuts of your keyboard. If you are using a Windows device, then the shortcut for this will be "Ctrl+J", and if you are using Mac, then the shortcut will be " Command+J".

![photoshop duplicate layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-1.jpg)

**Step 2 Select the Image whose colour you want to change.**

Photoshop has several selection tools. Choose one of the many selection tools. You might choose the "Pen Tool" or the "Lasso Tool" or anything else. Select the image with the tool by drawing along the image with the tool. And when you are done with tracing the image with the selection tool of your choice, you will see a border marching around the image.

![selection tool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-2.jpg)

**Step 3 Select the area of the second image**

You will need the selection tool again. The second image is the one that consists of the colour you would want the original image to match with. So, use the selection tool again to trace out an area in the second picture with the colour you want.

Ensure that you trace out a substantial area with the colour you need. You need not be highly precise with selecting the area. Instead, focus on covering a large area so that you can cover up the different shades and hues of the colour.

![select purple](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-3.jpg)

**Step 4 Move back to the original picture**

We will proceed with the "Colour Match" feature in Photoshop, but before that, you must make sure that you have the original image selected. The technical term to use here is "Focus". So, ensure that the original image is in focus.

You can bring the original image into "focus" by clicking anywhere inside the document's window where the original image is present. And that will automatically bring back the focus to the original image.

**Step 5 Bring the "Colour Match" command into function**

After selecting the original image, reach out to the "Image" option and click on the "Adjustments" option. You will find the "Match Colour" option; click on it.

There are two sections of the "Color Match" option. One is the "Image Statistics" portion, and the other is the "Destination Image". The "destination Image" portion consists of the name of the original image and a few image settings as well. The options include "luminescence", "color intensity", "fade", and "neutralize".

**Step 6 Head to the "Image Statistics" portion**

The "Image Statistics" portion consists of the "Source" option. It is present in the bottom down part of the "Image Statistics" box. It is a drop-down box, and you will have to click on it. Tap on the small downward arrow beside the "Source" option and then choose the second image where you traced out the area of the colour you would want your original image to have.

![match color source](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-5.jpg)

Your image might have more than one layer, and if so, you will have to opt for the correct layer from the "Layer" option of Photoshop.

**Step 7 Select the correct options in the "Image Statistics" area**

In the "Image Statistics" portion, you will find some options, such as "Use Selection in Source to Calculate Colours" and "Use Selection In Target To Calculate Adjustment". You will have to click on this option and agree to them. It will instruct Photoshop to follow these instructions and colour match photos accordingly.

![match color](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-6.jpg)

Click on "OK" after doing the changes mentioned above and exit the dialogue box to proceed with the next step.

**Step 8 Add "Adjustment Layer"**

Go to the "Layers" option and then opt for the "Layers Palette" present at the bottom. Then select "New Adjustment Layer" and click on the "Levels" option.

![choose levels](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-7.jpg)

**Step 9 Adjust the Pointers**

You will find two pointers, one black and the other white. You will have to bring both the pointers to the centre of the line.

Then click on "OK" and exit the box to proceed with the next step.

![level adjustment layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-8.jpg)

**Step 10 Select "Luminosity"**

You will find the "Blend Mode" in the "Layers palette". Select the "Blend Mode" from there. You will find it reflecting "Normal", which is the default setting. You need to click on the small drop-down arrow and change the option from "Normal" to "Luminosity".

![luminosity blend mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-9.jpg)

## **Part 1\.** **Unlocking Color Precision: Exploring the Improved Scopes in [DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve)**

The Blackmagic Design continues to improve the Resolve to make it better with every iteration. The new features improve colorist workflow in less powerful ways. The major improvements include a major facelift to the scope, allowing professions to do more with DaVinci resolve. Let’s have a look at some of these changes:

### **1\. CIE 1931 Color Space**

The inclusion of the CIE chromaticity diagram is perhaps the biggest change to DaVinci scopes. It displays the gamut of the project as set in the Color Management preferences. This makes it a useful alternate way of looking at the trace of an image to judge when the values are out of legal range. It also functions as an educational tool for learning about the range of color spaces.

![cie 1931 color space](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/mastering-davinci-resolve-scopes-a-comprehensive-guide-1.JPG)

### **2\. Low Pass Filter**

The wavefront and parade scopes now have a low pass filter, which reduces noise in the trace. This visually sharpens the display of the scopes, allowing easier detection of elements in the frame.

![low pass filter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/mastering-davinci-resolve-scopes-a-comprehensive-guide-2.JPG)

The image above shows the major improvements. The second set of waveforms has more defined lines. These have the low-pass filter activated, which makes the scopes easier to read.

### **3\. High, Mid, and Low Views in Vectorscope**

The vectorscope has been added to the ability to toggle the mid-tones, shadows, and highlights of the image independently. You can set the ranges with greater visualization control.

![high, mid, and low views in vectorscope](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/mastering-davinci-resolve-scopes-a-comprehensive-guide-3.JPG)

As seen in the picture above, the vectorscope controls allow you to select the low, mid, or high range of the image. You can also set the low and high ranges as desired.

### **4\. Histograms Over Curves**

Another great DaVinci scope is the histogram, which now appears outside of the scope panel. The new improvements have embedded the histogram inside the Curves tab on the bottom Palette. Click on the three dots in the Custom Curves tab. The pulldown menu that appears includes the Input or Output of the histogram. With these settings, you can find the element in the frame that helps you make adjustments quickly.

![histograms over curves](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/mastering-davinci-resolve-scopes-a-comprehensive-guide-4.JPG)

### **5\. Scope Quality**

The GPU-accelerated scopes engine allows the scopes to respond quickly. Users have the option to set the quality to high, medium, or low and the scopes will respond to a range of hardware systems. Depending on whether you are working on a stationary short or looking to see how the scopes react in real-time, you will be able to toggle the modes quickly and easily.

![scope quality](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/mastering-davinci-resolve-scopes-a-comprehensive-guide-5.jpg)

### **6\. YRGB View in Histogram and Parade**

The histogram and parade now come with the ability to view luminance together with the red, green, and blue channels. Users also have the option for YCbCr mode in the Parade.

![yrgb view in histogram and parade](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/mastering-davinci-resolve-scopes-a-comprehensive-guide-6.jpg)

### **7\. Extents**

These are weak elements in the signore, which are of lesser importance compared to the stronger elements. However, Danvici now allows them to be revealed for a full illustration of the information that lies in the image. Consequently, extents can be used to determine whether the data is being clipped beyond legal limits.

![extent](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/mastering-davinci-resolve-scopes-a-comprehensive-guide-7.jpg)

## **Part 2\. Mastering Scopes in DaVinci Resolve: A Brief Guide**

DaVinci scopes help you to analyze images as a basis for color correction. When used properly, scopes help in fixing white balance issues and checking saturation. They also allow you to get the correct exposure and check details like skin tone. To use scopes in DaVinci Resolve, go to the color page in the bottom right corner. You can also click on the small graph icon to view the scope. Here is how to use them:

* [Waveform](#davinci1)
* [Parade (RGB)](#davinci2)
* [Vectorscope](#davinci3)
* [Histogram](#davinci4)

### **1\. Waveform**

The Waveform represents the brightness or luminance of your image. In this video scope, the brightest parts are at the top while the darkest are at the bottom. The pixels are represented from left to right.

![waveform](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/mastering-davinci-resolve-scopes-a-comprehensive-guide-8.JPG)

The Waveform scope on DaVinci Resolve is helpful when you are checking for clipping. This simply means finding out whether the image is too bright or too dark. The waveform also ensures that the image is properly exposed. The colorize feature of the waveform shows the colors of the image while the extent shows the darkest or lightest parts of the image.

### **2\. Parade (RGB)**

The RGB Parade comprises 3 waveforms that represent the luminance of red, green, and blue channels. The approach for reading the parade video scope is similar to that of the waveform. However, you now look at the balance between the colors correct the white balance, and check for a color cast.

![parade](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/mastering-davinci-resolve-scopes-a-comprehensive-guide-9.JPG)

The Parade works almost in a similar manner as the waveform. It displays the red, green, and blue channels of the image as separate waveforms. This way, you can easily identify and correct color casts while ensuring the colors in the image are balanced. The video scope provides useful information to decide which parts of the image need to be corrected or tweaked further.

### **3\. Vectorscope**

Vectorscope in DaVinci Resolve shows hue and saturation on a circular graph. Hues (the colors) are indicated outside of the color wheel for easier color correction. Saturation is indicated by how far the graph extends from the center.

![vectorscope](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/mastering-davinci-resolve-scopes-a-comprehensive-guide-10.JPG)

By displaying the hue and saturation of the image as a vector, this video scope helps check skin tones. The scope specifically checks whether skin tones are shifted toward colors such as yellow, magenta, or green. It allows you to make sure that the colors in your subject skin tones are not too saturated or desaturated.

### **4\. Histogram**

Histogram is a video scope in DaVinci Resolve that displays the brightness or luminance of an image from left to right for the RGB channel. The video scope is based on the number of pixels that the colors red, blue, and green have in an image.

![histogram](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/mastering-davinci-resolve-scopes-a-comprehensive-guide-11.JPG)

Using the histogram video scope on DaVinci Resolve allows you to check for overexposure or underexposure in your image. You can also ensure that the image has a good overall brightness range. The scope provides a graphical representation of tonal distribution in each channel. This way, you can evaluate the tone in detail for more accurate brightness and contrast adjustments.

## **Part 3:** **Edit Like a Pro: Mastering Video Scopes in [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**
