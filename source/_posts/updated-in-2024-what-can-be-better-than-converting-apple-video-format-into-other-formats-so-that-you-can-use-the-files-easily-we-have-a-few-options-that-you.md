You can **match color in Photoshop** in just a few simple steps. And as far as the question of what scene can be used for it, you can use any and every photo you want to match the colour for. And the following steps will be noting how you can adjust the color of an image in Photoshop.

**Step** Open both the images, the one you want to alter and the one you want to change it with. And if it is just one image, open and select that one image.

**Step** Choose the "Image" and then select the "Adjustment" option. And after you choose the "Adjustment" option, go to the "Match Colour" option. You will be noticing the target photo that you have opted for.

**Step** You will find the "Image Statistics" portion in the dialogue portion. Opt for the "Source" list and select the image name consisting of the shades and hues you would want your image to be altered. You will notice a thumbnail appearing in the dialogue as you do so. And you will automatically see the colours of the photo have changed.

**Step** Now use the "Preview" feature to see the **photoshop match colour tone**, and then you will be done with adjusting the colour!

## Part 2 How to perfectly match colors in Photoshop when combining photos

Now, we will be discussing the different steps that will help you **match color from photo** in Photoshop, with absolute precision and effortlessness. Here is the list of steps that you would need to follow to **match skin tone in Photoshop** most perfectly.

**Step 1 Duplicate the background of the original photo**

The first and the most essential step to **match lighting photoshop** or the colour or any other editing task is to duplicate the background of the original image. The reason for this is that without this step, we might lose out on the original background information, which is essential for the image.

And to duplicate the background of an image in Photoshop, you need to use a few shortcuts of your keyboard. If you are using a Windows device, then the shortcut for this will be "Ctrl+J", and if you are using Mac, then the shortcut will be " Command+J".

![photoshop duplicate layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-1.jpg)

**Step 2 Select the Image whose colour you want to change.**

Photoshop has several selection tools. Choose one of the many selection tools. You might choose the "Pen Tool" or the "Lasso Tool" or anything else. Select the image with the tool by drawing along the image with the tool. And when you are done with tracing the image with the selection tool of your choice, you will see a border marching around the image.

![selection tool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-2.jpg)

**Step 3 Select the area of the second image**

You will need the selection tool again. The second image is the one that consists of the colour you would want the original image to match with. So, use the selection tool again to trace out an area in the second picture with the colour you want.

Ensure that you trace out a substantial area with the colour you need. You need not be highly precise with selecting the area. Instead, focus on covering a large area so that you can cover up the different shades and hues of the colour.

![select purple](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-3.jpg)

**Step 4 Move back to the original picture**

We will proceed with the "Colour Match" feature in Photoshop, but before that, you must make sure that you have the original image selected. The technical term to use here is "Focus". So, ensure that the original image is in focus.

You can bring the original image into "focus" by clicking anywhere inside the document's window where the original image is present. And that will automatically bring back the focus to the original image.

**Step 5 Bring the "Colour Match" command into function**

After selecting the original image, reach out to the "Image" option and click on the "Adjustments" option. You will find the "Match Colour" option; click on it.

There are two sections of the "Color Match" option. One is the "Image Statistics" portion, and the other is the "Destination Image". The "destination Image" portion consists of the name of the original image and a few image settings as well. The options include "luminescence", "color intensity", "fade", and "neutralize".

**Step 6 Head to the "Image Statistics" portion**

The "Image Statistics" portion consists of the "Source" option. It is present in the bottom down part of the "Image Statistics" box. It is a drop-down box, and you will have to click on it. Tap on the small downward arrow beside the "Source" option and then choose the second image where you traced out the area of the colour you would want your original image to have.

![match color source](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-5.jpg)

Your image might have more than one layer, and if so, you will have to opt for the correct layer from the "Layer" option of Photoshop.

**Step 7 Select the correct options in the "Image Statistics" area**

In the "Image Statistics" portion, you will find some options, such as "Use Selection in Source to Calculate Colours" and "Use Selection In Target To Calculate Adjustment". You will have to click on this option and agree to them. It will instruct Photoshop to follow these instructions and colour match photos accordingly.

![match color](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-6.jpg)

Click on "OK" after doing the changes mentioned above and exit the dialogue box to proceed with the next step.

**Step 8 Add "Adjustment Layer"**

Go to the "Layers" option and then opt for the "Layers Palette" present at the bottom. Then select "New Adjustment Layer" and click on the "Levels" option.

![choose levels](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-7.jpg)

**Step 9 Adjust the Pointers**

You will find two pointers, one black and the other white. You will have to bring both the pointers to the centre of the line.

Then click on "OK" and exit the box to proceed with the next step.

![level adjustment layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-8.jpg)

**Step 10 Select "Luminosity"**

You will find the "Blend Mode" in the "Layers palette". Select the "Blend Mode" from there. You will find it reflecting "Normal", which is the default setting. You need to click on the small drop-down arrow and change the option from "Normal" to "Luminosity".

![luminosity blend mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-9.jpg)

## Part 1 What Scene is Photoshop's Color Matching Generally Used For?

You can **match color in Photoshop** in just a few simple steps. And as far as the question of what scene can be used for it, you can use any and every photo you want to match the colour for. And the following steps will be noting how you can adjust the color of an image in Photoshop.

**Step** Open both the images, the one you want to alter and the one you want to change it with. And if it is just one image, open and select that one image.

**Step** Choose the "Image" and then select the "Adjustment" option. And after you choose the "Adjustment" option, go to the "Match Colour" option. You will be noticing the target photo that you have opted for.

**Step** You will find the "Image Statistics" portion in the dialogue portion. Opt for the "Source" list and select the image name consisting of the shades and hues you would want your image to be altered. You will notice a thumbnail appearing in the dialogue as you do so. And you will automatically see the colours of the photo have changed.

**Step** Now use the "Preview" feature to see the **photoshop match colour tone**, and then you will be done with adjusting the colour!

## Part 2 How to perfectly match colors in Photoshop when combining photos

Now, we will be discussing the different steps that will help you **match color from photo** in Photoshop, with absolute precision and effortlessness. Here is the list of steps that you would need to follow to **match skin tone in Photoshop** most perfectly.

**Step 1 Duplicate the background of the original photo**

The first and the most essential step to **match lighting photoshop** or the colour or any other editing task is to duplicate the background of the original image. The reason for this is that without this step, we might lose out on the original background information, which is essential for the image.

And to duplicate the background of an image in Photoshop, you need to use a few shortcuts of your keyboard. If you are using a Windows device, then the shortcut for this will be "Ctrl+J", and if you are using Mac, then the shortcut will be " Command+J".

![photoshop duplicate layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-1.jpg)

**Step 2 Select the Image whose colour you want to change.**

Photoshop has several selection tools. Choose one of the many selection tools. You might choose the "Pen Tool" or the "Lasso Tool" or anything else. Select the image with the tool by drawing along the image with the tool. And when you are done with tracing the image with the selection tool of your choice, you will see a border marching around the image.

![selection tool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-2.jpg)

**Step 3 Select the area of the second image**

You will need the selection tool again. The second image is the one that consists of the colour you would want the original image to match with. So, use the selection tool again to trace out an area in the second picture with the colour you want.

Ensure that you trace out a substantial area with the colour you need. You need not be highly precise with selecting the area. Instead, focus on covering a large area so that you can cover up the different shades and hues of the colour.

![select purple](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-3.jpg)

**Step 4 Move back to the original picture**

We will proceed with the "Colour Match" feature in Photoshop, but before that, you must make sure that you have the original image selected. The technical term to use here is "Focus". So, ensure that the original image is in focus.

You can bring the original image into "focus" by clicking anywhere inside the document's window where the original image is present. And that will automatically bring back the focus to the original image.

**Step 5 Bring the "Colour Match" command into function**

After selecting the original image, reach out to the "Image" option and click on the "Adjustments" option. You will find the "Match Colour" option; click on it.

There are two sections of the "Color Match" option. One is the "Image Statistics" portion, and the other is the "Destination Image". The "destination Image" portion consists of the name of the original image and a few image settings as well. The options include "luminescence", "color intensity", "fade", and "neutralize".

**Step 6 Head to the "Image Statistics" portion**

The "Image Statistics" portion consists of the "Source" option. It is present in the bottom down part of the "Image Statistics" box. It is a drop-down box, and you will have to click on it. Tap on the small downward arrow beside the "Source" option and then choose the second image where you traced out the area of the colour you would want your original image to have.

![match color source](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-5.jpg)

Your image might have more than one layer, and if so, you will have to opt for the correct layer from the "Layer" option of Photoshop.

**Step 7 Select the correct options in the "Image Statistics" area**

In the "Image Statistics" portion, you will find some options, such as "Use Selection in Source to Calculate Colours" and "Use Selection In Target To Calculate Adjustment". You will have to click on this option and agree to them. It will instruct Photoshop to follow these instructions and colour match photos accordingly.

![match color](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-6.jpg)

Click on "OK" after doing the changes mentioned above and exit the dialogue box to proceed with the next step.

**Step 8 Add "Adjustment Layer"**

Go to the "Layers" option and then opt for the "Layers Palette" present at the bottom. Then select "New Adjustment Layer" and click on the "Levels" option.

![choose levels](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-7.jpg)

**Step 9 Adjust the Pointers**

You will find two pointers, one black and the other white. You will have to bring both the pointers to the centre of the line.

Then click on "OK" and exit the box to proceed with the next step.

![level adjustment layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/fast-and-easy-method-to-match-color-in-photoshop-8.jpg)

**●** At the end: Using a freeze-frame allows the audience to choose or decide how the movie ends, whether it is obvious. The 'breakfast club' filmmakers use a freeze-frame at the end to emphasize the young boy.

![install the software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-a-freeze-frame-squence-effect-1.gif)

## Adding the footage

Next, your main step is to add the video you will edit into the Filmora software. First, you must click the Create New Project tab on the homepage. When the editor opens, tap on the "Click here to import media" button and insert the video you will edit from your device. Next, drag it down to the editing timeline for making further changes. Choose the Keep project settings option when the prompt comes up to ensure the same quality of the video.

![insert the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-a-freeze-frame-squence-effect-2.gif)

Still, it would help if you tapped the play button on the screen to see a Preview of the video clip to check its stability and quality. Also, ensure that your main subject is darker than the backdrop in the video clip.

## Adjust the playhead location

On the video clip, you added to the editing timeline, click on the playhead. Then, drag it to move it to the specific point in the video where you will freeze the frame. Click on the Snapshot icon at the right end of the preview window to capture the frame. Press the Lock Track icon after that.

![click the snapshot icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-a-freeze-frame-squence-effect-3.gif)

## Move the image in place

After the previously mentioned step, you should drag the snapshot you just captured to the second layer on the timeline above the clip. Make sure to place the image where the playhead is, marking the point of the freeze frame. Then, drag the slider at the end of the image clip you added to the timeline to match its length with the video clip.

Afterward, you should click on the playhead and move it a little ahead by a few frames. Again, tap the "Lock Track" icon beside the image file to keep it in place. Following that, take another snapshot of the image via the Snapshot icon.

![tap the lock track icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-a-freeze-frame-squence-effect-4.gif)

## Unlock the layers

Repeat this step for a few more layers, like dragging the snapshot image to the timeline > moving the playhead by some frames > Snapshot > Lock Track. Then, after you are done with the number of stages possible with your video clip, unlock all of the locked track layers sequentially from top to bottom.

## Editing the layers

After this, click on the second clip in the layers. Right-click on the top of the clip in the timeline and choose "Edit Properties" from the drop-down menu. Next, click on the Compositing option and tap the tickmark beside it. Then, select the drop-down menu for the Blending Mode option and change Normal to Darken. Press the OK button after you are done.

![change normal to darken](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-a-freeze-frame-squence-effect-5.gif)

## Exporting the effect the first time

After completing all the editing steps, you should select the Export button at the top of the screen. Then, choose the Local tab and click on the MP4 as the video file format. Make settings-based changes if needed and press the Export button.

![press the export button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-a-freeze-frame-squence-effect-6.gif)

## Edit the freeze frame video clip

Choose all of the video clip sections you edited on Filmora from the timeline after adding the recently edited video clip to the editor. Then, drag this clip to the primary editing timeline layer on the timeline and drop it.

Then, drag the playhead on the clip to the frame at which the third freeze frame occurs. For this, you can play the Preview of the clip to verify. After placing the playhead at that exact moment, click on the Split icon from the toolbar above the editor timeline or the Scissor icon. Then, remove the second half of the clip.

## Create the freeze frame to reverse the speed effect

After this, right-click on the top of the remaining video clip on your timeline. From the drop-down menu that appears, tap on the Copy option. Then, paste the second half beside the first half on the same layer.

After that, right-click on the second copied clip and choose the Speed option > Click on Reverse. After that, play the Preview to see how the effect appears in your video. Finally, export the video from Filmora.

## Conclusion

The process of creating a freeze-frame effect can typically get complex. But it is relatively simple to achieve on Filmora if you follow the steps diligently. Furthermore, on this software, whether you are using a Windows or Mac device, there are various video editing features, including the freeze-frame effect. They all assure quick and advanced optimization of video projects, so you should try the platform.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

To install the software, you have to double-click on the app installer that got downloaded and agree to the permissions that it prompts. Then, the installation process will continue. The software will launch automatically after the process ends and you press Start Now.

![install the software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-a-freeze-frame-squence-effect-1.gif)

## Adding the footage

Next, your main step is to add the video you will edit into the Filmora software. First, you must click the Create New Project tab on the homepage. When the editor opens, tap on the "Click here to import media" button and insert the video you will edit from your device. Next, drag it down to the editing timeline for making further changes. Choose the Keep project settings option when the prompt comes up to ensure the same quality of the video.

![insert the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-a-freeze-frame-squence-effect-2.gif)

Still, it would help if you tapped the play button on the screen to see a Preview of the video clip to check its stability and quality. Also, ensure that your main subject is darker than the backdrop in the video clip.

## Adjust the playhead location

On the video clip, you added to the editing timeline, click on the playhead. Then, drag it to move it to the specific point in the video where you will freeze the frame. Click on the Snapshot icon at the right end of the preview window to capture the frame. Press the Lock Track icon after that.

![click the snapshot icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-a-freeze-frame-squence-effect-3.gif)

## Move the image in place

After the previously mentioned step, you should drag the snapshot you just captured to the second layer on the timeline above the clip. Make sure to place the image where the playhead is, marking the point of the freeze frame. Then, drag the slider at the end of the image clip you added to the timeline to match its length with the video clip.

Afterward, you should click on the playhead and move it a little ahead by a few frames. Again, tap the "Lock Track" icon beside the image file to keep it in place. Following that, take another snapshot of the image via the Snapshot icon.

![tap the lock track icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-a-freeze-frame-squence-effect-4.gif)

## Unlock the layers

Repeat this step for a few more layers, like dragging the snapshot image to the timeline > moving the playhead by some frames > Snapshot > Lock Track. Then, after you are done with the number of stages possible with your video clip, unlock all of the locked track layers sequentially from top to bottom.

## Editing the layers

After this, click on the second clip in the layers. Right-click on the top of the clip in the timeline and choose "Edit Properties" from the drop-down menu. Next, click on the Compositing option and tap the tickmark beside it. Then, select the drop-down menu for the Blending Mode option and change Normal to Darken. Press the OK button after you are done.

![change normal to darken](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-a-freeze-frame-squence-effect-5.gif)

Following that, repeat the same for all of the layers of the snapshots to choose the blending mode parameter for them to Darken. After you are done, click on the Preview play button to see how the process worked for creating the freeze frame effect in your video clip.

## Exporting the effect the first time

After completing all the editing steps, you should select the Export button at the top of the screen. Then, choose the Local tab and click on the MP4 as the video file format. Make settings-based changes if needed and press the Export button.

![press the export button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-a-freeze-frame-squence-effect-6.gif)

After that, however, import the edited file to Filmora from your device again.

## Edit the freeze frame video clip

Choose all of the video clip sections you edited on Filmora from the timeline after adding the recently edited video clip to the editor. Then, drag this clip to the primary editing timeline layer on the timeline and drop it.

Then, drag the playhead on the clip to the frame at which the third freeze frame occurs. For this, you can play the Preview of the clip to verify. After placing the playhead at that exact moment, click on the Split icon from the toolbar above the editor timeline or the Scissor icon. Then, remove the second half of the clip.

![drag the playhead and split](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-a-freeze-frame-squence-effect-7.gif)

## Create the freeze frame to reverse the speed effect

After this, right-click on the top of the remaining video clip on your timeline. From the drop-down menu that appears, tap on the Copy option. Then, paste the second half beside the first half on the same layer.

After that, right-click on the second copied clip and choose the Speed option > Click on Reverse. After that, play the Preview to see how the effect appears in your video. Finally, export the video from Filmora.

![play the preview](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-a-freeze-frame-squence-effect-8.gif)
