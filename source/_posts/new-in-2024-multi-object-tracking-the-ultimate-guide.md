## Multi Object Tracking: The Ultimate Guide

**Multi Object Tracking (MOT)** in a video is a challenging process with many applications in both the public and private sectors. Surveillance cameras in public places can track potential criminals, while retail stores can use object tracking to monitor customer behavior.

Developed in 1988 by Zenon Pylyshyn, MOT is a technique first designed to study the human visual system's ability to track multiple moving objects. However, since then, various methods have been introduced for Object Tracking through computer vision.

In this article, we will explore **Multi Object Tracking** and provide a detailed guide on object tracking and the requirement to track multiple objects.

## Part 1\. What Is Object Tracking

Object Tracking is an application of computer vision that involves tracking the movement of objects in real-time. It is a useful tool for many different purposes, such as video surveillance, human-computer interaction, and automotive safety.

The Object Tracking algorithm is a deep-learning-based program that works by developing a model for each individual object and creating a set of trajectories to represent their movement. This is done through an indication, such as a square that follows the object and tells the users about its location on the screen in real-time.

Its algorithms are designed to work with various types of inputs, including everything from images and videos to real-time footage. The input you expect to use will impact the category, use cases, and object tracking applications.

## Part 2\. Types Of Object Tracking

There are two main types or levels of Object Tracking: SOT and MOT

### SOT

Single Object Tracking or Visual Object Tracking is a process in which the bounding box of the target object is assigned to the tracker in the first frame. The tracker then detects the same object in all the other frames.

SOT only detects and tracks a single object and comes under the category of detection-free tracking, which implies that it is manually initialized with a fixed number of objects, even though other objects are present in the frames.

Let's understand it with an example: A police department is resolving a murder case that involves a car on the highway. They received surveillance camera footage and wanted to track the vehicle to resolve the mystery. However, it might take time to do it manually. Therefore, they will use the Single Object Tracking process and will assign the tracker a bounding box for the target car to check what happens to it.

![single object tracking](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/single-object-tracking.png)

### MOT

Multiple Object Tracking involves tracking multiple objects in a frame. Since its development in 1988 by Zenon Pylyshyn, several experiments have been conducted to see how human and computer vision systems can detect and track multiple objects in a frame.

As an output, multiple tracking creates several bounding boxes and are identified using certain parameters such as coordinates, width, height, etc. MOT program is not pre-trained regarding the appearance or amount of objects to be tracked.

Moreover, the algorithm assigns a detection ID to each box which helps the model in identifying the objects within a class. For instance, if multiple cars are in a frame, the MOT algorithm will identify each car as a separate object and assign them a unique ID.

## Part 3\. What Multi Object Tracking Needs?

Above is the explaination of MOT. In this part, we will focus on its mechanism. Following are some of the most important requirements of Multi Object Tracking:

### 1\. Detection

The best approach to detect objects of your interest depends on what you're trying to track and if the camera is stationary or moving.

**MOT Using Stationary Camera**

The _vision.ForegroundDetector_ System object can be used to detect objects in motion against a stationary background by performing background subtraction. This approach is efficient but requires that the camera be stationary.

**MOT Using Moving Camera**

A sliding-window detection approach is often used with a moving camera to detect objects in motion. However, this approach is slower than the background subtraction method.

Use the following approaches for tracing the given categories of objects.

| Type of the Tracking Object                | Camera Position   | Approach                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

### 2\. Prediction

The second requirement for Multi Object Tracking is "Prediction." In this, you have to predict the position of the tracking object in the next frame. To do this, you can design the model to use the Kalman filter ([vision.KalmanFilter](https://www.mathworks.com/help/vision/ref/vision.kalmanfilter.html)).

This will help predict the next location of the object in the frames. For this, it will take into account the object's constant velocity, constant acceleration measurement noise, and process noise. Measurement noise is the detection of an error, while process noise is the variation in the object's actual motion from that of the motion model.

### 3\. Data Association

Data association is a critical step in Multiple Object Tracking and involves linking the data points together that represent the same thing across different frames.

A "track" is the temporal history of an object consisting of multiple detections and can include the entire history of past locations of the object or simply the object's last known location and current velocity.

## Part 4\. Approaches Of Object Tracking

After understanding what MOT needs, let’s learn about the theory of how Object Tracking works.

The following are the most popular approaches for Object Tracking:

### 1\. OpenCV-Based Object Tracking

There are many ways to approach object tracking, but one of the most popular is through the use of built-in algorithms in the OpenCV library.

The library has a tracking API containing Object Tracking algorithms and eight trackers: BOOSTING, MEDIANFLOW, MIL, KCF, CSRT, TLD, GOTURN, and MOSSE. Each tracker has its own advantages and disadvantages and has different goals. For instance, the MOSSE tracker is best for the fastest object tracking.

### 2\. MDNet

MDNet is a breakthrough in the field of tracking because it is the first network to use classification-based models instead of the more traditional approach. This makes MDNet much faster and more accurate than other tracking methods.

Inspired by the R-CNN object detection network, the MDNet algorithm can detect objects in real-time more efficiently and with high speed, making it a state-of-the-art visual tracker.

![mdnet for visual tracking](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/mdnet-for-visual-tracking.png)

### 3\. DeepSort

DeepSort is the most popular Object Tracking algorithm choice. The integration of appearance information or deep appearance distance metrics vastly improves DeepSORT performance.

The addition of the "Deep Appearance" distance metric enables DeepSort to avoid identifying switches by 45% and handle complex scenarios. On the MOT17 dataset, DeepSORT has received 77.2 IDF1 and 75.4 MOTA with 239 ID switches but a lower FPS of 13.

### 4\. ROLO

ROLO - a combination of YOLO and LSTM is a Spatio-temporal convolutional neural network that uses the YOLO module and LTSM network for collecting visual features, location inference priors, and locating the target object's trajectory.

The LSTM network uses an input feature vector of length 4096 for each frame to predict the target object's location. This vector is obtained by combining the high-level visual features with the YOLO detection. By working together, the LSTM and YOLO can predict the target object's location more accurately.

## Camtasia Vs Captivate - Which to Choose?

Being a video editor, it’s critical to keep ahead of the curve in our fast-changing global world. From small enterprises to major corporations, eLearning applications have shown to be a significant tool for cutting expenses and increasing profits. Software like Camtasia and Captivate are in high demand as e-learning becomes a more vital aspect of our life. When it comes to creating a course or video instruction, these two applications are quite quick and useful. Whether you should choose a Camtasia or a Captivate relies entirely on your industry and what you want to accomplish with this application.

Often times between Camtasia vs Captivate, the question arises: "Which software is superior?" As a result, we've compared Camtasia and Captivate based on the software packages themselves, as well as some important features, similarities, and differences. Software stimulation, production, demonstration screencasts, and translation of PowerPoint presentations into various formats are all possible using TechSmith Camtasia and Adobe Captivate. Camtasia offers fewer online learning alternatives, but it boasts incredible screen and video capture, as well as video editing facilities. This application allows you to alter the sound and visual characteristics manually. Video artists may improve video quality by using auxiliary microphones and cameras. The editing of the video is Camtasia's most impressive function. It allows you to cut and paste films, add transitions and subtitles to them, as well as do color grading and color correction.

## Part 1\. Overall Comparison

Each piece of software may be used to create eLearning and lesson material. Despite the fact that Adobe Captivate offers amazing transitional features and visual effect tools, it does not include video editing, which is, in my view, the backbone of developing eLearning material that adheres to the learning management system. As a result, Adobe Captivate needs the use of Adobe Premiere to edit and correct any problems in your films. Adobe Captivate, on the other hand, is the greatest alternative for developing quality eLearning and lesson software material. It's an excellent tool for developing online courses and tutorials. However, as previously said, Adobe Captivate is not simple to use and is not recommended for novices. Camtasia, on the other hand, seems to be the most economical and practical alternative for you based on your abilities if you are an entry-level editor and want to master the fundamentals of video editing and lesson production on your own.

## Conclusion

Developers inexperienced with the method may have significant trouble with the editing operation in Camtasia since screen grabs occur in real time. Editing material using slides in Captivate 2 is often less onerous than the video format utilized in Camtasia. The biggest issue is that long presentations might result in a large number of slides that can be time consuming to look through and result in a greater file size for the Flash file that user’s access. Hence, we like to advocate Filmora as a reasonable method between these two.

## Conclusion

Camtasia's technique of making a presentation using an individual movie works well for developers who are knowledgeable with video applications. Developers inexperienced with the method may have significant trouble with the editing operation in Camtasia since screen grabs occur in real time. Editing material using slides in Captivate 2 is often less onerous than the video format utilized in Camtasia. The biggest issue is that long presentations might result in a large number of slides that can be time consuming to look through and result in a greater file size for the Flash file that user’s access. Hence, we like to advocate Filmora as a reasonable method between these two.

## Blender Green Screen Effects

Blender is an open-source cross-platform 3D graphics program, but this doesn’t mean it’s a low-rent option. Just like commercial packages like Lightwave 3D, it is also a very capable compositing package. Unlike Lightwave, it is a modern node-based compositor like Nuke or Fusion. It’s not what the software is designed for, but it does a bangup job of green screen compositing, as you will soon see.

Blender green screen uses technique of the ****chroma key** a color is isolated (in our case the green of the****green screen**), or a particular luminance, it is removed and the area that was occupied by it becomes transparent, thus becoming part of the alpha channel. The transparent parts will thus show the video or the image below, which will thus define the environment in which the subject of the first movie will act.

## How to Use Green Screen in Blender

So we need to pull these two elements into Blender and pull a key on the green bits to make the background show through in as naturalistic a way as possible. Blender is a node-based compositor which means the control mechanism is nodes or little LEGO blocks of love which you place on the screen and link with little strings which form your signal path.

![blender](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/blender-interface.jpg)

Locate the drop-down (it goes up, actually, but you know what we mean) at the bottom of the view, and select “Movie Clip Editor.”

Click the “Open” button and choose and load your green screen footage. (You can also load sequences of images for uncompressed keys in this step if you have the space, and the footage is the right size.)

Once the clip is loaded, go back to the drop-down and select Node Editor.

The screen will be blank, but just go to the bottom of the view and click the middle button marked “Node Tree Type” to Display, and then check the Use Nodes and Backdrop buttons.

Select the “Render Layers” node, and because we won’t need it you can delete it (on the Mac this is the Forward Delete key). Then move the Compositing node out of the way because we won’t need it yet.

****Note:** to zoom in and out of the nodes, use the centre scroll wheel of the mouse if you have it. To zoom in and out of the images you are working on, use the V and Alt-V keys.

****Compositing Nodes**

Click the Add menu in the bar at the bottom of the view and select “Input -> Movie Clip.” Select the green screen clip you added in the Movie Clip Editor. This is the input. We have to push this through a keyer to remove the green and make those areas transparent.

****Important:** in this program flow goes from left to right, so node inputs are on the left of a node, and outputs are on the right of a node.

Now select “Add -> Matte -> Keying” to add a keying node. Also “Add -> Output -> Viewer” to make the output from the key visible. Click on the little yellow dot next to Image output on the Input node, and drag it to Image input on the Keying node. Then drag the little dot next to Image output on the keying node, and drag it to the image input on the viewer node.

You now have to select the key colour, the colour which the keyer is changing to transparent. Click the Key Colour button on the Keying node, and this displays a colour selector. Click the eyedropper, and click on the image in the background somewhere on the green screen.

If you look carefully, you will see that there are some areas which still have a bit of colour and are not fully transparent. You can check this more accurately by dragging the string from the Matte output on the Keying node and linking to the input on the viewer. This is the key you have made. As you can see, the dark bits are supposed to be totally black, and there are still greys showing through. (This is because the source material wasn’t perfect.)

There are many different ways to fix this depending on the shot, but if it’s a reasonably well-shot green screen, all you will need to do is the following.

Adjust the Black Clip slider to expand the amount of greens which turn to black. Then adjust the White Clip to push the whites to prevent them from becoming transparent.

Once you have pure white and pure black, reconnect the image output of the keying node to the image input on the viewer, and you’ll see you have a decent key.

You can adjust the amount of fringing and spill (reflections from the green screen on the model), but generally the keyer does a good job of guessing that for you with a decently-shot green screen.

****Adding the background**

After this, adding the background is more of the same with a slight twist. “Add -> Input -> Movie Clip,” navigate to your background clip and load it.

To blend the two layers, you have to make a mix of the two clips so that the background shows through the now transparent bits of the foreground.

“Add -> Colour -> Mix node”. Take the output from the background clip, and feed it to the top image input of the mix node. Take the output from the keying node, and feed it into the lower image input on the mix node.

Click the Alpha channel button next to the drop-down on the mix node.

And finally we have our key. The background is way too sharp and makes the green screen footage look really soft and crappy, so we need to soften the background. There is a really nice Bokeh Blur filter in blender for just this purpose to make the background look out of focus and add lots of gorgeous Bokeh blobs.

“Add -> Filter -> Bokeh Blur” and put it between the background clip and the mix. In Blender, if you add a node and place it over a string between two nodes, the string goes yellow, and dropping it will automatically insert the new node into the signal path connecting inputs and outputs.

Finally add an image to the Bokeh Blur for the shape you want the bokeh to be; we opted for a donut-shaped iris pattern.

To render out your video, connect the output of the Mix node to the input of the compositing node we left lying about earlier. It’s okay for this output to be connected to the input node of the viewer, too, as this means we see progress while rendering.

Make sure you are set up to render the right amount of frames at 30fps in the render panel on the far right. 30fps for 5 seconds (the duration of our clip) is 150 frames. Insert 150 where it says End Fr.

Select a place and a filename to output to in the Output panel further down the right-hand side. Then to render, select the info menu bar from the top-left drop-down, and finally choose “Render Menu -> Render Animation,” and the render will begin.

## Conclusion

Obviously, to get the best green screen composites you have to shoot good “plates.” “Plates” are the main bits of the shot that you bolt together in movie visual effects. You have the foreground plate and the green screen bit with an actor filmed in front of a green screen. Then you have the background plate which is the bit you want to show through the green bits of the foreground, making the whole thing look as though the background and foreground were filmed at the same time.
