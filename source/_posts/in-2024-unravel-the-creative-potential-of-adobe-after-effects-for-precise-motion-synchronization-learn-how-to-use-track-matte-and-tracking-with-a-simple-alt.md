### Using Track Mattes in After Effects

In Adobe After Effects, a track matte is a layer that defines the transparency of another layer. It acts as a stencil, determining which parts of the underlying layer are visible and which are transparent. Track mattes are used for creating various effects such as text animations, transitions, and seamlessly composing multiple layers. After Effects offers four Track Matte options:

![alpha track matte](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-1.jpg)

* **Alpha Matte:** **Alpha matte in After Effects** allows white areas in the matte layer to become visible while black areas become transparent. Effectively, this helps the underlying layer to show through.
* **Alpha Inverted Matte:** In an alpha inverted matte, black areas in the matte layer are visible, and white areas are transparent. It reverses the transparency values to create unique effects.
* **Luma Matte:** A luma matte uses the brightness values of the matte layer to determine visibility. Bright areas in the matte layer are visible, while dark areas are transparent.
* **Luma Inverted Matte:** The luma inverted matte works opposite to the luma matte. The top layer’s dark areas are visible, while bright areas are transparent.

![luma track matte](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-2.jpg)

You can use any of the **track mattes in After Effects** according to your requirements. Following is a step-by-step guide on how to use track mattes:

##### Step 1

To apply a track matte to your video, you must work with two layers. The top layer acts as the alpha or the luminance layer. The bottom layer acts as the fill. Once you have identified the layers, you can proceed to the next step.

##### Step 2

Go to the "Modes" column and open the dropdown menu next to "Layer List." Here, select the layer you wish to use as the track matte.

![select track matte layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/track-matte-and-tracking-in-after-effects-3.jpg)

##### Step 3

## 1\. What is an intro video?

A video intro is a brief introduction, typically lasting between 5 and 15 seconds, that introduces your video, YouTube channel, or brand. Video intros are becoming increasingly popular. It is often the first occasion on which a viewer will have the chance to interact with the content you produce.

Because of this, it has the power to attract attention from the very beginning and to develop trust in the company or product that you are promoting. It goes without saying that this is one of the most critical factors to consider when trying to attract and connect with your desired audience.

## 2\. What are some good intro makers?

### Adobe After Effects

One of the most well-known pieces of software for creating video effects is called Adobe After Effects. It is capable of producing great motion graphics, and as a result, it should have no trouble animating and producing dynamic video intros or 3D intros for your company, brand, or YouTube channel.

![adobe after effects intro maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/after-effects-effects-presets-pane.jpg)

After Effects is utilized by professionals working in the film business to create aesthetically spectacular work for cinema, television, video, and the online. The most significant drawback to After Effects is the fact that it requires an average beginner around eight weeks to learn the program by watching training videos and going through tutorials. In addition, the fee to join Adobe's Creative Cloud Suite membership service is quite high.

### Canva

When you use Canva, you will have instant access to a video introduction creator that is hosted on the web. You get access to a number of different themes, as well as royalty-free photographs and videos, as well as a drag-and-drop editor that you can use to create content that you can then share and post everywhere. In addition to providing, you with intro templates, it also gives you the ability to design your own logo. With a freshly designed logo in hand, now would be the ideal time to produce an introduction film using it.

Canva's mission is to demystify graphic design and make it available to users who are not designers. They also provide a premium edition of Canva, which is ideally suited for teams to collaborate on the creation of designs with the same objective in mind. In addition, Canva Pro is equipped with additional premium features, such as a brand kit and a backdrop remover.

![canva intro maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canva-poster.jpg)

Canva is an easy-to-use website that provides free access to some of its features, which may be used to create great movies. However, some limitations to using Canva include the fact that it only supports a limited number of output formats and there is a possibility that you will experience connectivity troubles while attempting to save and export your video introductions.

When it came to design, I previously relied on a combination of Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, and PicMonkey until I discovered Canva. After some time, we were able to navigate both with ease, but we found that Canva was more difficult to use than PicMonkey. Canva had a steep learning curve and lacked some of the features I was looking for in a design program.

We choose to disregard it. But I decided to give it another shot about two or three years ago, and this time I was impressed enough to switch PicMonkey out for it in my collection of editing tools. Canva had added a large number of features that made the program simpler to use and gave users the ability to accomplish more.

### Promo

Promo has a wonderful look that pops. You may build quick video intros for your social media or YouTube channel by using their intro maker, and then post and share them on your social networks afterwards.

You may utilize Promo to create videos in a variety of orientations and forms, including horizontal, vertical, square, and even banner films.

To summarize, Promo is a video maker that has an impressive design and allows for direct uploads to various social media platforms. The only problem is that their website occasionally becomes unresponsive and sluggish. Because of this, the process of creation can become rather laborious and drawn out.

In general, streamers on Twitch can't earn money from their content, and they can only make money from donations. However, if you have more followers, consistent viewers and **hosting a channel on twitch** regularly, then you can try to become a Twitch affiliate or partner. Some benefits that you can enjoy with this are:

* You will be able to sell your games
* You can get subscriptions.
* You will enjoy chargeback protection.
* It will be easier for you to get Twitch Bits.
* You can now earn revenue through advertisements.

To become an affiliate on Twitch, first of all, you need to monetize your content, i.e., stream. Now, let's have a look at some requirements to become an affiliate.

![upload video to twitch](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/upload-video-to-twitch-3.jpg)

* You must have at least 50 followers.
* Make sure you have completed a minimum of 500 total minutes broadcast within one month or in the last 30 days.
* In the last 30 days, you should have at least seven unique broadcast days.
* At least 3 viewers per stream in the last 30 days.

**Steps to Become an Affiliate**

* Visit the Twitch website and log into your account.
* Find the Notifications icon and click on it.
* There you can see the Get Started option. Click on it.
* Sign the affiliate agreement and then give your tax information.
* Then choose your payment location to complete the procedure.

**Requirements For Becoming a Partner**

Once you receive your affiliate status, you can become a partner. But there are some requirements that you need to keep in your mind.

* You must have 75 average unique viewers per day in the last 30 days.
* Have streamed or **hosting a channel on twitch** for 12 days in the last 30 days.
* You need to stream for 25 hours in 30 days.

**Steps to Follow**

* Visit Twitch and log into your account.
* Now click on your Profile icon and then click on the Creator Dashboard option.
* Click on the arrow mark located near Insights and then click on Achievements.
* Click on the Apply option located under the Patch to Partner tab.

Once applied, Twitch will reply to your application within 7 business days. Well, if you face rejection, then you need to build a stronger audience and apply for it again later.

**What Do You Mean Stay Active?**

Chat is an important part of Twitch, and it lets you interact with your fellow members of the community as well as streamers. By keeping your chat active, you can let others know that you are ready to interact with them. This, in turn, can help you to increase your followers.

## Part 4: What's The Alternative to Twitch for Creators?

### 1\. YouTube Gaming

Well, even though YouTube Gaming lacks in-game overlays, it offers other features. The platform offers live gaming broadcasts, channels, chat rooms and more. Here the viewers don't need to subscribe to watch the content.

### 2\. Smashcast

If you are a gaming fan, you must have heard about Hitbox and Azubu. They came together to form Smashcast. This provides the users with perfect JavaScript and HTML integration. If you are a gaming partner, esports team, viewer, organizer or streamer, then this platform will be an excellent option for you. Compared to Twitch, Smashcast offers better quality esports streams.

### 3\. Facebook Gaming

![upload video to twitch](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/upload-video-to-twitch-4.jpg)

Facebook also has introduced its own gaming and streaming platform. Facebook Gaming comes with an easy-to-navigate interface. It has a chat room and also allows you to watch videos from different social media platforms, like Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube. Besides, it offers some amazing features, such as different monetization options, interactive live-streaming, simple streaming setup, stream analytics and more.

### 4\. DLive

While YouTube and Twitch have some high bars for monetization, they don't offer sufficient profit to the creators. DLive is here to solve that issue. This platform rewards content creators as well as viewers. It charges a flat fee and takes around 20 percent of total revenue. On the other hand, viewers also get rewards for their engagement.

### 5\. Ustream

This platform offers more than just gaming video streams, such as sports news, live streams, talk shows, podcasts and more. Some reviews say Ustream provides users with a better and faster streaming service. Besides, it is available for different platforms, such as PS4, Mac, Windows, iOS, and Android.

### 6\. Vimeo

![upload video to twitch](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/upload-video-to-twitch-5.jpg)

Vimeo has all the features, such as a live chat system and other features that a streaming platform must have. You can easily access its analytic dashboard to know your audience in a better way. It also has many integrations such as Figma, Meta, WordPress, Shopify and more. So, uploading videos directly from your website to Vimeo will not be a challenging task.

## FAQs

### How Long Do My Videos Stay on Twitch?

The answer is that it depends. If you are a Twitch Prime user, Turbo user or a Twitch partner, then once you **upload video to twitch**, it will stay for 60 days. For regular broadcasters, their videos will remain active for 14 days. Just follow the above-mentioned steps to successfully upload your videos.

### Can I Upload Videos to Twitch?

You can upload your **video to twitch** if you become a Twitch affiliate or Partner. Regular streamers don't have this feature for now. Just meet the criteria required for this and apply for an affiliate. This can be a great way to promote your brand as you can leverage this amazing form of influenced marketing.
