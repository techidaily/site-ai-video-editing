Nobody likes watching videos without effects as there is no entertainment value, and the video is not soothing and pleasing to the eyes. That is why effects in videos are extremely important especially when it is a video you are posting on social media to get everyone’s attention. You should definitely consider adding slow zoom effect in your video to make it stand out.

Color grading can feel daunting, especially if you don’t have much experience grading footage. Fortunately, LUTs can help you grade your footage almost effortlessly. Like your favorite Snapchat or Instagram filters, a LUT can instantly transform dull-looking footage into something more vibrant. So, what is a LUT?

LUT is an acronym for “look up table.” A LUT is a preset color that you can apply to footage to transform how it looks. Video editors, colorists, and filmmakers use LUTs to speed up color grading. However, you don’t need to be an experienced professional to use them. With minimal color grading and video editing experience, you can easily apply LUTs to your footage.

LUTs are usually denoted by the .LUT, .CUBE, or. 3DL file extensions. You can create LUTs using several video editing and color grading applications, such as Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, DaVinci Resolve, and Filmora. In this guide, we’ll explore how to create your own LUT and use custom LUTs in Filmora.

#### In this article

01 [Why We Need to Create Our Own LUT](#part1)

02 [How to Create Your Own LUT](#part2)

03 [How to Use Custom LUTs in Filmora](#part3)

## Why We Need to Create Our Own LUT

Many video editing tools usually come with pre-installed LUTs that you can quickly apply to footage. However, you may need to create your own LUT in some cases. Here are some reasons why you may need to create your own LUT:

### 1\. To Create a Particular Feeling

Clients may want their videos to evoke a particular emotion. If the pre-installed LUTs that come with your video editing software can’t evoke the particular feeling the client wants, you may need to create your own LUT. Some key questions to ask yourself when creating the LUT include:

* What is the genre of the video project?
* What kind of atmosphere do you want to create?
* Are there any colors or tones that you should emphasize?
* Once you ask yourself these questions, you’ll be able to create an appropriate LUT for the client.

For instance, if the genre of the video project is a comedy, you may want to create a LUT that highlights orange, yellow, and its tones to create a cheerful atmosphere.

On the other hand, if the project’s genre is an action video, you may want to create a LUT that highlights blue, green, and other similar tones to evoke a serious feeling.

### 2\. To Showcase Several Looks

Color grading often comes down to preference. There isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution when grading footage, especially if the video project is on a neutral topic.

Creating custom LUTs can allow you to preview different looks for clients and allow them to choose the footage they like.

### 3\. To Speed Up the Color Grading Process

Perhaps the biggest pro of LUTs is their ability to speed up the color grading process. Creating your own LUTs can allow you to use the same LUT for multiple projects that are similar and save time during color grading.

In addition, since color grading can take a considerable amount of time, creating your own LUTs can be helpful if you regularly work on projects with tight deadlines.

And if you’re working with an editor or team of editors, adding your own LUT to the footage can speed up editing and give the final cut a more refined look.

### 4\. When Working with Multiple Editing Tools

Nearly all popular video editing applications support LUTs. If you regularly use several applications for editing and color grading, LUTs can help you quickly achieve the same colors across all the various applications you use.

All editing applications have different color grading tools, so it’s relatively challenging to achieve the same colors across several applications. Creating your own LUTs can make it easier to transfer color values between different software.

## How to Create Your Own LUT

Creating LUTs is fairly simple. However, to create effective LUTs, ensure you prepare your source footage to avoid issues down the line when applying the LUT to your footage.

Here are some crucial things you should do when prepping your source footage:

* Ensure your exposure is perfect.
* Ensure your white balance is correct.
* Ensure your lighting reflects an accurate balance of highlights and shadows.

By ensuring these things are in order, you will be able to create a versatile LUT that you can apply across a wide variety of footage.

After prepping your source footage, you can then create your own LUT. Here’s how you can create a LUT in Filmora following a few simple steps:

#### Tips for Filmora New Version Users

Due to the updating of Filmora, some of the following operations may be different from the operations of the new version, new version users can click on the latest operation guide - [**Apply 3D LUT in color correction**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) in the User Guide section.

### Step 2\. Add the Footage to the Timeline

Under the Color tab, choose the '3D LUT' in Basic to customize your own LUTs.

![select 3d lut in Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/select-3d-lut.png)

Since you're creating your own LUT instead of using the pre-built LUTs, scroll down to adjust various things, such as the White Balance, Color, Light, HSL, and Vignette.

![adjust setting to create lut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/create-your-own-lut.png)

Tweak these settings until you’re satisfied with the results. To help you make the adjustments and balance the intensity of the colors in your footage, check the color histogram located at the top right corner of the window.

###

### Step 5\. Save Your LUT

If you’re satisfied with the results, click on the ![save lut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/save-icon-in-filmora.jpg) Save button locate in the menu bar.

You’ll need to name and save your LUT in the new window that opens. Give your LUT a descriptive name and click on OK to save it.

![how to create lut with Filmora - save](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/save-your-created-lut.png)

## Conclusion

LUTs can make the color grading process easier and quicker. They can prove incredibly useful, especially if you’re unfamiliar with the color grading workflow or hard-pressed for time. They can also elevate your footage and make it look more cinematic.

While many video editing applications come with several pre-installed LUTs, try to create your custom LUTs using the steps above. Creating your LUTs from scratch may take you slightly more time than using pre-created LUTs, but creating the perfect LUT could save you time grading future projects.

When creating your own LUTs, try to create and apply several different LUTs to see which one is suitable for your footage. There usually isn’t a one-size-fits-all LUT option, so creating and testing out different LUTs is the best way to find the perfect custom LUT for your projects.

## Conclusion

LUTs can make the color grading process easier and quicker. They can prove incredibly useful, especially if you’re unfamiliar with the color grading workflow or hard-pressed for time. They can also elevate your footage and make it look more cinematic.

While many video editing applications come with several pre-installed LUTs, try to create your custom LUTs using the steps above. Creating your LUTs from scratch may take you slightly more time than using pre-created LUTs, but creating the perfect LUT could save you time grading future projects.

When creating your own LUTs, try to create and apply several different LUTs to see which one is suitable for your footage. There usually isn’t a one-size-fits-all LUT option, so creating and testing out different LUTs is the best way to find the perfect custom LUT for your projects.

Color grading can feel daunting, especially if you don’t have much experience grading footage. Fortunately, LUTs can help you grade your footage almost effortlessly. Like your favorite Snapchat or Instagram filters, a LUT can instantly transform dull-looking footage into something more vibrant. So, what is a LUT?

LUT is an acronym for “look up table.” A LUT is a preset color that you can apply to footage to transform how it looks. Video editors, colorists, and filmmakers use LUTs to speed up color grading. However, you don’t need to be an experienced professional to use them. With minimal color grading and video editing experience, you can easily apply LUTs to your footage.

LUTs are usually denoted by the .LUT, .CUBE, or. 3DL file extensions. You can create LUTs using several video editing and color grading applications, such as Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, DaVinci Resolve, and Filmora. In this guide, we’ll explore how to create your own LUT and use custom LUTs in Filmora.

## Why We Need to Create Our Own LUT

Many video editing tools usually come with pre-installed LUTs that you can quickly apply to footage. However, you may need to create your own LUT in some cases. Here are some reasons why you may need to create your own LUT:

### 1\. To Create a Particular Feeling

Clients may want their videos to evoke a particular emotion. If the pre-installed LUTs that come with your video editing software can’t evoke the particular feeling the client wants, you may need to create your own LUT. Some key questions to ask yourself when creating the LUT include:

* What is the genre of the video project?
* What kind of atmosphere do you want to create?
* Are there any colors or tones that you should emphasize?
* Once you ask yourself these questions, you’ll be able to create an appropriate LUT for the client.

For instance, if the genre of the video project is a comedy, you may want to create a LUT that highlights orange, yellow, and its tones to create a cheerful atmosphere.

On the other hand, if the project’s genre is an action video, you may want to create a LUT that highlights blue, green, and other similar tones to evoke a serious feeling.

### 2\. To Showcase Several Looks

Color grading often comes down to preference. There isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution when grading footage, especially if the video project is on a neutral topic.

Creating custom LUTs can allow you to preview different looks for clients and allow them to choose the footage they like.

### 3\. To Speed Up the Color Grading Process

Perhaps the biggest pro of LUTs is their ability to speed up the color grading process. Creating your own LUTs can allow you to use the same LUT for multiple projects that are similar and save time during color grading.

In addition, since color grading can take a considerable amount of time, creating your own LUTs can be helpful if you regularly work on projects with tight deadlines.

And if you’re working with an editor or team of editors, adding your own LUT to the footage can speed up editing and give the final cut a more refined look.

### 4\. When Working with Multiple Editing Tools

Nearly all popular video editing applications support LUTs. If you regularly use several applications for editing and color grading, LUTs can help you quickly achieve the same colors across all the various applications you use.

All editing applications have different color grading tools, so it’s relatively challenging to achieve the same colors across several applications. Creating your own LUTs can make it easier to transfer color values between different software.

## How to Create Your Own LUT

Creating LUTs is fairly simple. However, to create effective LUTs, ensure you prepare your source footage to avoid issues down the line when applying the LUT to your footage.

Here are some crucial things you should do when prepping your source footage:

* Ensure your exposure is perfect.
* Ensure your white balance is correct.
* Ensure your lighting reflects an accurate balance of highlights and shadows.

By ensuring these things are in order, you will be able to create a versatile LUT that you can apply across a wide variety of footage.

After prepping your source footage, you can then create your own LUT. Here’s how you can create a LUT in Filmora following a few simple steps:

## How to Create Loop Videos with Filmora

A loop fashion lookbook will be familiar to you if you are a fashion YouTuber. Here we will show you how to record shots and make a creative lookbook to show off your best outfits in an excellent way with Wondershare Filmora.

![loop video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-1.gif)

## Shots recording for loop masking

The first and most crucial step for creating a good loop video is to record perfect shots. Here are the steps to record video shots for loop videos.

### How to create a loop video

Step1 Set your camera or phone on a tripod. Make sure it stands still and does not move.

![set up a camera](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-2.png)

Step2 Set it so that you have a door on one side and enough room for the subject to walk through the door and move out of the frame.

![move out of the frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-3.png)

Step3 Make sure all your outfits are ready.

![outfits ready](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-4.png)

Step4 Start recording on your camera. Walk through the door wearing the first outfit. Change your outfits and repeat the step with all your dresses. It would help if you kept the camera rolling while recording all these clips. Turning the recording on and off with every shot will result in many small movements.

## Editing footage with a professional video editor - Wondershare Filmora

After recording the shots, the next step is to edit them. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is the best software for this purpose. Creating a loop video using filmora is an easy task.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

Below is the step-by-step guide on using Wondershare Filmora to create a loop masking or lookbook video.

### How to edit a loop lookbook video

Step1 Download and install Wondershare Filmora on your PC or Mac.

Step2 Launch Wondershare Filmora, import the video clip into Filmora and place it on the first track.

![import clip into filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-5.png)

Step3 Find a frame with an empty background, i.e., without the subject, and freeze the frame.

![empty background frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-6.png)

Step4 Extend the frozen frame and cut out the rest of the video.

![extend the frozen frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-7.png)

Step5 We are done with the first track so lock it.

![lock first track](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-8.png)

Step6 Import the clip again on the second track. And find the sections of the clips where the subject is walking in the video. Cut the remaining part.

![import the clip on the second track](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-9.gif)

Step7 It will create several small sections on the second track.

![second track sections](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-10.png)

Step8 Put the first clip at the start of the timeline and move the playhead to find the frame containing enough room for the second outfit.

![put the first outfit clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-11.gif)

Step9 Move the second outfit to that playhead area.

![put the second outfit](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-12.gif)

Step10 Double-click on the clip, go to effects, and choose a single-line mask.

![choose single line mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-13.gif)

Step11 Drag the mask to the point where it shows the outfit on its right side.

![drag the mask line](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-14.gif)

Step12 Blur the mask edges by increasing blur numbers.

![blur the mask edges](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-15.gif)

Step13 Click on the add button to add a mask keyframe and move the play head forward until the first outfit leaves the frame.

![add a mask keyframe](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-16.gif)

Step14 Move the mask to the left to reveal the entire frame, and repeat the same process with all outfits.

![reveal the frame and repeat with all outfits](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-17.gif)

Step15 After finishing all outfits, copy the clip from the first outfit. And paste it on top of all the tracks after the last outfit. And add a mask keyframe to this section too.

![add a mask frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-18.gif)

Step16 Unlock the first track and move the playhead to find the point where the subject with 4th outfit moves out of the frame. Then, cut the remaining part of the freeze frame on the right.

![unlock first track](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-19.gif)

Step17 Now move the playhead to the first frame and find where it coincides with the last part of the final frame. Cut the previous piece.

![move playhead to first frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-20.gif)

Post it on Instagram, and it will keep playing automatically and act like a loop video. Otherwise, duplicate this edited clip several times to create a longer loop video. Background music plays a vital role in these videos, setting the tone and pace. Follow all the steps in the correct order. Then, create and post loop videos on your social media platforms.

Step15 After finishing all outfits, copy the clip from the first outfit. And paste it on top of all the tracks after the last outfit. And add a mask keyframe to this section too.

![add a mask frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-18.gif)

Step16 Unlock the first track and move the playhead to find the point where the subject with 4th outfit moves out of the frame. Then, cut the remaining part of the freeze frame on the right.

![unlock first track](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-19.gif)

Step17 Now move the playhead to the first frame and find where it coincides with the last part of the final frame. Cut the previous piece.

![move playhead to first frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/loop-videos-20.gif)

Post it on Instagram, and it will keep playing automatically and act like a loop video. Otherwise, duplicate this edited clip several times to create a longer loop video. Background music plays a vital role in these videos, setting the tone and pace. Follow all the steps in the correct order. Then, create and post loop videos on your social media platforms.
