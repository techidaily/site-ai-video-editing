The GIF image format is a bitmap image format that supports up to 8 bits per pixel. APNG (Animated Portable Network Graphics) is a format for animated images that supports 24 bits per pixel and 8 bits of transparency, which is not available in GIFs.

Because the initial frame of an APNG file saves as a regular PNG stream, it can display by most conventional PNG decoders. Extra chunks can hold frame speed data and different animation frames (as provided by the original PNG specification).

Is APNG superior to GIF? APNG files are smaller and have more outstanding quality than GIF files. However, GIF is more compatible than APNG. Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome, and Opera support APNG, while practically all online browsers support GIF.

The GIF image format is a bitmap image format that supports up to 8 bits per pixel. APNG (Animated Portable Network Graphics) is a format for animated images that supports 24 bits per pixel and 8 bits of transparency, which is not available in GIFs. Backward compatibility with non-animated PNG files is also maintained.

Because the initial frame of an APNG file saves as a regular PNG stream, it can display by most conventional PNG decoders. Extra chunks can hold frame speed data and different animation frames (as provided by the original PNG specification).

Is APNG superior to GIF? APNG files are smaller and have more outstanding quality than GIF files. However, GIF is more compatible than APNG. Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome, and Opera support APNG, while practically all online browsers support GIF.

The GIF image format is a bitmap image format that supports up to 8 bits per pixel. APNG (Animated Portable Network Graphics) is a format for animated images that supports 24 bits per pixel and 8 bits of transparency, which is not available in GIFs. Backward compatibility with non-animated PNG files is also maintained.

Because the initial frame of an APNG file saves as a regular PNG stream, it can display by most conventional PNG decoders. Extra chunks can hold frame speed data and different animation frames (as provided by the original PNG specification).

Is APNG superior to GIF? APNG files are smaller and have more outstanding quality than GIF files. However, GIF is more compatible than APNG. Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome, and Opera support APNG, while practically all online browsers support GIF.

**Step 2**: Choose Image Format

Determine the image format, quality, and size you want to use. You choose to use the original image size or select "Change width and height" and enter a custom image size. 1920x1080 is an example of a \[width\]x\[height\] format. Only a few image formats support the picture quality choice, such as JPG, WEBP, or AVIF. The value ranges from 1 (lowest picture quality and highest compression) to 100 (highest image quality and lowest compression) (best quality but least effective compression). If this field is left blank, the converter will use the estimated quality of your input image if found; otherwise, 92 by default. JPG, PNG, TIFF, GIF, HEIC, BMP, PS, PSD, WEBP, TGA, DDS, EXR, J2K, PNM, or SVG are examples of target image formats.

## Best Audio Waveform Generator

For more than a century, sound waves and broadcasts have played an important role in shaping media as we know it. Here's how to implement them into your social media strategy. They have become popular in short video animations used to promote audio on social media, commonly referred to as audiograms.

Before learning everything there is to know about audiograms and how to make them, let's gain a better understanding of the significance of these patterns.

## Part 1\. What is an audio waveform?

A sound wave is the vibration of air molecules, which is how sound travels. The waveform describes the wave using a graph of how the air molecule is displaced over time.

Amplitude is the strength of a wave's action; the higher the amplitude, the more the air molecules are displaced. This also translates into loudness for the human ear; increasing the amplitude of the wave will increase how loud it appears to us. Sine, triangle, square, and sawtooth waveforms are the most typical periodic waveforms.

## Part 2\. What is audio wave animation?

A waveform animation video is a short video clip that can be uploaded to social media that combines an audio file with a static background image and a straightforward waveform animation. Audio animations, an example of audio visualization, make for fantastic video content, which is increasingly valuable on ever-noisy social media platforms.

## Part 3\. Why do we use audio visualization?

We all know that there is a special way of feeling called synesthesia, which is both a psychological and a linguistic phenomenon. Similar to how you automatically link this rain scene with the sound of heavy rain when you see it. People's newly awakened senses are more about the synthesis of sensory experience with actual life experience than they are entirely about actual information. Therefore, for clean audio, enhancing it with complementary visual animation effects will improve the user's visual experience and, to some extent, offer additional information and impact to your audio.

![use audio visualization](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/audio-waveform-animation-1.jpg)

## Part 4\. Best Audio Waveform Generator

Audio visualization can be presented in a variety of ways. The simplest kind of processing involves taking low-dimensional information like frequency, loudness, and rhythm and converting them into images in the form of colors, forms, strokes, etc. However, modern artificial intelligence technology can now extract high-dimensional visual attributes including style, tone, and emotion. But, for most non-technical players, such processes are obviously out of their league, therefore your best choice is to use a basic audio waveform generator. Following, we'll suggest 10 desktop or online generators so you may quickly finish the audio visualization project and create your audio-related videos.
