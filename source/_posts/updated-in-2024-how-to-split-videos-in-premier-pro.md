### 1\. The Razor tool

The Razor tool in Premiere is the simplest way to split or cut clips. This enables you to separate clips from the project timeline during your chosen clip. This technique is useful for making the first rough cut of your clips, with the sole drawback being that it can be less exact.

**You can use the following steps to split a clip using the Razor tool:**

Step1By pressing **Cmd+I or Ctrl+I** or by choosing File > Import, you can import it into Premiere Pro.

Step2Drag the clip onto the timeline if there is an existing sequence. If not, use the right-click menu to choose **New Sequence From Clip**. The video will now appear as a single block.
