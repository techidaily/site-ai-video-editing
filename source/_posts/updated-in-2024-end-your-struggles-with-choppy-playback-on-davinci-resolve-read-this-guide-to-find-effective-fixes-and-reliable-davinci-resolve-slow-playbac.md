### Solution 1: Lower Playback Resolution

In DaVinci Resolve, full timeline proxy resolution is set by default. To enjoy a smooth playback while editing, you should reduce the playback resolution. Open your project in DaVinci Resolve and press the "Playback" menu from the top. Then, select "Timeline Proxy Resolution" and pick one either "Half" or "Quarter" options. It will reduce the playback resolution and speed up the playback.

![lower playback resolution slow playback](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/fix-slow-playback-issues-in-davinci-resolve-1.jpg)

### Solution 2: Change Timeline Resolution

DaVinci Resolve can work on 4K high-resolution footage that might disrupt the playback. So, cutting down the resolution to speed up your playback is suggested. To do so, click the "Settings" icon from the bottom right side and enter the “Project Settings” window. Expand the “Time Resolution” menu and choose 1920x1080 HD if working on 4K or high resolutions. Now, apply the changes by hitting on “Save.”

Adjust the timeline resolution and right-click on the timeline in the Media Pool. Choose “Timeline” and then “Timeline Settings.” Lastly, check the “Use Project Settings” option and decide a resolution to click on "OK."

### Solution 3: Enable Render Cache

It’s another solution to fix the **DaVinci resolve slow playback**. Render cache is a file that stores the rendered frames and makes the rendering faster. Start by hitting the “Playback” option and choose “Render Cache.” Then, you’ll see 3 options: None, Smart, and User. You should select "Smart" and let DaVinci Resolve pick one clip to be cached.

Look for the “User Preference” menu and click on the top left side button of DaVinci Resolve. Go to the “Preferences” under the user tab. From the “Project Save and load,” check the “Disable Live Save” option. Now, you should remember to manually save your projects after editing.

## Blender Green Screen Effects

Blender is an open-source cross-platform 3D graphics program, but this doesn’t mean it’s a low-rent option. Just like commercial packages like Lightwave 3D, it is also a very capable compositing package. Unlike Lightwave, it is a modern node-based compositor like Nuke or Fusion. It’s not what the software is designed for, but it does a bangup job of green screen compositing, as you will soon see.

Blender green screen uses technique of the ****chroma key** a color is isolated (in our case the green of the****green screen**), or a particular luminance, it is removed and the area that was occupied by it becomes transparent, thus becoming part of the alpha channel. The transparent parts will thus show the video or the image below, which will thus define the environment in which the subject of the first movie will act.

## How to Use Green Screen in Blender

So we need to pull these two elements into Blender and pull a key on the green bits to make the background show through in as naturalistic a way as possible. Blender is a node-based compositor which means the control mechanism is nodes or little LEGO blocks of love which you place on the screen and link with little strings which form your signal path.

![blender](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/blender-interface.jpg)

Locate the drop-down (it goes up, actually, but you know what we mean) at the bottom of the view, and select “Movie Clip Editor.”

Click the “Open” button and choose and load your green screen footage. (You can also load sequences of images for uncompressed keys in this step if you have the space, and the footage is the right size.)

Once the clip is loaded, go back to the drop-down and select Node Editor.

The screen will be blank, but just go to the bottom of the view and click the middle button marked “Node Tree Type” to Display, and then check the Use Nodes and Backdrop buttons.

Select the “Render Layers” node, and because we won’t need it you can delete it (on the Mac this is the Forward Delete key). Then move the Compositing node out of the way because we won’t need it yet.

****Note:** to zoom in and out of the nodes, use the centre scroll wheel of the mouse if you have it. To zoom in and out of the images you are working on, use the V and Alt-V keys.

****Compositing Nodes**

Click the Add menu in the bar at the bottom of the view and select “Input -> Movie Clip.” Select the green screen clip you added in the Movie Clip Editor. This is the input. We have to push this through a keyer to remove the green and make those areas transparent.

****Important:** in this program flow goes from left to right, so node inputs are on the left of a node, and outputs are on the right of a node.

Now select “Add -> Matte -> Keying” to add a keying node. Also “Add -> Output -> Viewer” to make the output from the key visible. Click on the little yellow dot next to Image output on the Input node, and drag it to Image input on the Keying node. Then drag the little dot next to Image output on the keying node, and drag it to the image input on the viewer node.

You now have to select the key colour, the colour which the keyer is changing to transparent. Click the Key Colour button on the Keying node, and this displays a colour selector. Click the eyedropper, and click on the image in the background somewhere on the green screen.

If you look carefully, you will see that there are some areas which still have a bit of colour and are not fully transparent. You can check this more accurately by dragging the string from the Matte output on the Keying node and linking to the input on the viewer. This is the key you have made. As you can see, the dark bits are supposed to be totally black, and there are still greys showing through. (This is because the source material wasn’t perfect.)

There are many different ways to fix this depending on the shot, but if it’s a reasonably well-shot green screen, all you will need to do is the following.

Adjust the Black Clip slider to expand the amount of greens which turn to black. Then adjust the White Clip to push the whites to prevent them from becoming transparent.

Once you have pure white and pure black, reconnect the image output of the keying node to the image input on the viewer, and you’ll see you have a decent key.

You can adjust the amount of fringing and spill (reflections from the green screen on the model), but generally the keyer does a good job of guessing that for you with a decently-shot green screen.

****Adding the background**

After this, adding the background is more of the same with a slight twist. “Add -> Input -> Movie Clip,” navigate to your background clip and load it.

To blend the two layers, you have to make a mix of the two clips so that the background shows through the now transparent bits of the foreground.

“Add -> Colour -> Mix node”. Take the output from the background clip, and feed it to the top image input of the mix node. Take the output from the keying node, and feed it into the lower image input on the mix node.

Click the Alpha channel button next to the drop-down on the mix node.

And finally we have our key. The background is way too sharp and makes the green screen footage look really soft and crappy, so we need to soften the background. There is a really nice Bokeh Blur filter in blender for just this purpose to make the background look out of focus and add lots of gorgeous Bokeh blobs.

“Add -> Filter -> Bokeh Blur” and put it between the background clip and the mix. In Blender, if you add a node and place it over a string between two nodes, the string goes yellow, and dropping it will automatically insert the new node into the signal path connecting inputs and outputs.

Finally add an image to the Bokeh Blur for the shape you want the bokeh to be; we opted for a donut-shaped iris pattern.

To render out your video, connect the output of the Mix node to the input of the compositing node we left lying about earlier. It’s okay for this output to be connected to the input node of the viewer, too, as this means we see progress while rendering.

Make sure you are set up to render the right amount of frames at 30fps in the render panel on the far right. 30fps for 5 seconds (the duration of our clip) is 150 frames. Insert 150 where it says End Fr.

Select a place and a filename to output to in the Output panel further down the right-hand side. Then to render, select the info menu bar from the top-left drop-down, and finally choose “Render Menu -> Render Animation,” and the render will begin.

## Conclusion

Obviously, to get the best green screen composites you have to shoot good “plates.” “Plates” are the main bits of the shot that you bolt together in movie visual effects. You have the foreground plate and the green screen bit with an actor filmed in front of a green screen. Then you have the background plate which is the bit you want to show through the green bits of the foreground, making the whole thing look as though the background and foreground were filmed at the same time.

## Part 1\. What is the Keyframe Feature?

A keyframe, also spelled "key frame," defines any smooth transition's beginning and conclusion. In the case of animation or film, or video, that something may be a drawing or a specific frame of a shot.

The keyframe feature creates room for boundless creativity. The Keyframe feature could imitate any illusive or fascinating impact, from object enlargement to magical power effects. A key frame is a frame that serves as a marker for the start or stop of a parameter change.

You could use a keyframe to mark the spot where the audio will have faded up or down to a specific volume.

## Part 2\. Where to Use The Keyframe Feature?

Editors and creators use keyframing for all kinds of stuff. These uses include:

### Animated Logo Intros

You can use the keyframe feature to create indigenous intros with animated logos. It helps the editors go for vlogging or tutorial videos.

![animated logo intro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-keyframe-video-1.gif)

### Special Transparency Effects

Keyframing is famous for creating blended visuals through experimentation with the transparency of the clip.

![varying transparency clips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-keyframe-video-2.gif)

### Custom Picture-in-Picture Paths

We use the picture-in-picture effect in many editing formats, from tutorial videos to gaming streams and vlogs. Keyframing allows editors to execute the movement of the PIP as they wish. For instance, this video call was shot from a video.

![picture-in-picture effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-keyframe-video-3.png)

The picture will move across the screen between the 30-second and 1-minute marks if you indicate that it will be in the upper left corner of the screen at the 30-second timestamp of your video and the bottom right corner at the 1-minute timestamp.

## Part 3\. What Would You Need to Make a Keyframe Video

Let us share the procedure for making a video using the keyframe feature.

### 1\. A Video Clip or Photos

For experimenting and creating with the keyframe feature, first, you would need high-quality video clips or images.

![wondershare filmora interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-keyframe-video-4.png)

##### Step2 Import your Photos and Videos

* When you open Wondershare Filmora, you will notice the main import window in the top left corner.
* Click in the center of the import window upon the import icon.
* After clicking, Wondershare Filmora will automatically direct you to your PC library.
* **Browse** to where your target Clips or Images are stored.
* Select all the objects you want to import.
* Click on **Open,** and you will have imported files.

![importing clips to filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-keyframe-video-5.png)

##### Step3 Add your Photos and Videos to the Timeline

Your next step will be to add the imported videos and images to the timeline. When you have many videos and photos imported into the timeline, you can add them simultaneously.

Or you can also add them one by one wherever you need. To add an item to your timeline, follow the steps mentioned.

* **Right-click** on the photo or video you want to add to the timeline.
* Keep holding the right-click and drag it down to the timeline.

![adding shots to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-keyframe-video-6.png)

##### Step4 Adding Movement to your Shots

The next step would be to use the movement option in Keyframing, where you can pan and zoom a shot over a specified time. To do this, follow the bullet points below.

* After importing your clips to the timeline, double-click the clip to open the Editing Menu.

![clip editing menu](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-keyframe-video-7.png)

* Once opened, the editing menu will have a Basic tab; click it.
* **Check** the key-shaped button in front of the Transform button. It will create a Keyframe in the default form of your clip.

![first keyframe created](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-keyframe-video-8.png)

* You need to add a second keyframe at the end of the clip to create movement. First, move the timeline cursor to the end of the clip. Then, check the key-shaped button in front of the Transform button again for a second Keyframe.
* Now change the scale of the clip from the slider options in the **Custom Animation**

![adding keyframes and varying clip scale](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-keyframe-video-9.png)

* Now **play** your clip, and you'll see it zooms in and pans automatically to the state of the second keyframe over that timeline.

![final result of added movement](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-keyframe-video-10.gif)

##### Step5 Adding Motion to your Shots

Keyframing can add motion to your project's objects, clips, or images. To perform this in Filmora, follow these instructions:

* Go to the Stock Media tab on the top left ribbon in Filmora and download some motion elements (videos/GIFs) from accessible outlets like the **Flora GIF** used here.
* After importing elements to the timeline, **double-click** the element to open the Editing Menu.

![opening the editing menu](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-keyframe-video-11.png)

* Once opened, the **editing menu** will have a Basic tab; **click**
* **Check** the key-shaped button in the Basic Tab. It will create a Keyframe in the default form of your motion element.

![adding keyframes from the transform option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-keyframe-video-12.png)

* Next, move it to the end of the clip, check the key-shaped button in front of the Transform button, and add another keyframe there, but this time, change its scale and rotation attributes as you like.

![changing scale and rotation of clip at the second keyframe](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-keyframe-video-13.png)

* Enter **OK** and play your clip to see the fantastic effect.

![final result of added motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-keyframe-video-14.gif)

##### Step6 Keyframing Opacity

Keyframing allows creators to integrate variable opacity in their shots to instill a dramatic feel. This technique also helps create perfect fade-in and fade-out shots for your videos. Additionally, it is for theatrically dissolving shots too.  
For an illustrated guide to keyframing opacity, keep on reading the following instructions:

* Add a Keyframe to a clip on your timeline. For it, double-click the clip to open the Editing Menu, Then go to Basic Tab.
* Check the key-shaped button in front of the Transform button. It will create a Keyframe in the default form of your motion element.

![creating an initial keyframe](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-keyframe-video-15.png)

* **Move** the red cursor to the end of the clip.

![moving the keyframe to the end of the clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-keyframe-video-16.png)

* Next, add another keyframe, scroll down in the editing menu, and remove the **opacity** from the slider below the Bend Mode option.

![decreasing the opacity at the second keyframe](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-keyframe-video-17.png)

* That's it; you have a theatrical variation of the clip's visible opacity throughout the timeline.
