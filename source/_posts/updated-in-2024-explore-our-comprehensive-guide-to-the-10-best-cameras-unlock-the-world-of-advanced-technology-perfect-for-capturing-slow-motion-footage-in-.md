## Part 1: What Do You Know About Phantom Camera Company?

Vision Research manufactures a Phantom camera that can be used in many professional fields. This company first came into being in 1950 by the name of "Photographic Analysis Company ."During the initial years, the company produced many cameras that could tackle the need for high-speed photography. However, in 1992, the company decided to create a separate entity to create high-speed cameras that wouldn't depend on photographic film for imaging.

The US Patent Office acknowledged the use of innovative technology in the Phantom high-speed cameras. The main aim of this company is to produce robust cameras that can capture faster frame rates in high-speed photography.

## Part 1: What Do You Know About Phantom Camera Company?

Vision Research manufactures a Phantom camera that can be used in many professional fields. This company first came into being in 1950 by the name of "Photographic Analysis Company ."During the initial years, the company produced many cameras that could tackle the need for high-speed photography. However, in 1992, the company decided to create a separate entity to create high-speed cameras that wouldn't depend on photographic film for imaging.

The US Patent Office acknowledged the use of innovative technology in the Phantom high-speed cameras. The main aim of this company is to produce robust cameras that can capture faster frame rates in high-speed photography.
