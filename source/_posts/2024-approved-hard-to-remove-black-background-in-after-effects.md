## The Power of Music in Videos (+Filmora Editing Tricks)

No video is complete without suitable audio. Adding audio to a video is not that difficult, but choosing the right audio can be a hassle. You want something that captures the ears of the audience but, at the same time, compliments your video. The best way to do this is by adding music to your videos with [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

The following passage will guide you through everything you must consider while choosing music for your videos. But first, we'll show you how easy it is to alter your video with music using Wondershare Filmora.

## How different types of music affect your videos

You can easily change the viewer's perception using different music, even with the same visuals. The right song will elevate your video to another level and assist in relaying your feelings and emotions to the viewers. The following examples will illustrate how changing the audio changes the impression of the video.

### Example #1

Let's say you have a video of someone walking through the woods. Now without music audio, your video will be boring. You can quickly fix this by adding an upbeat song to make your video more energetic.

![adding an uplifting beat to your video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/the-power-of-music-in-videos-1.gif)

Using the same visuals, you can add a more tense and dramatic song, like from a horror movie. You have successfully changed the entire vibe of the same video from "inspiring" to "sinister." It proves the importance of the balance between audio and visuals.

![adding scary music to your video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/the-power-of-music-in-videos-2.gif)

### Example #2

For a better understanding, let's look at a movie scene we all know and love. Take the entrance scene from Avengers: Endgame. The music used by the producer aims to excite the audience while building up the hype for the upcoming battle. However, if we change the audio of this scene, we end up with a completely different set of emotions that might not go too well with the shot.

![changing the music of a movie scene](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/the-power-of-music-in-videos-3.gif)

Now that we've seen how crucial audio can be in a video, let's see how to choose the best music audio for your video.

## Tip #1: Identify the mood

As we've demonstrated before, the audio can change the entire mood of the video. The right music for any video will be the one that compliments the spirit of the visuals and relays the emotions the producer intended.

![identifying the mood of the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/the-power-of-music-in-videos-4.gif)

Rewatch your recorded clips until you know the mood portrayed by the visuals. Select music that matches the spirit of your visuals. For example, you would use different music for a sunny day compared to a cloudy day. Once you've figured out the mood and understand the emotions you want to elicit, search for audio that achieves this and balances out your visuals.

## Tip #2: Video and music style

We've already established that different styles of music complement other types of videos. So, keep the type of your video in consideration. For example, is your video fast-paced and full of action, or is it more serious in nature, like an interview or documentary?

![matching the video and audio styles](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/the-power-of-music-in-videos-5.gif)

Once you have music that matches your video style, check the audio wave. The four most common patterns are steady, ascending, descending, or furious. The audio wave will help you select the visuals that best match that audio.

![identifying the audio wave](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/the-power-of-music-in-videos-6.gif)

For example, if you're using audio with an ascending audio wave, you would use visuals that build up with the audio. The beat drop will signal the transition to reveal a powerful shot.

## Tip #3: Don't force the music

As emphasized before, your music should match your video. We all have a favorite music genre, but sometimes that may not go well with our visuals. For example, you love country music but have a video about the nightlife in the city. Using country music in a video about the town does not match well and will confuse your audience.

![adding mismatched audio to a video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/the-power-of-music-in-videos-7.gif)

To get music that best suits our video, we must be open and explore all music genres. You'll see how easy it is to scout a song that fits perfectly with your visuals. The easiest way is to choose a song that gives out the same emotions as intended by the visuals.

## Final Words

Now, you clearly understand the importance of music in videos. The right music can uplift your video into a viral sensation, while the wrong music track will turn your video into a catastrophe. Remember to review the legalities of copyright and infringement before using any music in your videos to avoid legal issues. Make sure you have permission to use the music or use royalty-free music.

Share this article with your friends and family interested in making stunning videos with perfect music audio. Comment below on your favorite scene from a movie or show where the music perfectly matched the visuals and left you with goosebumps.

How to Make a GIF With Transparent Background?

#### In this article

01 [Is It Possible to Create a Transparent GIF From Video?](#Part 1)

02 [Can Parts of GIF Be Made Semi-Transparent?](#Part 2)

03 [6 Best Free Transparent GIF Maker Software](#Part 3)

## Part 1 Is It Possible to Create a Transparent GIF From Video?

GIFs are a complete infotainment package that keeps you imbibed with requisite information in a rather fun centered way. When it is about editing GIFs, you are free to experiment with limitless creativity. While making GIFs from videos is quite a common edit, something that gains attraction is, turning dull videos into classic, **transparent GIFs**.

Still wondering on this to be a possibility? Rest assured, because it is certainly a ‘Yes’. You can very conveniently create a **transparent GIF** from your videos without a hustle. All you need to do is just a background shuffle. While you can do this with almost any GIF editing software available across the web, here’s how you can take up the process using the Egif video converter tool:

**Step 1: Convert a Video to GIF**

Using Egif, first of all convert a desired video into GIF. Take caution to manually remove backgrounds from all video frames and save the GIF using .gif or .png file extensions. Don’t use .jpg extension; else you will end up losing background transparency.

In case of a solid color GIF background, navigate to Egif’s ‘Effects Tool’ and click on ‘Replace Color with Transparency’.

![Original GIF with White Background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/How-to-make-a-GIF-with-transparent-background-1.JPG)

**Step 2: Color Selection**

Make a desired color selection that you wish to replace with transparent pixels. Select ‘White’ for a black and white GIF background. In case of color backgrounds, open any suitable picture editor (GIMP, MS Paint, etc.) and choose the hex color code using the ‘Color Picker’ tool.

![Background Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/How-to-make-a-GIF-with-transparent-background-2.JPG)

![Processed GIF with Transparent Background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/How-to-make-a-GIF-with-transparent-background-3.JPG)

This tool however, has compatibility limitations and can replace only a restricted number of color backgrounds, which too should not match the color scheme of foreground objects that you wish to restore in your GIF. If you require partially transparent backgrounds within specific portions of complex animated creations, you can use the ‘GIF Maker’ tool to selectively split and edit every clip frame, apply the transparency effect and finally merge all such clips together.

## Part 2 Can Parts of GIF Be Made Semi-Transparent?

No matter how much disappointing it appears, you can never introduce semi-transparent backgrounds in your GIFs. This is due to the fact that the GIF format has a limitation on pixel appearances. This basically means that you can only have completely opaque or completely transparent GIF backgrounds, strictly permitting nothing in between. Hence, it is a regret to conclude that you can literally never add anti-aliasing effects to your GIF backgrounds.

This may be a little disapproving though, but thanks to revolutions in technology, you can live up to the hope that creating semi-transparent GIFs would not be a forever tussle. You never know when the trick strikes IT engineers, and you may possibly be reading an article on interesting ways of creating semi-transparent GIFs in future!

Let us help you with that. Here are 5 Call of Duty: Warzone thumbnails you should check out.

### 1\. Call of Duty Warzone: THE BATTLE OF VERDANSK GAMEPLAY! (No Commentary)

![warzone thumbnail by noannoyingcommentary](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/warzone-thumbnail-1.JPG)

This video from the channel [NoAnnoyingCommentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3pBdi2Cf9Y) has 3.3 million views. It shows the player pointing their gun upwards. Flying in the sky are many fighter planes (obviously edited.) Then, a sepia filter is applied to make it look like a shot from past real-world wars. It is cool and sure to attract the attention of the COD: Warzone demographics.

### 2\. TOP 300 FUNNIEST FAILS IN WARZONE

![warzone thumbnail by red arcade](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/warzone-thumbnail-2.JPG)

This video is made by [Red Arcade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1UFojIiiK8). It has attracted more than 12 million views. Admittedly, the title and the video concept are already enough to attract many viewers. But we can't say that the thumbnail did not help. It's actually really good.

The thumbnail shows a screenshot from Warzone. A player's character is in the middle, with his back facing the camera. The words "AFK. Don't shoot!" are written on the wall he is facing. The character is viewed through a sniper scope. It's more "funny" than cool. But for what the video is about, it works fantastic.

### 3\. Clean House \[PS5 UHD 4K\] Next-Gen Ultra Realistic Graphics PlayStation 5 Call of Duty Gameplay

![warzone thumbnail by hedgehog](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/warzone-thumbnail-3.JPG)

This video from [HEDGEHOG ヅ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQlxN49jn6Y) has a whopping 12 million views. Again, the title likely is the main reason why it got that many views. But for sure, people did not read that long title at first. They were drawn to it by the thumbnail.

The thumbnail shows a clear-as-crystal screenshot of a team of 4 players on the battlefield. At the top left corner is the PS5 logo. Then, at the bottom left is an icon that says the video is in 4K UHD. If you're also uploading 4K Warzone videos, you can try doing this. Users are attracted to videos that are eye-pleasing.

### 4\. Call of Duty: Warzone Battle Royale | RTX 3080 10GB ( 4K Maximum Settings Ray Tracing OFF )

![warzone thumbnail by gtx 1050 ti](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/warzone-thumbnail-4.JPG)

The thumbnail for this video (made by [GTX 1050 Ti](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fU9zMSBcius)), with 5.2 million views, is just an in-game screenshot. At the top-right is a large logo of GEFORCE RTX 3080 and at the bottom left is an Intel logo. Like the previous one, it attracts viewers by stating the visual appeal of the video.

### 5\. NEW RECORD! 64 KILL GAME in CoD WARZONE! (Best Classes / Loadouts)

![warzone thumbnail by vikkstar123](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/warzone-thumbnail-5.JPG)

Like most Warzone thumbnails, this thumbnail from a [Vikkstar123](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5VNeLLs2yM) video features a gun. At the top right is the victory banner, and at the bottom is the logo for kills with the number 64 next to it. The top right shows the logo of COD Warzone.

Players are attracted to amazing gameplay. Unsurprisingly, the player who got 64 kills got 3.1 million views in his video. The gist is that if you have achieved something amazing, try to incorporate it into the thumbnail.

## 5 Best Call of Duty: Warzone Thumbnails on YouTube That May Inspire You

Research is always key to accomplishing something. If you want to create kickass COD: Warzone video thumbnails, you should look at the ones that worked. Visit YouTube and find videos that have great success. That will help you get some ideas for your thumbnails.

Let us help you with that. Here are 5 Call of Duty: Warzone thumbnails you should check out.

### 1\. Call of Duty Warzone: THE BATTLE OF VERDANSK GAMEPLAY! (No Commentary)

![warzone thumbnail by noannoyingcommentary](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/warzone-thumbnail-1.JPG)

This video from the channel [NoAnnoyingCommentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3pBdi2Cf9Y) has 3.3 million views. It shows the player pointing their gun upwards. Flying in the sky are many fighter planes (obviously edited.) Then, a sepia filter is applied to make it look like a shot from past real-world wars. It is cool and sure to attract the attention of the COD: Warzone demographics.

### 2\. TOP 300 FUNNIEST FAILS IN WARZONE

![warzone thumbnail by red arcade](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/warzone-thumbnail-2.JPG)

This video is made by [Red Arcade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1UFojIiiK8). It has attracted more than 12 million views. Admittedly, the title and the video concept are already enough to attract many viewers. But we can't say that the thumbnail did not help. It's actually really good.

The thumbnail shows a screenshot from Warzone. A player's character is in the middle, with his back facing the camera. The words "AFK. Don't shoot!" are written on the wall he is facing. The character is viewed through a sniper scope. It's more "funny" than cool. But for what the video is about, it works fantastic.

### 3\. Clean House \[PS5 UHD 4K\] Next-Gen Ultra Realistic Graphics PlayStation 5 Call of Duty Gameplay

![warzone thumbnail by hedgehog](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/warzone-thumbnail-3.JPG)

This video from [HEDGEHOG ヅ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQlxN49jn6Y) has a whopping 12 million views. Again, the title likely is the main reason why it got that many views. But for sure, people did not read that long title at first. They were drawn to it by the thumbnail.

The thumbnail shows a clear-as-crystal screenshot of a team of 4 players on the battlefield. At the top left corner is the PS5 logo. Then, at the bottom left is an icon that says the video is in 4K UHD. If you're also uploading 4K Warzone videos, you can try doing this. Users are attracted to videos that are eye-pleasing.

### 4\. Call of Duty: Warzone Battle Royale | RTX 3080 10GB ( 4K Maximum Settings Ray Tracing OFF )

![warzone thumbnail by gtx 1050 ti](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/warzone-thumbnail-4.JPG)

The thumbnail for this video (made by [GTX 1050 Ti](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fU9zMSBcius)), with 5.2 million views, is just an in-game screenshot. At the top-right is a large logo of GEFORCE RTX 3080 and at the bottom left is an Intel logo. Like the previous one, it attracts viewers by stating the visual appeal of the video.

### 5\. NEW RECORD! 64 KILL GAME in CoD WARZONE! (Best Classes / Loadouts)

![warzone thumbnail by vikkstar123](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/warzone-thumbnail-5.JPG)

Like most Warzone thumbnails, this thumbnail from a [Vikkstar123](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5VNeLLs2yM) video features a gun. At the top right is the victory banner, and at the bottom is the logo for kills with the number 64 next to it. The top right shows the logo of COD Warzone.

Players are attracted to amazing gameplay. Unsurprisingly, the player who got 64 kills got 3.1 million views in his video. The gist is that if you have achieved something amazing, try to incorporate it into the thumbnail.

## Conclusion

Using in-game screenshots is recommended for making amazing COD Warzone thumbnails. But you should not use raw photos. You must edit them to ensure they have visual appeal. Of course, that means you need a good thumbnail maker.
