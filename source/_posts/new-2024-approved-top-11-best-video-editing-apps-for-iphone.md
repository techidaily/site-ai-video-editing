## **Wrapping Things Up**

People's viewing experiences are greatly influenced by the audio accompanying a video. No matter how wonderful or perfect a video clip is, if the audio playing while watching it is terrible, it may be a very frustrating experience. So, we've gone over a few different software options for removing audio from a video file and replacing it with another audio in a couple of moments.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **How to Insert Audio to Video Clip in Da Vinci Resolve?**

There may be times that your video may require the addition of music, background audio, or wooshing sounds.

To begin, open Resolve and import your audio clip:

3. Right-click and choose "Import Media" or push "Ctrl + i."
4. Pick your audio clip and browse to your location.
5. Select "Open."

The audio clip is now imported into the "Media Pool." After that, you'll need to figure out which part of the audio track you'll use.

Double-click the audio clip to play it. In the "Source Viewer," it will appear.

Set the needed audio parts in (press I) and out (press O). Alternatively, if you need the entire soundtrack, there's no need to set in and out.

Drag & drop the audio track (from the media pool) underneath the video you want to use. It will then add the sound file with the selected portion of the audio. You can now modify the audio to match the visual.

### **How to Link Your Audio and Video in DaVinci Resolve?**

Here's how to connect audio and video in a timeline:

1. Press "Ctrl" or "Cmd" to toggle both the video and audio.
2. Right-click and choose "Link Clips." You may also use the shortcuts “Ctrl + Alt + L" or "Option + Command + L."

If you don't want to go into legal trouble, the only thing you need to remember is never to utilize any illegal video.

##### Step2 Read and study the histogram

Now you'll see the Advanced Color Correction pop-up window. Here, you'll see a histogram with the brightest point on the right and the darkest point on the left. From our example, you can see that the video has more dark pixels than bright ones. Horizontally, the histogram shows you how many pixels are in a certain range of brightness.

![read and study the histogram](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/color-correction-basics-2.jpg)

##### Step3 Adjust the image colors

Once you've understood the histogram, look for pure black and white parts on the video clip. For example, in this video, you can see that the roofs are pure black and the boat at the bottom-right corner is pure white.

![adjust the image colors](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/pure-blacks-and-whites.gif)

After finding the white and black parts in the video, go to the **Light** section, then adjust the **Highlights** to see if you can get a pure white on the boat. If the boat or any other image of your choice doesn't look pure white, increase the **Whites** slide to make it whiter.

![go to the light section](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/color-correction-basics-3.jpg)

Now adjust the **Shadows** settings to reduce the effect and make the roofs look closer to pure black. If you want the roofs to look darker, drag the **Blacks** slider to the left.

**Pro tip**: Ensure that the darkest and brightest points don't cross the broken lines on the edge, or the video will start losing details.

##### Step4 Adjust the color saturation

Does your video still look a little flat? Probably yes! In that case, click the **Color** section and adjust the **Saturation** slider to the right to make the video less flat. Saturation simply means how colorful a video clip is to the viewer. Apart from the color saturation, you can also adjust the **Vibrance** to make your video objects look more colorful.

![adjust the color saturation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/color-correction-basics-4.jpg)

##### Step5 Preview and compare the video

Now it's time to check and compare the results. To make it easier, click the **Eye** icon at the top-right corner to switch between the original S-Log video and the color-corrected clip. You can also tap the **AB** icon and choose **Split View-Left/Right** to view the clips in the side-by-side mode.

## Summary
