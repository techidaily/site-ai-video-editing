## Want to Make a Fun and Cinematic Video with an Introductory Text Title? Learn the Stages of Editing with Filmora for This Effect Here

Have you ever seen videos on social media apps or movies and seen a video in text like the title as the intro? The highly appealing and unique style makes the video introduction stand out. Not to mention, it creates an illusion of almost-transparent titles that showcase the video playing in a subdued manner in the background, thereby showcasing a modern, funky intro.

![the example of text intro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-video-in-text-intro-0.gif)

Now, are you planning to create an effect such as that on your own video project? Worry not; you do not have to hire video editing experts at enormous costs or opt for a video editing course, to name a few. With [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you can create the effect at more than half the cost and effort. Let's learn how that works.

## 1\. Accessing the software

The first step to kickstart the whole process is downloading the software into your system. For this, visit the official website of Filmora and click on the Download button at the top of the page or the description. This will automatically download an installer for the app on your device.

![click on the download button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-video-in-text-intro-1.jpg)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

From the Downloads section of your Mac or Windows-based device in the browser, double-click on the installer. It will ask you to confirm the terms and conditions and press the Install button on the next pop-up prompt. Then will start the overall downloading process of the software into your device, and it will take some seconds, after which Filmora will automatically open to the homepage.

Click on the "Create New Project" button on the homepage, and that will launch the software to the editor window.

![launch to the editor window](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-video-in-text-intro-2.jpg)

## 2\. Add Sample Color

On the main editor window of Filmora, you have to go to the My Media section. From the drop-down list, click on the folder full of Sample Colors. Next, click on the black sample color option and drag it down to the editing timeline. Finally, drop it in the place of the Track 1 section on the timeline.

![drop it in track 1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-video-in-text-intro-3.jpg)

## 3\. Put the Title tile into the video

After you add the sample color to the timeline, you have to click on the Titles tab from the top main toolbar of Filmora. Out of the options you find here, choose the Default Title. Then, hold it and drag the title template onto the Track 2 section of the editing timeline, and drop it in place.

Then, double-click on it to open the editing panel for the text. You will see a text field where you can update the title wording instead of "Your Title Here". Then, you have to change the size of this title text to 280\. Make sure to adjust the font style to whichever option you prefer, but typically a blocky style works. Click on the Bold icon to change the structure of the title text.

Scroll downward among the text editing parameters until you see the Text Spacing option. Whatever the default value here is placed as, you have to turn it to 10\. After that, click on the OK button.

![change the title](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-video-in-text-intro-4.jpg)

## 4\. Take a Snapshot

After adjusting the size and dimension of the title you added, click on the Snapshot icon to take a screenshot of the Track 2 title clip that has been changed. Then, select both of the clips on Tracks 1 and 2 and remove them from the timeline.

## 5\. Insert the background video

Next, go to the My Media tab again and choose the Project Media option. Right-click on the library section and tap on the Import button. This will open you to the device storage of your computer. From there, please search for the video clip you want to insert into your project as the main video background and import it into Filmora.

![search for the video clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-video-in-text-intro-5.jpg)

Then, when that is available in your media library section, hold it and drag and drop the clip onto the timeline in the Track 1 section.

## 6\. Add the Black and White Effect

Move the playhead forward to the 15-second mark on the added clip in the timeline. Then, tap on the scissor icon to split this clip. Please tap on the excess amount of the video clip and delete it.

Following that, click on the Effects tab on the top toolbar of Filmora. Out of the list of various effects that you will find, tap on the Black and White category and choose the Willow effect. If you cannot find the Willow effect easily, you can directly search for it in the text search field above and select from there.

Then, drag the willow effect to the video clip in the timeline below, keeping a watch on the preview window. The effect will turn the video into its format of Black and White.

![drag the willow effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-video-in-text-intro-6.jpg)

## 7\. Add the Screenshot to the Edit

Again, scroll up to the My Media section and tap on the screenshot you created earlier. Then, drag it down onto Track 2 of the editing timeline. Then, use the playback to mark the beginning of the video two frames off of the beginning of the video. Then, move the clip to that position so that it starts from that point onward.

Next, move the playback to the 14-second mark and adjust the Track 3 clip to fit that section perfectly.

![move the playback to 14 second mark](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-video-in-text-intro-7.jpg)

## 8\. Use the Chroma Key Effect

Now, double-tap on the Snapshot clip and choose the Video tab. Activate the Chroma Key option and go to the color picker section. Choose the black color from the clip shown on the preview window.

![choose the black color from preview](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-video-in-text-intro-8.jpg)

You must now click on the Crop option from the function bar. On the top, you will get the option for Pan and Zoom. Click on it and shorten the visible bright window by dragging it towards the center. Move this cropped rectangle to an all-white position. This will determine the end point of the text to be shown at the starting position of the video.

Move the playhead ahead in the timestamp and again click on the Chroma Key button from the function bar. When it opens, click on the Chroma key option in the editor and change the edge thickness value to a -7 number.

## 9\. Export the Clip

Once done, you need to export this clip. To do so, tap on the Export button at the top of the screen. On the Export page, change the name of the video to the intro title text and go to Settings to see its resolution condition. For the best effect, you should choose the higher bit rate of the file while exporting. After you are done, tap on the Export button.

![click on the export button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-video-in-text-intro-9.jpg)

Once the video gets exported, delete the screenshot clip you took from the timeline.

## 10\. Add the Effect on the Video Clip

Double-click on the background video clip on the timeline to open the text editor window. Tap on the Effects tab in this section and remove the Willow effect from your video.

You must extend the video duration to 20 seconds in the lowermost editing window. After that, import the exported video clip from where you stored it after downloading.

![extend the video to 20 seconds](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-video-in-text-intro-10.jpg)

Following this, you must import the video you exported into the timeline. For this, you have to click on the My Media section and go to Project Media. Then, right-click on the library section here and tap on Import. Choose the file and import it from the location where you saved it.

Then, drag and drop the file back into the timeline. Here, the next step for you is to adjust the playhead position for the new video clip. Move the play head to the 14th second and the 14th frame position to synchronize it with the Track 3 video clip.

Then, double-click on the video, and under the video tab, choose the Chroma Key option. Then, tap on the color picker and choose to add white color from the preview window. After this, select the Edge Thickness parameter on the editor window and increase it to a value of 1.5.

![select the edge thickness parameter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-video-in-text-intro-11.jpg)

## Leveraging the Vectorscope for Better Color Correction in Premiere Pro

Our eyes process colors differently. When two people look at the same picture, they may see different shades of colors. In post-production, Vectorscopes help to color grade and make sure you get your images exactly right. This means that you will process the exact color that you want across devices. **Premiere Vectorscope** is a great choice for anyone looking to correct and grade colors. Using Vectorscope Premiere allows you to get quantitative data about your image for a more accurate assessment of colors within the film. In this article, we explore what comprises Premiere Pro Vectorscope and how to use them in video editing.

**Color Correction Editor** An easy-to-use video editor helps you make color correction and color grading experience for videos!

![Wondershare Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box.png)

## **Part 1\. Vectorscope: What is It and How to Read**

Vectorscopes provide a great post-production way for color correction. It is video scope that provides greater data about the color properties of an image. Another way to look at it is that a Vectorscope is a circular graph, which monitors the following information of an image. By looking at it, you can measure saturation outward from the center while hue is measured in a circular pattern.

The Vectorscope contains markings indicating the degree of saturation and hue in an image. The distance of the markings from the center indicates how saturated the color is in your image. In simple terms, the further the markings, the more saturated the color. The two main options of Vectorscope are HLS and YUV. The HLS displays the hue, lightness, saturation, and signal information at a glance. On the other hand, the YUV mode contains several color boxes, giving accurate levels of hue and saturation.

![vectorscope](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/demystifying-the-vectorscope-a-comprehensive-guide-for-premiere-pro-color-correction-1.JPG)

Vectorscopes are useful to filmmakers and editors to ensure greater conformity in a film as they transition from one shot to the next. When the camera captures an image with too much saturation, using a Vectorscope helps to reduce the said saturation. This makes Vectorscope a useful feature for color correction and color grading. Color correction involves altering the colors of an image within a film to provide consistency and tone for the film. On the other hand, color grading is more like a supercharged version of color correction. It refers to altering a film so that it matches a tone or theme. Since the two, grading and correction are important, more video editing will use a combination of both.

### **How to Read a Vectorscope**

Learning how to read a Vectorscope will make your video editing fun and easier. The best way is to view the Vectorscope in relation to the color wheel. When using Premiere Vectorscope, the colors are nicely labeled for anyone to understand. You only need to understand the primary colors of saturation and hue to accurately read a Vectorscope.

![reading vectorscope](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/demystifying-the-vectorscope-a-comprehensive-guide-for-premiere-pro-color-correction-2.JPG)

The hue color is the direction to which the marketer points. For instance, a marker pointing toward the boxes labeled “R” indicates that the hue is predominantly red. On the other hand, the saturation correlates to the length of the marker. The image is more saturated when the marker is furthest from the center of the wheel.

Keep note of the two boxes in each main color. The box that is close to the center indicates 75%, and you will normally avoid the marker extending beyond this first box. Any marketer that extends beyond this is known as non-broadcast safe or illegal colors. Although you may need to go beyond the first box in some projects for stylistic reasons, the general rule of thumb is to avoid that.

Without proper calibration, your images may end up looking too red or too blue. They will not look natural at all and will affect the overall quality of your video. Therefore, using the features within the vectorsope will help you color-grade your images to perfection.

## **Part 2\.** **[Vectorscope in Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html): A Brief Guide**

Just like many other video editing software, Adobe Premiere Pro offers Vectorscope to help in post-production. The best way to look at Vectorscope in Premiere Pro is to use the Color Correction workspace. Once you have launched the software, Click Window, followed by Workspace, and then Color Correction. Access the reference monitor directly to deliver the program.

The reference monitor will first display composite video. Clicking on the setting icon allows you to access the panel and choose the video scope you want to use. Now, this is how you use the Vectorscope in Premiere Pro:

### **1\. Reading a Vectorscope on Premiere Pro**

A Vectorscope is similar to a color wheel. It displays colors in the same places as the wheel, with cyan to the bottom right and red to the top left. When you see a dot or line in the Vectorscope, you can tell it is giving you information about the color or chrominance of a shot. Essentially, this information is the hue (specific color) and the saturation (the strength of that hue).

![color wheel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/demystifying-the-vectorscope-a-comprehensive-guide-for-premiere-pro-color-correction-3.JPG)

As you examine the Vectorscope, you get to see how strong a particular color is by the length of the line from the center of the wheel. A longer line indicates that the color is more saturated. However, all Vectorscopes have small color targets. The Vectorscope points are lined with a drop-down used to read the scope. The default is set to 75%, which is a good limit for a typical broadcast system.

![drop-down](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/demystifying-the-vectorscope-a-comprehensive-guide-for-premiere-pro-color-correction-4.JPG)

### **2\. Adjusting Skin Tones**

A commonly used feature of the Premier Pro Vectorscope is the Skin Tone Line. With this feature, you get the line on the scope between the Yellow and the Red sections at about 10.30 or 11 o’clock position.

![skin tones](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/demystifying-the-vectorscope-a-comprehensive-guide-for-premiere-pro-color-correction-5.JPG)

The Vectorscope skin tone line represents the color of blood flowing through the skin. You can use this line to check the accuracy of skin tone color representation regardless of the ethnicity of the person you’re filming. In particular, video images are more accurate

The major problem is figuring out how to look at skin tones in a shot with many other colors. With the skin tons line in Premiere Pro, color correction becomes easy and quick. You only need to use a garbage matte, which is found under video effects then keying. Adjust the points so that they cover the skin of the person on the shot, then look at the Premiere Pro Vectorscope to see your end results.
