### Save GIF as AVI through GIF to AVI Software

One of the primary reasons we recommend Wondershare Filmora is that online GIF converters can be unreliable. This implies that there must be a stable internet connection and power supply. In addition, Filmora software is safe and secure, which is a common concern with online tools.

Follow the steps below to turn **GIF into AVI**:

**Step 3: Import Files to Convert**
