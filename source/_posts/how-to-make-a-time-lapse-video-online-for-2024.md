### Step By Step Guide to Make Slow Motion Videos in Filmora

Unlike **Final Cut Pro's slow motion**, Wondershare Filmora is more straightforward to operate. Follow the step-by-step guide below to apply slow-motion effects to your video.

#### Method 1: Uniform Speed

If you want to adjust the speed and retain its high quality, use the uniform speed option. You can access this option by following the stepwise method below. Using the advanced features, you don’t need any other tool to ensure the video’s original worth:

##### Step 1Import Your Project and Start a New Project

After launching Filmora, head to its “New Project” option from the home screen. You will enter the main editing screen this way. Import your project in the media panel and then drag it to the timeline.

![creating a new video project](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/final-cut-pro-slow-motion-8.jpg)

##### Step 2Explore Uniform Speed and Adjust the Speed

Go to your video in the timeline and right-click on it. Now, explore the “Uniform Speed” option and tap on it to get an editing panel at the right. From that panel, move the “Speed” slider to the right and get a slow-motion video preview. You can see the "Duration" of the video after slowing it down and adjusting it accordingly.

![decrease uniform speed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/final-cut-pro-slow-motion-9.jpg)

##### Step 3Use Advanced Features to Ensure Quality of Videos

Move down and toggle the “Reverse Speed” option if required. You can enable the “Maintain Pitch” and “Ripple Edit” options to enhance the video automatically. Lastly, extend the “AI Frame Interpolation” menu using its downward symbol and choose “Optical Flow.” It will ensure that the video will remain slow with high quality.

![set ai frame interpolation to optical flow](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/final-cut-pro-slow-motion-10.jpg)

#### Method 2: Speed Ramping

This method aims to bring smooth transitions in slow-motion videos. Instead of an abrupt change, a gradual increase in speed can impose a professional look. So, there are the steps to access this feature and get a preview of smooth playback.

##### Step 1Discover the Speed Ramping Feature

Access the Speed Ramping option next to the “Uniform Speed” in the right-side editing panel. Alternatively, you can right-click on the video and look for the “Speed Ramping” option from the list.

![navigate to speed ramping](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/final-cut-pro-slow-motion-11.jpg)

##### Step 2Pick a Template for Speed Ramping or Customize It

From the speed ramping section, you can choose any template from 6 options. Also, users can pick the “Customize” option to adjust the speed ramping as desired.

![customise speed to apply slow mo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/final-cut-pro-slow-motion-12.jpg)

##### Step 3Use the Render Preview Option for Smooth Playback

To get a high-quality preview of your videos, look for Render Preview. In this regard, go to the top toolbar of the timeline section on the right side. Click the “Render Preview” icon next to the “Copilot Editor.” Wait for a while and get a smooth playback of your slow-motion video.

### Integral Features of Filmora

Slowing down videos is easier than **slow-mo Final Cut Pro.** Filmora automates the process with an optical flow, ensuring the project's high quality with one click. Without any wait, learn more about some top-rated features in the given section.

#### 1\. [AI Thumbnail Creator](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Besides, there are over 58 thumbnail templates that can be customized after picking the right one.

#### 2\. [AI Copilot Editing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

#### 3\. [Motion Tracking](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

If you love giving an artistic touch to your videos, then motion tracking is exactly what you need. This feature automatically tracks the object throughout the video. You can add graphics, stickers, or even blur an object in the video. Furthermore, it allows you to add text with the tracked objects, like a name title with a running athlete.

#### 4\. [Auto Reframe](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

With the help of the Auto Reframe feature, you can use one video on all social media platforms. The tool reframes your video in such a way that the main object doesn’t get removed. AI allows you to turn your landscape video into a vertical with a 19:6 aspect ratio. It saves you time and the trouble of creating different videos for every platform.

## Conclusion

And, just like Filmora, it comes with a stock media library that you can use as a resource for your projects (i.e., images, clip arts, etc.) Canva also comes with a Pro version that you can unlock if you want some of its more advanced features (highly recommended if you’re looking to create content for work or entrepreneurial reasons and not just for posting on social media. Especially since it will allow you to collaborate with others.)

## 03 Express It

You can say that "Express It" is Adobe’s version of Canva. It is available as an online tool and as a **photo collage with music** **app** that you can use for your smartphone or tablet.

Much like with Canva, this program has a built-in stock media library that you can use for your projects. It’s also primarily FREE to use, although you’ll need to pay in order to unlock some of its more advanced resources. It comes with the usual layouts for creating quick templates, but it’s most prized for its ‘free-style’ mode, which will allow you to create a collage that looks exactly how you want it to look.

## 04 Smilebox

Smilebox is an automatic video collage maker that is capable of turning photographs into a video collage without much input from you It’s the tool to use if all you’re looking for is a quick solution. By that, we of course mean the solution of the ‘upload-and-then-download’ variety

![Smilebox - Create Pic Collage with Music](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/8-free-photo-collage-with-music-video-maker4.png)

## 05 Fotojet

Next is ‘Fotojet’, which is an online collage maker that is incredibly popular for those that are looking for an easy solution. It works pretty much how you expect a collage maker to work. You choose from a list of ‘collage layouts’, choose the images that you want to place in the layout that you’ve chosen, pick out your music, maybe decorate the pic collage a bit (for example, you can add text, clipart stickers, etc.) and then you’re done

Much like some of the programs on this list, Fotojet isn’t an entirely free **music photo collage** tool. However, a FREE trial is available if you want to try it out for a quick project or two.

![Fotojet - Music Photo Collage Tool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/8-free-photo-collage-with-music-video-maker5.png)

## 06 Vimeo

Video is a professional online photo editing tool that’s incredibly popular with entrepreneurs. It actually works very similarly with all the other tools that we’ve introduced so far. That means that it comes with templates that you can use in order to create projects, it also comes with a ‘resources’ library that you can take advantage of in order to fill up said projects

As for creating a **photo collage with music** by using this tool. You will need to sign up to start creating, but it’s FREE to try — with some elements locked under the premium version.

![Vimeo — Create Picture Collage with Music](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/8-free-photo-collage-with-music-video-maker6.png)

## 07 Kapwing

KapWing is exactly what it looks like, it’s an online photo editor The best part about it is that it comes with quick collage layouts that you can use and the usual resources library. The layouts in question are customizable, allowing you to control what your **music photo collages** look like in the end. You also have the choice of creating said collage with photos, videos, GIFs, and music

![VEED.IO - Video Collage Maker with Music](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/8-free-photo-collage-with-music-video-maker8.png)

Here, you can define the area you want to record and the audio settings. Specify a location where you want to save your recorded file.

You'll need video editing software to put your series of CSGO gameplay clips together and make a montage video. While you'll find numerous desktop-based video editing programs available, choose the best one.

A reliable video editing software should be user-friendly. The last thing you want is to get a video editing program that will make you spend months trying to learn how to edit your first montage video.

Pick a program with video editing templates; this will allow you to create CSGO montage videos swiftly because you only have to substitute the existing placeholder media with the content you are making. It should also have special effects and music.

If you're tired of the plain and common video editing effects, check out Filmora. This video editing software has tons of cool effects that you can add to your CSGO montage videos.
