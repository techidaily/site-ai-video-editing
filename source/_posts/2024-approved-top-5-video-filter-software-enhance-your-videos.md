**Advantages:**

**Disadvantages:**

There are a few considerations to keep in mind. Adobe Premiere Pro operates on a **subscription-based** model, which means you'll need to pay a monthly or annual fee to access the software.

## Part 1 How to Make Animated Gifs in Procreate

As is already stated, Procreate is among the most affordable GIF creator and editing software. Creating GIFs here is a few minute stuff within a span of counted steps. Let’s have a broader see through of the creation process. Take the following quick steps and get started to make your exclusive Procreate GIF:

**●** **Step 1: Select an Artwork**

Launch the software in your device to reach the Procreate welcome screen, where you need to select an existing static GIF to work on from your device. You can also create a fresh one if you like. Having done that, make a right swipe on the ‘Canvas’ icon and select ‘Duplicate’. This creates a copy of your artwork, preserving all of its layers, so that you are free to make changes or stick to the original one according to your preference.

If you want to use a specific section of your image to animate, you can use the crop tool to remove unwanted portions. Next, you need to put together the specific layers you wish to animate and also remove any unwanted layers you don’t want to use.

![Procreate Animated GIF Creator](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/Easy-ways-to-make-procreate-gifs-1.JPG)

**●** **Step 2: Enable Animation Assist Tool**

From the Procreate tool gallery at the top, click on the ‘Wrench’ icon and select ‘Canvas’ from the ’Actions’ menu that drops down. In the interface that appears, enable the ‘Animation Assist’ tool with a right toggle. This will cause the ‘Animation Toolbar’ to appear at the bottom of the interface.

![Procreate- Animation Assist Tool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/Easy-ways-to-make-procreate-gifs-2.JPG)

**●** **Step 3: Add Frames and Make Image Adjustments**

At this instant, you need to make additional adjustments in your selected image and create a copy of the image frames. To get this done, navigate to the ‘Animation Assist Toolbar’ and long press the ‘Add Frame’ button. A duplicate frame will now appear on the screen. Within this frame, you need to move the image elements that you wish to animate. To do this, select an element and drag it to a convenient spot of your choice.

While you go through with object movement, the software simultaneously shows you a semi-transparent preview of your creation through its unique ‘Onion-skin’ feature. You can enjoy playing your animation at this very stage, or continue to create something more exciting.

**●** **Step 4: Enjoying? Let’s Continue.**

Repeat Step 3 to create long and smooth GIFs with additional frames. Take caution to create a copy of your latest frame (not the original one), in case you need to make any adjustments later on. Consider playing your GIF to see if you need to add extra frames or implement further changes.

**Step 5: Almost There.**

You may notice a jerky movement of your final image frames. This is on account of the ‘Default Play’ feature of the Procreate software that initiates a run of your creation from the beginning to end and loops on the same fashion.

To set this right, navigate to the ‘Settings’ tool of the ‘Animation Assist Toolbar’ and tap ‘Ping-Pong’ on the opening interface. Your animated Gif will now play in a forward to backward loop, resulting in a smooth frame movement.

**●** **Step 6: Time to Share.**

Once you are happy with your artwork, you can share it across different media platforms. To export your creation, navigate to the Procreate tool gallery and tap the ‘Wrench’ icon and select ‘Share’. In the ‘Sharing Options’ menu, you will be asked to make a format selection. You can share your creation in either of the GIF, PNG or MP4 formats.

You may even require a size modification in the created file with respect to specific sharing platforms. You can either select a web compatible resolution to shrink your file, or create a copy of the file to resize the same.

Once you get familiar with Procreate and its GIF creation basics, you have the liberty to explore the huge effects library offered by the software to give your animated GIFs the classy, professional touch. So why wait? Just get the software and start a never ending spree of Procreating GIFs.

From making simple static and animated GIFs to creating professionally sound market promotion tools; you can play with your editing skills to extract just anything from these quick snippets.

Having said that, let’s take a dive into creating animated **Procreate GIFs**. Being a relatively new dimension of GIF editing, a merge of the two produces matchless and classic results. Read through the further article to get a complete guide for working on GIF creation and editing with Procreate.

**●** **Underlying Concept**

Before you begin creating a **Procreate GIF**, let’s get a bit familiar with the concept behind this GIF creation utility. This one is an excellent and advanced means of exploring your skills in digital drawing and animations. It is one of the easiest GIF maker software that helps you to become a pro in animation creativity even if you are beginner and for the ones already into the skill, Procreate is simply heaven.

Procreate allows you to work with animation in its ‘Animation Assist’ tool, where you get a generous workspace with the perfect editing canvas to experiment with a plethora of tools, effects and filters to create exciting GIFs with basic and complex animation craft.

The software allows frame-by-frame animation that refers to working with different frames of a particular illustration, while making minimal changes in each frame. Once you finish, your final creation gets played in a motion loop.

## Part 1 How to Make Animated Gifs in Procreate

As is already stated, Procreate is among the most affordable GIF creator and editing software. Creating GIFs here is a few minute stuff within a span of counted steps. Let’s have a broader see through of the creation process. Take the following quick steps and get started to make your exclusive Procreate GIF:

**●** **Step 1: Select an Artwork**

Launch the software in your device to reach the Procreate welcome screen, where you need to select an existing static GIF to work on from your device. You can also create a fresh one if you like. Having done that, make a right swipe on the ‘Canvas’ icon and select ‘Duplicate’. This creates a copy of your artwork, preserving all of its layers, so that you are free to make changes or stick to the original one according to your preference.

If you want to use a specific section of your image to animate, you can use the crop tool to remove unwanted portions. Next, you need to put together the specific layers you wish to animate and also remove any unwanted layers you don’t want to use.

![Procreate Animated GIF Creator](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/Easy-ways-to-make-procreate-gifs-1.JPG)

**●** **Step 2: Enable Animation Assist Tool**

From the Procreate tool gallery at the top, click on the ‘Wrench’ icon and select ‘Canvas’ from the ’Actions’ menu that drops down. In the interface that appears, enable the ‘Animation Assist’ tool with a right toggle. This will cause the ‘Animation Toolbar’ to appear at the bottom of the interface.

![Procreate- Animation Assist Tool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/Easy-ways-to-make-procreate-gifs-2.JPG)

**●** **Step 3: Add Frames and Make Image Adjustments**

At this instant, you need to make additional adjustments in your selected image and create a copy of the image frames. To get this done, navigate to the ‘Animation Assist Toolbar’ and long press the ‘Add Frame’ button. A duplicate frame will now appear on the screen. Within this frame, you need to move the image elements that you wish to animate. To do this, select an element and drag it to a convenient spot of your choice.

While you go through with object movement, the software simultaneously shows you a semi-transparent preview of your creation through its unique ‘Onion-skin’ feature. You can enjoy playing your animation at this very stage, or continue to create something more exciting.

**●** **Step 4: Enjoying? Let’s Continue.**

Repeat Step 3 to create long and smooth GIFs with additional frames. Take caution to create a copy of your latest frame (not the original one), in case you need to make any adjustments later on. Consider playing your GIF to see if you need to add extra frames or implement further changes.

**Step 5: Almost There.**

You may notice a jerky movement of your final image frames. This is on account of the ‘Default Play’ feature of the Procreate software that initiates a run of your creation from the beginning to end and loops on the same fashion.

To set this right, navigate to the ‘Settings’ tool of the ‘Animation Assist Toolbar’ and tap ‘Ping-Pong’ on the opening interface. Your animated Gif will now play in a forward to backward loop, resulting in a smooth frame movement.

**●** **Step 6: Time to Share.**

Once you are happy with your artwork, you can share it across different media platforms. To export your creation, navigate to the Procreate tool gallery and tap the ‘Wrench’ icon and select ‘Share’. In the ‘Sharing Options’ menu, you will be asked to make a format selection. You can share your creation in either of the GIF, PNG or MP4 formats.

You may even require a size modification in the created file with respect to specific sharing platforms. You can either select a web compatible resolution to shrink your file, or create a copy of the file to resize the same.

Once you get familiar with Procreate and its GIF creation basics, you have the liberty to explore the huge effects library offered by the software to give your animated GIFs the classy, professional touch. So why wait? Just get the software and start a never ending spree of Procreating GIFs.

Procreate is undoubtedly an excellent tool for creating animated GIFs, but if you are looking for alternatives, another software to rely on is **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** GIF creator.

Before understanding the custom proxy settings, let us know what proxy files are.

### Proxy Files

Proxy files in Wondershare Filmora allow you to render and edit **4K** and other higher-resolution videos easily, regardless of your computer's processing power.

Another hack you can use to save space on your hard drive is Deleting the Render cache. But before we do that, let us understand what Render cache is!

### What is Render Cache?

Rendering can be a giant leap to give you a smooth performance experience. However, when you import your videos into the timeline, you can always render to have an uninterrupted playback experience.

Doing so will allow you to work in your zone quickly and efficiently. You can do a manual rendering before you begin the editing process. Or you can also opt to choose automatic rendering. In the automatic rendering option, you can continue your editing process. In the meantime, your timeline will be rendered.

### How to Delete Render Cache in Filmora

To save up storage space on your computer, you can delete your render cache by following the steps.

Step1 Click on **files** in the top left corner of the Wondershare Filmora home interface.

Step2 Go to **Preferences**.

## Part 4\. Remove Split Button on Playhead

## Part 5\. Copy and Paste Effects

Copy and paste are one of the oldest tricks in editing procedures. Wondershare Filmora comes with a range of commands and features that allow you to save time and be reliable.

Suppose you want to add an effect to a video clip in the timeline. Then, after adding the effect to your video, make custom changes to make it look more closely to the style you want. You can now use the copy-and-paste function to add the same effect to another clip. That helps you save a lot of time from tedious and time-consuming work.

### How to Copy and Paste Effects

While editing, you will need to ensure that your editing process is as clean as possible and that you have all the time on hand.

![wondershare filmora copy and paste effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/secret-tips-in-wondershare-filmora-5.png)

## Part 6\. Timeline Snap

You might have added multiple videos in the same timeline track. If you removed the video ahead of the video clip, you have to close the gap in between.

So, arranging and moving clips in the timeline are hectic and time-consuming. However, that is the case without timeline snapping.

### How to Apply Timeline Snap in Filmora

**Timeline snapping** will allow you to arrange video clips side by side without any breaks and cut-offs. Also, it will enable you to place it precisely above other video and audio gaps in the timeline.

Now you can easily enable and disable timeline snapping according to your choice!

## Part 7\. Color Code Video Clips

When editing footage from multiple cameras, you might want to organize which media is from which source in the timeline. You can do this by color coding your clips.

### Steps to Color Code Your Videos

Color coding allows you to edit all the clips marked with a particular color to be selected simultaneously without selecting them manually in the timeline.

To color code a video, follow the steps as mentioned:

## Part 8\. Group Clips Together

Now in an editing timeline, you might encounter a situation where you want to arrange a video clip with specific audio. Again, it allows you to stay organized and save up a lot of time.

Grouping clips together can also be helpful when you want to edit multiple clips in the timeline but want to maintain a particular order. The group will remain in its place and allow you to edit your other video clips quickly.

## Part 9\. Pan and Zoom Shortcut

Editing shortcuts are excellent. They allow you to save up a lot of time. Some people prefer to use a mouse only to edit their videos, but professionals always use a keyboard.

But there are some other shortcuts too! In these shortcuts, you would not necessarily need a keyboard; only a mouse will work and give a good outcome.

You might have seen those videos in which a specific screen ratio moves over a picture. Or, in some cases when you have to pan and zoom to create a flow effect.

Instead of **manually** adjusting the ratio of your videos and photos, Pan and Zoom shortcuts will allow you to use multiple features. These features allow you to select where your video or photo will start, zoom, and end.

These shortcuts are so easy to apply. Just go through the steps below, and you will accomplish the following:
