## **What Makes Movavi Video Editor Plus Appealing To Consumers?**

**[Movavi Video Editor Plus 2022](https://isoftfinder.com/blog/unbiased-review-for-movavi-video-editor-plus.html)** has a lot to offer in terms of features. Object Animation, Automatic Video Creation, and more built-in media are the highlights of Video Editor Plus 2022\. Let's see how they work together!

### **Interface**

The Movavi Video Editor Plus 2022 is one of Movavi's aesthetically pleasing apps. When selecting different tabs on the upper part of the interface, toolbars and tabs can be found at the top or on the left, and the tools will expand. Right on the right is a player that lets you preview samples of videos, transitions, titles, and so on. Even dozens of tracks can be added and edited at once to create your video, as you can add video, audio, and images to the timeline at the bottom.

### **Quick Video Creation**

This is one of the best features of this video editor. Adding a video, selecting a template, then adding loyalty-free audios will quickly create a video with the help of the video creation wizard.

### **Editing Tools**

You can edit your videos with all the editing tools necessary to make them more personal, such as Rotate, Crop, Trim, Split, Stabilize, Adjust colors, Combine, Stabilize, Pan and Zoom, Slow motion, Chroma key, Scene detection, Animate, Highlight & Concealed, Add logo, Overlay, etc. Applying an editing tool is as simple as selecting a video, choosing a tool, and configuring the settings.

In addition, it allows editing of video and audio properties, providing excellent detail treatment. A video can be sped up or lowered, normalized, changed opacity, reversed, faded in or out, and synchronized, equalized, noise removed, audio effects added, and the beat detected.

### **Creativity: Filters, Transitions, Titles and Stickers**

To make your video more personal, you will need to add filters, titles, transitions, and stickers. Movavi video editor offers free templates built-in and templates that can be purchased from its store. It has all the templates organized into themes, the design is very pleasing to the eye, and we are more likely to try these effects.

### **Sharing and output**

Unless you're actively streaming videos on video streaming platforms, this sharing feature may be helpful for you. Logging in allows you to upload videos directly to YouTube, YouTube Video, and Google Drive.

The export feature supports a wide range of video and audio formats that are highly frequently used. Leave them alone if you don't have a good reason to change the output settings. The program will display the current file size when you choose a different video quality, which is useful if you have limited storage space.

### **Tutorials**

It isn't easy to edit videos, unlike other tasks. An online video tutorial will be of great help if you wish to learn how to effectively use a video editor and perform specific video editing tasks.

Movi's instructions explain how to add files to the program and how to edit videos when you first run it. Additionally, it organizes all video tutorials in one place in the Notification panel for performing specific video editing tasks. You can play a tutorial by scrolling down. Every week, the tutorials are updated, greatly reducing the time it takes to get started with this tool and inspiring us to create amazing videos we would never have dreamed of.

## **Final Verdict**

There is no doubt that Movavi is a great video editor. It is often compared with the Movavi video suite, but they have their usage. It is feature-rich and comes with a variety of options. Overall, it is good, but if you are looking for something very professional and easy to use, it might not be the right option. Over the years, the Movavi downloads have increased rapidly, but if you want to create professional and eye-catching videos, then we recommend you to use the Filmora X video editor.

If you compare both these video editors, then you will find that Filmora is the more suitable option. It surpasses movavi video editor plus by every means whether you compare the features, video editing tools, or audio tools. It has a more intuitive interface, and you can try it for free for as long as you want. As soon as you are ready, you can purchase a subscription. So, what are you waiting for?

Wondershare Filmora is the best video editor to add all the popular and amazing video text effects. Filmora is equally popular among professionals and amateurs due to its wide range of text effects and intuitive user interface.

## Part 1\. Popular text effects in Filmora

There are unlimited text effects available in Filmora but some of them are extremely popular that video creators regularly use in their videos. Here is the list of the popular Filmora video editor text effects that you should be aware of.

### 1\. Text Swipe Effect

Text swipe effects are the most commonly used in today’s videos on social media and video streaming platforms. In this effect, the text slides into the video frame from a particular direction. The entire text can swipe in if it is a one-liner and it can even swipe in word by word or sentence by sentence.

If you want to show short texts and you do not want to experiment with text animations, the text swipe effect is the safest option. For example, if you want to display your social media handles, your location, a coupon code, or a correction phrase that you have uttered wrongly, text swipe effects should be on your video.

### 2\. Type Text Effect

The type text effect in Filmora is referred to as the typewriter text effect in Premiere Pro and After Effects. The effect displays the text as if it is being typed in real-time as it is done in a typewriter. The characters will appear on the screen with a cursor on the screen and therefore, it takes more duration than most other text effects.

The type text effect is particularly useful when you are displaying a large size of text on the screen. It is also widely used when showing a paragraph of text instead of a simple line. This helps in drawing the attention of the audience to the paragraph and retaining the attention for a longer duration of time.

### 3\. WordArt Effect

WordArt is synonymous with MS Word where large words have 3D effects and highlighted background. Apart from 3D effect, text can have a thick stroke or outline as well as a gradient color style when WordArt effect is applied. In Filmora, you will find a plethora of WordArt effects and some are them are modern while others have a retro feel to them.

The WordArt effect is particularly popular while displaying titles and funny texts on the entire screen or covering a large part of the video. These are mostly used in the opening or ending scenes of the video. Besides, some video creators use them while making transitions from one scene to another.

### 4\. Keyframe

If you want to create text animations as per your requirements, you have to use keyframes in any video editor. You can always apply the ready-made video editing text effects but if you want to customize and personalize, you can add keyframes in between two timestamps. Thereafter, you need to change text styles and parameters for each frame so that it looks like an animation.

If you want to add uniqueness to text animations so that you can make the audience wonder and appreciate, keyframes are the way. Adding keyframes in the text layer on Filmora is super easy and you can get effects like texts slowly scaling up, dancing randomly, changing fonts, and much more.

### 5\. Color Text Effect

The color text effect is becoming extremely popular and it is widely used for opening and ending credits. Flashing different colors through your texts and titles against a darker background can act as a feast for the human eyes. There are different types of color text effects available that can make your text stand out.

When you are using color text effect, you need to maintain a large font size for your text so that it is widely visible. Even if your background is not dark, you can use a darker box in the background of the text or a darker frame around the text to amplify the effect.

### 6\. Bounce to Zoom Effect

The bounce to zoom effect is widely used during a transition from one scene to another. It is regarded as a funny text effect where the text can swipe in and bounce and enlarge in size. Alternatively, the characters can bounce individually and zoom in and out with the motion as if they are dancing.

Apart from transitions, you can use the bounce to zoom effect to showcase a few important texts at the bottom of the video so that the viewers notice your text. Generally, the effect lasts for a few seconds before the text disappears. When you are using it for a larger text, you can use it for promotions and advertisements as well.

Part 1\. Popular text effects in Filmora

There are unlimited text effects available in Filmora but some of them are extremely popular that video creators regularly use in their videos. Here is the list of the popular Filmora video editor text effects that you should be aware of.

### 1\. Text Swipe Effect

Text swipe effects are the most commonly used in today’s videos on social media and video streaming platforms. In this effect, the text slides into the video frame from a particular direction. The entire text can swipe in if it is a one-liner and it can even swipe in word by word or sentence by sentence.

If you want to show short texts and you do not want to experiment with text animations, the text swipe effect is the safest option. For example, if you want to display your social media handles, your location, a coupon code, or a correction phrase that you have uttered wrongly, text swipe effects should be on your video.

### 2\. Type Text Effect

The type text effect in Filmora is referred to as the typewriter text effect in Premiere Pro and After Effects. The effect displays the text as if it is being typed in real-time as it is done in a typewriter. The characters will appear on the screen with a cursor on the screen and therefore, it takes more duration than most other text effects.

The type text effect is particularly useful when you are displaying a large size of text on the screen. It is also widely used when showing a paragraph of text instead of a simple line. This helps in drawing the attention of the audience to the paragraph and retaining the attention for a longer duration of time.

### 3\. WordArt Effect

WordArt is synonymous with MS Word where large words have 3D effects and highlighted background. Apart from 3D effect, text can have a thick stroke or outline as well as a gradient color style when WordArt effect is applied. In Filmora, you will find a plethora of WordArt effects and some are them are modern while others have a retro feel to them.

The WordArt effect is particularly popular while displaying titles and funny texts on the entire screen or covering a large part of the video. These are mostly used in the opening or ending scenes of the video. Besides, some video creators use them while making transitions from one scene to another.

### 4\. Keyframe

If you want to create text animations as per your requirements, you have to use keyframes in any video editor. You can always apply the ready-made video editing text effects but if you want to customize and personalize, you can add keyframes in between two timestamps. Thereafter, you need to change text styles and parameters for each frame so that it looks like an animation.

If you want to add uniqueness to text animations so that you can make the audience wonder and appreciate, keyframes are the way. Adding keyframes in the text layer on Filmora is super easy and you can get effects like texts slowly scaling up, dancing randomly, changing fonts, and much more.

### 5\. Color Text Effect

The color text effect is becoming extremely popular and it is widely used for opening and ending credits. Flashing different colors through your texts and titles against a darker background can act as a feast for the human eyes. There are different types of color text effects available that can make your text stand out.

When you are using color text effect, you need to maintain a large font size for your text so that it is widely visible. Even if your background is not dark, you can use a darker box in the background of the text or a darker frame around the text to amplify the effect.

### 6\. Bounce to Zoom Effect

The bounce to zoom effect is widely used during a transition from one scene to another. It is regarded as a funny text effect where the text can swipe in and bounce and enlarge in size. Alternatively, the characters can bounce individually and zoom in and out with the motion as if they are dancing.

Apart from transitions, you can use the bounce to zoom effect to showcase a few important texts at the bottom of the video so that the viewers notice your text. Generally, the effect lasts for a few seconds before the text disappears. When you are using it for a larger text, you can use it for promotions and advertisements as well.
