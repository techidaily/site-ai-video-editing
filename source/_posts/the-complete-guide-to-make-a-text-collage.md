## An Ultimate Guide to Edit a Music Video: Aspect Ratio and First Cut

Are you planning to edit your music video? Do you need on out how to edit your first music video draft? Editing a music video is a creative task but can be challenging.

One of the key elements of this process is selecting the aspect ratio and making the first cut. In this blog, we will explore these steps in detail, providing important tips and tricks. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced editor, get ready to take your music video to the next level. Let's get started.

## Which software will you need?

As we have a lot of software in the market, we must select the right software for high-quality editing. [**Wondershare Filmora**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is an amazing video editing software. It offers a ton of video editing tools. You can add special effects, transitions, and more to make your music video captivating.

**Note:** Before you start editing your project, make sure that you have a backup. You can copy the project to an external USB or hard drive for a backup.

## Adjust the aspect ratio

The aspect ratio is known as the size of the video frame. For example, the most common aspect ratios are 16:9 and 4:3\. The first number represents the width, and the second represents the height.

You should always ask your cinematographer about the aspect ratio. There are chances when cameras won't shoot at the intended aspect ratio they were framed for. In that case, you'll need to crop or letterbox them when editing.

![some common aspect ratios](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/some-common-aspect-ratios.jpg)

### How to find the width/height of the frame?

Most of the frames that are being shot on the camera are 3424 pixels wide, which is a little under 4k. If you have a measurement of one side of the frame, you can find the other by using some math. Let's suppose your frame is 3424 pixels wide. You can use this formula to find the height.

**Formula:** 3424 pixels wide **x** 1 high / 2.35 wide (or whatever your aspect ratio)

![1st step of the formula](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/1st-step-of-the-formula.jpg)

Now you can cancel out the width from the multiplier and the denominator.

\= 3424 pixels wide **x** 1 high / 2.35 wide

![2nd step of the formula](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/2nd-step-of-the-formula.jpg)

Now you are left with the equation:

\= 3424 pixels high / 2.35

After solving this equation, you will get the answer which is: 1457 pixels high. Let's adjust it on the music video as well, follow the steps given below:

![changing the width and the height](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/changing-the-width-and-the-height.jpg)

## Assembly

The next step is assembly. You will arrange the shots, clips, and elements in this process and get everything in order. It can be daunting and inspiring for you, as it's a blank canvas you are going to start with. Before editing, you can also get some guidance from your art director.

If your music video has shots of the band performing, drop them off first and sync them with the audio. On the contrary, if you are doing a narrative style, you can arrange the shots according to the story you want to portray.

![graphical text of assembly](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/graphical-text-of-assembly.jpg)

##### Step1Drop the media

You can start by dragging and dropping the music onto the audio timeline. Then you can add the shots of your music video.

![dropping the media onto the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/dropping-the-media-onto-the-timeline.jpg)

##### Step2Arrange the shots

Arrange the shots according to the storyboard you created and sync them with the audio.

![arranging the shots in order](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/arranging-the-shots-in-order.gif)

##### Step3Add the title

Once you arrange all shots in order, you can add the title of your music video. Click on the **Titles**, then choose your desired style and add the name of your music video in the title box. You can also change the text's size, font, and color.

![adding the title of the music video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/adding-the-title-of-the-music-video.jpg)

##### Step4Flip the clip

One last thing is, if you shot any scene in mirror-image format, you can flip it. Click on the clip you want to flip and select the flip icon in the video properties.

![flipping the clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/flipping-the-clip.jpg)

## Send your first draft

The first draft is the video in which you added audio and re-ordered the shots. You decided on the pace and flow of the video to create a basic structure. You made changes to make it interesting and captivating.

Before you put too much effort into editing your video, send it to your director, producer, or client for review. It will help ensure that any big changes can be made before you invest too much time in the edit.

For first drafts, you don't need anything fancy. A lower-resolution and more compressed file can make sending it to a director or client much easier. You can also add a timer on the music video, so the person reviewing it can give you accurate timing on where he wants any revision.

### How to add the timer in the music video?

1. Click on **Effects** and search for **Timecode** in the search bar.
2. Choose the timer style you like and drop it onto the new timeline.
3. Extend the timer to the end of the video.
4. Adjust the position and add the duration of your music video.

![adding timer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/adding-timer.gif)

Now you are all set to export the first draft of your music video. You can also adjust the video format on the export option, but MP4 is recommended.

## Conclusion

We hope this blog has helped you edit the initials of your music video. By adjusting the aspect ratio to fit the desired screen size and properly planning the first cut, you can lay a solid foundation for the rest of the editing process.

These two steps can greatly impact the overall look and feel of the final product. Remember to communicate with your director, producer, or client throughout the process to ensure that the final product meets their expectations.

## Here We Are, Now the Main Topic of Interest of This Article - How to Put Together Several Videos so that They Become One? This Case, Unlike Other Possibilities We Discussed Above, Is More Complicated, so We Will Study This Feature Step by Step

Sometimes, when working on a project, we really need to combine several videos - this way some content needs to be conveyed, there are shots that, when neatly sorted and merged together, really create visual and content value which we aspire to make; The process becomes more enjoyable if we work on the videos produced by ourselves, or if the work is to be done for our side project. People always take special care of their own work, and the same can be emphasized freely about the editing as well - about the packaging with which we have to deliver our videos to the audience. Even in the absence of an audience, maybe we want to make a kind of video collage for ourselves, our children, or in general, for the family to make delightful memories?

Of course, not everyone who has taken a camera or a mobile phone to take videos at least one time, even so, for family and friends, has the experience of editing and making various manipulations. However, the function of merging videos in various editing programs or on online platforms is so simple that it can be learned in just a few minutes, without the help of other people, and with a kind of small, though very useful result at the same time.

One of the programs where videos can be uploaded is VLC Media Player, which is a free-to-use, robust, and feature-packed software that plays a wide range of audio, image, and video files. It can play multimedia files directly from extractable devices or the PC. The program is unique, as it can stream from popular websites like Disney +, Hulu, Gaia, and Netflix. VLC Multimedia Player also accepts live video from PlayStation Live, Xbox Live, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. While most competing programs display advertisements, VLC Player does not, as it receives support from a non-profit organization.

![merge videos in vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/merge-videos-in-vlc-1.jpg)

Interestingly, we can, as though with the help of a magic wand, turn this particular video player into video editing software. When one computer program delivers too many functions, it might make us think of the situation where one person claims to serve ten professions at the same time - there is a mood that they will not be good in any of them. It's not true with VLC Player, which, from experience, seems to be both a good "player" as well as a fairly user-friendly editing software with many interesting features and functions.

Before we move on to video streaming, let's look at two features that we can use in VLC player:

* [Rotate a video in VLC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MxR2MnLomw)

In the player, right when our video clip starts to play, we may find that the footage is taken vertically instead of horizontally! This is not a nightmare just for video enthusiasts. If you don't know how to rotate the video, then you have to rotate your head 90 degrees, and at this time you can not even get pleasure from watching, not to mention that it can even cause your neck to lock up. VLC Player took care of that - in the top panel, just click on Tools, then select Effects & Filters. In the opened window, we find Video Effects, select Geometry and check the Rotate option - so, the whole 360 degrees are at our disposal!

* [Cut/trim video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtxpVJ5sX9M)

Sometimes it happens that we watch the video, we are crazy about one part of it, and the other part of it seems to spoil everything! Even if we are ready to publish the raw material on social media or just save it for ourselves, we just don't want some parts of the video to be there. So, it can be said - we are not satisfied with the full version and we wish to cut our clip and/or reduce its timeframe. VLC Player solves this problem "without any problem" - we find the View in the top panel, then we demand the cursor to aim for Advanced Controls button. As a result, a sort of video editor will appear, with its red record button on which we will click and the video will play until we reach the point where we want to split the footage. The cut video will be automatically saved in My Computer's My Video folder.

## How to Merge Multiple Videos in VLC Media Player

Here we are, now the main topic of interest of this article - how to put together several videos so that they become one? This case, unlike other possibilities we discussed above, is more complicated, so we will study this feature [step by step](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VioOE6tCg1g&t=1s).

The choice is yours, the main thing is to know all the alternatives and find the most time and energy saving, preferable option for you personally!

Interestingly, we can, as though with the help of a magic wand, turn this particular video player into video editing software. When one computer program delivers too many functions, it might make us think of the situation where one person claims to serve ten professions at the same time - there is a mood that they will not be good in any of them. It's not true with VLC Player, which, from experience, seems to be both a good "player" as well as a fairly user-friendly editing software with many interesting features and functions.

Before we move on to video streaming, let's look at two features that we can use in VLC player:

* [Rotate a video in VLC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MxR2MnLomw)

In the player, right when our video clip starts to play, we may find that the footage is taken vertically instead of horizontally! This is not a nightmare just for video enthusiasts. If you don't know how to rotate the video, then you have to rotate your head 90 degrees, and at this time you can not even get pleasure from watching, not to mention that it can even cause your neck to lock up. VLC Player took care of that - in the top panel, just click on Tools, then select Effects & Filters. In the opened window, we find Video Effects, select Geometry and check the Rotate option - so, the whole 360 degrees are at our disposal!

* [Cut/trim video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtxpVJ5sX9M)

Sometimes it happens that we watch the video, we are crazy about one part of it, and the other part of it seems to spoil everything! Even if we are ready to publish the raw material on social media or just save it for ourselves, we just don't want some parts of the video to be there. So, it can be said - we are not satisfied with the full version and we wish to cut our clip and/or reduce its timeframe. VLC Player solves this problem "without any problem" - we find the View in the top panel, then we demand the cursor to aim for Advanced Controls button. As a result, a sort of video editor will appear, with its red record button on which we will click and the video will play until we reach the point where we want to split the footage. The cut video will be automatically saved in My Computer's My Video folder.
