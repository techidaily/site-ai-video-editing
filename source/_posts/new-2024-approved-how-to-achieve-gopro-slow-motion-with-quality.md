## Part 1\. How to create slow zoom-in effect in [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

If you want to add slow zoom to any recorded video on your computer, you will need a dedicated video editor. There are many popular video editors available where slow zoom effect is not available. We recommend [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) which is a professional video editor that is available for Windows and Mac users. You will need to combine slow motion and keyframe to achieve the desired slow zoom effect. Here are the steps on how to create slow zoom in effect for your videos.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

Step1 Download and install Wondershare [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Launch the application and click on New Project option from the welcome screen.

![download and install wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/startup-window-02.png)

Step2 Drag and drop your video in Project Media folder. Thereafter, drag and drop the video into the Timeline.

![filmora drag video timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/filmora-drag-video-timeline.jpg)

Step3 Put the red header on the beginning part of the clip that you want to cut off and click on Cut(Scissor) icon. Then put the red header on the end part of the clip and click on Cut icon again. You should now have the separated clip for applying slow zoom effect.

![filmora video cut option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/filmora-video-cut-option.jpg)

Step4 Select the separated clip and click on Speed icon. Go to Slow option and select the speed according to the slowness of zooming you want.

![filmora slow option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/filmora-slow-option.jpg)

Step5 Now you have to add multiple keyframes so that the slow zoom effect is smooth and soothing. Right-click on the clip, go to Animation and click on Add Animation. Go to Animation tab and then to Customization section.

![filmora animation option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/filmora-animation-option.jpg)

Move the red header to the point where you want a keyframe and click on Add option. Similarly, move the red header slightly farther and add another keyframe. Keep adding like that till you reach the end point.

![filmora add header](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/filmora-add-header.jpg)

Step6 Double-click on the clip and go to Video> Basic> Transform. Select keyframes and slowly increase the scale slider for each keyframe to apply the zoom effect. Therefore, for every keyframe, zooming will increase gradually and you have already applied slow speed for complete slow zoom effect.
