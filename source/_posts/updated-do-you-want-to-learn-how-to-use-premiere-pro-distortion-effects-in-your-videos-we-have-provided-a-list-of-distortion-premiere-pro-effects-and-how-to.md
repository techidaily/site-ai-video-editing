Adobe Premiere Pro offers a wide variety of beneficial editing tools and effects. Below are some of the impressive distortion effects you'll find in Premiere Pro and how to use them in your project.

#### 1\. Corner Pin Effect

This effect distorts your image by simply changing the position of its corners. You can use the Corner pin effect to twist, skew, shrink, or stretch an image. Additionally, you can use it to simulate movement or perspective pivoting from the edge of your clip like a door opening.

You can directly manipulate the properties of the Corner Pin effect in the Program monitor by clicking the Transform right next to Corner Pin. To adjust the properties, drag one of the corner handles.

1. To use this effect, open Premiere Pro and click File. Choose Import from the drop-down menu. The File Explorer window will open and allow you to find your footage. Select the video file you want to import, then click Open.
2. Go to Effects Control and click Distortion. Choose Corner Pin Effect from the drop-down menu.

#### 2\. Lens Distortion Effect

This distortion effect Premiere Pro simulates the distorted lens through which people view the clip.

1\. Go to Effects Control>Distortion>Lens Distortion Effect.

2\. Choose the settings you want to use from the available options and adjust the slider.

* The Vertical and Horizontal Decentering control displaces the lens' focal and makes the image bend and smear. The image will wrap in on itself at extreme settings.
* The Curvature setting alters the curvature of the lens. You can specify a positive value to make the image convex, while the negative value makes the image concave.
* The Vertical and Horizontal Prism FX setting created results similar to horizontal decentering and vertical, but the image does not wrap in on itself at extreme values.
* Use the Fill Color option to specify the background color, and Fill Alpha to make your background transparent.

#### 3\. Magnify Effect

This effect allows you to enlarge a selected area of your clip. The Magnify effect acts as a magnifying glass set over an area of an image. You can also use this effect to scale the whole image far beyond 100 percent and still maintain resolution.

1\. To use this effect, go to Effect Control>Distortion>Magnify.

2\. Next, go to the left side of the Effects Control panel and make the necessary adjustments to suit your preferences.

* Shape: This control specifies the magnified area shape.
* Center: The Center control allows you to specify the center of the magnified section.
* Magnification: This setting lets users specify the percentage of the magnification of the area they have selected, while the values represent the scale percentage.
* Link: The Link control allows you to specify how the effect will link the Size, Feather, and Magnification amount, to enable them to decrease or increase proportionally. You will disable the Resize Layer option if you set the Link control to any of the available settings except None. Setting the Link control to any setting except None disables Resize Layer. Size & Feather To Magnification allows you to specify that the edge feather and size of the magnified section decrease or increase proportionally regarding the magnification adjustment.
* Size: This control allows you to specify the magnified area size in pixels.
* Feather: With the Feather option, you can specify the amount of feather the effect applies to the magnified area edge. Lower values will sharpen the edge. Higher values will soften the edge while blending the edge with the layer that's behind it.
* Opacity: This control allows you to specify the transparency of the magnified region.
* Scaling: Use this option to specify the kind of scaling the effect is using to magnify an image.
* Blending Mode: Use this control to specify the blend mode the effect will use to combine the original clip with the magnified area. The None option shows transparent pixels around the magnified section.
* Resize Layer: Selecting this option means the effect will only use the boundaries as the clip's edge when the magnified region extends beyond the original boundaries of the clip. Deselecting the Resize Layer means that the boundaries of the clip will crop any area of your image outside the bounding box of the original clip.

Adobe Premiere Pro offers a wide variety of beneficial editing tools and effects. Below are some of the impressive distortion effects you'll find in Premiere Pro and how to use them in your project.

#### 1\. Corner Pin Effect

This effect distorts your image by simply changing the position of its corners. You can use the Corner pin effect to twist, skew, shrink, or stretch an image. Additionally, you can use it to simulate movement or perspective pivoting from the edge of your clip like a door opening.

You can directly manipulate the properties of the Corner Pin effect in the Program monitor by clicking the Transform right next to Corner Pin. To adjust the properties, drag one of the corner handles.

1. To use this effect, open Premiere Pro and click File. Choose Import from the drop-down menu. The File Explorer window will open and allow you to find your footage. Select the video file you want to import, then click Open.
2. Go to Effects Control and click Distortion. Choose Corner Pin Effect from the drop-down menu.

![use corner pin effect in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/premiere-pro-distortion-effects-1.png)

![use corner pin effect in premiere pro - pin corner](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/premiere-pro-distortion-effects-2.png)

#### 2\. Lens Distortion Effect

This distortion effect Premiere Pro simulates the distorted lens through which people view the clip.

1\. Go to Effects Control>Distortion>Lens Distortion Effect.

2\. Choose the settings you want to use from the available options and adjust the slider.

* The Vertical and Horizontal Decentering control displaces the lens' focal and makes the image bend and smear. The image will wrap in on itself at extreme settings.
* The Curvature setting alters the curvature of the lens. You can specify a positive value to make the image convex, while the negative value makes the image concave.
* The Vertical and Horizontal Prism FX setting created results similar to horizontal decentering and vertical, but the image does not wrap in on itself at extreme values.
* Use the Fill Color option to specify the background color, and Fill Alpha to make your background transparent.

![lens distortion effect in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/premiere-pro-distortion-effects-3.png)

#### 3\. Magnify Effect

This effect allows you to enlarge a selected area of your clip. The Magnify effect acts as a magnifying glass set over an area of an image. You can also use this effect to scale the whole image far beyond 100 percent and still maintain resolution.

1\. To use this effect, go to Effect Control>Distortion>Magnify.

2\. Next, go to the left side of the Effects Control panel and make the necessary adjustments to suit your preferences.

* Shape: This control specifies the magnified area shape.
* Center: The Center control allows you to specify the center of the magnified section.
* Magnification: This setting lets users specify the percentage of the magnification of the area they have selected, while the values represent the scale percentage.
* Link: The Link control allows you to specify how the effect will link the Size, Feather, and Magnification amount, to enable them to decrease or increase proportionally. You will disable the Resize Layer option if you set the Link control to any of the available settings except None. Setting the Link control to any setting except None disables Resize Layer. Size & Feather To Magnification allows you to specify that the edge feather and size of the magnified section decrease or increase proportionally regarding the magnification adjustment.
* Size: This control allows you to specify the magnified area size in pixels.
* Feather: With the Feather option, you can specify the amount of feather the effect applies to the magnified area edge. Lower values will sharpen the edge. Higher values will soften the edge while blending the edge with the layer that's behind it.
* Opacity: This control allows you to specify the transparency of the magnified region.
* Scaling: Use this option to specify the kind of scaling the effect is using to magnify an image.
* Blending Mode: Use this control to specify the blend mode the effect will use to combine the original clip with the magnified area. The None option shows transparent pixels around the magnified section.
* Resize Layer: Selecting this option means the effect will only use the boundaries as the clip's edge when the magnified region extends beyond the original boundaries of the clip. Deselecting the Resize Layer means that the boundaries of the clip will crop any area of your image outside the bounding box of the original clip.

![magnify effect in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/premiere-pro-distortion-effects-4.png)

#### 4\. Mirror Effect

This distortion Premiere Pro effect splits an image along a line while reflecting one side onto the other. Where the reflection appears and which side will be reflected is determined by the reflection angles.

1\. Head over to Effect Control>Distortion>Mirror to use this effect.

2\. Adjust the controls until you get the results you desire.

* Reflection Angle: With the Reflection Angle control, you can specify the angle of reflection and where it appears on the clip. A zero-degree angle reflects the left-hand side on the right.
* Reflection Center: This control allows you to specify the position of the line. You need to click the box, then drag the resulting crosshair up to the area in the image where you would like to place the line.

![mirror effect in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/premiere-pro-distortion-effects-5.png)

02 [Need to Color Match in Video? There's an App for That...](#Part 2)

## Part 1 How to Match Paint Color Without a Sample

We will be discussing three methods in which you will get the perfect answer to the question of how can I **match my paint color** perfectly. So, let us jump right into the first method without further delay.

### 01**Method 1 Perfect Match Paint without a sample**

The following steps will help you attain **Perfect Match Paint** without the necessity of a sample.

**Step Clean the print area**

The first and the most essential step is to make the area where you will be painting clean and tidy. As time passes, fingerprints, marks, dust, and many other things accumulate and make the area dirty. And if you do not clean the same, then the paint you do on it becomes much darker, dull, and gives a shabby outlook.

Use a damp sponge, and if possible, it is better to use soap on the sponge. And most importantly, you will have to let the area dry out completely before you put it on to test the paint. Moreover, the new paint adheres much better than before when you clean the area.

![clean area](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-do-perfect-match-paint-100%25-the-easy-way-1.jpg)

**Step Scraping off**

The next step requires you to use a utility knife. And with that utility knife, you will have to scrap an inch or 2.5 cm of your wall paint. It is because, when you have a sample, you can easily bring that to the store for **paint matching near me**. Use a plastic bag to secure the sample price. It will prevent the paint of the sample to smudge or getting any marks or destruction.

And after you **find paint colors** that match the ones you need, try to dab a little of that paint on the sample. As a result, you will precisely know how perfectly the new shade of paint matches with the new one. It ensures optimum precision and can be the **best way to match paint**.

![scrapping off](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-do-perfect-match-paint-100%25-the-easy-way-2.jpg)

**Step Bring the object if possible**

The best way to maintain absolute precision in the match is by bringing an object to the store. You can also opt for a **car paint match near me**. If you bring the object with the color for matching, it ensures perfect matching and 10precision. Nowadays, the technology is highly advanced and will help you obtain the best paint match.

### 02**Method 2 Using a sample**

Since we have discussed the steps for matching paint without the sample, you must know how to match color with the help of samples. So, here are the steps for doing so.

**Step 1: Click a Picture of the original hue**

This step is necessary for better precision and matching the color as perfectly as possible. Clock a picture of the original color sample. The color in the photo might not be absolutely precise. But it can help to a large extent to match the color as perfectly as possible. You can easily take the sample to any renowned color matching store, like, **dupli color paint match** and have the perfect color matching done.

And it is better to not one picture or from just one angel. It will be best to take numerous snaps and that too, from different angles, sides and lighting conditions. It will help you get the original color shades in different angles, shades and lights, and it increases the possibility of matching the color as impeccably as possible.

**Step 2: Bring home more than one sample**

You will see numerous samples of paints that you feel will match the color you brought from your home as a sample of the original color. You might not be sure which sample perfectly matches the original sample color at that exact moment. However, if you find a sample that seems t match perfectly, you must not make your decision right at that moment. Because in the store, the lighting, angles, and many other factors play a hugely influential role in enhancing the shades of the sample colors.

So, the color you see in the store often does not remain the same in natural light settings; it might get a bit darker or lighter. So, it is always better to bring home those samples that you feel match the original shade of the sample you brought. This increases the possibility of being the most precise and impeccable in matching the colors.

![samples color match](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-do-perfect-match-paint-100%25-the-easy-way-3.jpg)

**Step 3: stick the sample and compare.**

This is the final step for matching the colors of paint with the help of a sample. After bringing home the samples that you found similar to the original sample, tape them to the wall. Take a sample at a time and use a tap to place them on the wall. You can also tape all the samples side by side, leaving enough gap between them.

It helps better compare and matches the sample's colors and the wall. A common thing that occurs is that in the daytime, you find one color matching perfectly, whereas, in the nighttime, some other sample color is matching perfectly. In such an instance, it is best to ask the store if they can give you the shade by mixing both the colors: the color that perfectly matched with the sample in the daytime and the color that perfectly matched with the sample in the time.

![taping samples](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-do-perfect-match-paint-100%25-the-easy-way-4.jpg)

**Step 4: Paint the samples on the wall**

It is an optional step, and you can opt for this step if you are not getting a hundred per cent confidence in choosing the correct color. Try to paint the colors of the samples that you are finding similar to the wall. Since the wall already has the original color, when you paint the sample colors on it, the sample colors clearly distinguish which samples match more impeccably with the actual color.

![matching color](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-do-perfect-match-paint-100%25-the-easy-way-5.jpeg)

### 03**Method 3 with the help of apps**

Since the technology has advanced in the most progressive way possible, you can easily match the paint colors through an application. So now, we will be listing down the steps that will help you match the paints with the help of mobile applications. The steps are given as follows.

**Step 1 Install the application**

You will find numerous mobile applications meant for matching paint colors. Opt for the ones you find the best and most efficient. Download it and install it on your phone. If you have used a renowned brand for painting, you can use their application. For example, you can use **Asian paints color matching** if you have used their brand of paints before.

![color matching app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-do-perfect-match-paint-100%25-the-easy-way-6.jpg)

![paint sample](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-do-perfect-match-paint-100%25-the-easy-way-8.png)

## Creating Video Testimonials

Video testimonials are a powerful way to generate trust and conversions. The key is to create videos that showcase your best customers’ most flattering moments, but you need the right elements in place first.

## Your script is vital

![write your script](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/write-your-script.jpg)

You know you need a script, but how do you make sure it's good?

* First, make sure it's clear and concise. Don't waste time on lengthy descriptions or flowery language. Your video should be easy to understand, so let the script do the heavy lifting for you. Don't get overly wordy; use short sentences and phrases that keep the viewer engaged throughout your testimonial.
* Next, research your subject matter thoroughly before writing any script content at all. This will ensure that people watching feel like they're getting an accurate portrayal of their company/product/service rather than just hearing what they want while they're busy doing something else (like trying out a new app).
* Lastly, once researched thoroughly enough to write detailed scripts, start working on writing those scripts into something coherent but still engaging enough for anyone watching regardless of whether they have any prior knowledge about whatever topic is being discussed by way of video testimonials.

## Your talent is important

![video talent](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/video-talent.jpg)

Talent is the most important element in creating a quality video testimonial, and this may seem like an obvious statement. However, it is important that you recruit someone who represents your brand well. This can be a celebrity, thought leader, or customer. If you are working with celebrities, for example, make sure they represent your products or services well and are not just there for the money (or social media).

If you are working with someone like a celebrity, be sure to interview them beforehand so that their story feels natural when telling it in front of the camera. In addition to finding someone who fits well with your product/service offering and brand image; look at other aspects such as age range and ethnicity when picking an appropriate talent partner.

## Use only HD resolution

![use only hd resolution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/use-only-hd-resolution.jpg)

* HD resolution is the minimum resolution you should use. If you're shooting a project that doesn't need to be broadcast at a high quality, then we recommend shooting your testimonial in standard definition (SD). But if it's possible, or if you have a higher budget, consider investing in HD equipment and filming in 720p or higher.
* This can make all of the difference when it comes to the clarity and quality of the video. Plus, when using HD cameras and editing software like [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), Final Cut, or Adobe Premiere, you'll get more than just better-looking images—you'll also be able to export files that are larger than those created by SD cameras.

## Filming elements are essential

![filming elements](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/filming-elements.jpg)

To get the most out of your video testimonial, first, you need to be close to the camera and look directly into it. This will increase the rapport between you and your customers, making them feel like they are right there with you—and in turn creating trust.

Then, you also need to be wearing good quality clothing that fits well. Having an outfit that makes you look attractive (but not overly sexy) can make all the difference when it comes to conveying confidence and professionalism.

Finally, smile while filming! This is important because smiling helps people connect with those around them better than any other facial expression can do alone. If possible, try smiling even before turning on your camera so that people can see who they are dealing with before having any contact at all!

## Where to place the videos

![share testimonial vdieo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/share-testimonial-vdieo.jpg)

Now that you've got your video testimonials in hand, it's time to put them to work. There are several key places where you should consider placing your videos:

* On your homepage
* On landing pages
* On blog posts or articles that mention the product/service being promoted (whether yours or a competitor's)
* In social media posts and ads that promote the product/service being promoted (whether yours or a competitor's)
* As part of email newsletters sent out by you and your client(s).
