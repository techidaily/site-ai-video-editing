## How to Create a Custom Sequence Preset in Premiere Pro

You've probably heard of Adobe Premiere Pro – it's a top-tier video editing software that's widely recognized in the market. But have you delved into the nitty-gritty of sequence presets? A custom sequence preset is your best friend for maintaining consistency across projects.

It allows users to save specific settings for sequence attributes like frame rate, resolution, and audio settings. Instead of reconfiguring these settings for each new project, a custom sequence preset lets you jump right into editing. Now, how do you create one? Keep reading!

## Part 1: How to Create a Custom Sequence in Premiere Pro

Creating a custom sequence is like tailoring a shirt to fit you perfectly. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you do just that:

### Step 1: Displays the New Sequence Window

Begin by launching Adobe Premiere Pro. Once opened, navigate to the top menu and select **_File_ \> _New_ \> _Sequence_**. This will open up the New Sequence window, where all the magic happens!

### Step 2: Change the Editing Mode to Custom in the Settings Panel

You'll see several tabs in the New Sequence window, but we will focus on the **"Settings"** tab for our purposes. Click on it.

Here, you'll find the **'Editing Mode'** dropdown menu. By default, it's set to a specific format like **'DSLR'** or **'AVCHD**.' Change this to 'Custom.' This will unlock a plethora of options for you to play with.

**Deep Dive into Settings:**

1. **Frame Size:** Define your video’s width and height. Remember, 1920x1080 is Full HD, and 3840x2160 is 4K. Choose based on your project needs.
2. **Frame Rate:** 24fps is the cinematic standard, but if you're creating content for TV or web, 30fps or 60fps might be more suitable.
3. **Pixel Aspect Ratio:** Stick with **'Square Pixels'** unless you have a specific reason to do otherwise.
4. **Fields:** Choose 'No Fields' for progressive footage. If you're unsure, this is a safe bet.
5. **Audio Settings:** Here, you can configure the sample rate, among other things. 48000Hz is standard for video.

### Step 3: Give the New Preset a Name and Save It

Once you've customized the settings to your satisfaction, it's time to save this configuration for future use. At the bottom of the New Sequence window, you’ll see a **'Save Preset'** button. Click on it.

A pop-up window will show up, requesting you to provide a name for your new preset. Choose something descriptive so you can easily recognize it later. Once named, click **'OK'**.

Your custom sequence preset is now saved and will appear under the **'Custom'** folder in the **'Sequence Presets'** tab.

## Part 2: Why Custom Sequence Presets are Essential for Efficient Editing

As you delve deeper into video editing, you'll begin to appreciate the little things that shave off minutes from your workflow, allowing you to dedicate more time to the creative process. This is precisely where the utility of custom sequence presets in Premiere Pro comes into play. But why are these presets so crucial?

* **Consistency Across Projects:** If you’re managing multiple projects or a series of videos, having a standard format ensures that all your content has a uniform look and feel. Consistency is a hallmark of professional-grade content. It's not just about the visuals – maintaining a uniform audio quality and format is equally significant. With a preset, you no longer need to remember the minutiae of each setting, ensuring consistency effortlessly.
* **Speed Up Your Workflow:** Every minute you spend adjusting the sequence settings is a minute less you have for cutting, color correcting, audio mixing, or adding those special effects that make your videos pop. Over time, those minutes can add up to hours. By using a custom sequence preset, you can jump straight into the creative part of editing without the preliminary setup.
* **Avoid Common Mistakes:** Have you ever rendered an entire project only to find that the frame rate was off or the audio was set to the wrong sample rate? These kinds of errors can occur when setting up a new sequence from scratch each time. By relying on a preset, you mitigate the risks of such oversights.
* **Personalized Templates for Different Platforms:** Different platforms may have varying preferred settings. For instance, the ideal video format for YouTube might differ from that of Instagram or TikTok. Instead of Googling these settings each time, you can have a custom sequence preset ready for each platform, ensuring your content is optimized wherever it's destined.
* **Ease of Collaboration:** If you're working as part of a team, having standard sequence presets ensures everyone is on the same page. This is particularly handy when multiple editors are working on different segments of the same project. With custom presets, you're not just aligning sequences but also visions.

Incorporating this practice into your editing routine might initially seem trivial, but its benefits compound with time.

## Part 3: Summary

Creating a custom sequence preset in Adobe Premiere Pro isn’t just about streamlining your workflow – it’s about ensuring consistency across your projects.

By saving your most-used settings, you're creating a base template that can be pulled up any time, granting you more time for the creative process.

Adobe Premiere Pro's interface is designed to make tasks like these intuitive, so even if you're a beginner, with a bit of practice, you'll be creating custom sequence presets like a pro.

Once you've customized the settings to your satisfaction, it's time to save this configuration for future use. At the bottom of the New Sequence window, you’ll see a **'Save Preset'** button. Click on it.

A pop-up window will show up, requesting you to provide a name for your new preset. Choose something descriptive so you can easily recognize it later. Once named, click **'OK'**.

Your custom sequence preset is now saved and will appear under the **'Custom'** folder in the **'Sequence Presets'** tab.

## Part 2: Why Custom Sequence Presets are Essential for Efficient Editing

As you delve deeper into video editing, you'll begin to appreciate the little things that shave off minutes from your workflow, allowing you to dedicate more time to the creative process. This is precisely where the utility of custom sequence presets in Premiere Pro comes into play. But why are these presets so crucial?

* **Consistency Across Projects:** If you’re managing multiple projects or a series of videos, having a standard format ensures that all your content has a uniform look and feel. Consistency is a hallmark of professional-grade content. It's not just about the visuals – maintaining a uniform audio quality and format is equally significant. With a preset, you no longer need to remember the minutiae of each setting, ensuring consistency effortlessly.
* **Speed Up Your Workflow:** Every minute you spend adjusting the sequence settings is a minute less you have for cutting, color correcting, audio mixing, or adding those special effects that make your videos pop. Over time, those minutes can add up to hours. By using a custom sequence preset, you can jump straight into the creative part of editing without the preliminary setup.
* **Avoid Common Mistakes:** Have you ever rendered an entire project only to find that the frame rate was off or the audio was set to the wrong sample rate? These kinds of errors can occur when setting up a new sequence from scratch each time. By relying on a preset, you mitigate the risks of such oversights.
* **Personalized Templates for Different Platforms:** Different platforms may have varying preferred settings. For instance, the ideal video format for YouTube might differ from that of Instagram or TikTok. Instead of Googling these settings each time, you can have a custom sequence preset ready for each platform, ensuring your content is optimized wherever it's destined.
* **Ease of Collaboration:** If you're working as part of a team, having standard sequence presets ensures everyone is on the same page. This is particularly handy when multiple editors are working on different segments of the same project. With custom presets, you're not just aligning sequences but also visions.

Incorporating this practice into your editing routine might initially seem trivial, but its benefits compound with time.

## Part 3: Summary

Creating a custom sequence preset in Adobe Premiere Pro isn’t just about streamlining your workflow – it’s about ensuring consistency across your projects.

By saving your most-used settings, you're creating a base template that can be pulled up any time, granting you more time for the creative process.

Adobe Premiere Pro's interface is designed to make tasks like these intuitive, so even if you're a beginner, with a bit of practice, you'll be creating custom sequence presets like a pro.

## Are You Aware that You Can Create Your Own Lower Thirds for Video? Read This Article for a Tutorial on How to Customize One

As a video creator, there are times when you need to use Lower Thirds. Although many lower-third presets are available, making unique and personalized ones can ensure your video stands out.

So, to empower your inner video creator, this article will show you how to make your own Lower Thirds in Filmora.

## Part 1: What is Lower Third

A Lower Third is a mix of motion graphic design and texts that are placed in the lower area of the screen. It provides additional information, such as a person's name or other relevant information, without distracting the audience from the main content.

Lower Thirds can be used in various settings, such as news broadcasts or interviews, to help provide viewers with additional context.

### (1) A simple line and texts

![a simple line and texts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-1.gif)

##### Step1 Create a simple line

Go to the **Media library > Sample Media folder > choose a color sample**. For this tutorial, we will select the white color. Then, drag and drop this sample color onto the upper video track.

![create a simple line](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-2.jpg)

Double-click the white sample clip to open the settings and scale it to 30%. Then, reposition the white bar to your desired place.

![double-click the white sample clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-3.gif)

##### Step2 Mask the white sample

Since we want to create a thin horizontal shape, you need to make some adjustments to the white sample by using an image mask. So, go to the **Effect window > Utility > Image Mask**. Then, drag and drop the “Image Mask” onto the white color sample.

![mask the white sample](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-4.gif)

After that, double-click the white sample on the timeline and find the Image Mask setting. Choose the shape that works best for your needs. For this tutorial, we are going to use this one. Then, adjust the X and Y-axis scale numbers until it becomes a thin white line. Click OK.

![double-click the white sample](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-5.jpg)

##### Step3 Add a text for your lower thirds

Go to **Titles > Plain Text > Basic 6** and drop it onto the second video track above the white line clip. Don't worry about the exact position yet. We can adjust it later.

![add a text for your lower thirds](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-6.jpg)

Double-click on the text clip to open the settings, then type some text there and adjust the size and font.

![double-click on the text clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-7.jpg)

##### Step4 Add animation to the text

Click **Advanced > Animation > Up Down 1** animation. Adjust the animation length by dragging the two brackets on the timeline on the right side. Click Ok.

![add animation to the text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-8.jpg)

##### Step5 Add keyframes to the white line clip when entering

Double-click on the white line clip on the timeline to show the animation keyframe setting window. Then, playback the animation of the text, find a position before the text animation starts and move the play head there. Make sure it is close enough to when the texts show up so the white line enters the keyframe right before the text enters.

![add keyframes to the white line clip when entering](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-9.gif)

Click to add a keyframe, double-check to make sure it is the final position you want, and the opacity should be 100 at this point.

After that, move the play head to the left for a few frames and click add again. To make sure the white line is out of the frame before entering, you need to change the Y-axis number. Change the opacity to 0 as the white line starts in transparent color.

![move the play head to the left](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-10.gif)

These two keyframes will create an effect of the line entering the frame while turning from transparent to white. Playback the animation and adjust the keyframes marks by dragging them to the left or right until you feel the timing looks good.

##### Step6 Add keyframes to the white line clip when exiting

Playback again to find where the texts disappear, then move the play head to a position after it. Also, make sure it's close enough to where the texts disappear so you can ensure the white line exits right after the texts disappear. Then, add the keyframe.

![add keyframes to the white line clip when exiting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-11.gif)

You don't need to change the setting this time because this keyframe is used to keep the position and opacity unchanged.

Instead, move the play head again to the right for a few frames and add another keyframe. Move the texts out of the frame by changing the y-axis number, then change the opacity to 0\. This keyframe is used to create the white line animation exiting the frame and turning back to transparent in the meantime.

![move the texts out of the frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-12.gif)

Playback the video and see how it looks.

### (2) A name card with a solid background

![a name card with a solid background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-13.gif)

Sometimes you might want to create a name card with a solid background like the sample above. To create it, we can use the same method. Here's how to do it:

##### Step1 Make the lower third background

Select the white color sample from the sample color folder and drop it onto the upper video track of the video.

![make the lower third background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-14.jpg)

Change the scale to 30%, then reposition the white sample to your desired place. Click OK.

![change the scale to 30%](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-15.gif)

##### Step2 Create an image mask for the lower third background

Drag and drop the Image Mask onto the white sample clip on the timeline.

![create an image mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-16.gif)

Double-click on the white sample clip to activate the video setting window and find the Image Mask settings. Then, choose the mask shape you need. You can also adjust its size by changing the X or Y-axis.

![double-click on the white sample clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-17.jpg)

##### Step3 Add some text

Once the background card is in place, go to Titles > Plain Text > ‘Basic 6' and drop it onto the third video track.

![go to titles](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-18.jpg)

Now, type in the texts as needed. Reposition and scale the texts to make sure they are on top of the background shape.

![type in the texts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-19.jpg)

##### Step4 Add animation to the text

Click Advanced > Animation > Push. Then, adjust the animation length accordingly. Click Ok.

![click advanced](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-20.jpg)

Double-click on the background clip to show the animation tab setting. Then, playback the text animation and find a position earlier than the start and add a keyframe.

![double-click on the background clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-21.jpg)

Similar to the tutorial before, move the play head again a few frames earlier to the left and add another keyframe. If you want to have the name card flying in from the left while expanding, you can change the X-axis and scale of the background card to 0\. Change the opacity to 0 to create a color change from transparent to white.

![move the play head again](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-22.gif)

To let the background card exit the frame, add two more keyframes to the background card. Add a keyframe with no changes to settings. Move the play head to the right for a few frames and add another keyframe.

![add two more keyframes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-23.gif)

If you want the name card to exit to the bottom, change the Y-axis number until it exits. Change the scale and opacity to 0\. Then, playback and adjust the keyframes.

Finally, you can add a Subscribe button from the new default Filmora element pack “Social Media.”
