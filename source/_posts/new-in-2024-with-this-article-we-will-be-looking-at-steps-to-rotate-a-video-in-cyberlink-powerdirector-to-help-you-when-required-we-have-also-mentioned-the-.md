## With This Article, We Will Be Looking at Steps to Rotate a Video in Cyberlink PowerDirector to Help You when Required. We Have Also Mentioned the Steps You Will Need to Follow in Wondershare Filmora

Video Editing is a craft that is highly dependent on various characteristics of your video. But the way one presents it or goes about filming clips also has a profound effect on the end product. And as you may know, not every aspect of a video production activity always goes without hiccups. But editing can come in clutch as it can easily solve minor problems like skewed footage that was shot at the wrong angle or is upside down (an issue that can happen while using mobile phones).

Thus, with this article, we will be looking at steps to rotate a video in Cyberlink PowerDirector to help you when required. We have also mentioned the steps you will need to follow in Wondershare Filmora.

**_Note:_** _We documented the steps in this guide with PowerDirector 365 and WonderShare Filmora X._

## Steps to Rotate Videos with CyberLink PowerDirector

Put yourself in a situation where you've just finished filming a project with your smartphone but end up realizing that the footage isn't in the right orientation by default. While the error has an easy fix on most smartphones, you can also perform this action with video editing tools.

Also, while this form of rotating might be the most basic implementation of the feature, you can often use the feature to add a dynamic nature to your video with Keyframes.

**Definition:** Keyframes in Video Editing is a software feature that allows an editor to set start and endpoints (denoted by In and Out Markers), presenting the opportunity to custom clip properties between the two positions. The set changes occur gradually as the playhead continues moving through the clip. Properties that can undergo modification with this method are zoom, rotation, colors, positions, etc.

The process of rotating clips is fairly straightforward; once you have PowerDirector 365 open, follow the steps listed below.

_If you do not have CyberLink PowerDirector 365, download the software by visiting_ [_Cyberlink's official website_](https://www.cyberlink.com/products/powerdirector-video-editing-software/features%5Fen%5FUS.html)_._

**Step 1:** Create a new video project in Cyberlink PowerDirector 365 and choose Full Mode.

![rotate-videos-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/rotate-videos-powerdirector-1.jpeg)

**Note:** Full Mode in Cyberlink PowerDirector 365 will provide users access to a full-featured video editing tool similar in function to Wondershare Filmora. The other option available is Ad Designer.

**Step 2:** Now, import media onto the Timeline from the Media Library.

For this guide, we used the pre-existing stock footage in Cyberlink PowerDirector.

![rotate-videos-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/rotate-videos-powerdirector-2.jpeg)

**Step 3:** Now, click on the video file on the Timeline; this will activate the video in the Preview Window. And it will provide you with access to the rotation circle, allowing you to change the orientation of the source file.

![rotate-videos-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/rotate-videos-powerdirector-3.jpeg)

**EXTRA**

Rotation added in the PiP Designer will function as a keyframe-based rotation action. Right-click on the video in the preview window, choose Edit and then Modify to access this menu.

![rotate-videos-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/rotate-videos-powerdirector-4.jpeg)

Following this, you can click on the Motion Tab, go into Rotation Settings, and modify the angle with greater precision. In the Preview Window, you will now be able to see the rotating video.

![rotate-videos-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/rotate-videos-powerdirector-5.jpeg)

## **An Easier Way to Crop Video with Wondershare Filmora**

Though Cyberlink PowerDirector 365 is a powerful video editing tool, we felt its menus were not as simple to navigate. Accessing the rotate function while available in the forefront, the use of PiP Designer didn't feel intuitive.

In Wondershare [Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) , rotating footage only happens via the Edit Option, and this straightforward approach felt simple. As for those who want to use Keyframes, the integration of this feature right above the Timeline is an appreciated convenience.

This emphasis on quick accessibility is present with almost every function in Filmora, and we believe this to be a significant advantage. The use of modern and unique iconography also increases familiarity, an aspect that will always be welcoming to new and budding creators.

_If you do not already have Wondershare Filmora, you can download the software by visiting the official website._

To help you learn how to use the rotate function and show you an example of the easy accessibility in Filmora, here is how you can use the feature to get the output you desire.

For Win 7 or later (64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For macOS 10.14 or later

Once you have a new project open in Filmora, follow the steps listed below.

**Step 1:** Import a Media File to edit into your Video Project.

![rotate-videos-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/rotate-videos-powerdirector-6.jpeg)

**Step 2:** Drag the video clip onto the Timeline and then select it with a mouse click to activate further interactions.

![rotate-videos-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/rotate-videos-powerdirector-7.jpeg)

**Step 3:** Choose the Edit Option (marked in Red).

This will bring up the Edit Window in the left-top corner of your screen.

![rotate-videos-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/rotate-videos-powerdirector-8.jpeg)

**Step 4:** Click on the Transform Menu and use the Rotation Slider to edit the orientation.

![rotate-videos-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/rotate-videos-powerdirector-9.jpeg)

Having read this stretch of the guide, we believe you may have noticed how Filmora is more user-friendly and accessible due to its menu layout.

**BONUS**

Click on the Keyframe Button (marked in Green) to access the Keyframe Menu that allows you to set points between which a decided amount of rotation can happen.

![rotate-videos-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/rotate-videos-powerdirector-10.jpeg)

## The Bottom Line

This marks the end of our guide on how to rotate video in PowerDirector 365 and Wondershare Filmora X. Now, while both software are high-capable tools, we feel the keyframe-based working on rotation in Filmora is a lot more intuitive and easy to use. The ability to only have number-based rotation within the edit menu is also a positive, as rotating with a swivel like in PowerDirector isn't always the most accurate.

And lastly, the modern iconography-based design of Wondershare Filmora is a factor to keep in mind, as this increases usability manifolds.

## Part 1: How to Create a Video Marketing Campaign

![ready to use video templates for marketing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/03/a-guide-to-effective-video-marketing-in-2024-1.jpeg)

Launching a video marketing campaign requires considerable planning and preparation. Follow these best practices for video campaign success:

##### 1.Set Goals and Identify Your Audience

The aim of video marketing for small businesses or large businesses should be tied to business objectives, such as raising brand awareness, educating consumers, or driving conversions. First and foremost, define these goals.

Who are you trying to reach with video content? You need a clear picture of this. Collect insights about audiences with regard to demographics, interests, values, media habits, and existing brand impressions. With these insights, you can create unique content that appeals to your target viewers.

##### 2.Conduct Market Research

Research what kinds of videos connect with your audiences by accounting for competitors and non-competitors successfully using video. Identify videos with the most hits, shares, subscribers generated, and other metrics through channels like YouTube Analytics, Tubular Labs or SEMrush.

From the data, conclude common themes around video length, preferred formats for content, production methodologies, and so on, which should then serve to guide your own content.

##### 3.Craft a Compelling Story

Every great marketing video is a story. Draw a story plot with rising tension and emotion leading to resolution. The story's exposition, rising action, climax, and denouement can be outlined by famous storytelling frameworks.

Narratives that keep viewers engaged from beginning to end result in better videos. Early validation for your script ideas can be gathered through focus groups, social listening, surveys, and interviews with members of your target audience.

##### 4.Produce Video/Audio with Quality

Bring your story to life by investing in experienced video producers. Budgets may be wildly divergent, so always aim to achieve the best production quality.

Feature crisp, bright camerawork, professional editing, and transitions. Be sure to use intense music to underscore emotional peaks and simple but eye-catching visual effects where they make sense.

For audio, manage volumes between scenes at the same level; minimize background noise; have clear dialogue and smooth mixing. Good video and audio keep viewers glued to your content.

##### 5\. Select Suitable Video Platforms

Research where video marketing is most effective in your niche, and figure out which social platforms and media sites your target audiences use.

Being present on several different platforms is every strategy's dream. However, the real key is finding out where your audiences are most engaged and directing them there with video content tailored for the individual user experience by the platform.

##### 6.Implement a Strong Call-to-Action

The ending of every video narrative should take the viewer toward an action. Clicks to websites? Subscriptions to YouTube channels? Form fills? App downloads?

Your final message in your video clears CTA. Add supporting calls-to-action in the form of superimposed graphics, cards, or endscreens outside of the video to direct traffic beyond that medium and give more expression to the story.

##### 7.Track and Optimize Performance

After videos are posted, collect data on performance. Such indicators include view counts, average % viewed, changes in viewership over time, referral traffic, subscribers gained (added), conversion rates, and so on.

Feed analytics insights into an optimization road map. To inform new video projects targeting the same KPIs, look at higher versus lower-converting videos. Test repetition of the same content on different media platforms at various time intervals, with varying images of thumbnails and so forth, to improve metrics.

## Part 2: 3 Typical Types of Marketing Videos

![AI text to speech tool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/03/a-guide-to-effective-video-marketing-in-2024-2.jpeg)

There are some video formats that particularly suit certain marketing objectives. Let's explore some of the most versatile, effective genres with real-world examples:

##### 1\. Explainer Videos

Knowing how to simplify and explain complex products, services, or concepts is precisely what Seasoned Explainers do. They use motion graphics, cartoons, live action--it's all good. They express it interestingly and help audiences understand value offerings they may be unfamiliar with.

##### 2\. Tutorial Videos

A good video tutorial leads audiences through a process one can use to employ the product, carry out the method, or develop the skill. Hands-on learning material meets user information needs, indirectly promoting brand owners of the know-how.

##### 3\. Behind-the-Scenes Content

These videos give audiences an insider’s perspective on making popular products. Getting a peek behind the curtain helps pique viewer curiosity while humanizing brands through interviews, b-roll footage, and more.

## Part 3: 6 Tips for making your video effective

![Video editor tool on Filmora V13](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/03/a-guide-to-effective-video-marketing-in-2024-3.jpeg)

Creating personalized video marketing strategies that effectively engage your target audience and achieve your marketing goals requires careful planning and execution. You need to grab viewer attention fast, communicate your key messages clearly, and provide strong calls to action.

The key is to keep it concise, optimize for sound-off viewing, build in interactivity, showcase user-generated content, partner with influencers, and more. Apply these best practices for getting your marketing videos noticed and acted upon:

##### 1.Keep It Concise

With a sea of content competing for viewer attention getting longer daily, shorter is better. Videos under 1 minute perform far better for driving clicks, conversions, completes, and shares. Test even 6-second bumper ads on YouTube and Facebook.

##### 2\. Capture Attention Early

You have seconds to hook audiences scrolling feeds non-stop. Dynamically edited intros with eye-catching colors, quick cuts, and dramatic questions/facts immediately grab interest versus slow fades or titles.

##### 3.Make Sound Optional

85% of videos are now watched without sound on mobile devices. While strong audio is still important for reeled-in viewers, ensure critical info is communicated visually as well.

##### 4.Incorporate Interactive Elements

Leverage platform tools like YouTube cards, info cards, links, hashtags, Q&As and more to keep audiences actively engaged with video content instead of passively viewing.

##### 5\. Spotlight User-Generated Content

User videos reviewing products or demonstrating branded tutorials often outperform corporate studio content now. Repurpose this UGC via reaction videos, contest highlights, and “best of” community compilations.

##### 6.Build Influencer Partnerships

Collaborations with influencers popular with your target demos lend video credibility. Support creators with gear, access, co-promotion, etc., in exchange for branded integration and affiliate sales.
