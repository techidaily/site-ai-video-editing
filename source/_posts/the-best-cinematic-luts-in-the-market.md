All you have to do most of the time is to choose a layout that you like and then fill it with the photographs, videos, GIFs, etc. that you want. Most programs also give you the choice to add things like text (for making the collage more meaningful), stickers, frames, and so on, so that you can fully deck out your photo collages exactly how you want to.

PhotoPad is an old-school photo collage editor for PC that’s been around for a while. It’s a particularly good choice for those who choose to stick to the older versions of Windows (like XP or Vista), as you don’t see a lot of the newer software supporting those anymore.

Much like many of the other software that we included in this list, this one is more of a general photo editor than one strictly made for collages. However, it does come with functionalities for that, so you shouldn’t miss out on anything

**Reasons to Buy:**

**●** Supports older Windows OS Systems

**●** Advanced photo editing functions

**●** Collage Feature for creating quick and easy collages

## **●** Final Words: 2024 Guide of 8 Photo Collage Apps for PC **→**

**●** What’s the benefit of using a **photo collage?** What can it actually do for you? We answered these questions in the first section of this article

**●** As for the recommendations that we promised for the best photo collage apps, software, etc. for 2024, we chose to include a wide variety so that you can have plenty to choose form.

**●** If you want a general recommendation from the list that we included, we recommend using something like Filmora, Canva Pro, Express It, etc. that comes with a built-in resource library that you can take advantage of for filling up your future collage projects.
