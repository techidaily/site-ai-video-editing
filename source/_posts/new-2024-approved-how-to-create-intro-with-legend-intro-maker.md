## Part 2: How to Edit Time-lapse Video on Computer

Time-lapse videos are becoming more and more popular nowadays. They are a great way to show the passage of time, but editing them on a computer is not an easy task. Editing time-lapse videos on a computer is not an easy task because it requires you to have the right software and know how to use it.

It's just about learning the basics of editing and then adding a few effects to make your video more interesting. Here are some tips on how you can edit time-lapse videos on your computer:

* The first thing you need to do is download and install a video editor for your computer.
* Import the timelapse footage into the video editing program that you have downloaded and installed, such as Adobe Premiere Pro or Sony Vegas Pro, etc.
* Now you need to trim out any unwanted footage at the beginning or end of the clip so that what remains is just what you want to show in your final video.
