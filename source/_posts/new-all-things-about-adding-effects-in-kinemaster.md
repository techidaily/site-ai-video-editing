**_Step 2: Import the Downloaded VN Filter APK_**

Here comes the cool part! To get new custom filters:

1. Visit the website or store where the VN filters are available for download. (**Hint:** Search for “vn filter download APK" or "vn iPhone filter download” based on your device.)
2. Once downloaded, head back to the VN app and click the **'Add'** or '+' icon in the **“My Filters”**
3. Navigate to your device's download folder or wherever the vn filter apk is saved.
4. Select the filter file (it should have a .apk or similar extension for Android users and a different format for iPhone users).
5. Tap on **'Import'** and wait for the magic to happen. Your brand-new filter will now be housed in **“My Filters”**!

**_Step 2: Save the Filter Preset and Use It Directly Next Time_**

After importing your snazzy new filter, the next step is super easy. Simply apply it to your video, and if you love how it looks, save it as a preset. This way, the next time you're editing, you can head straight to **"My Filters**," find your favorite custom filter and slap it onto your video without a hitch. Talk about convenience!

## Part 3: Best Alternatives

Though VN offers many fantastic filter options, it's always nice to have alternatives, right? Meet Filmora, another stellar video editing tool known for its expansive video filter collection.

Filmora is more than just an editor; it's a canvas for videographers. One of its most raved-about features is its extensive range of video filters.

1. Launch Filmora and import your video.
2. Head to the **“Effects”** tab and immerse yourself in the filter options.
3. Preview, select, and apply – it’s that simple!
4. Like VN, Filmora allows you to tweak the filter settings for that perfect look.

While Filmora is a great tool, the best fit depends on personal preferences and specific project needs. However, it's always good to have choices in your editing toolkit. Variety is, after all, the spice of life (and video editing)!

## Best Cloud Storage Service for Videos

Which **video cloud storage** service is the best for storing videos? Many options are available, so it can be hard to decide which is the best for you.

Some factors to consider when choosing a cloud storage service for videos include how easy it is to use, the number of storage options available, and the price.

Some popular **best video cloud storage** services for videos include Flicker, Wondershare Drive, and Adobe Creative Cloud. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages, so it's essential to consider what you need before making a decision.

Ultimately, the best cloud storage service for videos is one that meets your specific needs. So don't hesitate to try out different services to see which one is best for you.

## Part 1: No.1 Flicker

Flickr is an online image hosting and video hosting service that has been around for a long time. However, SmugMug now owns it, and you can access photos and videos from Flickr without registering an account.

<a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068416/7443" target="_top" id="2068416"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068416" border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068416/7443" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Flicker Free Storage Policy

Flickr is a great **online video storage** service, but it can be limiting if you want to store many pictures and videos. For example, a Flickr free account can only store 1000 photos and videos, which means it can only hold about 2-3 GB of data.

Flickr also has some limitations when it comes to file size. For example, photos are limited to 200 MB and videos are limited to 1 GB. However, you can get around these limitations by storing the maximum allowed file size (e.g., photo files are limited to 200 MB and video files are limited to 1 GB). Additionally, if you want to share photos and videos with others, you'll need to **upload video to the cloud** or use the Flickr app on a device.

Overall, Flickr is a great online photo and video storage service, but it may not be the best option for you if you're looking for a lot of space or want to share photos and videos with others.
