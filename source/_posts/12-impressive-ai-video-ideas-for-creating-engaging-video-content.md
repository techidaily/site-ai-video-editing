This tool will be more beneficial for the content creators to get more **AI video ideas**.

Before starting a YouTube channel or posting a video, know your area of interest first. Once you get clarity on the area of interest, it's easy to pick a topic from that and create an innovative video. Try to be more specific in the topic you choose. Also, have clarity on the section of audience you want to target.

For example, if your topic is more related to children, add more animations of animals/ cartoons that interest children. If you choose a related topic, do not add more animations that might confuse the audience. Add more reference links so that they can refer to those and be more particular on the specific topic you are trying to explain through the video. Similarly, if you choose a gaming-related topic, do not be more general about gaming.

Be specific towards a particular section of games like mobile gaming/ desktop/ virtual to reach more audience, and it does not seem boring to the audience.
