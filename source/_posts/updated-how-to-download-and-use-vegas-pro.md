A lot of times, you'll get a video file that was shot in low light, and it will make your subject look dark and underexposed. Video brightness is an important feature that is easy to adjust. However, if your video is too dark to start off with, it may be difficult to brighten it in a way that doesn't look unnatural.

There are several ways you can brighten a dark video. For example, you can use color correction or add more light to the scene before you film. If you already have a dark video, then you'll need to adjust the contrast and brightness of your video during post-production.

Enhancing your videos with Premiere Pro is easy once you know the proper steps to do so. Just follow the steps described below:

### Step 1

In the effects panel, search for "unsharp Mask" and drag it to the video clip.

![enhance video in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/premiere-pro-brighten-video-8.png)

### Step 2

In the effect control panel under the Unsharp mask, set the amounts, radius, and threshold to enhance the video.

![enhance video in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/premiere-pro-brighten-video-9.png)

Keep in mind that you can increase the values of these parameters too high, but you will end up with a distorted video. Try increasing the values by small increments and see what happens. Avoid increasing the "amount" and radius value beyond 100% and ten, respectively.

## Conclusion

● Brightening in Premiere Pro is a simple process that can benefit some video projects. Whether you want to brighten the video by increasing exposure, increasing luminance, or adding a vignette effect altogether, there are several ways to do so in Premiere Pro.

● However, you should know that neither option is necessarily better than the other. Video editing in general does take a bit of practice to master, but in this article, we have provided you with the basics and helped you on your way. All methods can be helpful in different situations, and even with similar circumstances, you might find advantages to all practices. Try out these methods for yourself and see which one best suits your needs.
