## Part 1 **What Is Freeze Frame Video Editing?**

**Freeze frame** video editing is a video editing technique that halts movement in a video for a given period. It converts moving pictures into still photography for some time. These video editor effects help filmmakers gear attention to the video editing or filmmaking process. In other words, they are self-reflexive.

## Part 2 **Ways to Use Freeze Frame in Video editing**

Freeze frames can be helpful in 3 significant ways in video editing;

**●** At the beginning of a movie/video: Freeze-frame at the beginning helps you pique the audience's interest and give them a sneak peek of what to expect in the movie. This **freeze-frame** technique was used in the film 'Good Fellas' to pique the audience's interests.

**●** At the end: Using a freeze-frame allows the audience to choose or decide how the movie ends, whether it is obvious. The 'breakfast club' filmmakers use a freeze-frame at the end to emphasize the young boy.

**●** In the middle, subtly capturing intense moments like in the movie 'The Departed.'

## Part 3 **What are the Best Freeze-Frame Video Editing Examples?**

It takes a great deal of skill to employ freeze frame with the best results correctly. It might bore the audience or give another impression other than the intended when not done effectively.

But several movie directors have effectively used the **freeze-frame** video editing technique that wowed the audience.

Here is a list of the best **freeze frame examples** you would love;

## Part 1 **What Is Freeze Frame Video Editing?**

**Freeze frame** video editing is a video editing technique that halts movement in a video for a given period. It converts moving pictures into still photography for some time. These video editor effects help filmmakers gear attention to the video editing or filmmaking process. In other words, they are self-reflexive.

## Part 2 **Ways to Use Freeze Frame in Video editing**

Freeze frames can be helpful in 3 significant ways in video editing;

**●** At the beginning of a movie/video: Freeze-frame at the beginning helps you pique the audience's interest and give them a sneak peek of what to expect in the movie. This **freeze-frame** technique was used in the film 'Good Fellas' to pique the audience's interests.

**●** At the end: Using a freeze-frame allows the audience to choose or decide how the movie ends, whether it is obvious. The 'breakfast club' filmmakers use a freeze-frame at the end to emphasize the young boy.

**●** In the middle, subtly capturing intense moments like in the movie 'The Departed.'

## Part 3 **What are the Best Freeze-Frame Video Editing Examples?**

It takes a great deal of skill to employ freeze frame with the best results correctly. It might bore the audience or give another impression other than the intended when not done effectively.

But several movie directors have effectively used the **freeze-frame** video editing technique that wowed the audience.

Here is a list of the best **freeze frame examples** you would love;

### 01**The Departed**

![The Departed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-freeze-frame-video-editing-1.jpg)

In this 2006 movie, an undercover cop and a mole try to identify each other. Scorsese shows his editing prowess once again as he uses freeze-frame more subtly.

He changes the frame speed instead of stopping on one frame for a considerably longer time. This emphasizes some memorable moments that you may overlook on a first watch.

### 02**Rocky III**

![Rocky III](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-freeze-frame-video-editing-2.jpg)

The **freeze-frame** came in during the final match between Apollo and Balboa in this movie.

During the first 3 Rocky movies, Apollo and Balboa had an intriguing rivalry. At the end of Rocky III, the duo decides to engage in a friendly battle to determine who was the Lord in boxing.

The movie ends in a freeze-frame with Rocky swinging a right hook after Apollo imitates the bell, saying, "Ding Dong."

The freeze-frame allows the audience to guess who the winner will be, thus a longer time to think of the movie after watching.

### 03**400 Blows**

![400 blows](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-freeze-frame-video-editing-3.jpg)

In 400 Blows, the main character Antoine, a young Parisian, was hardly out of trouble.

In an attempt to end his troubles, he arrives at the beach after running away from a soccer match.

He is faced with either jumping right in or going back. The movie ends in a freeze-frame as no one finds out. The decision was left to the audience.

### 04**Thelma and Louise**

![Thelma and Louise](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-freeze-frame-video-editing-4.jpg)

Thelma and Louise is about two (2) friends, Thelma Dickinson and Louise Sawyer. They both rise to defend themselves in a male-dominated world. In the film, Thelma and Louise are both running from the authorities. Louise killed a man who almost raped her friend, Thelma, thus the run. Things get out of control as they try to escape to Mexico, away from the authorities.

While on the run, they get ambushed by the police towards the grand canyon. The audience, at this point, is in suspense as to whether the ladies will survive or not.

Instead of surrendering, they drive right into the grand canyon, and the movie ends in a **freeze-frame** as they get caught hanging in the air while plunging into the canyon.

Regular movies might decide to give us all the details of the car plunging and exploding.

### 05**The Wolf of Wall Street**

![The wolf of wall street](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-freeze-frame-video-editing-5.jpg)

Scorsese uses freeze-frame at the beginning of this movie, just as he did in Good Fellas. The freeze-frame effect here helps introduce the character and shows us the plot of the movie hence piquing the audience's interests immediately.

### 06**Out of Sight**

![Out of Sight](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-freeze-frame-video-editing-6.jpg)

This movie is another excellent example of **freeze-frame** video editing. What other way to pique the audience's interest significantly and emphasize them than capture them in a freeze-frame.

### 07**Death Proof**

![Death Proof](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-freeze-frame-video-editing-7.jpg)

In this movie, the freeze-frame stays till the very end. It captures three women as they raise their hands-on celebration after successfully beating to death a psychopath who has been killing young women.

### 08**Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid**

![Butch Cassidy and Sundance kid](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-freeze-frame-video-editing-8.jpg)

This movie follows two train robbers, Butch Cassidy and Harry Longabaugh, known as the 'Sundance Kid.' After conducting several robberies, they go on the run as the authorities pursue them. After a gun battle with the authorities, they take cover inside a building, but they get surrounded with no other escape route.

Thus they decide to engage in the last fight instead of surrendering, and you see them in a gun battle with the authorities. The movie ends with them caught in a **freeze-frame** brandishing their guns at the officers instead of actual bloodshed. Though we all know they will get killed.

### 09**Good Fellas**

![Good fellas](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-freeze-frame-video-editing-9.jpg)

Initially, we mentioned that a freeze-frame could be of use at the beginning of a movie. Scorsese used this effectively in 'Good Fellas' to emphasize the movie plot.

In the opening scene, the characters Henry, Jimmy, and Tonny, played by Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, and Joe Pesci, respectively, stop their car in the middle of the road.

They open their truck and see a man badly wounded and beaten, Tonny stabs him, and Jimmy shoots him. Henry then closes the truck and looks on in a **freeze-frame** before uttering the lines, "As far back as I can remember, I have always wanted to be a gangster."

This lets us know right away what will happen in the movie. That person will get killed, and this is the mob territory.

### 10**Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban**

![Hardy Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-freeze-frame-video-editing-10.jpg)

## Cropping Videos in Final Cut Pro [Step by Step]

“Storytelling at its most powerful”, - words we read on the first page of the official web-site of Final Cut Pro, non-linear video editing software program which runs on Mac computers. The software lets us to log and transfer videos onto a hard drive, where it can be edited, processed, and output to a wide variety of formats. Final Cut Pro is so advanced that it is used by hobbyist filmmakers and industry professionals in TV, Film, and media. Anyone can get a free trial of the software for their Macs, but, to purchase directly from the Mac App Store it costs $299.99\. It’s evident that Final Cut Pro can’t be downloaded, installed, and thus used on Windows, which is unfortunate, but for Mac users, it’s a very powerful video editing software.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-1.jpeg)

What are the features this advanced computer program offers to Mac users? – itreads on the web-site of Final Cut Pro:

* Object Tracker and Cinematic mode;
* Blazing pro performance;
* Editing, audio, motion graphics, color grading, and delivery;
* The best plug-ins, effects, and tools from leading developers.

One of the most impressive things about Final Cut Pro is that through it, you can create 2D and 3D titles right in the program, apply and modify filters, and use the built-in chroma key for high-quality green- and blue-screen effects. But, one should not be alarmed when it comes to experience and knowledge in editing – even though Final Cut Pro seems so advanced with its powerful tools and the possibilities it contains, it is designed for easy use and can be used by amateurs as well as professionals.

The interface, which, when it comes to editing, is one of the most important aspects (if not the main one!), seems quite standard - an ordinary window configuration, sidebar with libraries, events, projects, collections… If you want to know more about the basics of Final Cut Pro, it would be helpful to watch a [beginner tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygBlgaT78mM), with the length of only 20 minutes, an introduction of the whole program.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-2.jpeg)

Anyway, the main topic of this article is about cropping – how to crop a video in Final Cut Pro? If you are a Mac user and have this program installed on your computer, and you as well have a footage where you want to remove some portions of the video and adjust the size of the cropped clip within a certain area, this article is for you. Even though cropping is especially used when it comes to the images, it is extremely helpful in certain situations about the video clips, as well. So, let’s dive into each step of cropping in Final Cut Pro!

## Steps to crop a video in Final Cut Pro

After getting Final Cut Pro ready to work in and opening it, you need to start as always, as in any other software: Of course, choose Import Media.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-3.jpeg)

The software will ask your permission to access files in your computer, so, in order to import some, guess you have to click on OK.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-4.jpeg)

Then, it will let you choose your file – but not by opening the new window (as in most cases), rather, you can choose file within the software.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-5.jpeg)

Once you have your file(s) chosen, you need to find Import Selected button on the down and right.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-6.jpeg)

This will lead you towards the editor again, but if you try to drag and drop your file into the sequence, the program will not follow this simple order…

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-7.jpeg)

This is because what the window below reads and looks like – it offers you create a New Project first. So, you need to hit it.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-8.jpeg)

This will create the sequence where you can add the video you have already selected and imported from your media.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-9.jpeg)

Now, it’s time to find where the cropping option is. It’s quite simple – look at the icon below and a little left of the screen where your video clip shows, click on it and you will see three options: Transform, Crop, and Distort. Needless to say, you will choose crop in this case, even if other options sound quite interesting, too!

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-10.jpeg)

Choosing Crop also gives you three options: Trim, Crop, and Ken Burns. Stick with the Crop again!

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-11.jpeg)

You will notice the kind of rulers on the angles of the video clip – they are there so you can crop your footage manually, by holding and moving them with your cursor to your liking.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-12.jpeg)

Of course, if you direct your cursor in the middle of the cropped video, you can move the whole cropping window around it, so you can find the area where you intend to crop better.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-13.jpeg)

And when the selected area is ready, you need to click on Done button on the right top side of the screen. If you are not satisfied with the result, you can take the step back, by clicking on Reset button right next to Done and modify the area again.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-14.jpeg)

On the right side of the screen, you notice a window where Crop is also written. Alongside it, if you hover over the option with your mouse, you will see the word: Show. Clicking on it will let you crop the video from each side from there, too.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-15.jpeg)

There, you can “play around” with Left, Right, Top, and Bottom sides.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-16.jpeg)

In the process, if you are unsure or you want to compare the original video to the cropped version of it, keep in mind that you can uncheck the Crop button.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-17.jpeg)

Finally, when you feel the result is what you have imagined, you can proceed to saving your work. For it to be done, you need to now find an Export button top right of the whole editor, and then, choose Export File (or else, if that’s what you are willing to do).

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-18.jpeg)

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-19.jpeg)

The next step would be Export Settings. You will see a new window which has three sections: Info, Settings, and Roles. The most important one here would be considered Settings, where you choose your preferred Format, Video Codec, Resolution, Color Space, Audio Format, and Action.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-20.jpeg)

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-21.jpeg)

 When you click on Next, you then choose the Name of your project and the location where you want to save it exactly.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-22.jpeg)

Then you click on Save, and in a short amount of time, you have your new cropped video where you chose to save it! So, that’s it with cropping in the Final Cut Pro!

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-23.jpeg)

![create tracks for additional audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_12.jpg)

##### Step3 Create Tracks for Sound Effects

The fourth track could usually be the sound effects track. You can add all the clapping sounds, laughing, and all kinds of other foley sound here.

![create tracks for sound effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_13.jpg)

##### Step4 Create Tracks for Ambient Sound

Keep the fifth track for Ambient sound and room tone. You can use it to keep a very subtle environment sound in specific scenes. For example, you can use the room tone recorded on sets.

![create tracks for ambient sound](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_14.jpg)

##### Step5 Create Tracks for Background Music

Finally, the sixth track is usually for background music. But, of course, you could also keep it empty if your project has no background music.

**4\. Color Code Your Clips**

Suppose you want to make the timeline even easier to view. In that case, you can select all clips from a camera or a subject and color code them into a specific color. For example, you can color code the footage from camera A in red, camera B in yellow, and Camera C in blue. Now, when you look at the Timeline, you can quickly distinguish footage from different cameras.

## Part 2: Pro Tips about Improving Video Editing Efficiency

**1\. Rename Individual Clips**

It would be much simpler to organize the timeline if you could quickly rename individual clips. Cut a clip into smaller segments and give each clip a different name. Make sure these clips have a name other than the source video to avoid confusion.

**2\. Remove Empty Timeline**

For quick video editing, timeline organization is essential. Organize your materials and footage at all times to prevent delays. Put everything in the correct folders with the proper labels. To keep your timeline organized, select "Delete Empty Tracks" from the context menu when right-clicking on the track window on the left.

**3\. Use Keyboard Shortcuts**

Knowing keyboard shortcuts allows you to carry out the editing process quickly and precisely.

**4\. Select Good Music**

Don't only concentrate on the images; the music also affects how well your video comes out. For example, suppose you're making a drama movie. In that case, you should pick the right music track to evoke particular emotions in your viewers.

**5\. Add Text and Graphics**

Depending on the style of the video, adding text, graphics, or stock video to your project could be helpful. You should provide more text than just the title for some videos.

## Summary

You don't need to be an expert in video editing to produce high-quality videos. In reality, you can complete the task without any expensive, high-end professional training. So how? Well, with the proper video editing tools like Wondershare Filmora, anything is possible. Follow the above guide, organize your timeline and keep the tracks consistent while video editing on Filmora so it's easier to come back and edit a project or share with other editors.

**1\. Create folders in Filmora**

If you have footage from multiple cameras, it is best to create some folders first.

##### Step1 Create a Folder for Camera 1

If you have video footage from three cameras, you can create one folder for each camera.

Go to the default folder on the top left and rename it Cam\_A.

![create a folder for camera 1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_1.jpg)

##### Step2 Create a Folder for Camera 2

Then go to the bottom left of the media browser and click on this icon to add a new folder. Rename it to Cam\_B.

![create a folder for camera 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_2.jpg)

##### Step3 Create a Folder for Camera 3

Repeat the steps to create another folder called Cam\_C. Now you can import footage from your different cameras into each folder.

![create a folder for camera 3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_3.jpg)

##### Step4 Create a Folder for Production Sound

After that, add three new folders and rename them to Production Sound, SFX, and Music. Production sound is usually the sound that is recorded on set. If you have recorded all dialects from the subjects on the location, you can put them into this folder.

![create a folder for production sound](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_4.jpg)

##### Step5 Create a Folder for SFX

SFX stands for sound effects. You can add push clapping, laughing and other Folly sounds into this folder.

![create a folder for sfx](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_5.jpg)

##### Step6 Create a Folder for Music

Next, import all music files into the music folder. You can create folders for your graphics, B-roll, and stock footage if needed.

![create a folder for music](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_6.jpg)

**2\. Organize your Timeline and Video Tracks**

##### Step1 Create Tracks for Picture Editing

Keep the first three tracks for picture editing. These tracks are usually for picture editing that includes footage with no effects or some simple effects—for example resizing, keyframing, transitions, or Green Screen.

![create tracks for picture editing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_7.jpg)

##### Step2 Create Tracks for Temporary Footage

Set up the fourth track for the temporary footage or placeholders so you can quickly switch the temporary footage without spending extra time looking for them.

![create tracks for temporary footage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_8.jpg)

##### Step3 Create Tracks for Effects

Set the fifth video track as the effect track. It will include all effects from firmware that do not apply to the footage directly.

![create tracks for effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_9.jpg)

##### Step4 Create Tracks for On and Off Content

Next, on the sixth video track, you can add the content that you would want to turn on and off from time to time. In this example, you can put the subtitles here.

![create tracks for on and off content](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_10.jpg)

**3\. Organize your Audio Tracks**

##### Step1 Create Tracks for Dialects

The first two tracks are usually for dialects. You can include all the dialects of characters in these tracks. Keep one track for each character. If you have more characters, feel free to assign more tracks to them.

![create tracks for dialects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_11.jpg)

##### Step2 Create Tracks for Additional Audio

The third audio track could be for any additional audio, such as voiceover. If you don't have a voiceover in your video, you can leave it empty.
