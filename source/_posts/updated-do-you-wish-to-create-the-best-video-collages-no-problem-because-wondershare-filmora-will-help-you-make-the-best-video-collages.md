## How to Make A Jaw-Dropping Time Lapse Video?

Are you looking for a handy tutorial that will give you a full-fledged time lapse video? Well, here’s some two cents of what would be the ideal guide that you shall refer to! Learn more about the complete steps involved in making your time lapse video. Find out more here:

## Part 1: What is Time Lapse?

### 1\. Technical basics of Time Lapse Photography and Videography

Time-lapse is a specialized type of shot that can be achieved in-camera, through editing, or a combination of both. Time-lapse is a technique where frames are shot much slower than a normal rate (e.g., 24 frames per minute instead of per second).

Professional time-lapses are a series of raw photos even though they are sometimes perceived as videos. In a nutshell, a time-lapse is a short video that processes by revealing the evolution of a series of events, invisible to the eye.

The simplest and most useful formula is time per frame (TPF), multiplied by frames per second (FPS), multiplied by 60 seconds. Using this formula will tell you how long to record to end up with your desired time lapse length or “recording time” (RT). TPF x FPS x 60 = RT

### 2\. What is a Time-lapse video used for?

The use of time-lapse photography and video is an excellent storytelling technique since compelling stories are essential to effective marketing. A time-lapse can also offer excellent insight into the advancement of developmental projects.

#### **①** Scientific research

* Time-lapses may be utilized to spread the word about scientific investigations to a wide audience. You can use time-lapse photography to gain money by selling the material of interesting scientific investigations to documentary makers or instructional websites.
* Scientists can visualize processes that would be challenging or sometimes even impossible to study in real life, thanks to time-lapse photography

#### **②** Individual enjoyment

Time-lapses are also utilized by filmmakers for scenes requiring extended durations of time with little significant activity occurring during the shot (such as night slowly turning into day).

#### **③** **Commercial use**

* Time-lapse videos are a wonderful instrument for enhancing the perception of your brand because they are. As a result, many consumers find it interesting.
* Time-lapse videos are the epitome of the old saying that "good things come in small packages" for any brand.

### 3\. How to Make a Time-lapse video?

Start with a stable tripod or surface and adjust the settings on your phone camera or DSLR. Use slow shutter speed, use still mode, and don’t forget to use the timer. Find a stable surface and place your camera this way, you can get your hands on a creative time-lapse video.

## Part 2: Record or Shoot Your Time-Lapse Video

### 1\. Select Your Subject

The best way to create a time-lapse video is to pick your subject very carefully. Movement is the most crucial factor to consider while selecting a time-lapse subject. Any movement—whether it be caused by people, animals, vehicles, water, clouds, or anything else—can create an exciting and captivating time-lapse.

* Some of the iconic ideas of filming a time-lapse include:
* A stunning glimpse of the day and night cycle of life at sea.
* Construction of a building from ground till its completion
* Capturing the traffic movement
* Ice melting
* Sun setting
* A great shot of a galaxy

### 2\. Prepare Right Equipment

Choose your equipment before heading out to capture time lapses. There are several options available for time-lapse cameras and applications, ranging from basic and affordable to sophisticated and pricy.

#### **①** **Camera**

You cannot make a time-lapse without owning a camera, whether it is a mobile phone, a compact, or a DSLR. The quality of the final result will be as good as the quality of the equipment you use.

**\- Smartphone camera apps (iPhone/Android)**

All good smartphones now possess a built-in camera with good optical quality, for example: recently Apple Company launched its new iPhone 14 with a magnificent 48-megapixel camera. By using such cameras we have been able to produce really good pictures, although not in negative conditions, such as those with low-light, etc.

For apple: use IguanaLapse or TimeLapse to create your great time-lapses

For Android: use Time-Lapse – Lite

\- **Point-and-shoot cameras**

Even though smartphone cameras have taken over in this digital era, it is still not possible to say that point-and-shoot cameras are not doing their magic. A point-and-shoot camera is really handy.

Some examples of point-and-shoot cameras which are best for creating fun time-lapse videos include Olympus Tough TG-6, Nikon Coolpix W300, Fujifilm XP140, Panasonic Lumix ZS70 / TZ90, and many others in the list.

**\- Action cameras**

Action cameras, also known as action cams are compact, rugged, handheld, or mountable digital cameras that are designed to capture what you see when you are immersing in a movement. The action camera is usually mounted to your helmet, chest, handlebars of a bike or motorcycle, or tripod to record life.

The best action cameras for creating time-lapses include GoPro Hero11 Black, Insta360 ONE RS Twin Edition, DJI Action 2, DJI Pocket 2, and GoPro Hero9 Black.

**\- DSLR cameras**

This is the best choice in terms of cost/benefit: it produces excellent results and high image quality. The best and top-rated DSLRs for creating terrific time-lapses include Nikon D850, Canon 80D, Canon EOS 90D, Sony A7 III, and others.

#### **②** Tripod/Gimbal/other stabilizers

Owning a solid and stable tripod is essential for the success of a time-lapse video. A good tripod will support the load without any problems and will keep the arsenal stable for the duration of the shooting session. The best way to use a tripod for filming a time-lapse is to use orient on a tripod that is quite high (at least 170cm).

Some best tripods used to record time-lapses include BONFOTO B671c, Patekfly Flexible Tripod, Sirui Easy Traveler ET-2204, and Vanguard Alta Pro 263AB 100.

A gimbal is a tool that uses motors and intelligent sensors to support and stabilize a camera. The best gimbal and other stabilizers used to film time-lapses include Moza Air 2, DJI RS 2, Zhiyun Crane-2S, Benro RedDog R1, iKan EC1 Beholder, and Feiyu AK4500.

#### **③** Intervalometer/other camera shutter triggers

An intervalometer is a small device able to trigger the shutter of your camera every ‘n’ second, ‘n’ times (also infinite). It can be external, or as we saw earlier, integrated into the camera.

Some of the best intervalometer include Nikon Integrated Intervalometer. With a Nikon D3, you can go into Shooting Menu, and then activate” Interval Timer Shooting”.

## Motion Tracking Is the Process of Tracking the Movements of a Project in a Video. This Article Will Show You How to Apply Motion Tracking Effect Into Videos

Motion tracking makes it easier to follow the movement of objects and provide the sensed data to a program for additional processing. Motion tracking involves recording an object's movements that match a previously stored motion template. This has a wide range of uses, including in robotics, entertainment, sports, the military, and the entertainment industry. Additionally, it is utilized in the creation of video games and films. While motion tracking is frequently referred to as match movement in the film and video game industries, motion tracking is frequently referred to as motion capture in other contexts.

### Blender

Open-source and cost-free motion tracking software is called Blender. It's an excellent 3D creating tool. Modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing, video editing, 2D animation, and of course motion tracking is all supported.

![blender video editing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/blender-video-editing.jpg)

### Kdenlive

A motion tracker was recently added to Kdenlive, an open source and free video editing tool, under its Effects section. This program analyzes an object's tracking information and automatically generates a map of the object's motion. Following that, you can align a title, an image, an icon, and any other 2D elements to the moving object using this track. Motion Tracker's regularly updated algorithms are one of its key characteristics, which leads to a higher tracking success rate and faster tracking speed.

![kdenlive adjust slider](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kdenlive-adjust-slider.jpg)

### HitFilm Express

The free edition of HitFilm Express is a wonderful place to start if you're learning the fundamentals of 2D motion tracking. To get superior tracking results, it offers two motion tracking types: Single Point for tracking simply position and Double Points for tracking position, scale, or rotation of an object. You can either steady the video with the tracking data or change the point with a CG object.

![hitfilm express](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hitfilm-express.jpg)

Its optical flow tracking technique is outstanding. It successfully tracks a moving item that changes into multiple shapes or is veiled for a few frames by figuring out the brightness flow of the moving object. Beginners can therefore save a great deal of time and effort when designing settings to deal with complex frames.

### VEGAS Pro

In VEGAS Pro 18 and later, auto motion tracking is a freshly upgraded function. Despite its late birth, it included the Mocha masking and planar tracking technology, winner of an Academy Award. It enables you to accurately attach images and messages and even adjust for shifting perspective. You can hide faces, license information, and any private objects using this capability.

![vegas pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vegas-pro.jpg)

### Adobe Premiere Pro

Because of its superior editing capabilities, Premiere Pro seems to be a requirement for anyone learning video editing. Premiere Pro, however, has a limited number of presets and automatic tools in order to provide consumers the most control.

![adobe premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-premiere-pro.jpg)

When masking and blurring a face, motion tracking only works with the auto option. If not, you will need to enter and alter multiple keyframes to add text or resize the video, or you will need to install an extension to convert the mask's tracks to any transformed parts.

### PowerDirector

Due to its simplicity of use, PowerDirector is unquestionably among the greatest motion tracking programs currently available. It accomplishes complex effects without having an advanced learning curve, in contrast to other video editing tools. As demonstrated in the introductory video up top, a simple interface may be used to easily track and manage one or more motion-tracked items.

![powerdirector for mac](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/powerdirector-for-mac-5.jpg)

With this program, creating a simple motion track may be done in only three easy steps. This editor is for you if you want to finish the job swiftly and painlessly and are new to intermediate video editing.

## Part 3\. Differences between camera tracking and motion tracking?

Making the audience forget that there is a camera in the room is one of the primary goals of filmmaking. To engage the audience, tracking shots like camera tracking and motion tracking are helpful. Tracking shots provide filmmakers the chance to immerse their audience more deeply in the storyline of their characters. I discovered that there is some ambiguity around how motion tracking and camera tracking differ from one another. I'll explain where the confusion might have originated and give you examples of how to use both strategies.

What distinguishes motion tracking from camera tracking? Their differences are due to how they view the course of action. From a camera's perspective, motion tracking monitors an object's movement. The scenario is more immersive thanks to camera tracking, which detects the movement of the camera and presents it as though you are in a virtual or augmented reality environment.

We'll examine tracking's development in the movie and its significance to the business. What it is and how it affects the cinematography industry. Along with the many software used for both motion tracking and camera tracking, we'll also look at some of the popular applications for both.

**Motion tracking**

Motion tracking is similar to a car pursuit on the highway in an action movie. Let's use a SimCity environment as another illustration: your Sim's movement is monitored against the steady scene of your home. The frame is set on your Sim, regardless of what your Sim does.

**Camera tracking**

When the camera must move and the object being "tracked" must remain stationary, camera tracking might be utilized instead of motion tracking. Information from a recorded live shot taken with a live camera is used for camera tracking. Then, using this data, a parallel virtual camera is projected in a three-dimensional composition frame. fresh 3D pieces are added while scenes are recreated.

On the Internet of Vehicles, motion tracking will be crucial. IoV will project the motion of your vehicle along the 2D path. Then, utilizing the information about your surroundings, you are informed of any potential roadblocks.

The same basic idea underlies motion tracking and stabilization. Both follow a moving target. When stabilizing, you choose the location where you wish to remain concentrated and centered despite movement. You track the object you wish to concentrate on while moving when you use motion tracking.

Sports videos frequently use basketball and football and use motion tracking. wherein the player is surrounded by a circle as he circles the court or the field for basketball.

## Conclusion

In video editing, techniques like motion tracking and camera tracking are frequently employed. Even though they are frequently compared, both employ various vantage angles to depict motion. By following the moving object's movement throughout the frame, motion tracking maintains the moving object in focus. A post-production technique called camera tracking uses data from a pre-shot movie to project a parallel virtual camera that displays a 3D perspective. If motion tracking and camera tracking have anything in common, it's the way they draw the viewer into the tale and make them feel like a part of it. This gives your audience a sense of immersion in the story and enables your movie to linger in their minds emotionally and visually long after the credits have rolled.
