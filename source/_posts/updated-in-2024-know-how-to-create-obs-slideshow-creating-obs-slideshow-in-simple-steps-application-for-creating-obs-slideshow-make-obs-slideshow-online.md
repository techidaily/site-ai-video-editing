#### 3\. AI Copywriting

Wondering what to enter as a prompt in Filmora’s Text-to-Video AI? There is no need to switch with AI copywriters as Filmora offers its own. With its ChatGPT integration, this feature generates accurate and rapid scripts. Users just need to add a description for a script, and it will generate content on it.

#### 4\. AI Smart Masking

Everyone loves those unique and high-quality transitions and effects. However, incorporating such transitions and effects can be tricky in manual editing. With its AI masking feature, you just need to activate the feature, and it will do the rest. When you enable AI masking and specify the area to mask, it will operate within seconds. You can later add transitions and effects to the unmasked area.

## Conclusion

Upon conclusion, let’s rewind the complete knowledge of this article. At first, the article discussed how slow-motion videos have a significant contribution. Along with video editing, they contribute to research, training, and education. Moreover, we discussed **DaVinci's resolve in slow motion** and a guide to use it. Although, we recommend you use Wondershare Filmora as it is an easy-to-use alternative.
