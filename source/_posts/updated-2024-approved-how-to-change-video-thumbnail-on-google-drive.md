## How to Change Video Thumbnail on Google Drive

**What is a Google drive?**

“Google drive is a self-hosted cloud-based site that provides free space to store your files and pictures to share them with your friends and family”.

Google Drive is also used to promote businesses or websites. You can upload a video to Google Drive and embed the file in your blog or any other website.

**What is a Thumbnail?**

“A Thumbnail is a still image that acts as

a preview image of your video.”

A thumbnail is the first thing seen by the viewers while watching videos. It is the only thing that forces the viewer either to watch the video or not because it previews the video content. It is also shown in the search results. A thumbnail is just like the cover or title of a book. You will read a book by its cover. In the same way, a video is viewed by its thumbnail.

Google drive is also used for the promotion of websites and businesses. It does not offer to add a thumbnail or cover image like YouTube has the option to set and can change the thumbnail of the video. As we all know Google drive is not a streaming platform and has its own boundaries.

Normally, the google drive can generate a thumbnail from the video and uses the generated thumbnail ignoring the one you have uploaded. But on the other hand, if it cannot generate a thumbnail the uploaded thumbnail will be displayed. Usually, the default thumbnail may have weird facial expressions or may not be attractive for the viewers to open the video.

Here we are discussing a few alternatives to change the thumbnail of the video in Google drive.

Select a separate image to be housed in a separate column to set as a thumbnail image and then go into the **details, title,** and **Image settings.**

Typically, video creators use the Final Cut Pro camera shake effect to add energy to their videos. As such, their scenes are more dramatic and encourage you to pay more attention to the video. For example, you can apply the effect to indicate the arrival of the villain in your video. In addition, the effect will be more impactful if the villain is a giant.

You can also use the camera shake video effect for the following purposes:

* Break the monotony in a scene. Applying this scene after a long dialogue scene will give your audience a brief respite, allowing them to regain their focus.
* The camera shake effect can also be an effective tool to build your brand identity. Instead of applying it during the screenplay, you can use it in the end credits to introduce your logo to audiences. Furthermore, you can include a creative sound track for additional emphasis.

### What kind of shots are best for such an effect?

The best shot to apply the camera shake effect are still shots. This is because they give you extra creative room with the scene since the subjects are facing the camera directly from a level angle. As such, you can customize unique motion patterns for each subject when applying the camera shake effect.

### Is it better to hand shake when shooting or add the effects?

Although it may seem tempting to physically shake the camera when shooting, most filmmakers prefer to add the effect during editing. This is because shaking the camera during shooting may result in unusable shots in post-production. For example, shooting a car scene from a hand-held camera in the passenger seat often results in shaky footage. As such, video creators mount the camera on a tripod to capture still shots and then add the camera shake during post-production.
