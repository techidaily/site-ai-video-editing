What Are The Stages Of Film Production

## 1\. Pre-Production

The pre-production phase comes early in the process, it usually comes after the development and before the production itself. This stage includes finalizing the scripts, bringing together the actors and crew, browse for locations, deciding which equipment is needed, and deciding on the budget. Pre-production is a planning stage of the movie, where you confirm all the details of the project before starting on production.

Pre-production

## 2\. Production

Now the fun part begins. It is time to get the movie on camera. All the producers and directors finished making the plans from the use of all the production assets that are needed to make the movie. Once the cast and locations are set, the actual filming process can begin and this can take from days, weeks, to months depending on how many locations are used, how much scenes are being filmed and if there are any problems that occur that delays the filming process.

## 3\. Post-Production

![Post-Production](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/what-are-the-stages-of-film-production-04.jpg)

Post-Production

After the filming process, any re-taking, and other filming phases the entire crew has to go through, it is time for post-production. This stage is when the audio and visual materials are combined together to create the movie. An editor, or multiple editors are using the following procedures to create the film:

### A. Cutting and Trimming Shots

Tips

###### ▷ What's a Cut

In the film and video industry, a cut is described by when one clip ends and another one starts. For example, say you have a wide shot clip of a car driving as well as clip of a man’s eyes watching.

###### ▷ When Would the Cut Happen

The cut would happen when the first shot has ended and is followed by the second shot. Repeating that will have an impact on how the viewer sees the movie and follows the story.

### B. Adding Music and Sound Effect

Tips

###### ▷ Sound Effects

Depending on what kind of movie it is, sound effects can make a huge difference in the viewing experience. No matter if it’s an explosion, an extra wind sound, a door crackle, or laughing people in the background.

###### ▷ Deliver the Emotion

Many sound effects are placed into the film to deliver the emotion and get the viewer onto the edge of their seat as it amplifies the moment.

### C. Adding Visual Effects

Tips

###### ▷ The Benefit of Post-production

When there are visual effects showing in the movie, these are not made physically on set. The benefit of post-production is that there are unlimited choices of adding visual effects to strengthen a moment and the impact on the viewer.

###### ▷ Visual Effects

A lot of results are accomplished by visual effects because they would be impossible to re-create on set.

## 4\. Distribution

Distribution is the final stage of production, which happens after the film has been edited, and is ready for release. Many film makers and production companies will advertise the movie’s trailer on social media and the general internet to target the audience that loves the type of movie that has been made. They will either see it on social media or on television to drive people to theaters to watch the movie and get them into the story. A lot of movies have follow-ups when it’s been received really well creating a storyline.

These videos, with a series of shots and information edited together cohesively in sequence, are useful for showcasing storyline progress.

2. [Wedding Montages](#part2-2)
3. [Birthday Montages](#part2-3)

* [How Can I Create Easily a Montage Video?](#part3)

## Part 1\. Classic Montage Ideas in Art and Film

Video montages play a major role in films, art productions, and gaming, like the **call of duty montage**.

In terms of the first example, when you watch movies, you might notice this technique used in many movies, utilized more prominently since the 1920s when Sergei Eisenstein coined the term first. These scenes appear as stitched-together shots of the characters showing time passage, enjoying activities or memories.

Different techniques are common, like rhythmic, metric, intellectual, or tonal. For example, the 2000 movie "Requiem for a Dream” showcased an intellectual/metric style of video montage to show the disorientating effect of the character under drug influence. A relatively recent example would be Benedict Cumberbatch’s 2016 movie “Doctor Strange”, where the montage shows the titular character’s interaction with the villain (no spoilers).

### 3 Top Montages in Film for All Times

If the above two examples did not fully express **what is a montage video**, seeing more examples should help. For this, here are three of the top montage examples available in Film History, each version representing a separate video montage style.

**1\. Rocky (1976)**

One of the most notable montages is available in the 1976 action movie, the Sylvester Stallone-starrer "Rocky". The type of video montage that is visible in this movie is rhythmic in nature, showcasing the training the character undergoes. This is edited with a musical background score, summarising some shots' full training progression process.

To add an emotive tone to the video, music is added to the video clip that engages audiences to feel the character's passion. A rhythmic style of video montage technique is used to cut the shorts as per the content. The lengths of each clip are not similar and differ as per the action going on in the scene.

**2\. Mulan (1998)**

Video montages are also visible in animated movies, as seen in the 1998 version of Disney’s “Mulan”. The scene in question is where the song “I’ll Make a Man Out of You” plays while Mulan undergoes strict training for the military from the male lead. A sequence of shots showing her progress is shown.

Here, the video montage is shown with the background music that perfectly aligns with what is occurring in the video. The visuals and the audio in the background cohesively show the main character's struggle, which creates an emotional response in the audience. Therefore, the style of video montage here falls under tonal or overtonal categories.

Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMX5zkYnGB0) to get an idea of how music and visuals can partner for tonal video montages.

**3\. Creed (2015)**

Like in the Rocky movie, its 2015 sequel, “Creed”, also has a video montage. Here, the clips in the sequence are also used to depict the intense training progress. However, where it differs from the rhythmic formula is that the sequence highlights the emotional journey or determination of Adonis Creed to succeed.

Plus, this video montage is a homage to the original version; the tonal effect is further noticeable in the scene of Rocky's health deterioration against Creed's training. Thus, it juxtaposes the two scenes, creating an emotional impact on viewers to root for the main character.

Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NH1A6CLIrY) to understand **what is a montage video** of the tonal type.

## Part 2\. Creative Montage Ideas for Social Media

Of course, movies and TV shows are the only types of media where video montage techniques are useful. Many non-professionals use options like a **fortnite montage editor** to create and edit montage videos for other projects they can share across platforms. Some even create video montages to create videos for social media.

These include vlog-like videos that people record and then edit together into a montage which different techniques. Plus, some users create montages of different things that interest them, like gameplay. Then, they share those videos across social media for views, like on TikTok or YouTube.

### · Gaming Montages

Different creators focus on developing **gaming montage**s to create projects for the games they operate. These can include videos showcasing the skills or gameplays of the creation, all explaining a specific theme in some cases.

There are different games that the users focus on for showcasing their gaming prowess in action. Common examples include Fortnite, Call of Duty, CSGO, or **PUBG montage** videos.

Many top influencers and celebrities have used this technique for their wedding videos on social media. Additionally, regular people also adopt the style.
