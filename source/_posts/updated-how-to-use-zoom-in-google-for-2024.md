Zoom in and out is a feature in every presentation/editing tool, but we generally forget its importance until it is unavailable, and you will need alternatives. You imagine a situation where you will have to zoom in on the sheet in the presentation because your client is sitting far from the projector. After the presentation, you will have to zoom out, so the sheet becomes normal. **Zoom in google** is our daily activity on a computer.

Previously there were no such options in Google sheet to zoom or out. But, now Google has come up with this new feature. This article will explore the steps to zoom in and out of the whole page and the elements of Google Chrome. Now we will know about several ways of using the Zoom control. Let's start.
