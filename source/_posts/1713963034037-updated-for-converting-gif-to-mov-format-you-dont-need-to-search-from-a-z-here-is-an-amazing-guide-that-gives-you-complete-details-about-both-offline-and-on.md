## What is Masking?

Masks are a feature of editing software that allows you to choose a particular portion of the video or utilize video overlays to hide, duplicate, reveal, or change your footage.

The mask then becomes isolated, and you may modify it as desired to produce your intended effect.

Scrolling down in the Windows category will take you to more options where you can change the scale, position, width, height, and radius of your chosen shape. You may also lessen the strength of the form and rotate it to make it blend in better with the other elements you're trying to hide in your window.

Step 1: Drag the clip from the Explorer or Project Media windows and drop it on the timeline. Then, look for another video that is quite distinct from the first.
