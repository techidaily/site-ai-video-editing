Multi-track editing – Kdenlive comes with a versatile timeline where you can have multiple tracks consisting of video clips, audio files and different effects and objects. You can lock the tracks as well as mute them so that you can experiment as you edit your video.

Effects and Transitions – Even though limited, there are eye-catching effects and transitions available. You can also go for color correction as well as minor adjustments in your audio. Besides, the titler lets you create amazing 2D texts and titles.

Proxy Editing – Kdenlive uses proxy editing technique to lower the resolution of high-resolution videos while you edit them. This takes away the pressure on the CPU resources, but when it renders, the original resolution gets restored back. That is why Kdenlive has been effective in low-end computers as well.

Flexible User Interface – Kdenlive comes with a customizable user interface. This means you can arrange the layouts of your workflow as per your requirements. Besides, there are configurable keyboard shortcuts. There are also different themes available for the user interface.

Keyframing – One of the advanced features of Kdenlive is that you can keyframe any effect. This means you can change the parameters of the effects with time using curves. Besides, the software supports green screen effect.

## Part 4\. Best Kdenlive Alternative to Edit Videos

Kdenlive has several drawbacks that prevent it from becoming the best video editor. Even though the features are sufficient for beginners, it is not suitable for professional editing.

## How to Convert SRT to DOCX

**SRT to Word: How to Convert an SRT File to Docx file?**

The SubRip Text (SRT) format is a popular subtitle format used in many videos. While SRT files are simple text files that can be edited with any text editor, they are not as convenient to work with as MS Word documents.

For one thing, it cannot be easy to format text in a way that is easy to read. In addition, SRT files do not support features such as spell checking and grammar checking.

As a result, converting SRT to Word can be a useful way to improve the quality of subtitles. In addition, it can also make it easier to translate subtitles into other languages.

Other than that, you might need to convert an SRT to a Word document when you need to edit the subtitles for a video you're working on or you want to create a transcript of a recorded conversation.

You might think that converting a speech to text is difficult or impossible. But it's not!

Here's how you can easily convert SRT to DOCX files. Let's begin.

## What is an SRT file?

SRT files are used for subtitles. Subtitles are the audio track of a video or movie. Subtitles are displayed alongside a video or movie on your TV or computer screen. They allow the viewer to understand what is being said in the language they speak.

People have recently begun using online streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Video, and Hulu to watch movies and television shows. While streaming services offer thousands of movies and shows, there are still many that only exist in a form that can be viewed in their entirety. This requires the user to download the entire file (usually in a format known as a .srt file).

## Why do we need to convert SRT files into Word?

Subtitles are a great way to enjoy movies and TV shows in different languages. They provide text on the screen that tells you what the characters are saying, so you can follow along even if you don't speak the language. However, SRT files can be difficult to work with because they are incompatible with all software programs**.** So, they need to be converted into Word. Some other reasons include:

* It allows your content to be viewed within a web browser or mobile device without downloading .srt file.
* If you need to embed the video into another site, you can do so easily with the.docx file.
* Learning a new language by downloading SRT subtitles from video.

## Convert SRT to word file without downloading any software

With the advent of the SRT (SubRip) format, videos can now be enjoyed on both computers and mobile devices. This means that videos can be viewed anywhere and anytime. Converting videos to SRT is relatively easy, but some online converters offer more flexibility than others.

These converters can take an SRT file and convert it into a word document, which can then be edited or saved for future use. Not only do online SRT to word converters save time, but they can also ensure that your captions are accurate and properly formatted. Whether you're captioning a home video or creating professional subtitles for a film, an online SRT to-word converter can be a valuable tool. Some of them include:

Ebby has 100+ languages and dialects, plus its fast transcription and accuracy make it stand out from its competitors. However, the web interface isn't designed to handle large files.

## Convert SRT to Word file Manually

You must first remove the time codes to convert an SRT file to a Word document. Open the SRT file in a text editor (such as Notepad++ or Sublime Text) and delete all the lines that begin with numbers. These lines will typically look something like "00:00:01,000 --> 00:00: 02,000." Once you have removed the time codes, save the file and open it in Microsoft Word.

The text from the SRT file will now be visible in the Word document. You can then format the text as desired and save the document.

Keep in mind that this manual method will not retain any formatting from the original SRT file, so you may need to do some additional editing to get the final results you want.

## What is an SRT file?

SRT files are used for subtitles. Subtitles are the audio track of a video or movie. Subtitles are displayed alongside a video or movie on your TV or computer screen. They allow the viewer to understand what is being said in the language they speak.

People have recently begun using online streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Video, and Hulu to watch movies and television shows. While streaming services offer thousands of movies and shows, there are still many that only exist in a form that can be viewed in their entirety. This requires the user to download the entire file (usually in a format known as a .srt file).

## Why do we need to convert SRT files into Word?

Subtitles are a great way to enjoy movies and TV shows in different languages. They provide text on the screen that tells you what the characters are saying, so you can follow along even if you don't speak the language. However, SRT files can be difficult to work with because they are incompatible with all software programs**.** So, they need to be converted into Word. Some other reasons include:

* It allows your content to be viewed within a web browser or mobile device without downloading .srt file.
* If you need to embed the video into another site, you can do so easily with the.docx file.
* Learning a new language by downloading SRT subtitles from video.

## Convert SRT to word file without downloading any software

With the advent of the SRT (SubRip) format, videos can now be enjoyed on both computers and mobile devices. This means that videos can be viewed anywhere and anytime. Converting videos to SRT is relatively easy, but some online converters offer more flexibility than others.

Not only do online SRT to word converters save time, but they can also ensure that your captions are accurate and properly formatted. Whether you're captioning a home video or creating professional subtitles for a film, an online SRT to-word converter can be a valuable tool. Some of them include:

## Convert SRT to Word file Manually

You must first remove the time codes to convert an SRT file to a Word document. Open the SRT file in a text editor (such as Notepad++ or Sublime Text) and delete all the lines that begin with numbers. These lines will typically look something like "00:00:01,000 --> 00:00: 02,000." Once you have removed the time codes, save the file and open it in Microsoft Word.

The text from the SRT file will now be visible in the Word document. You can then format the text as desired and save the document.

Keep in mind that this manual method will not retain any formatting from the original SRT file, so you may need to do some additional editing to get the final results you want.

## Best Frame Rate for 4K Video

People in the videography ad filmmaking world use complicated terminology like Ultra High Def to describe 4K videos. Even though you are not a complete stranger to the term 4K, you might still be unaware of what it means.

In a nutshell, 4K is the highest resolution you can watch your movies and videos. The details are incredibly crisp, meaning you can see pimples or the pores on an actor's face through the screen. However, the frame rate will significantly affect how you enjoy a 4K video. Therefore, it would be wise to learn how to choose the ideal frame rate to suit your needs.

Keep reading this article to learn more about frame rates and which is suitable for a 4K video.

![4k video frame rate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/4k-video-frame-rate.jpg)

## How Do Frame Rates Affect Video Viewing?

The motion will appear smoother if your video contains more frames per second. Even though your viewers are not tech-savvy, they will definitely notice the difference.

Consider a video of a duck drinking water from a pond. If you film and playback the same video in 24, 30, and 60fps, you will see a noticeable difference, assuming your shutter speed is set according to the 180-degree shutter rule.

If you are filming quicker motions of wildlife and birds, you are better off sticking to higher resolutions to give the viewer a pleasant experience and ensure the motion is fluid.

On the other hand, lower frame rates like 24fps are ideal for human movements, which are not as smooth as wildlife. Suppose you used 60fps for a cinematic film or a TV show. The video would look a bit odd because that is not how we see things in the natural world. In addition, your viewers aren't used to such smoothness.

## Viewing Requirements of 4K Videos

You may have heard about 4K videos and wondered what people mean by that term. In simple terms, a 4K video is a high-resolution video that is four times the usual 1080p HD video. When it comes to 4K videos, there are two standard resolutions. One of them is the standard for Digital Cinema which is 4096\*2160 pixels. The other is for television and is 3840\*2160 pixels.

To stream 4K content, you need a bandwidth between 10 and 20 Mbps. On the other hand, streaming platforms like Netflix require higher bandwidths of not less than 15 Mbps. In addition to the bandwidth we mentioned earlier, you need a 4KTV or 4K monitor.

This specification was brought up at the UHD Alliance, a union of more than 50 tech companies working together to support 4K content. Tech companies ought to ensure the devices they produce are compatible with 4K videos, which are becoming increasingly popular.

Below is a list of requirements any electronic device should fulfill before being termed a 4KTV or 4K monitor.

![requirements of 4k videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/4k-video-requirements.jpg)

* A resolution of not less than 3840\*2160.
* A 10-bit color depth that allows for 1,024 shades of red, yellow, and blue.
* A high dynamic range for color accuracy.
* An excellent combination of black level and peak brightness. The peak brightness should not exceed 1,000 nits, and the black level shouldn't go below 0.5 nits. Alternatively, the peak brightness shouldn't exceed 540 nits; neither should the black level plummet below 0.0005 nits.

## Best Frame Rate for 4K Video

We all know that the frame rate you choose for your video will significantly impact the viewer's experience and the overall style of your video. The frame rate will also affect how the video looks. For instance, a frame rate lower than 24fps will make your video look unprofessional and of poor quality. The content will also flicker because there aren't many still images per second.

On the other hand, a lower FPS causes the file size to be smaller, causing it to consume a lower bandwidth. The vice versa is also true. Now that you understand these facts, you might wonder which frame rate would be best for your 4K videos.

Research reveals that the most acceptable frame rate is 30fps and 60fps. This is because the motion will appear natural to the human eye without being too fast or unrealistic.

If you are wondering what is the best frame rate for 4k videos, we urge you to select 60fps because it contains more detail. The higher frame rate also makes the motion look very smooth and crisp. Perhaps you want to shoot a slow-motion video. In that case, an even higher frame rate of 120fps would be ideal.

## How To Choose The Base Frame Rates for Your Next Video

Choosing a frame rate for your videos is not complicated. However, it is not a straightforward process either. There are numerous moving parts that ought to work harmoniously for your video to turn out perfect and guarantee your audience will have a pleasant viewing experience. Before we dive into choosing the best frame rate for your 4K videos, let's help you understand the filmmaking process.

Most filmmakers and videographers see it fit to shoot videos in 120p or 4K. This step makes their work easier during the editing process. If the raw footage is in 4K, they can de-emphasize or retain specific plot points that would look great in the final video. However, not everyone is shooting a video for Hollywood. Therefore, shooting in 4K on your laptop for your YouTube channel might be difficult.

Below are some factors you should consider when choosing the best frame rate for a 4k video.

![factors for choosing frame rate for videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/factors-for-choosing-frame-rate.jpg)

#### File size

Shooting your video at a higher frame rate means more still images are packed into a single second of the video. Therefore, you will end up with a larger file size. If you want to shoot a video for your YouTube channel, it would be wise to stick to a smaller frame rate.

#### Purpose

It wouldn't make sense to shoot a talking head video at more than 24fps. However, a higher frame rate would be ideal for a travel vlog, where the details need to be crisp.

#### Medium of delivery

The standard frame rate for television is 24fps. On the other hand, it would be best to stick to a higher frame rate of 60fps if you intend to shoot content for the silver screen.

#### Motion in the video

Lastly, the movement within the video will play a massive role in the frame rate you choose. The faster the motion, the higher the frame rate needs to be. For instance, action movies don't do well in frame rates of less than 60 fps.
