## Part 1: What is Google Photos and How Does It Work?

Google Photos is an app that can be obtained from Play Store or App Store to be installed on an Android-based smartphone or iPhone or iPad respectively.

The program can store photos and videos from your phone, and ensures that those media files are well-backed up so they can be recovered easily if/when lost due to some mishaps. Furthermore, the tool even lets you edit, customize, and share your photos and videos with ease.

**1\. History and Current Policies**

Earlier, Google Photos used to offer unlimited storage to the users where they can save as many photos as they want, as long as the images were saved in ‘high-quality’ resolution. However, from June 01, 2021, Google changed its policies of using the app, and now the tool offers limited storage. If more space is needed, the users must subscribe to a paid plan.

**2\. Accessibility**

Google Photos can be accessed from a web browser, Google Drive desktop program, and smartphone app. While you can make only minor changes to the videos such as editing date, time, and location when accessing Google Photos via a web browser, the smartphone app allows you to edit the clips comparatively more sophisticatedly.

**3\. Deletion**

The files that are stored in Google Photos remain there for an indefinite duration, of course until the entire space is completely consumed. When you delete something, it is moved to the Trash and stays there for another 60 days, after which it is automatically deleted from the Cloud forever.

## Part 2: How to Stabilize Videos with Google Photos on Android and iPhone?

The application will enter on full-screen, covering the remaining half screen. Repeat the steps for Pages also and you will end up with both the applications open side by side.

## Part 2 How To Use Keynote Slides

Apple’s keynote is a great option for Mac users to make beautiful slides for their presentations. Making a presentation focuses on idea or information you want to deliver to your audience. Designing a keynote slide includes, keynote slides sizes and dimensions which are very important.

Here are some important things to consider to make the best use of keynote slides.

### 01Keynote Slide Size Matters

Before designing your slides think about the screen size you’ll be presenting your presentation. Every screen has an aspect ratio. The aim is to create a keynote presentation that matches the aspect ratio of the screen on which you are going to present.

Screens on which your presentation will appear are:

**●** iPad and tablets

**●** Conference room projectors

**●** Laptop

**●** Widescreen, large format display

Setting the size of the keynote slide will ensure that your slides will match to the screen on which you are going to present. Keynote slides can be changed in different ways which includes changing the designs, dimensions and ruler options etc.

### 02Change Keynote Layout Dimensions and Size

Start off in keynote by clicking on the document option given at the top right corner. A new panel will open and all the changes will be done in that panel.When you will click on the document panel, there will be two tabs on the panels, make sure you are working on the labeled document panel.

![Adjust the slide size](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/Tactics-To-Make-Keynote-Slideshow-1.JPG)

On the slide size at the down side, you can set the size of the slide. By default you have two options 4:3 and 16:9 slide sizes. When you will create a new document, its size will be 4:3 by default, so before making a keynote slide make sure you check the size.

![Formatting 16:9 slide to 4:3 format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/Tactics-To-Make-Keynote-Slideshow-2.JPG)

Keep in mind that the content should be on the keynote slides. When you turn your widescreen content into a square shaped layout, to make it look fit in the square shaped layout you have to rearrange the content on slide.
