Color grading can be a tedious process, especially if you don’t have the technical skills required to achieve the desired result. That’s where a LUT can come in handy. So, what is a LUT?

LUT stands for “look up table.” Simply put, a LUT is a color preset that you can apply to your video footage to speed up the color grading process. While LUTs are commonly used to speed up the color grading process, they can also be used for other tasks, such as color transfer between software, monitor calibration, and more.

In this article, we’ll explore a particular LUT – Leeming LUT Pro™ and how you can use it in various video editors.

## What is Leeming LUT Pro™?

Leeming LUT Pro™ is the world's first unified, corrective Look Up Table (LUT) system for supported cameras. It’s designed to maximize dynamic range, fix skin tones, remove unwanted color casts and provide an accurate Rec709 starting point for further creative color grading.

The Pro LUTs are designed for perfect Rec709 colorimetry and have a linear luma curve, with an average measured dE(2000) of less than 1\. As a result, they are visually indistinguishable from reality to the human eye.

Athena LUTs are a brighter version of Pro. They are designed around how the eye sees while retaining the same perfect colorimetry as Pro.

## Part 5: Bonus! Use Filmora – Easy to Use Video Editor for Color LUTs

Besides Final Cut Pro and PowerDirector, Filmora is another excellent video editing software that you can use to apply LUTs to your video.

Designed for beginners and intermediate users, Filmora is an intuitive yet powerful video editing software.

For instance, you can apply 3D LUTs to your video using Filmora. Unlike 1D LUTs, which can only control one value setting, 3D LUTs can allow you to control various value settings. As a result, 3D LUTs can give you more control over specific color values in your video.

Here’s how you can apply LUTs using Filmora:

### Step 1\.  Import the Footage

Launch Filmora and choose New Project. In the New Project window that opens, import the video you want to apply the LUT to by clicking on Import and selecting one of the drop-down options.

### Step 2\.  Add the Video to the Timeline

Drag and drop the video into your project’s timeline.

### Step 3\.  Open the Color Tab

Double click the video on the timeline to select it. Once it’s selected, go to the top left panel and click on the color tab.

![use lut in filmora - open color tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/leeming-lut-pro-5.jpg)

### Step 4\. Apply a LUT to the Video

Under the color tab, navigate to the 3D LUT option and select one of the available options in the 3D LUT drop-down menu to apply a LUT.

Many LUTs are named after popular TV shows and series whose visual styles they mimic, such as Batman, House of Cards, Game of Thrones, Mission Impossible, Harry Potter, Star Wars, and more.

Once you apply a LUT, you can see your changes in the Preview Window. Besides using the preset LUTs, Filmora also allows you to use custom LUTs. Instead of choosing one of the presets, click on the Load New LUT option to import your custom LUT into Filmora.

### Step 5\. Make Fine Adjustments

Once you apply a LUT, Filmora can allow you to make further modifications to the video. Click on the Advanced button at the bottom of the color tab to view advanced color correction options.

In the new window that opens, you can adjust several things, such as color, light, HSL, and more. You can also choose from a variety of other available presets.

![use lut in filmora - make adjustments](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/leeming-lut-pro-6.jpg)

## Conclusion

LUTs are a fast way to color grade your footage after color correction. However, to ensure your LUTs work effectively, here are some important guidelines you should observe when using LUTs:

* Ensure your footage matches from shot to shot, especially if you’re applying LUTs to multiple clips.
* Ensure your exposure is correct before using LUTs. You can use a histogram to help you set the exposure.
* Ensure you apply LUTs to a video that’s been properly color corrected.
* Make small adjustments to things, such as brightness, saturation, contrast, exposure, color temperature, and tint for best results.
* Test out various LUTs before settling for one because shooting conditions can drastically affect how different LUTs look.

Ultimately, LUTs are an excellent way to make your video more cinematic. If you don’t have advanced video editing skills or prior experience working with LUTs, don’t worry. Filmora is a user-friendly video editing software that allows you to quickly apply LUTs with no video editing experience. Just download Filmora for free to get started.

## Conclusion

LUTs are a fast way to color grade your footage after color correction. However, to ensure your LUTs work effectively, here are some important guidelines you should observe when using LUTs:

* Ensure your footage matches from shot to shot, especially if you’re applying LUTs to multiple clips.
* Ensure your exposure is correct before using LUTs. You can use a histogram to help you set the exposure.
* Ensure you apply LUTs to a video that’s been properly color corrected.
* Make small adjustments to things, such as brightness, saturation, contrast, exposure, color temperature, and tint for best results.
* Test out various LUTs before settling for one because shooting conditions can drastically affect how different LUTs look.

Ultimately, LUTs are an excellent way to make your video more cinematic. If you don’t have advanced video editing skills or prior experience working with LUTs, don’t worry. Filmora is a user-friendly video editing software that allows you to quickly apply LUTs with no video editing experience. Just download Filmora for free to get started.

Color grading can be a tedious process, especially if you don’t have the technical skills required to achieve the desired result. That’s where a LUT can come in handy. So, what is a LUT?

LUT stands for “look up table.” Simply put, a LUT is a color preset that you can apply to your video footage to speed up the color grading process. While LUTs are commonly used to speed up the color grading process, they can also be used for other tasks, such as color transfer between software, monitor calibration, and more.

In this article, we’ll explore a particular LUT – Leeming LUT Pro™ and how you can use it in various video editors.

## An Ultimate Guide To Edit a Music Video: Aspect Ratio and First Cut

Are you planning to edit your music video? Do you need on out how to edit your first music video draft? Editing a music video is a creative task but can be challenging.

One of the key elements of this process is selecting the aspect ratio and making the first cut. In this blog, we will explore these steps in detail, providing important tips and tricks. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced editor, get ready to take your music video to the next level. Let's get started.

## Which software will you need?

As we have a lot of software in the market, we must select the right software for high-quality editing. [**Wondershare Filmora**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is an amazing video editing software. It offers a ton of video editing tools. You can add special effects, transitions, and more to make your music video captivating.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Before you start editing your project, make sure that you have a backup. You can copy the project to an external USB or hard drive for a backup.

## Adjust the aspect ratio

The aspect ratio is known as the size of the video frame. For example, the most common aspect ratios are 16:9 and 4:3\. The first number represents the width, and the second represents the height.

You should always ask your cinematographer about the aspect ratio. There are chances when cameras won't shoot at the intended aspect ratio they were framed for. In that case, you'll need to crop or letterbox them when editing.

![some common aspect ratios](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/some-common-aspect-ratios.jpg)

### How to find the width/height of the frame?

Most of the frames that are being shot on the camera are 3424 pixels wide, which is a little under 4k. If you have a measurement of one side of the frame, you can find the other by using some math. Let's suppose your frame is 3424 pixels wide. You can use this formula to find the height.

**Formula:** 3424 pixels wide **x** 1 high / 2.35 wide (or whatever your aspect ratio)

![1st step of the formula](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/1st-step-of-the-formula.jpg)

Now you can cancel out the width from the multiplier and the denominator.

\= 3424 pixels wide **x** 1 high / 2.35 wide

![2nd step of the formula](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/2nd-step-of-the-formula.jpg)

Now you are left with the equation:

\= 3424 pixels high / 2.35

After solving this equation, you will get the answer which is: 1457 pixels high. Let's adjust it on the music video as well, follow the steps given below:

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

##### Step1Open the aspect ratio setting tab

Open your music video project in [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and click on the screen icon, as shown in the picture.

![clicking on the screen icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/clicking-on-the-screen-icon.jpg)

Then select the **Change Project Aspect Ratio**.

![clicking on the change project aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/clicking-on-the-change-project-aspect-ratio.jpg)

##### Step2Add values

Now set the project **Width to 3424** pixels and its **Height to 1457** pixels. You can also adjust the frame rate by selecting the one in which you shot the video. Then click **OK**.

![changing the width and the height](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/changing-the-width-and-the-height.jpg)

## Assembly

The next step is assembly. You will arrange the shots, clips, and elements in this process and get everything in order. It can be daunting and inspiring for you, as it's a blank canvas you are going to start with. Before editing, you can also get some guidance from your art director.

If your music video has shots of the band performing, drop them off first and sync them with the audio. On the contrary, if you are doing a narrative style, you can arrange the shots according to the story you want to portray.

![graphical text of assembly](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/graphical-text-of-assembly.jpg)

##### Step1Drop the media

You can start by dragging and dropping the music onto the audio timeline. Then you can add the shots of your music video.

![dropping the media onto the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/dropping-the-media-onto-the-timeline.jpg)

##### Step2Arrange the shots

Arrange the shots according to the storyboard you created and sync them with the audio.

![arranging the shots in order](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/arranging-the-shots-in-order.gif)

##### Step3Add the title

Once you arrange all shots in order, you can add the title of your music video. Click on the **Titles**, then choose your desired style and add the name of your music video in the title box. You can also change the text's size, font, and color.

![adding the title of the music video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/adding-the-title-of-the-music-video.jpg)

##### Step4Flip the clip

One last thing is, if you shot any scene in mirror-image format, you can flip it. Click on the clip you want to flip and select the flip icon in the video properties.

![flipping the clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/flipping-the-clip.jpg)

## Send your first draft

The first draft is the video in which you added audio and re-ordered the shots. You decided on the pace and flow of the video to create a basic structure. You made changes to make it interesting and captivating.

Before you put too much effort into editing your video, send it to your director, producer, or client for review. It will help ensure that any big changes can be made before you invest too much time in the edit.

For first drafts, you don't need anything fancy. A lower-resolution and more compressed file can make sending it to a director or client much easier. You can also add a timer on the music video, so the person reviewing it can give you accurate timing on where he wants any revision.

### How to add the timer in the music video?

1. Click on **Effects** and search for **Timecode** in the search bar.
2. Choose the timer style you like and drop it onto the new timeline.
3. Extend the timer to the end of the video.
4. Adjust the position and add the duration of your music video.

![adding timer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/adding-timer.gif)

Now you are all set to export the first draft of your music video. You can also adjust the video format on the export option, but MP4 is recommended.

## Conclusion

We hope this blog has helped you edit the initials of your music video. By adjusting the aspect ratio to fit the desired screen size and properly planning the first cut, you can lay a solid foundation for the rest of the editing process.

These two steps can greatly impact the overall look and feel of the final product. Remember to communicate with your director, producer, or client throughout the process to ensure that the final product meets their expectations.
