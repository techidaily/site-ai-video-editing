## Want to Buy a Drone for Better Videography Creating? This Article Will Review 6 of the Best Drones on the Market for You to Consider

Drones are all the rage these days and for good reason. They're a lot of fun to fly, and they can be a great addition to your toolkit for capturing aerial footage. But with so many different drones on the market, it can be tough to know which one is right for you.

![best drone for videography](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/best-drone-for-videography.jpg)

That's why we've put together this guide to the best drones on the market for every budget. Whether you're looking for an entry-level drone that won't break the bank or a top-of-the-line model that will let you capture stunning 4K footage, we've got you covered. So read on to find the perfect drone for you!

## Buyers Guide: The Best 6 Drones on the Market for Every Budget

**#1\. DJI Air 2S:** Among the best options for most people.

![dji air 2s](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/dji-air-2s.jpg)

The DJI's new Air 2S is our top pick. It finds the ideal compromise in terms of size, weight, picture quality, intelligent features, and price. The camera on the Air 2S isn't as nice as the Mavic 2 Pro's, which has a variable aperture for more flexible shooting in sunny conditions and includes neutral density filters to help make up for it.

1.3 pounds might not seem like much, but the Air 2S is a force to be reckoned with- it's durable enough to fly in light winds and can stay up for 30 minutes! Plus, the new collision-avoidance system will keep you safe even when there are trees around, and the 1 inch 20 mp sensor captures amazing 5K video or still photos.

**#2\. Skydio 2+ Drone:** If you want your flights to be handled automatically.

![skydio 2 drone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/skydio-2-drone.jpg)

The Skydio 2+ has the best collision-avoidance system, far outperforming any other drone on the market. If you want a drone that can follow your mountain bike off-road or quickly maneuver through obstacles without your help, this is it. Its 27-minute flight time and 6-mile range make it restrictions for some people, but plenty for most. The 1/2.3-inch sensor on this camera is good enough for 4K footage at 60 frames per second, but it's not as great as the 1-inch sensor in the Air 2S and Evo Lite+. D-log support is also absent, so video professionals might want to keep that in mind.

However, if you can live without D-log and don't mind the slower sensor, this drone is capable of flying in places where other drones can't. For certain applications, a smaller sensor may be preferable to having a great one.

**#3\. DJI Mini 3 Pro:** The Best Ultralight Drone for Most People

![dji mini 3 pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/dji-mini-3-pro.jpg)

The DJI Mavic Mini 3 Pro is the third version of the name, and it has been greatly improved from its original state. It features a 4K/60p footage with 1/1.3" sensor as well capture 12.1 megapixel RAW photographs. The Mini 3 Pro also has a 48-megapixel mode that improves image quality, but loses some camera functions. A faster F/1.7 lens is now on the front of the drone, and it also incorporates three-direction obstacle avoidance and a gimbal that allows for vertical shooting--all while weighing in at less than 250 grams. This number is important because, in many areas, a drone under 250 grams does not need to be registered (however, you should always check your local laws).

I was ecstatic about the performance of the Mini 3 Pro. It can fly in an impressive 45 minutes when using its extended battery--which is a dramatic improvement from the 32 minutes I got with the standard battery. Not to mention, it's delightful to fly because it maneuvers so effortlessly in even high winds. The only issue I have with it is that its price has risen since DJI released Mini 2; however, they still sell both models.

**#4\. DJI Mini 2:** Most Affordable Drone

![dji mini 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/dji-mini-2.jpg)

The Mavic Air 2S has advanced collision-avoidance tech, but at a high cost. Even the new Mini 3 Pro sells for $750\. If budget is more important to you than features, DJI's Mini 2 would be your best bet. It flies compared to its larger siblings, though wind gusts that wouldn't bother bigger drones like the Mavic 2 Pro will ground the Mini. The lack of collision-avoidance sensors makes it better suited for experienced pilots.

Even with those minor drawbacks, the Mini 2 is still a great beginner drone. It's enjoyable to fly, captures 4K video footage, and can be stored in smaller spaces than many smartphones. And that last part is essential because the best drones are ones that you'll actually bring with you instead of leaving at home. The Mini 2 only weighs 249 grams so it's easy to transport, and you don't even need to register it with the Federal Aviation Administration

**#5\. DJI Mavic 3:** The Most Luxurious Drone

![dji mavic 3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/dji-mavic-3.jpg)

The DJI Mavic 3 Pro is a cut above the rest. It's the finest drone on the market right now. The new 20-megapixel Four Thirds sensor produces outstanding image and video quality, and 45 miles per hour mobility allows you to follow and track objects without missing a beat.

If you're willing to spend the money, this drone is definitely worth it. It has a 45-minute flying time and can avoid obstacles in all directions. The Cine model also supports Pro Res video and comes with 1TB of storage space- perfect for filmmakers or anyone who wants to capture high-quality footage.

**#6\. Autel Evo Lite+:** Great for Long Flights

![autel evo lite](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/autel-evo-lite.jpg)

The Evo Lite+ is your best bet if you want to stay airborne as long as possible. Its massive battery provides a 40-minute flight duration, and the additional weight makes it more stable in the wind (though not by much). The Evo Lite+ features a fantastic camera with variable aperture controls, a 1-inch sensor, and night mode for better low-light photos.

The control does resemble an Xbox controller, which is nice, but it lacks the storage capacity for detachable joysticks that you get with DJI drones. It's still perfectly functional, and Autel's software will be familiar to anyone who has used a DJI drone.

## Some Final Suggestions

Drones can be used for a variety of purposes, from shooting landscapes and cityscapes to capturing footage of sporting events or outdoor activities. They can also be used for wedding videos, real estate videos, and other types of commercial work. And if you're just looking for some fun footage to add to your home movies, drones are the perfect way to do it.

Of course, not all drones are created equal. If you're looking for a drone that can shoot high-quality video on a budget, there are a few things you need to keep in mind.

* First, make sure the drone has a high-resolution camera.
* Second, make sure the drone has a long battery life so that you can get plenty of shots without having to recharge.
* Third, make sure the drone is lightweight and easy to control so that you can get the perfect shot every time.

So, what's the best drone for you? It depends on your budget and your needs. If you want a high-quality camera that can shoot in low light, the DJI Mavic 3 Pro is a perfect choice. If you're looking for a long-flight drone, the Autel Evo Lite+ is a great option. And if you're just starting out, the DJI Mini 2 is an affordable and easy-to-use drone that anyone can fly. With that said, happy flying!

## Guide to Create a Timelapse Video in After Effects

Time-Lapse movies are great for a variety of projects; you can use them as establishing shots in sitcoms, corporate marketing videos, and they can make lovely backgrounds for animated slideshows. A time-lapse video is essentially a series of photographs taken at regular intervals to depict how the environment changes gradually over a shorter period of time. In this article, we'll demonstrate how you may quickly and easily build an After Effects time-lapse effect.

With that said, let's start!

## Step 1\. Create a new composition

Calculating your composition length to accommodate the frame rate and number of images is the first step in generating a time-lapse video.

1. Verify the number of images you have for your Sequence.
2. New Composition Creation. Selecting a frame rate: A time lapse film produced at 30 frames per second will flow smoothly, but you can select any frame rate you like.
3. To determine the duration of your composition, divide the number of photographs you have by the frame rate you've chosen. For instance, if you use 600 photos at 30 frames per second, your composition will last 20 seconds.

## Step 2\. Import your images

You are prepared to make a time-lapse sequence if all of your photographs are saved to the same folder and are in the same order. If you are working directly from your Camera, you will likely have Camera Raw files, although this procedure works with PNG and JPEG sequences.

1. Press Command/Control I on your keyboard or select File > Import. Find the folder holding your image sequence.
2. To begin, select the first picture in the sequence. If all of your images have accurate names, After Effects will be able to identify a sequence of images.
3. Make sure the Force Alphabetical Order and Camera Raw Sequence checkboxes are selected. Your Time-Lapse Sequence will display in the Project Browser Panel after you click Import.
4. Once you've watched how it plays, you can adjust the Frame Rate by right-clicking the Sequence in the Project Browser and selecting Interpret Footage > Main.
5. To update your time-lapse, modify the Frame Rate setting and click OK.

![import images into after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/import-images-into-after-effects.jpg)

## Step 3\. Create movements

1. After Effects' Time-Lapse Sequence can be used just like any other standalone clip. This implies that you may give your time-lapse clip movement by adding Keyframes and Effects.
2. Place your Playhead at the beginning of the clip after choosing the Image Sequence. Make a keyframe for the scale or position.
3. To generate a second Keyframe for the value of your choice, move to the end of the clip. Make any necessary Clip modifications.
4. Right-click on the timeline, choose New > Adjustment Layer, then add your effects to the Adjustment Layer to add effects like noise and grain.

## Step 4\. Create slow motion from a video

You can import your video after you've shot it to prepare it for editing. The same steps, including naming your photos in order, must be taken for the Time Lapse sequence. It may be advantageous to entirely rename both your Image Sequence and Performer clip.

1. Drag the finished Time Lapse sequence to your Timeline after completing it as previously explained.
2. Over the Time Lapse, add the Performer Clip to the Timeline.
3. Choose Time>Time Stretch by performing a right-click on the performer clip.
4. You can alter the Stretch Factor or Duration in the dialogue box. When you alter one parameter, the other will reflect the new Stretch Factor or Duration for you.

## Step 5\. Make an overlay

You can alter the Stretch Factor or Duration in the dialogue box. When you alter one parameter, the other will reflect the new Stretch Factor or Duration for you.

1. Find Luma Key in the Effect Control Panel and drag it to your clip.
2. Change the Key Type setting in the Effect Control Panel to Key Out Brighter.
3. The Threshold, Tolerance, and Edge settings should be adjusted until only the silhouette is visible.
4. Use the Pen or Mask Tool to create a circle around the parts you want to delete if you discover any corners of your clip that are still visible.
5. Add any Effects, such as Light Leaks, to your Adjustment Layer by choosing "Right-click > New > Adjustment layer."

![make an overlay after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/make-an-overlay-after-effects.jpg)

After Effects CC must be opened, a new project must be created, the Import File menu option must be selected, and the appropriate folder containing the altered still images must be located and selected before the time-lapse photos can be turned into a film. You need to make sure that the JPEG Series box is checked, as well as the Force Alphabetical Order box.

Once you have clicked on the first image in the sequence. The time-lapse video that you uploaded appears in the project library. After performing a right-click on the filename, select "New Comp from Selection" from the context menu.

## Step 6\. Exporting your video

After getting our sequence to perform some kind of slow, understated animation so that it appears as though the camera is moving dramatically, we will need to export a video file. Go to File > Export > Add to Render Queue, then open the Render Queue dialog box by going to Window > Render Queue. From there, you can choose the Output Module and change the settings in the options dialog box. Finally, choose the Output To option and select the location on your computer where you would like to save the video clip that we are currently rendering and exporting.

## Conclusion

No matter how you make your time lapse videos, After Effects has a ton of features you can use to modify and enhance the way they look. Now that you are familiar with the fundamentals, you can play with the Frame Rates and Composition options.
