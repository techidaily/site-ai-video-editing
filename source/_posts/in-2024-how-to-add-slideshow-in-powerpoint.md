## Part 1: Not All Subtitles for MKV files Can Be Extracted (Hardsub Vs. Softsub)

As we have mentioned that there are tools and programs available that can help you remove the subtitle srt files, but here one thing needs to be remembered not all types of subtitle files can be extracted from the MKV videos. The reason for this lies in the type of subtitles used in the videos. So, first, let's learn about subtitle types and their differences.

There are two major types of forms of subtitles- hardsubs (also known as hardcoded subtitles or open subtitles) or softsubs (also known as closed subtitles or softcoded subtitles).

**Hardsubs** are the subtitles that are burned in the image of the videos and thus cannot be extracted, removed, hidden, or disabled when the video files are played.

**Softsubs** are the subtitles that are added as external files to the video container as an independent stream and thus can be turned off, removed, or extracted.

So, what we guide here is for ripping softsubs from videos in MKV videos. Now, let's dive into the details.

Pixel art is digital art created through computer software. In this digital art, images are edited on a pixel level. This gives the kind of aesthetic from computer video games using 8-bit and 16-bit technology. In general, this art uses very few color palettes, with some using only two.

The history of pixel art goes back to the 1930s with the monochromatic light bulb displays in New York City.

Pixel art tries to mimic the features of old video game graphics done by computers that were only able to display a few colors at once.

Digital pixel art evolved in such a way that artists are now dedicated to that art, and so create beautiful pixel art wallpapers that we'll show you in this article.

### 7\. The Spaceship

In this space-inspired pixel art wallpaper, we can see a spaceship with six people, two onboard, commanding it. One is fixing the spaceship; one is resting on the back, one on top scouting, one on the edging reaching for another in open space. There is also a dog on top of the spaceship and an alien-like creature in open space.

![pixel art wallpaper spaceship](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/pixel-art-wallpaper-spaceship.jpg)

### 8\. The Old Tree

In this pixel art wallpaper, we have a huge old tree that served as a refuge for passersby. It has a broken wood ladder and a wooden floor on an opening on the tree. The tree is inside a river, and a boat is moored next to it. Two birds rest on rocks on the margin, and we have the perspective behind the birds.

![pixel art wallpaper tree](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/pixel-art-wallpaper-tree.jpg)

### 9\. The Broken Earth

In this pixel art wallpaper, we have the planet earth floating in space. One part of the planet is broken and floating away. This pixel art wallpaper uses a black background, as well as blue, green and several tones of blue to make the oceans.

### 10\. The Airport

In this pixel art wallpaper, we have an airport terminal. We can see a plane landing on the course—workers pulling carts of baggage and other vehicles belonging to that setting. The sun is almost set, and so there is an orange sky above, as well as orange lights.
