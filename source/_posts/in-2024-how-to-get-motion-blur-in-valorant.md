### How to Save a Trimmed Video

Now that you have trimmed your video in Microsoft PowerPoint, you might want to save it to use it outside this program. You can only save the video file after compressing it, then you can use the trimmed video as you want.

After compressing your trimmed video, only the trimmed section will show up on your slide. That said, follow the steps below to save your trimmed video:

1. From the PowerPoint menu, select File > Info
2. Next, select the Compress Media option.
3. Next to Compress Media, you will see all media that are in your slideshow, including your trimmed video. If you've got other video files here, the compression process will apply to these files.
4. Choose the suitable level of compression. A dialog box will pop up as the compression process takes place. Hit the Close button when this process completes.
5. Go back to the slide that contains your trimmed video, which has now been compressed.
6. Right-click the compressed video, and select the Save Media As option.

![how to crop video in microsoft powerpoint ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/trim-video-in-powerpoint-8.png)

![crop video in microsoft powerpoint ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/trim-video-in-powerpoint-9.png)

1. On the edges of your video clip, you'll see dark crop handles. If you use the Video Shape option, the crop handles will appear on the edge of that shape.
2. Pressing the Ctrl key on your keyboard while you drag allows you to alter how you crop. Pressing Ctrl plus dragging the side cropping handles resizes two opposite sides, while Ctrl plus dragging the corner cropping handles resizes all the four sides.
3. Pressing the Shift key on your keyboard while dragging will give you different results. You can also use the Shift and Ctrl keys simultaneously to combine both capabilities.
4. You can reposition the crop by either moving the video itself or the crop area.
5. Crop the unwanted portion by hitting the Crop button again or pressing the Enter key. You can also click on the Slide Area to apply the cropping changes.
6. You can access more crop options by right-clicking the video, where a contextual menu will appear. Select the Format Video option.
7. You'll see the Format Video Task Pane; select the Crop option.

#### How to Play Video Inside a Shape

If you want to edit your video and enhance its appearance, you can have it play inside a unique shape instead of the usual rectangle format that videos play in. In turn, you'll draw attention to your video.

To play your video in an unusual shape, select your video and navigate to the Format tab. Then, go to the Video Shape menu, where you'll see multiple shapes to choose from.

#### How to Apply Preset Video Styles

You can also liven up your video by applying one of the pre-designed styles that PowerPoints provides. These styles combine various effects, including bevels, reflections, shadows, tilts, and frames.

Applying preset video styles is a simple process. Select the video, then navigate to the Format tab. Click More under the Video Style section. You'll see a gallery of preset styles; roll your mouse over it and hold the cursor over any style type. The program will apply a live preview of this style to your video.
