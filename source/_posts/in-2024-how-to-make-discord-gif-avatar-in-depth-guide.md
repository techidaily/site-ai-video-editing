Many gamers consider it a revolutionized application that solves all their worries making gaming communication bigger and better. Before Discord, gaming communication was difficult and dangerous. After all, you need to share personal Skype details that connect with your phone, making it a not-safe option.

Discord brings out the best network channel; gamers and friends have quickly started using it.

The same case happens for Discord emojis. They are there to make communication appealing, interesting, funny and reveal how you feel about a situation.

**Importance of Discord emojis**

**●** **Emojis help you to communicate the right emotions**. Sometimes, it's impossible to express the right feelings using words, and emojis come to the rescue in such situations. Of course, they are useless for formal communication, but Discord holds a considerable weight for various issues.

**●** **They are fun and exciting**. Sometimes you can choose to use an emoji instead of writing some phrase, and this option works for all. Besides, it feels good to see different emojis instead of a long paragraph that tells the same story.

**●** **Emojis make communication easy**. We are in the 21st century with multiple revolutionary changes with our communication channels. Young people prefer emojis for different conversations.

**●** **It offers a sense of presence in a conversation**. People believed that they could only hold exciting discussions when they were together. Over time, this statement has been proved impossible since we can't always be there to hold serious talks. We need Discord emojis since they give a sense of physical presence.

**●** **They liven up a serious conversation**. Have you ever noticed, people tend to include emojis when having serious talks making them more casual and creating a friendly environment that suits everyone? And this trick often works.

## Part 3\. Free Premiere Filter Presets to Use

Adobe Premiere Pro comes with a handful of video filters. However, you can add various free Premiere Pro filter presets and apply them to your video. Here is the list of the free Premiere Pro filter presets to use on your video.

**Retro Preset Pack -**

There is a craze to have retro filters on the video so that the video looks different and takes the audience back to the golden old days. This is a collection of filter presets where you can get different old-school styles. Starting from VHS filter effect to RGB split, there are ample filter presets to make your video look retro.

**Cinematic LUT Pack -**

There is no doubt that cinematic videos always look class apart from the rest of the videos and this is the perfect collection of video filters you need. Use these filters to deepen and sharpen colors and cut down brightness so that the video becomes eye-catching and eye-soothing. This is a must-have video filter you should have in Premiere Pro so that you can make regular videos look extraordinary.

**Panoramic Transitions Pack -**

Transitions are a part of video filters in Premiere Pro and if you want something different in transition effects, you should opt for Panoramic transitions. Starting from fish-eye effect to spinning effect, you can apply them when you move from one scene to another or one clip to another.

**Free Animated Text Preset Pack -**

Text is an important part of any video and you need video filter presets to apply to the textual part. Instead of the regular text filters, the animated text presets are extremely eye-catching. Starting from shake animations to bounce animations, 13 free animation titles can transform your video especially the part where texts are the main highlights.

**Glitch Effects Pack -**

If you make videos for social media or you make informational videos, glitch effects must be in your videos. You can get quick attention of your audience with glitch effects, make scene transitions, and add some comedy scenes. Your video will have some extra kick and look more interesting to watch.

## Conclusion

If you are using Adobe Premiere Pro to edit your videos, adding filters to your videos could be quite common. We have illustrated how to add filter to video in Premiere Pro to enhance your video quality and outlook. We have also listed the must-have free Premiere Pro filter presents. If you are looking for an alternative to add video filters, we recommend Wondershare Filmora.
