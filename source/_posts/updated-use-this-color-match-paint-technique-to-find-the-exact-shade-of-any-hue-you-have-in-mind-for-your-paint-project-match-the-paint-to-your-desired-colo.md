Premiere Pro can help you trim videos, leaving you with tight and compelling content that engages your audience. Developed by Adobe Inc., this timeline-based video editing software application is ideal for those who want to produce the best video. We'll explain how to trim videos in Premiere Pro.

## What Is the Difference Between Cutting and Trimming a Video?

If you are new to video editing, you might find that cutting and trimming video files sound the same to you. At first sight, you'll see that these two operations are similar because they involve the cutting of videos. Let's look at the differences between these two operations.

### Trimming

Trimming is the process of cutting off a portion of the end or beginning of your video to reduce its length, leaving the desired content only. Trimming is vital when you want to ensure your video starts swiftly and your viewers will not get bored while waiting for something captivating to occur.

The first seconds of a video are what draw viewers' attention and convince them to continue watching the entire video. When you apply it intelligently, video trimming allows you to remove unnecessary frames from the beginning and end of your video and leave content that your audience will like.

### Cutting

Cutting is also a fundamental video editing skill, and it involves removing a portion of a video clip by cutting in two places. You'll then lift out the middle area and combine the leftover video back together.

This operation is helpful when you want to polish your video and cut off meaningless snippets. What's more? You can apply cutting if you intend to insert a section of your video clip into another one.

You might want to consider cutting when you want to share your video on social networks and need to cut it into pieces due to the video length limits.

People often confuse trimming with cutting because they are all about deleting sections of the video. However, trimming involves deleting the beginning and end of a video, while cutting refers to cutting a part of a video file from somewhere else. Understanding this crucial difference will allow you to edit your videos like a professional.

## How to Trim videos in Premiere Pro in Different Ways

You can trim video Premiere Pro on the timeline or program. Let's look at these two methods.

### Method 1:Trim Clips on Timeline

If you are wondering: What is a timeline? It's the area Premiere Pro where you arrange your videos and map out the edits you want to apply. You will see all your video clips, transitions, effects, and more laid out in chronological order while you are working on your project. You can Premiere Pro trim video clips on the timeline, and at any point, play your project to check how your edits will look.

Remember that edits on the Premiere Pro timeline don't alter your source files, and they are previews of how your edits will appear. That means you can untrim a video clip to extend it to its original length without consequence.

To learn how to trim video in Premiere Pro on the timeline, follow the steps below.

1. Double click on the video file you want to trim in Premiere Pro.
2. Adjust the timings of your edits. Drag the ends of your video clip as if you are resizing a window to shorten or extend by trimming. As your cursor gets closer at the edge of the video clip, you'll see a red arrow.

![how to trim video in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-trim-videos-in-premiere-pro-1.png)

## Extra Tips About Trimming Videos in Premiere Pro

We have provided some tips that you should keep in mind when using Adobe Premiere trim video.

### How to Trim a Video without Re-Rendering?

When adding a video to Premiere Pro, it will be rendered by this software application to ensure high-quality playback and speed. Rendering takes time afterward, leading to loss of quality; however, it makes sure you have gotten the best video quality as much as possible by removing skipped frames and lag from the video playback.

If you are wondering how to trim videos in Premiere Pro without re-render follow the steps below:

1. Import your video to Premiere Pro by launching the application and choosing 'Import Media to Start'. Browse and select the video you want to trim.
2. The video will appear in the media library area at the bottom of the screen.
3. Drag and drop the video from the media library to the timeline. You'll see the complete video clip duration in the timeline.
4. You can crop the video by dragging the blue time marker to the duration where you would like to start the video.
5. Hold the 'Ctrl' key on your keyboard, then drag the starting end of the video clip to the time marker position. You'll remove unnecessary video content from the beginning of your video.
6. You can trim the video from its other end by following the same steps but from the opposite direction. You can only use this method to trim from one of the ends of your video clip.
7. Choose the 'Laser Tool' located at the side menu of the timeline to trim from the center of the video clip. Now, click on the clip at the position you want to trim, and the application will cut the video from this position.
8. Follow steps 2 to 4 to trim from cuts you've just made.

![trimming video without re-rendering in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-trim-videos-in-premiere-pro-5.png)

1. Go to 'File' and choose the 'Export' option. Tap 'Media' from the list, and you will be directed to the export setting. Here, you can adjust specific settings, such as quality, name, and format. Click 'Export' after entering the appropriate information.

![trim video without re-rendering in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-trim-videos-in-premiere-pro-6.png)

### Unlink Audio and Video for Trimming

When you upload a video file to Adobe Premiere Pro and take it into the timeline, the audio tracks and video will be synced and locked. Essentially, this ensures there is no misalignment when the program converts the video to another format. For example, importing it into another video editor can cause a mis-sync between audio and video if the two tracks are not locked or linked.

Video editing professionals avoid this by locking the two tracks together. As such, you might want to unlink or unlock the two before doing anything. To do this, you need to import the video into the application and take it to the timeline with the associated tracks. Then, select the video track alone.

![unlink audio from video in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-trim-videos-in-premiere-pro-7.png)

Next, right-click the video track and select the Unlink option. The software will separate the audio from the video track. You can now trim either of these.

### How to Trim and Re-Encode Videos without Re-Rendering

Follow the method below to trim video Premiere Pro and encode it without rendering it.

1. Launch Premiere Pro and navigate to File, then choose import. Find the video that you want to trim and double click on it.
2. Drag and drop the video into the timeline.
3. Choose the 'Ripple Edit Tool' and then Press 'Sequence'. Head to 'Sequence Settings' and set or modify the codec, bitrate, name, format, and much more.
4. Adjust the Ripple so that it defines the end time and start time that you want for your video.
5. Now, finalize the trim by choosing 'File' and tap 'Export'. To 'Export Settings,' elect 'Media'.

### Unlink Audio and Video for Trimming

When you upload a video file to Adobe Premiere Pro and take it into the timeline, the audio tracks and video will be synced and locked. Essentially, this ensures there is no misalignment when the program converts the video to another format. For example, importing it into another video editor can cause a mis-sync between audio and video if the two tracks are not locked or linked.

Video editing professionals avoid this by locking the two tracks together. As such, you might want to unlink or unlock the two before doing anything. To do this, you need to import the video into the application and take it to the timeline with the associated tracks. Then, select the video track alone.

![unlink audio from video in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-trim-videos-in-premiere-pro-7.png)

Next, right-click the video track and select the Unlink option. The software will separate the audio from the video track. You can now trim either of these.

## What Is the Difference Between Cutting and Trimming a Video?

If you are new to video editing, you might find that cutting and trimming video files sound the same to you. At first sight, you'll see that these two operations are similar because they involve the cutting of videos. Let's look at the differences between these two operations.

### Trimming

Trimming is the process of cutting off a portion of the end or beginning of your video to reduce its length, leaving the desired content only. Trimming is vital when you want to ensure your video starts swiftly and your viewers will not get bored while waiting for something captivating to occur.

The first seconds of a video are what draw viewers' attention and convince them to continue watching the entire video. When you apply it intelligently, video trimming allows you to remove unnecessary frames from the beginning and end of your video and leave content that your audience will like.

### Cutting

Cutting is also a fundamental video editing skill, and it involves removing a portion of a video clip by cutting in two places. You'll then lift out the middle area and combine the leftover video back together.

This operation is helpful when you want to polish your video and cut off meaningless snippets. What's more? You can apply cutting if you intend to insert a section of your video clip into another one.

You might want to consider cutting when you want to share your video on social networks and need to cut it into pieces due to the video length limits.

People often confuse trimming with cutting because they are all about deleting sections of the video. However, trimming involves deleting the beginning and end of a video, while cutting refers to cutting a part of a video file from somewhere else. Understanding this crucial difference will allow you to edit your videos like a professional.

Moreover, the video will lose its charm if you put cuts on every beat. People will not be able to enjoy, let alone understand, what is happening in the film.

##### What are the beats?

Beats are pieces of music that recur in a pattern. They are essential for music videos. It adds attraction for the viewers. Also, without beats, no music video can go viral. In the digital age, beats boost your music video.

### How to smooth out cuts

Adding cuts in the beats is one part of the job, not the whole job. After adding these cuts, you have to smoothen them. With it, the point of interest for the audience becomes clear.

To maintain the audience's attention on our video, we have to smoothen the cuts so that our audience quickly understands the ongoing story in our video. If sudden changes occur on the screen, watching it gets disconcerting.

Indeed, you would not want your audience to have this experience. Head to the following techniques to understand how to smooth out video cuts

##### Technique 1: Showing multiple perspectives

The focal person in the video must occupy the same spot in the previous shot as it maintains in the current shot.

Let us understand from the example given below.

* **Shot 1**: The actress in the music video is occupying the left seat on the bus while looking outside.

![focusing on the main lead in the first shot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/smooth-out-cuts-1.jpg)

* **Shot 2**: The actress occupies the same spot in the subsequent shot.

![focusing the actress in the second shot from a different angle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/smooth-out-cuts-2.jpg)

* **Third Shot**: The shot shows the wide angle of the bus from the inside. The actress is still sitting in the same position and the same place.

![focusing the actress in the third shot from a different angle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/smooth-out-cuts-3.jpg)

This technique keeps the audience focused on the point of interest while giving them a different perspective of the scene.

##### Technique 2: Using light leaks

The technique is quite helpful for the transition between two cuts. It uses different levels of colors to shine between cuts, adding smoothness and providing coherence.

##### What are light leaks?

Light leaks are great effects in Filmora. These effects fill the screen with light. It seems that light is leaking in a disorderly fashion. For the time being, the whole screen is filled with that effect. Thus, it explains the name of this effect as a light leak.

## Part 2\. Polishing Your Music Video

Just like ladies apply polish to their nails to make them more attractive, you can use editing to your music video to get the same result. Ladies can go to the beautician if they want. You can go to a professional editor if you like it.

However, these options are pretty expensive. The best way is to do it yourself. It is fun. Also, you can let loose your hidden artist for a while. Stick to the following points to understand how to begin polishing your music video.

### How to put cuts on beats?

Adding beat cuts to a music video is imperative. Randomly placing beats yield an inferior-quality video. It also gives the impression that video editing is not done by a professional. The beats must be adjusted to synchronize with the storyline of the video.

Moreover, the video will lose its charm if you put cuts on every beat. People will not be able to enjoy, let alone understand, what is happening in the film.

##### What are the beats?

Beats are pieces of music that recur in a pattern. They are essential for music videos. It adds attraction for the viewers. Also, without beats, no music video can go viral. In the digital age, beats boost your music video.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Cuts are recommended on every 2nd and 4th beat. In that way, a smooth transition of music beats takes place, making it more ear-pleasing. It also gives a professional outlook to the whole music.

Let's learn how you can put cuts on your beats.

##### Step1Import the music video

* Import the Music video to which you would like to add any beat.
* You can also use the one given in Filmora.
* Drag and Drop the music video in the timeline panel.

![importing video in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/importing-video-in-filmora.jpg)

##### Step2Detach its audio

* Right-click on the video.
* Select the option "Detach Audio." It will separate the attached audio from the music. You will be able to add cuts where you deem necessary.

![detach audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/detach-audio-in-filmora.jpg)

You can also import audio from your drive. After that, drag and drop the imported file into the timeline panel.

* Right, Click on the audio file in the audio panel.
* Select the option **"Beat Detection."** It will show beats (with red markers) on the audio timeline, making adding cuts to the beat easy.

![beat detection](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/beat-detection-in-filmora.jpg)

##### Step3Cut the beats where you find necessary

* Listen carefully to the audio file and plan where you want to add a cut to your beat.

![cutting the beat](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/cutting-the-beat-in-filmora.jpg)

* Adjust the beat according to your music video.
* Join the trimmed video segments to maintain continuity. The final product should look like the one given below.

![adjusting cut to the music video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/adjusting-cut-to-the-music-video.jpg)

Resultantly, it will readjust the beat to a different spot on the video. You can make multiple cuts in the beats. However, it is not recommended. It makes the whole experience of listening quite jarring.

Once you've added cuts to the beats, it is time to make them smooth. For that, keep reading the instructions given below.

### How to smooth out cuts

Adding cuts in the beats is one part of the job, not the whole job. After adding these cuts, you have to smoothen them. With it, the point of interest for the audience becomes clear.

To maintain the audience's attention on our video, we have to smoothen the cuts so that our audience quickly understands the ongoing story in our video. If sudden changes occur on the screen, watching it gets disconcerting.

Indeed, you would not want your audience to have this experience. Head to the following techniques to understand how to smooth out video cuts

##### Technique 1: Showing multiple perspectives

The focal person in the video must occupy the same spot in the previous shot as it maintains in the current shot.

Let us understand from the example given below.

* **Shot 1**: The actress in the music video is occupying the left seat on the bus while looking outside.

![focusing on the main lead in the first shot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/smooth-out-cuts-1.jpg)

* **Shot 2**: The actress occupies the same spot in the subsequent shot.

![focusing the actress in the second shot from a different angle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/smooth-out-cuts-2.jpg)

* **Third Shot**: The shot shows the wide angle of the bus from the inside. The actress is still sitting in the same position and the same place.

![focusing the actress in the third shot from a different angle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/smooth-out-cuts-3.jpg)

This technique keeps the audience focused on the point of interest while giving them a different perspective of the scene.

##### Technique 2: Using light leaks

The technique is quite helpful for the transition between two cuts. It uses different levels of colors to shine between cuts, adding smoothness and providing coherence.

##### What are light leaks?

Light leaks are great effects in Filmora. These effects fill the screen with light. It seems that light is leaking in a disorderly fashion. For the time being, the whole screen is filled with that effect. Thus, it explains the name of this effect as a light leak.

Filmora provides a plethora of features for adding Light Leak for transitioning cuts. With the use of Filmora, one can quickly bring a level of flow to the music video. Keep reading to understand how to use this remarkable feature of Filmora.
