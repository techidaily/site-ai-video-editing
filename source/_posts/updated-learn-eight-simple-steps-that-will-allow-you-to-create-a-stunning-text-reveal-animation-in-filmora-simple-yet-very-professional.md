## Want to Know the Full Process of Adding the Falling Text Effect as a Video Introduction? Detailed Guidelines on All the Steps Are Mentioned Here for Filmora Users

Indeed, there are different elements of a video that has the potential to make it stand out to viewers. The title you add to the video, content information in the slides, and other elements are some parts that capture one's interest.

But seeing only the text in single lines or paragraphs can get repetitive and unappealing, especially with so many videos having the same style. In this context, the fun falling text effect is a unique and exciting approach to making your titles in videos engaging. It creates a fun look when the viewer clicks into the video and is met with this styling title effect.

On [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), there is a feature available for users to apply this effect to videos in a more straightforward sequence of steps than other editors. Yet, knowing how it works is still valid, even for experienced editing professionals. In this post, we shall detail all of the steps that go into creating this effect in videos, with examples.

## Launch Filmora on the Device

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

After switching on your device and going to your preferred browser, search for Wonderhsare Filmora's official website. Upon accessing it, you will see the "Download" button at the top of the screen. Click on it, and the respective Filmora installer will download into your device instantly, depending on your OS type.

Then, you have to double-click on the installer file you will find in the Downloads folder. This will open the software installation problem window. Click on the Install button and then tap the Agree option for the terms & conditions that appear next on the screen. After that, the software will begin installing automatically.

![click on the install button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-falling-text-effect-in-filmora-1.gif)

Finally, press the Start Now button on the installation complete prompt window. The software will then launch automatically.

## Adjust the project settings

After the software launches on your device, you should tap on the Create New Project button. Before you add the video file you will edit from your device through; you should take time to change some aspects of the project settings.

For this, click on the File tab at the top-most toolbar in the editor window. You should click on the Project Settings option from the drop-down menu, which will open the dialog box. Under the resolution option, you will see the Frame Rate element. Click on the drop-down menu and adjust the video's frame rate to 25 FPS. After you are done, tap the OK button.

![adjust the frame rate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-falling-text-effect-in-filmora-2.gif)

## Add the Title

Following this, you must click on the Titles tab at the top toolbar on the editor. Different title templates, like Custom, Openers, End Credits, etc., will appear. Choose the default title of your liking and download it.

Next, hold the title that appears in the library window and then drag it to the first layer of the editing timeline. Clip the title short by moving the play head to the 3-second and 15 frames mark and shape the title to that length. Then, delete the rest of the part.

![clip the title short](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-falling-text-effect-in-filmora-3.gif)

## Edit the Title

After this, you have to double-click on the top of the default title in your Track 1 timeline. A window will appear for editing the title.

![change the font of the title](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-falling-text-effect-in-filmora-4.gif)

## Animate the characters

When this part is done, in the text field, add the first letter of the text you will add to your animated introduction. After inserting the first letter only, click on the Animation tab next. Following that, you have to move the playhead on your timeline to the very front. You will see the Position parameter in the Animation settings and change the number in the Y axis until it goes out of the top frame of the video.

![change the number on the y axis](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-falling-text-effect-in-filmora-5.gif)

Next, you must move the play head to the 1-second position in the timeline. Here, you must change the number Y axis to a lower position and adjust the Rotate element as per your preference. After that, move the playhead again to 15 frames from the 1-second mark. It would be best if you changed the Y-axis position digit to 0 and adjusted the Rotation value slightly.

Following that, move the playhead again by 15 frames ahead. Rotate the letter again and change the Y-axis value until the letter rests at the bottom of the screen. Again, you have to move the play head on the timeline to 10 frames ahead and adjust the Y-axis and Rotation values to a higher point. Then, continue the step like this at ten frames forward, this time making the character move to the ground again. Press the OK button to complete.

![move the playhead on the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-falling-text-effect-in-filmora-6.gif)

## Repeat for the next letters

After you are done with this editing process for the first letter, hold the default title in the library and drag and drop it into Track 2 on the timeline. Adjust the starting point for this layer to frame five from the beginning, and move the file to that starting point. In the end, cut the title length at the same position as layer one was, at 3.15 seconds.

Follow the process explained in the previous section for the first letter, i.e., moving the playhead at specific frames and changing the Y-axis and Rotation value multiple times.

After editing the second letter in the title, repeat the process of holding and dragging the default title to Track 3 in the timeline and adjusting starting position at the 10th frame. Again, follow the process of animating the letter like for Letter 1 and Letter 2\. Continue doing this process for multiple more letters in your title text.

![follow the process for letters 1 and 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-falling-text-effect-in-filmora-7.gif)

Tap on the Play button under the Preview screen to see how the letters have the falling text effect.

## Add Screenshot

Next, you have to click on the hide button for Tracks 2 and up. Tap on the Snapshot icon in the editing timeline of the first letter. Then, when it appears in the library window, click on it and move it beside the Track 1 Title file that you were editing. Move the play head to the 1-second position of this file in the timeline.

Hide Track 1 again and click the Unhide button on Track 2\. Repeat the snapshot function and add it to Layer 2\. Adjust the end as per Track 1\. After this, follow these steps for the subsequent letters as well.

![tap on the snapshot icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-falling-text-effect-in-filmora-8.gif)

## Adjust Keyframing

Follow the animation process for all of the title clips and screenshots you did before. Move the play head to the point where the Tracks end and the Screenshots on the timeline start. Choose the first letter and click on the Keyframe icon in the editing window under Animation. Then, make adjustments to the values of Position, Rotation, etc.

Continue this keyframing step for all of the letters in sequence. After you are done here, click on the Render Preview icon on the right-hand side of the toolbar above the editing timeline. See how the falling text effects line up.

![click on the render preview icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-falling-text-effect-in-filmora-9.gif)

After editing the second letter in the title, repeat the process of holding and dragging the default title to Track 3 in the timeline and adjusting starting position at the 10th frame. Again, follow the process of animating the letter like for Letter 1 and Letter 2\. Continue doing this process for multiple more letters in your title text.

![follow the process for letters 1 and 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-falling-text-effect-in-filmora-7.gif)

Tap on the Play button under the Preview screen to see how the letters have the falling text effect.

## Add Screenshot

Next, you have to click on the hide button for Tracks 2 and up. Tap on the Snapshot icon in the editing timeline of the first letter. Then, when it appears in the library window, click on it and move it beside the Track 1 Title file that you were editing. Move the play head to the 1-second position of this file in the timeline.

Hide Track 1 again and click the Unhide button on Track 2\. Repeat the snapshot function and add it to Layer 2\. Adjust the end as per Track 1\. After this, follow these steps for the subsequent letters as well.

![tap on the snapshot icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-falling-text-effect-in-filmora-8.gif)

## Adjust Keyframing

Follow the animation process for all of the title clips and screenshots you did before. Move the play head to the point where the Tracks end and the Screenshots on the timeline start. Choose the first letter and click on the Keyframe icon in the editing window under Animation. Then, make adjustments to the values of Position, Rotation, etc.

Continue this keyframing step for all of the letters in sequence. After you are done here, click on the Render Preview icon on the right-hand side of the toolbar above the editing timeline. See how the falling text effects line up.

![click on the render preview icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-falling-text-effect-in-filmora-9.gif)

After that, you can export the final file to your device or do further editing work through the Export button.

## Final Words

Indeed, adding the falling text effect should allow you to create a stunning, dynamic, and engaging video project. While the feature is available in many other editing software, you can expect a better user experience on Filmora, especially as a beginner-level user.

The UI on this software is simple to navigate, with all features easily accessible. Besides the falling text customization benefits, you will also use other effects, filters, and title presets in videos with some simple taps. So, install it soon and give it a try.

Many converter tools are available for downloading high-quality videos from Instagram Reels. The best ones we tested out with these benefits are InstaVideoSave and iGram. In the former, you can download HD quality videos to 1080p resolution, while iGram allows video downloads to 720p.

### 3\. How can I download reels audio or sound only?

There are specific tools that users can opt for to download Instagram videos in audio format. AceThinker, for example, is the best online converter to download only the audio from the Instagram video links you add. Users opt for this software to convert IG-based music videos into MP3 files.

## Final Words

Overall, multiple online converter tools are available for downloading different IG content like Reels, Videos, and Images to video/audio/image file format. Among them, InstaVideoSave and F2mp are the two tools where we noticed the best benefits. However, F2mp is a paid software, so choose it only for premium features.
