![youtube funny video ideas](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/funny-content-ideas-1.jpg)

If you ever plan to create funny videos, what are you going to do? What type of content will you make? The following section of this article will bring 5 ideas to you. With these ideas, you can create funny videos for YouTube.

### 1\. Prank Videos

Who doesn't enjoy pranking others? Well, we all love to play safe pranks on our loved ones. Surprisingly, people love to watch these pranks. This is the perfect idea for funny videos. You can set a hiding camera, prank someone and record it. By sharing the prank, you can make someone laugh. Pranks are not always planned. Sometimes candid things can also do the job.

### 2\. Baby and Kids Videos

Who doesn't like babies? One idea for funny videos is sharing your baby's or kid's activities. Babies and kids are very cute, adorable, and innocent. They always do cute little disasters, which are fun to watch. You can share their funny and cute moments with everyone. Kids and babies can easily make everyone laugh. Their cuteness will attract the audience.

### 3\. Challenge Videos

Challenge videos are another type of video which are fun to watch. Simple challenges which do not harm anyone in any way are encouraged. Challenge videos automatically become funny. Things get funny when someone can't complete the challenge and is desperate to get it done. Completing the challenge and struggling to get things done seems funny.

### 4\. Plan a Skit

Skits are very successful. The factors that help in making unique skits are the idea and the humor. If both things are amazing and well presented, your skit will shine. The fact because skits are short comedy films, they effortlessly attract the audience. So, creating skits is another fantastic idea for funny YouTube content.

### 5\. Blooper Videos

Blooper videos are naturally funny. You don't have to put extra effort to make them funny. Bloopers are the funny things that take place while you try to record something. Bloopers never make it to the final video, but they are always fun to watch. So instead of watching and enjoying them alone, you can share them on YouTube so that everyone can enjoy the fun behind the scenes.
