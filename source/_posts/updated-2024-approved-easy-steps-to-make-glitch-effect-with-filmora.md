## Easy Steps to Make Glitch Effect with Filmora

You don't need outdated VCRs or any other broken technology to produce glitch effects. Instead, you can use a video editing program for Mac and PCs, such as [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), to transform your videos into glitch-effect masterpieces. You can also use the glitch effects to provide striking shot transitions or opening titles. Keep reading this article on how to apply various glitch video effects in Filmora 11:

## Part 1: What is a Glitch Effect?

A glitch effect occurs when a section of your video temporarily changes look or "glitches" for a short while. Although transient glitches are typical, they can occasionally linger for a few seconds or more.

![what is a glitch effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/glitch_effect_2.jpg)

You can use a glitch effect to temporarily change the appearance of the image in the video to give the impression that a machine is processing it. Additionally, it gives your finished piece a fantastic, dreamlike aspect.

## Part 2: When Should you Apply a Glitch Effect?

A few years back, we had no choice but to watch glitchy movies on rusty VCR devices. Nowadays, retro video effects are very popular in TV movies and even games. You can use these effects in many ways, like making fake vintage footage or emulating a glitching computer.

Filmmakers frequently employ glitching in their videos to give the impression that a character has been affected by a technical abnormality, is having a flashback, or is being watched by someone else via a digital camera system. Something happens when the person or image flashes, often without their knowledge. In addition, you can apply the glitch effect to a composition to evoke a feeling of dramatic irony.

## Part 3: Tutorial to Chromatic Aberration Effect

Chromatic aberration refers to how old lenses tend to split colors. This effect is very common in Old media like VHS or LaserDisc.

## How to Convert Time-Lapse to Normal Video

Ever since video cameras were invented, there have been various technological advancements in filming. And today people generally use smartphones or portable cameras to record videos. But one of the interesting ways in which smart devices can capture moments is using the timelapse feature. Timelapse files are a way of videography in which the camera or smart device captures frames in intervals of a few seconds or minutes.

In this way, you get a stop motion-like video at the end. This format of the video is both interesting and can be used to capture long hours of activities. But often we are needed to **convert time-lapse to normal video** to export or share them over a platform. For these requirements, there are different applications available across multiple operating systems.
