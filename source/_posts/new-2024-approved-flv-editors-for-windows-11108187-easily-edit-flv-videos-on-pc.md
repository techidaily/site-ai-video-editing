FLV is basically used to publish or distribute videos on the Internet. Many social platforms and web pages (such as youtube, Hulu, e.t.c.) use .flv files as it provide high-quality synchronized audio and video in compact file size. It was mostly used for embedded videos on these platforms. It is compatible with most browsers and devices even with older phones and computers.

**How to play .FLV files?**

To play .flv files a flash player is required. Which is pre-installed in almost most of the computers and browsers, if that's not the case. Then you need a good video player which supports .flv format. Therefore VLC media prayer is a good choice. It is quite easy to use and has some useful features like Speed, Adding subtitles, Audio sync, e.t.c.

If you don't want to stick with the .flv format for long enough and want to switch over to a more convenient format then you can try these converters.

**Note:** You don't want all the outlines to play simultaneously. Otherwise, the outlines will not appear to be separate.

* To do so, stack the videos on each other on different tracks.

**Tip:** The trick here will be to offset the video by a few seconds so that each video plays a little later than the other.

![offset the videos by a few seconds](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/neon-dance-effect-9.png)

* In the effects panel, search for the **Pixelated edges**
* You will notice a search bar in the top right corner. Type "**Pixelated edges,**" and you will see some effects pop up in the import window.

![searching for pixelated edges effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/neon-dance-effect-5.png)

* Select the Pixelated edges effect. Then, click and drag it below the video that we turned to black using the **Difference**
* The edges of the individual dancing in the video will be outlined.

##### Step5 Change the outline color

You may not like the default color with the Pixelated edges effect. But no worries, you can change that to whatever color you desire by following these steps:

* Double-Click on the video in which you added the **effect**.
* An editing panel will pop up.
* Click on the **Effect** option below the **Video**
* Here, you can see the color option.
* Click on the **color** and select whatever suits you the best.

##### Step6 Create Multiple Outlines

It would help if you created multiple outlines to achieve the Neon Dance effect. These multiple outlines will be produced by exporting them multiple times with the color you want. Follow the below points to get it instantly!

* When you have selected the color for your outline, export the video by clicking on the **Export** icon in the top right corner.

![export the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/neon-dance-effect-8.png)

* When you have exported the video, move back to the timeline to edit again.
* As we had selected the **Blue** color for reference, now choose another color you wish.
* After changing the video, export it again.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Export as many times as you want with the color of your choice. **E.g., 5 colors = 5 exports.**

##### Step7 Import the exported videos

* Now you have to import the videos that you exported.
* Before doing that, first, delete the video in track 2\. (The video on which we applied the **Difference**)
* Now select all the exports from your library and import them onto the import window.
* Please select all of them and drag them on the timeline.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You don't want all the outlines to play simultaneously. Otherwise, the outlines will not appear to be separate.

* To do so, stack the videos on each other on different tracks.

**Tip:** The trick here will be to offset the video by a few seconds so that each video plays a little later than the other.

![offset the videos by a few seconds](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/neon-dance-effect-9.png)

To efficiently blend the outlines with the green screen, you can change the blending mode of each of the exported videos to "**Lighten**."

* Double-click on each video.
* In the editing panel, choose compositing.
* From there, select the "**Lighten**" option.

![change the blending mode to lighten](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/neon-dance-effect-10.png)

##### Step8 Add the Glow effect

To make the outlines glow like Neon lights, we will need to add another effect from the effects library.

* Go to the effects tab and search for "**Glow**."
* Click and **drag** the glow effect to each of the exported videos.

![add the glow effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/neon-dance-effect-11.gif)

You can make it more fun by going one step further!

* Double-click on each of the glow effects that you added.
* In effect, the **editing panel** goes to the video effects.
* Here, you can change the **radius** of the Glow effect you added.
* Similarly, you can do it in all the other videos.

##### Step9 Apply the Green screen effect

We will change our green screen for the final part. Follow the last steps, and then enjoy!

* Move the green screen footage below them all to the top track.
* Double-click the video to enter the editing panel.
* Go to the chroma key (Green Screen) in the editing panel**.**
* Click on the arrow aside from the tab.

You will immediately see changes to your video in the main play window. Play the video from the start and notice the changes.

## How to Add Subtitles in QuickTime Player?

QuickTime is among the most popular multimedia players available for PC users. Developed by Apple Inc. in 1991, it was initially made available for Mac OS. However, from 2005 till 2016, QuickTime was available for Windows operating systems as well. While QuickTime allows you to view images and music, it is a popular choice for playing videos.

Do you use QuickTime player to watch music videos, movies, and TV shows? Well, you may find it interesting that the QuickTime player allows you to add subtitles. As there are multiple methods through which you can add subtitles in QuickTime, we are going to discuss them one by one in this blog. So, let’s start our discussion!

## Method 1: Turn on the Subtitles in QuickTime

As you might know, some videos come with embedded subtitles. It’s up to you whether you want to view them while playing the video or not. If you are playing a video with embedded subtitles in the QuickTime player but are somehow unable to view the subtitles, it’s probably because the subtitles feature is turned off. So, you need to enable the subtitles by following certain steps.

### Steps to Turn on Subtitles in QuickTime

## Method 2: Download and Add Subtitles to Videos in QuickTime

If you want to play videos in QuickTime that do not have embedded subtitles, you can add subtitles to them manually.
