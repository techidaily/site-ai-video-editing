## Part 7: How to Choose the Right Screen Recorder?

Here are the main parameters you need to keep in mind while choosing the best screen recorder for you.

1\. Recording options: An ideal screen recorder should have all the different options for recording your screen, webcam, system audio, and external audio from microphone. Besides, it should offer you the option to customize the recording area by selection. You should be able to record full screen, application window, and browser tab accurately.

2\. Price: If you are serious about recording your screen video and uploading the recorded video on online platforms, you have to opt for a premium screen recorder. While purchasing a proprietary screen recorder, you need to compare the software price with its peers and ensure that you are getting more features for the price you are paying.

3\. Customer support: You need to ensure that the screen recorder you are purchasing, they have a highly responsive customer support. This is a highly neglected factor but users suffer a lot when the customer support team is not responsive. Be sure that you will need to contact the customer support team at some time to learn more about certain features and troubleshoot in emergency situations.

4\. Sharing options: When your ultimate goal is to share your recorded video online, you should check for the sharing options available in the screen recorder. There are screen recorders that allow sharing recorded and edited videos on online platforms, cloud storage platforms, and video streaming platforms. It should also offer you options to let you export videos in different file formats.

5\. Video editing tools: You have to edit your recorded video to trim out unnecessary parts and add effects and filters to enhance your video content and video quality. Besides, you may need options to add music and voiceover as well as intro and outro. That is why you should opt for a screen recorder where a great video editor is available.

6\. Customer Reviews: Last but most importantly, you should check the customer review of the screen recording software. Even when a screen recorder has loads of features, if the customer reviews are not good enough, you should not choose you. Besides, the customer reviews reveal the pros and cons of a screen recorder for your better understanding.

## Part 8: Screen Recording Tips and Tricks

1\. Practice before recording: Unless you are a pro, you should practice at least once before the actual recording. This will help you to execute your plan according to your script smoothly when you actually start recording. Besides, you can check if the frame, the camera, the mic, and everything else are working perfectly.

2\. Only record the required screen: Screen recorders offer you the option to record the entire screen, any specific application window or any specific tab of your browser. In fact, you can even customize the screen recording area as per your requirements for better focus and better visual experience.

3\. Keep it short: It is always necessary to keep the length of the video as short as possible without skipping the relevant points and important explanations. That is where a proper script before recording is crucial so that you can have a plan and execute it properly without stretching your explanation unnecessarily.

4\. Speak slowly and clearly: The way you speak in the video can attract as well as repel audiences. If you speak too fast and if you have a weird accent, it is going to repel audiences. That is why it is important for you to speak slowly and clearly so that everyone can understand everything you speak and negate your accent to a greater extent.

5\. Use screen drawing tools: If you are recording a video where you need to explain something, it is always better if you use screen drawing tools. In fact, it is important that you choose the screen recorder that offers drawing tools so that the video gets visually pleasing and impactful for audiences to understand effectively.

6\. Cut out dead moments: When you are recording screen videos, there are going to be a lot of dead moments and boring pauses. You have to cut out those boring and dead moments while editing so that the video stays interesting and the audiences do not lose concentration. This will also help to tighten the length of the video.

7\. End with a summary: Last but most importantly, you should offer a proper conclusion before ending the video. You need to summarize everything you have discussed in the video so that the audience can get a revision of all the important points. Besides, a proper ending rather than an abrupt ending can leave a positive impact regarding your video.

1\. Recording options: An ideal screen recorder should have all the different options for recording your screen, webcam, system audio, and external audio from microphone. Besides, it should offer you the option to customize the recording area by selection. You should be able to record full screen, application window, and browser tab accurately.

2\. Price: If you are serious about recording your screen video and uploading the recorded video on online platforms, you have to opt for a premium screen recorder. While purchasing a proprietary screen recorder, you need to compare the software price with its peers and ensure that you are getting more features for the price you are paying.

3\. Customer support: You need to ensure that the screen recorder you are purchasing, they have a highly responsive customer support. This is a highly neglected factor but users suffer a lot when the customer support team is not responsive. Be sure that you will need to contact the customer support team at some time to learn more about certain features and troubleshoot in emergency situations.

4\. Sharing options: When your ultimate goal is to share your recorded video online, you should check for the sharing options available in the screen recorder. There are screen recorders that allow sharing recorded and edited videos on online platforms, cloud storage platforms, and video streaming platforms. It should also offer you options to let you export videos in different file formats.

5\. Video editing tools: You have to edit your recorded video to trim out unnecessary parts and add effects and filters to enhance your video content and video quality. Besides, you may need options to add music and voiceover as well as intro and outro. That is why you should opt for a screen recorder where a great video editor is available.

6\. Customer Reviews: Last but most importantly, you should check the customer review of the screen recording software. Even when a screen recorder has loads of features, if the customer reviews are not good enough, you should not choose you. Besides, the customer reviews reveal the pros and cons of a screen recorder for your better understanding.

## Part 8: Screen Recording Tips and Tricks

1\. Practice before recording: Unless you are a pro, you should practice at least once before the actual recording. This will help you to execute your plan according to your script smoothly when you actually start recording. Besides, you can check if the frame, the camera, the mic, and everything else are working perfectly.

2\. Only record the required screen: Screen recorders offer you the option to record the entire screen, any specific application window or any specific tab of your browser. In fact, you can even customize the screen recording area as per your requirements for better focus and better visual experience.

3\. Keep it short: It is always necessary to keep the length of the video as short as possible without skipping the relevant points and important explanations. That is where a proper script before recording is crucial so that you can have a plan and execute it properly without stretching your explanation unnecessarily.

4\. Speak slowly and clearly: The way you speak in the video can attract as well as repel audiences. If you speak too fast and if you have a weird accent, it is going to repel audiences. That is why it is important for you to speak slowly and clearly so that everyone can understand everything you speak and negate your accent to a greater extent.

5\. Use screen drawing tools: If you are recording a video where you need to explain something, it is always better if you use screen drawing tools. In fact, it is important that you choose the screen recorder that offers drawing tools so that the video gets visually pleasing and impactful for audiences to understand effectively.

6\. Cut out dead moments: When you are recording screen videos, there are going to be a lot of dead moments and boring pauses. You have to cut out those boring and dead moments while editing so that the video stays interesting and the audiences do not lose concentration. This will also help to tighten the length of the video.

7\. End with a summary: Last but most importantly, you should offer a proper conclusion before ending the video. You need to summarize everything you have discussed in the video so that the audience can get a revision of all the important points. Besides, a proper ending rather than an abrupt ending can leave a positive impact regarding your video.

Besides, it should offer you the option to customize the recording area by selection. You should be able to record full screen, application window, and browser tab accurately.

2\. Price: If you are serious about recording your screen video and uploading the recorded video on online platforms, you have to opt for a premium screen recorder. While purchasing a proprietary screen recorder, you need to compare the software price with its peers and ensure that you are getting more features for the price you are paying.

3\. Customer support: You need to ensure that the screen recorder you are purchasing, they have a highly responsive customer support. This is a highly neglected factor but users suffer a lot when the customer support team is not responsive. Be sure that you will need to contact the customer support team at some time to learn more about certain features and troubleshoot in emergency situations.

4\. Sharing options: When your ultimate goal is to share your recorded video online, you should check for the sharing options available in the screen recorder. There are screen recorders that allow sharing recorded and edited videos on online platforms, cloud storage platforms, and video streaming platforms. It should also offer you options to let you export videos in different file formats.

Besides, you may need options to add music and voiceover as well as intro and outro. That is why you should opt for a screen recorder where a great video editor is available.

6\. Customer Reviews: Last but most importantly, you should check the customer review of the screen recording software. Even when a screen recorder has loads of features, if the customer reviews are not good enough, you should not choose you. Besides, the customer reviews reveal the pros and cons of a screen recorder for your better understanding.

## Part 8: Screen Recording Tips and Tricks

1\. Practice before recording: Unless you are a pro, you should practice at least once before the actual recording. This will help you to execute your plan according to your script smoothly when you actually start recording. Besides, you can check if the frame, the camera, the mic, and everything else are working perfectly.

2\. Only record the required screen: Screen recorders offer you the option to record the entire screen, any specific application window or any specific tab of your browser. In fact, you can even customize the screen recording area as per your requirements for better focus and better visual experience.

3\. Keep it short: It is always necessary to keep the length of the video as short as possible without skipping the relevant points and important explanations. That is where a proper script before recording is crucial so that you can have a plan and execute it properly without stretching your explanation unnecessarily.

4\. Speak slowly and clearly: The way you speak in the video can attract as well as repel audiences. If you speak too fast and if you have a weird accent, it is going to repel audiences. That is why it is important for you to speak slowly and clearly so that everyone can understand everything you speak and negate your accent to a greater extent.

5\. Use screen drawing tools: If you are recording a video where you need to explain something, it is always better if you use screen drawing tools. In fact, it is important that you choose the screen recorder that offers drawing tools so that the video gets visually pleasing and impactful for audiences to understand effectively.

6\. Cut out dead moments: When you are recording screen videos, there are going to be a lot of dead moments and boring pauses. You have to cut out those boring and dead moments while editing so that the video stays interesting and the audiences do not lose concentration. This will also help to tighten the length of the video.

7\. End with a summary: Last but most importantly, you should offer a proper conclusion before ending the video. You need to summarize everything you have discussed in the video so that the audience can get a revision of all the important points. Besides, a proper ending rather than an abrupt ending can leave a positive impact regarding your video.

2\. Price: If you are serious about recording your screen video and uploading the recorded video on online platforms, you have to opt for a premium screen recorder. While purchasing a proprietary screen recorder, you need to compare the software price with its peers and ensure that you are getting more features for the price you are paying.

3\. Customer support: You need to ensure that the screen recorder you are purchasing, they have a highly responsive customer support. This is a highly neglected factor but users suffer a lot when the customer support team is not responsive. Be sure that you will need to contact the customer support team at some time to learn more about certain features and troubleshoot in emergency situations.

## Part 8: Screen Recording Tips and Tricks

1\. Practice before recording: Unless you are a pro, you should practice at least once before the actual recording. This will help you to execute your plan according to your script smoothly when you actually start recording.

2\. Only record the required screen: Screen recorders offer you the option to record the entire screen, any specific application window or any specific tab of your browser. In fact, you can even customize the screen recording area as per your requirements for better focus and better visual experience.

3\. Keep it short: It is always necessary to keep the length of the video as short as possible without skipping the relevant points and important explanations. That is where a proper script before recording is crucial so that you can have a plan and execute it properly without stretching your explanation unnecessarily.

4\. Speak slowly and clearly: The way you speak in the video can attract as well as repel audiences. If you speak too fast and if you have a weird accent, it is going to repel audiences. That is why it is important for you to speak slowly and clearly so that everyone can understand everything you speak and negate your accent to a greater extent.

5\. Use screen drawing tools: If you are recording a video where you need to explain something, it is always better if you use screen drawing tools. In fact, it is important that you choose the screen recorder that offers drawing tools so that the video gets visually pleasing and impactful for audiences to understand effectively.

6\. Cut out dead moments: When you are recording screen videos, there are going to be a lot of dead moments and boring pauses. You have to cut out those boring and dead moments while editing so that the video stays interesting and the audiences do not lose concentration. This will also help to tighten the length of the video.

7\. End with a summary: Last but most importantly, you should offer a proper conclusion before ending the video. You need to summarize everything you have discussed in the video so that the audience can get a revision of all the important points. Besides, a proper ending rather than an abrupt ending can leave a positive impact regarding your video.

## Best Tips for Better Event Videography

There is no doubt that if you have an upcoming corporate event, you will want to record it using professional

corporate event video production. This is something that can't be stressed enough. Providing video footage of events is an excellent method to raise people's awareness of your brand, as well as interest in and enthusiasm for the work that your firm does.

Let's start!

![event videography](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/event-videography.jpg)

## 1\. A quality corporate event video represents your business

People who are watching your corporate event video aren't just learning about who your company is and what your company does. They're also learning about your commitment to quality. If your event video looks like it was shot off the cuff by an employee on someone's phone, people may assume you take that kind of approach to your business and service to your customers.

You don't, but it's an easy assumption to make. A professionally shot, high-quality video signals to viewers that your company appreciates quality and seeks it out in everything they do. It also shows your attention to detail and what they can expect when they choose your business to handle their own occasions or services.

## 2\. A professional videographer is capable of editing

Videoing your corporate event is about more than just filming, it's knowing how to cut the event together, how to mix the shots and the sound, and add music and any subtle effects or graphics that will make the video really shine. There is a lot that goes into post-production that an amateur simply cannot replicate.

Editing your video without the benefit of a dedicated studio with years of experience just won't have the same

effect when it comes to amplifying the energy and mission of your event. It also will not show the level of detail that your video could contain if a professional corporate event video production company did it.

## 3\. A professional video is completed on schedule

It can take longer than you anticipate if you opt to handle your corporate or conference videos yourself or

delegate the task to one of your workers. Without a lot of post-production knowledge, it could take a lot of trial and error to put your material together in a way that produces the desired outcome.

If you're trying to summarize an event and demonstrate to stakeholders or customers how effective it was, you might not have time for that. Even though unforeseen issues might always arise, if you and a competent

videographer agree on a finish date, they will be able to deliver. This is crucial if you want to utilize your video

to promote a recent event or for marketing purposes.

## 4\. A skilled videographer avoids interference

A skilled videographer is trained to film an event without getting in the way, so things can keep going as usual.

If you're not used to doing professional videography, you might not realize you're bothering your guests and

messing up the event while you're trying to film it. This can turn people off and hurt your finished product, as

well as the success of your event. If your occasion is streamed online, you don't want the videographer to get in the way or become visible in the frame your live show.

## 5\. A video that is done well tells a story

Companies with experience creating videos do more than just capture actions digitally, they also find the story

in the event they are recording and use their videography skills to tell that story. This storyline is defined in

what they choose to shoot, when they shoot it and how they edit it all together. It's that storyline that is going

to capture the attention from the audience and give your video the desired impact.

It's also going to stir up emotions and passion in your audience, creating momentum in your company and with your customers that will last until your next event. Remember that any video you share with your customers or employees is a video marketing exercise that helps you build brand awareness. Let your corporate event video reflect positively on your business.

## 6\. A videographer has a shot list

It is not enough to simply create a list; you must also put it to good use. The idea that you should plan your shot and then execute your plan is a fundamental element of production. Create a strategy and put it into action since your videographer will be knowing his job to adhere to this concept regardless of whether or not they are aware of it.

Also, get things you may or may not need for editing. It is usually excellent practice to use some B roll audio

and video, in addition to establishing shots, no matter what kind of event you are filming, be it a wedding or a business function. If you anticipate that it will be overly crowded during the event, take your creative shoton a pleasant day that occurs before the main event.

## Conclusion

We sincerely hope that some of these pointers will be of assistance to you as you navigate the area of special

events videos. Whether you are able to employ all of them or not will depend on your client, the event, and

your own workflow; nonetheless, the takeaway from this anecdote is that you should be prepared for the

worst-case scenario and find that you are better equipped to offer the best possible results. There won't be

many situations that you won't be able to manage with grace and professionally if you have the ability to

remain calm, cool, and professional.

## Detailed Tutorial to Rotate a Video in Cyberlink PowerDirector

Video Editing is a craft that is highly dependent on various characteristics of your video. But the way one presents it or goes about filming clips also has a profound effect on the end product. And as you may know, not every aspect of a video production activity always goes without hiccups. But editing can come in clutch as it can easily solve minor problems like skewed footage that was shot at the wrong angle or is upside down (an issue that can happen while using mobile phones).

Thus, with this article, we will be looking at steps to rotate a video in Cyberlink PowerDirector to help you when required. We have also mentioned the steps you will need to follow in Wondershare Filmora.

**_Note:_** _We documented the steps in this guide with PowerDirector 365 and WonderShare Filmora X._

## Steps to Rotate Videos with CyberLink PowerDirector

Put yourself in a situation where you've just finished filming a project with your smartphone but end up realizing that the footage isn't in the right orientation by default. While the error has an easy fix on most smartphones, you can also perform this action with video editing tools.

Also, while this form of rotating might be the most basic implementation of the feature, you can often use the feature to add a dynamic nature to your video with Keyframes.

**Definition:** Keyframes in Video Editing is a software feature that allows an editor to set start and endpoints (denoted by In and Out Markers), presenting the opportunity to custom clip properties between the two positions. The set changes occur gradually as the playhead continues moving through the clip. Properties that can undergo modification with this method are zoom, rotation, colors, positions, etc.

The process of rotating clips is fairly straightforward; once you have PowerDirector 365 open, follow the steps listed below.

_If you do not have CyberLink PowerDirector 365, download the software by visiting_ [_Cyberlink's official website_](https://www.cyberlink.com/products/powerdirector-video-editing-software/features%5Fen%5FUS.html)_._

**Step 1:** Create a new video project in Cyberlink PowerDirector 365 and choose Full Mode.

![rotate-videos-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/rotate-videos-powerdirector-1.jpeg)

**Note:** Full Mode in Cyberlink PowerDirector 365 will provide users access to a full-featured video editing tool similar in function to Wondershare Filmora. The other option available is Ad Designer.

**Step 2:** Now, import media onto the Timeline from the Media Library.

For this guide, we used the pre-existing stock footage in Cyberlink PowerDirector.

![rotate-videos-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/rotate-videos-powerdirector-2.jpeg)

**Step 3:** Now, click on the video file on the Timeline; this will activate the video in the Preview Window. And it will provide you with access to the rotation circle, allowing you to change the orientation of the source file.

![rotate-videos-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/rotate-videos-powerdirector-3.jpeg)

**EXTRA**

Rotation added in the PiP Designer will function as a keyframe-based rotation action. Right-click on the video in the preview window, choose Edit and then Modify to access this menu.

![rotate-videos-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/rotate-videos-powerdirector-4.jpeg)

Following this, you can click on the Motion Tab, go into Rotation Settings, and modify the angle with greater precision. In the Preview Window, you will now be able to see the rotating video.

![rotate-videos-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/rotate-videos-powerdirector-5.jpeg)

## **An Easier Way to Crop Video with Wondershare Filmora**

Though Cyberlink PowerDirector 365 is a powerful video editing tool, we felt its menus were not as simple to navigate. Accessing the rotate function while available in the forefront, the use of PiP Designer didn't feel intuitive.

In Wondershare [Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) , rotating footage only happens via the Edit Option, and this straightforward approach felt simple. As for those who want to use Keyframes, the integration of this feature right above the Timeline is an appreciated convenience.

This emphasis on quick accessibility is present with almost every function in Filmora, and we believe this to be a significant advantage. The use of modern and unique iconography also increases familiarity, an aspect that will always be welcoming to new and budding creators.

_If you do not already have Wondershare Filmora, you can download the software by visiting the official website._

To help you learn how to use the rotate function and show you an example of the easy accessibility in Filmora, here is how you can use the feature to get the output you desire.

For macOS 10.14 or later

Once you have a new project open in Filmora, follow the steps listed below.

**Step 1:** Import a Media File to edit into your Video Project.

![rotate-videos-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/rotate-videos-powerdirector-6.jpeg)

**Step 2:** Drag the video clip onto the Timeline and then select it with a mouse click to activate further interactions.

![rotate-videos-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/rotate-videos-powerdirector-7.jpeg)

**Step 3:** Choose the Edit Option (marked in Red).

This will bring up the Edit Window in the left-top corner of your screen.

![rotate-videos-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/rotate-videos-powerdirector-8.jpeg)

**Step 4:** Click on the Transform Menu and use the Rotation Slider to edit the orientation.

![rotate-videos-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/rotate-videos-powerdirector-9.jpeg)

Having read this stretch of the guide, we believe you may have noticed how Filmora is more user-friendly and accessible due to its menu layout.

**BONUS**

Click on the Keyframe Button (marked in Green) to access the Keyframe Menu that allows you to set points between which a decided amount of rotation can happen.

![rotate-videos-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/rotate-videos-powerdirector-10.jpeg)

## The Bottom Line

This marks the end of our guide on how to rotate video in PowerDirector 365 and Wondershare Filmora X. Now, while both software are high-capable tools, we feel the keyframe-based working on rotation in Filmora is a lot more intuitive and easy to use. The ability to only have number-based rotation within the edit menu is also a positive, as rotating with a swivel like in PowerDirector isn't always the most accurate.

And lastly, the modern iconography-based design of Wondershare Filmora is a factor to keep in mind, as this increases usability manifolds.

**Note:** Full Mode in Cyberlink PowerDirector 365 will provide users access to a full-featured video editing tool similar in function to Wondershare Filmora. The other option available is Ad Designer.

![rotate-videos-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/rotate-videos-powerdirector-8.jpeg)

**Step 4:** Click on the Transform Menu and use the Rotation Slider to edit the orientation.

![rotate-videos-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/rotate-videos-powerdirector-9.jpeg)

Having read this stretch of the guide, we believe you may have noticed how Filmora is more user-friendly and accessible due to its menu layout.

**BONUS**

Click on the Keyframe Button (marked in Green) to access the Keyframe Menu that allows you to set points between which a decided amount of rotation can happen.

## The Bottom Line

This marks the end of our guide on how to rotate video in PowerDirector 365 and Wondershare Filmora X. Now, while both software are high-capable tools, we feel the keyframe-based working on rotation in Filmora is a lot more intuitive and easy to use. The ability to only have number-based rotation within the edit menu is also a positive, as rotating with a swivel like in PowerDirector isn't always the most accurate.

And lastly, the modern iconography-based design of Wondershare Filmora is a factor to keep in mind, as this increases usability manifolds.

**Note:** Full Mode in Cyberlink PowerDirector 365 will provide users access to a full-featured video editing tool similar in function to Wondershare Filmora. The other option available is Ad Designer.

**Step 2:** Now, import media onto the Timeline from the Media Library.

For this guide, we used the pre-existing stock footage in Cyberlink PowerDirector.

![rotate-videos-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/rotate-videos-powerdirector-2.jpeg)

**Step 3:** Now, click on the video file on the Timeline; this will activate the video in the Preview Window. And it will provide you with access to the rotation circle, allowing you to change the orientation of the source file.

![rotate-videos-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/rotate-videos-powerdirector-3.jpeg)

**EXTRA**

Rotation added in the PiP Designer will function as a keyframe-based rotation action. Right-click on the video in the preview window, choose Edit and then Modify to access this menu.

![rotate-videos-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/rotate-videos-powerdirector-4.jpeg)

Following this, you can click on the Motion Tab, go into Rotation Settings, and modify the angle with greater precision. In the Preview Window, you will now be able to see the rotating video.

## **An Easier Way to Crop Video with Wondershare Filmora**

Though Cyberlink PowerDirector 365 is a powerful video editing tool, we felt its menus were not as simple to navigate. Accessing the rotate function while available in the forefront, the use of PiP Designer didn't feel intuitive.

In Wondershare [Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) , rotating footage only happens via the Edit Option, and this straightforward approach felt simple. As for those who want to use Keyframes, the integration of this feature right above the Timeline is an appreciated convenience.

This emphasis on quick accessibility is present with almost every function in Filmora, and we believe this to be a significant advantage. The use of modern and unique iconography also increases familiarity, an aspect that will always be welcoming to new and budding creators.

_If you do not already have Wondershare Filmora, you can download the software by visiting the official website._

To help you learn how to use the rotate function and show you an example of the easy accessibility in Filmora, here is how you can use the feature to get the output you desire.

Once you have a new project open in Filmora, follow the steps listed below.

**Step 1:** Import a Media File to edit into your Video Project.

**Step 3:** Choose the Edit Option (marked in Red).

This will bring up the Edit Window in the left-top corner of your screen.
