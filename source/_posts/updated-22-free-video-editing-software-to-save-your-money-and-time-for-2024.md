* **Learning curve**: You need to compare the editing software options that you have to determine which one is complex to learn and which one is easy. This will save you the time and effort you would have spent downloading multiple products to test.
* **Quality**: Another important factor to consider in video editing software is the quality and format of the video. There are many formats and quality of video content, and you need to choose the one that supports your video format.
* **Resources**: Depending upon the requirements of the editing on your video, you should choose a video editor with all the video effects, music tracks, and other resources that you might need to apply to your video. Be careful not to select one with few resources.
* **Compatability**: Check whether your PC, Mac, or Android platform can run the video editor you want to use. Consult the internet for compatibility by checking its minimum specification requirement on its manual or docs.

## Step by Step to Rotate Videos in Windows Media Player

Video Editing and the emotion the final product evokes is dependent on many aspects, be it the source clips, the cuts introduced or the way of presentation. But to get to the end, there are several steps involved in the production process, and not every instance of it is perfect. But we all know, editing does often help iron out any kinks, with its ability to solve basic problems, like footage that is askew, or upside down. Thus with the steps listed in this article we will help you understand how you can rotate videos to ensure your edited project looks as intended.

This particular article considers the pre-installed Windows Media Player and WonderShare Filmora.

**_Note:_** _We documented the steps in this guide with Windows Media Player_ _(on a device running Windows 10_ _) and WonderShare Filmora._

## How to Rotate Videos with Windows Media Player?

Imagine you’re in a situation where you have gone ahead and finished the filming portion of a project on your smartphone but realise that the capture footage is upside down. Fortunately, this sort of a scenario is a common occurrence and it has quite a simple fix. If you look around the gallery app on your phone, you should be able to rotate the footage there itself, but if you’ve already moved it over to your laptop, hopping into a video editor can get this done in a jiffy.

Unfortunately, if you were planning to do this with the pre-installed Windows Media Player, _you will not be able to rotate the clip_. The software is only capable of being used as a Media Player that can help keep track of stored videos in a neat and easy to view format. It also has the ability to burn inserted discs, although we doubt any modern laptop comes with a disc drive.

Hence, to rotate video and still ensure its compatible with Windows Media Player, you can use free tools like VLC Media Player or Wondershare Filmora. The steps on how to use Wondershare Filmora to rotate video clips have been elaborated ahead in this article.

### **TIPS FOR WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER**

In case you want to use Windows Media Player as your default software to manage stored content, read this section to understand how you can control displayed video libraries.

While Windows Media Player will pull all compatible files present in the Default Video Library, you can customise the information made available by using the Organises Function.

To configure the Videos Section to display specific content follow the steps listed below.

* Click on Organize.
* Then move onto Manage Libraries
* Now click on Videos.

## **An alternate way to** **Rotate** **Video with Wondershare Filmora**

With Windows Media Player only being a playback tool, we feel free software like [Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) are a great option to have installed on your device.

In Wondershare Filmora, footage rotation can only be done via the Edit Option — in my experience this straightforward approach felt quite simple and intuitive. And in case you wish to incorporate Keyframes into the rotation step, the feature is available near the Timeline.

_The emphasis on accessibility for every function in Filmora, provides a significant advantage. The use of modern iconography also betters the familiarity users may have with the software. These factors make Wondershare Filmora a great option to consider. If you do not already have Wondershare Filmora, you can download the software by visiting the official website._

Now, the steps we have listed below will help you learn how to use the rotate function in Wondershare Filmora and get the desired output.

## The Bottom Line

Rotating video is unfortunately impossible in Windows Media Player, thus the access and ability to free software like Wondershare Filmora is a huge positive for the creative community. Speaking of how rotation is done in Filmora, the intuitive number-based system is a huge positive, as there are some software which prefer using swivels. The integration of Keyframes into a free tool is also welcome.

This marks the end of our guide on how to rotate video in Windows Media Player and Wondershare Filmora. Once again, if you wish to not use a proper video editing tool, you can consider alternate players like VLC, which can rotate footage.

Pixel art is digital art created through computer software. In this digital art, images are edited on a pixel level. This gives the kind of aesthetic from computer video games using 8-bit and 16-bit technology. In general, this art uses very few color palettes, with some using only two.

The history of pixel art goes back to the 1930s with the monochromatic light bulb displays in New York City.

Pixel art tries to mimic the features of old video game graphics done by computers that were only able to display a few colors at once.

Digital pixel art evolved in such a way that artists are now dedicated to that art, and so create beautiful pixel art wallpapers that we'll show you in this article.

### 7\. The Spaceship

In this space-inspired pixel art wallpaper, we can see a spaceship with six people, two onboard, commanding it. One is fixing the spaceship; one is resting on the back, one on top scouting, one on the edging reaching for another in open space. There is also a dog on top of the spaceship and an alien-like creature in open space.

In this pixel art wallpaper, we have a huge old tree that served as a refuge for passersby. It has a broken wood ladder and a wooden floor on an opening on the tree. The tree is inside a river, and a boat is moored next to it. Two birds rest on rocks on the margin, and we have the perspective behind the birds.
