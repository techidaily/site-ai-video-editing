Those that seem to take place close together chronologically are edited together, while scenes that occur at separate periods or locales are faded out. These are recognizable features of the film. They alert us to the fact that the tale is moving to a later time or place, either thematically, chronologically, or geographically.

**Frame blending** is a video editing technique used to create smooth transitions between two video frames. This process is often used to create special effects or transition between two different video clips. Frame blending can be done manually or with the help of software.

When **frame blending** is done manually, the editor will take two consecutive frames and blend them. This is done by using a process called cross-fading. Cross-fading is when the first frame gradually fades out while the second frame gradually fades in. The result is a seamless transition between the two frames.

Frame blending can also be done with the help of software. Many software programs offer frame blending capabilities Like Adobe Premiere Pro and more. These software programs typically have a user interface that allows the user to select the two frames that they want to blend. The software will then perform the cross-fading process automatically.

## Part 3: How to Play Videos with QuickTime

Once you know how QuickTime Player makes it easy for Mac users to play their video, it is time to understand the steps associated with the procedure. Two basic techniques can be implemented to play videos with QuickTime. The first method to play videos with QuickTime are featured as follows:

Step 1: You need to open QuickTime Player across your Mac. For that, proceed across Launchpad to access the application.

![select quicktime player](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/guide-about-quicktime-player-1.jpg)

Step 2: Once the player is launched, you can simply select any video across the window that opens up. Once selected, tap “Open” to play it across QuickTime.

![tap on open button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/guide-about-quicktime-player-2.jpg)

Sounds easy, right? However, if you have multiple videos to open or have other video players installed in your Mac, you should consider following this second approach. If QuickTime Player is not your default video player, it is important to follow the steps below for opening any video across QuickTime.

Step 1: Open Finder on your device and proceed to locate the video that you wish to open across QuickTime. On finding the video, click on the video while holding the “Control” button on the keyboard. This opens a drop-down menu.

![choose your video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/guide-about-quicktime-player-3.jpg)

Step 2: In the “Open With” section across the menu, you will find the option of QuickTime Player. Tap on the option to open the video across QuickTime.

## Part 4: How to Do Screen Recording with QuickTime?

Several functions can be performed across QuickTime. While the QuickTime video format allows you to play different videos across the platform, it also helps users record screens of their choice. To understand the step-by-step procedure, you need to follow the steps displayed below. Come along and learn more about it.

Step 1: Open QuickTime Player on your device and tap on the "File" tab on the top of the screen. Select the option of "New Screen Recording" from the available options to initiate screen recording.

![select new screen recording option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/guide-about-quicktime-player-5.jpg)

Step 2: The next window opens up, which involves managing the screen recording settings. You need to set up the screen area recorded in the process initially.

![choose your recording portion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/guide-about-quicktime-player-6.jpg)

Step 3: After setting the screen area, tap on “Options” to specify the microphone settings, the location where the recording will be saved, the timer, and other significant options that are important for screen recording. Click on the "Record" button to start.

![customize recording option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/guide-about-quicktime-player-7.jpg)

Step 4: Once you have recorded the appropriate screen, click on the “Stop” sign appearing on the top of the window to conclude recording and save it across the decided location.

![tap on stop icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/guide-about-quicktime-player-8.jpg)

## Part 5: How to Convert Video File to MOV Format in QuickTime?

QuickTime Player is not quite extensive when it comes to converting video files. Although there are several QuickTime format files that you may come across and play across the platform, it only converts any video file into MOV format, which is the dedicated file format potentially designed by Apple. To understand the method to convert any QuickTime video format to MOV format, follow the steps shown below:

Step 1: You need to open the appropriate video across QuickTime to convert it accordingly. Once opened, tap on the "File" tab, and select "Export as" across the available options.

![access export as option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/guide-about-quicktime-player-9.jpg)

Step 2: You need to select an appropriate resolution from the available options according to the video quality that you want the video to be saved in on the preceding menu. QuickTime player will show low-quality resolutions for the high-quality video but not vice versa.

![choose video quality](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/guide-about-quicktime-player-10.jpg)

Step 3: A new window opens that requires you to set up the name and location for the video. Add the file extension “.mov” at the end of the name of the video to convert it into MOV format.

![export video in mov](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/guide-about-quicktime-player-11.jpg)
