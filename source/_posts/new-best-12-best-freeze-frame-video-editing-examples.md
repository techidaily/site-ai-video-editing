## Part 1 **What Is Freeze Frame Video Editing?**

**Freeze frame** video editing is a video editing technique that halts movement in a video for a given period. It converts moving pictures into still photography for some time. These video editor effects help filmmakers gear attention to the video editing or filmmaking process. In other words, they are self-reflexive.

## Part 2 **Ways to Use Freeze Frame in Video editing**

Freeze frames can be helpful in 3 significant ways in video editing;

**●** At the beginning of a movie/video: Freeze-frame at the beginning helps you pique the audience's interest and give them a sneak peek of what to expect in the movie. This **freeze-frame** technique was used in the film 'Good Fellas' to pique the audience's interests.

**●** At the end: Using a freeze-frame allows the audience to choose or decide how the movie ends, whether it is obvious. The 'breakfast club' filmmakers use a freeze-frame at the end to emphasize the young boy.

**●** In the middle, subtly capturing intense moments like in the movie 'The Departed.'

## Part 3 **What are the Best Freeze-Frame Video Editing Examples?**

It takes a great deal of skill to employ freeze frame with the best results correctly. It might bore the audience or give another impression other than the intended when not done effectively.

But several movie directors have effectively used the **freeze-frame** video editing technique that wowed the audience.

Here is a list of the best **freeze frame examples** you would love;

## Part 1 **What Is Freeze Frame Video Editing?**

**Freeze frame** video editing is a video editing technique that halts movement in a video for a given period. It converts moving pictures into still photography for some time. These video editor effects help filmmakers gear attention to the video editing or filmmaking process. In other words, they are self-reflexive.

## Part 2 **Ways to Use Freeze Frame in Video editing**

Freeze frames can be helpful in 3 significant ways in video editing;

**●** At the beginning of a movie/video: Freeze-frame at the beginning helps you pique the audience's interest and give them a sneak peek of what to expect in the movie. This **freeze-frame** technique was used in the film 'Good Fellas' to pique the audience's interests.

**●** At the end: Using a freeze-frame allows the audience to choose or decide how the movie ends, whether it is obvious. The 'breakfast club' filmmakers use a freeze-frame at the end to emphasize the young boy.

**●** In the middle, subtly capturing intense moments like in the movie 'The Departed.'

## Part 3 **What are the Best Freeze-Frame Video Editing Examples?**

It takes a great deal of skill to employ freeze frame with the best results correctly. It might bore the audience or give another impression other than the intended when not done effectively.

But several movie directors have effectively used the **freeze-frame** video editing technique that wowed the audience.

Here is a list of the best **freeze frame examples** you would love;

### 01**The Departed**

![The Departed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-freeze-frame-video-editing-1.jpg)

In this 2006 movie, an undercover cop and a mole try to identify each other. Scorsese shows his editing prowess once again as he uses freeze-frame more subtly.

He changes the frame speed instead of stopping on one frame for a considerably longer time. This emphasizes some memorable moments that you may overlook on a first watch.

### 02**Rocky III**

![Rocky III](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-freeze-frame-video-editing-2.jpg)

The **freeze-frame** came in during the final match between Apollo and Balboa in this movie.

During the first 3 Rocky movies, Apollo and Balboa had an intriguing rivalry. At the end of Rocky III, the duo decides to engage in a friendly battle to determine who was the Lord in boxing.

The movie ends in a freeze-frame with Rocky swinging a right hook after Apollo imitates the bell, saying, "Ding Dong."

The freeze-frame allows the audience to guess who the winner will be, thus a longer time to think of the movie after watching.

### 03**400 Blows**

![400 blows](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-freeze-frame-video-editing-3.jpg)

In 400 Blows, the main character Antoine, a young Parisian, was hardly out of trouble.

In an attempt to end his troubles, he arrives at the beach after running away from a soccer match.

He is faced with either jumping right in or going back. The movie ends in a freeze-frame as no one finds out. The decision was left to the audience.

### 04**Thelma and Louise**

![Thelma and Louise](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-freeze-frame-video-editing-4.jpg)

Thelma and Louise is about two (2) friends, Thelma Dickinson and Louise Sawyer. They both rise to defend themselves in a male-dominated world. In the film, Thelma and Louise are both running from the authorities. Louise killed a man who almost raped her friend, Thelma, thus the run. Things get out of control as they try to escape to Mexico, away from the authorities.

While on the run, they get ambushed by the police towards the grand canyon. The audience, at this point, is in suspense as to whether the ladies will survive or not.

Instead of surrendering, they drive right into the grand canyon, and the movie ends in a **freeze-frame** as they get caught hanging in the air while plunging into the canyon.

Regular movies might decide to give us all the details of the car plunging and exploding.

### 05**The Wolf of Wall Street**

![The wolf of wall street](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-freeze-frame-video-editing-5.jpg)

Scorsese uses freeze-frame at the beginning of this movie, just as he did in Good Fellas. The freeze-frame effect here helps introduce the character and shows us the plot of the movie hence piquing the audience's interests immediately.

### 06**Out of Sight**

![Out of Sight](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-freeze-frame-video-editing-6.jpg)

This movie is another excellent example of **freeze-frame** video editing. What other way to pique the audience's interest significantly and emphasize them than capture them in a freeze-frame.

### 07**Death Proof**

![Death Proof](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-freeze-frame-video-editing-7.jpg)

In this movie, the freeze-frame stays till the very end. It captures three women as they raise their hands-on celebration after successfully beating to death a psychopath who has been killing young women.

### 08**Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid**

![Butch Cassidy and Sundance kid](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-freeze-frame-video-editing-8.jpg)

This movie follows two train robbers, Butch Cassidy and Harry Longabaugh, known as the 'Sundance Kid.' After conducting several robberies, they go on the run as the authorities pursue them. After a gun battle with the authorities, they take cover inside a building, but they get surrounded with no other escape route.

Thus they decide to engage in the last fight instead of surrendering, and you see them in a gun battle with the authorities. The movie ends with them caught in a **freeze-frame** brandishing their guns at the officers instead of actual bloodshed. Though we all know they will get killed.

### 09**Good Fellas**

![Good fellas](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-freeze-frame-video-editing-9.jpg)

Initially, we mentioned that a freeze-frame could be of use at the beginning of a movie. Scorsese used this effectively in 'Good Fellas' to emphasize the movie plot.

In the opening scene, the characters Henry, Jimmy, and Tonny, played by Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, and Joe Pesci, respectively, stop their car in the middle of the road.

They open their truck and see a man badly wounded and beaten, Tonny stabs him, and Jimmy shoots him. Henry then closes the truck and looks on in a **freeze-frame** before uttering the lines, "As far back as I can remember, I have always wanted to be a gangster."

This lets us know right away what will happen in the movie. That person will get killed, and this is the mob territory.

### 10**Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban**

## Step by Step to Cut a Video in QuickTime

Filming a video is fun and editing is more interesting and entertaining. Today, everyone is making videos and there are tons of videos on the internet. Editing videos is required to make the video stand out and retain the audience. Video trimming helps you cut out the unwanted part of the video and leave the desired portion of the viewers.

**Cutting a video means your video starts quickly and you don’t lose your audience’s attention**.

The first ten seconds of the video are very important when deciding whether to stay or move on to the next video.

## **How to cut a video in QuickTime**

Quicktime is an authentic application developed by Apple in 1991\. It allows the users to edit, record, play, and share videos and pictures. If some editing software confuses you, **QuickTime** is just for you.

You need to download the application and here are all the features you can enjoy. It is compatible with all versions of windows whereas, if you are a Mac user it is already installed in your system.

Cutting a video is one of the basic but useful functions of QuickTime. It requires a few simple steps and some features related to cutting, splitting, and trimming a video.

Let’s start…

### **1\.** **Cutting/splitting a video**

Cutting a video means splitting some parts of the video to edit and rearrange the clips to make a new video. Mostly, it is used where you want to edit all clips of the video differently. It is also needed as it allows you to focus on your message and delete the portion not required and make the video large. You can remove the extra fat from the video to give clarity, direction, and hope. You can convey your message in a clear and concise way.

These steps should be followed to cut/split the video in minutes.

* In the **QuickTime player**, open the desired video.
* Select **show clips** from the **view** on the menu bar.
* Move the red marker from right to left to select the desired portion.
* Hit **split clip** from the **edit**

![cut-video-quicktime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/cut-video-quicktime-1.png)

* A yellow rectangular bar appears over the edges of your video.
* You can cut the desired portion and make editing as you like.

* Press the **done**

![cut-video-quicktime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/cut-video-quicktime-2.png)

Cutting the video by splitting is used when you have a long video and you can easily edit them by splitting them into two parts.

### **2\.** **Trimming a video**

If you are cutting some parts at the beginning and the end of the video, it is called trimming a video. You can say it as removing unnecessary preparation scenes. Normally, professionals start their cameras before the film scene to ensure not to miss any part of the video. Here’s, how to trim video in the QuickTime player.

Let’s dive in…

* Launch **QuickTime**
* Select your **video** from the system.
* Select **edit** from the top menu.
* Select the **trim** or **command T**, or you can select the **hold** option from the drop-down list.

![cut-video-quicktime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/cut-video-quicktime-3.png)

* A **yellow trimming bar** will appear over the edges of your video.
* Remove the unwanted area by moving from the right or left **trim edges** also called **handles**.

![cut-video-quicktime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/cut-video-quicktime-4.png)

Everything inside the **yellow bars** will remain. You can preview your video anytime during the editing process.

* Hit the **trim** from the bottom right corner.
* Select save from the file on the top menu bar.

Trimming is critical because it is the time to convince the viewers to stick around and stay with your video.
