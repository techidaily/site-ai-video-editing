## Tips for a Fantastic Logo Intro

We hope the comprehensive guide above was easy to follow and inspired you to try your hand at creating your own logo reveal video. Without further ado, let's discuss some tips for a fantastic logo intro.

* Start by conducting ample research to find as many intro videos as possible before attempting to make your own. Watching and learning will allow you to figure out what works and what you shouldn't do. You might also discover many resources to make a fantastic intro video you missed.
* Understand what message your company intends to send and tailor your intro video to portray it as accurately as possible. For instance, you could create a fun video to relay that your brand is easygoing.
* It wouldn't be a great idea to show your entire logo all at once. You could create anticipation by showing tiny bits of your logo in each frame till the final logo covers the screen.
* Design your video in a manner that keeps your audience glued to the screen. The dynamism will keep the viewer watching because they don't want to miss what comes next.
* Though it is not mandatory, you could end the video on a dark background, such as pitch black, to ensure your logo is clearly visible to your audience.
* The most important tip is to keep the video short, so you don't bore your audience. The average attention span for most viewers is shorter than 15 seconds, meaning any video longer than that will cause them to click away from your video.

**Unique**

**Simple**

Complex logos are hard to recognize. They are also much harder to enlarge or reduce. It would help to incorporate strong lines and letters into your logo as opposed to thinner ones.

**Versatile**

Your logo should look good with or without colour. If you must add colour, ensure you don't exceed four colours in the design. Remember that printing your logo when it contains too many colours becomes an expensive affair.

**Scalability**

It would help to ensure that your logo looks good in a big or small size. Remember that you will use your logo on letterheads and perhaps on large banners.

**Balanced**
