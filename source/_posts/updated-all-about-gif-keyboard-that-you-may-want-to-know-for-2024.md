## Detailed Tutorial to Crop a Video in KineMaster

“Create. Edit. Share. Transform your videos with KineMaster! Powerful tools, easy to use.” – a few words we read when we come up with the official web-site of KineMaster, a mobile video editing application.

![crop-video-kinemaster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-kinemaster-1.jpeg)

Scrolling down, we see a rich list of all the features KineMaster offers to its users, such as: Assets, Projects, Backup and Share, Blending Modes, Reverse, Chroma Key, High Resolution, Video Layers. Simply put, on KineMaster, you can download projects, add more than 2 500 effects, use powerful tools, add cinematic color, etc…

![crop-video-kinemaster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-kinemaster-2.jpeg)

This many features make you think – how come it is possible to do all that on a mobile phone? How come Kinemaster is not only a software you can download, pay for, and use on your computer, which, on its behalf, should also be a powerful one? It would be a logical question, but remember, we are in 2022 already, so, no limits are put to the technology of today! On Google Play Store, in the description of the abovementioned app, it reads: “KineMaster makes video editing fun on your phone, tablet, or Chromebook!” – So, why not use this opportunity, to explore new ways of making our content better and as appealing as ever for our viewers?

Even though Kinemaster deserves a bigger article with more explanation of each tool, for now, we will only be focusing on cropping a video in this app. First off, why crop a video at all? – well, sometimes we have a wonderful footage but the aspect ratio just doesn’t work for us. It might be because we want to upload our clip on a platform needing a specific aspect ratio, or, we just need to crop and pan (which means to move around within a clip or an image) because we don’t like some things shown in the original video – we might as well need to zoom in and out, in order to get the best out of our footage. For whatever reason, when you need or just wish to crop a video, it should not be a big deal, and let’s see how KineMaster makes it a good and easy experience.

So, the first thing we do in almost every situation is to access the platform or an application itself! – you guessed it right, download KineMaster from Google Play Store! Once you have it on your phone, open it and enjoy the introduction of the app itself.

![crop-video-kinemaster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-kinemaster-3.jpeg)

The interesting fact you will notice is that the layout of the app is horizontal, not vertical, unlike in most cases. So, it makes you feel like you are at least close to what video editors who work on their computers represent. The interface of the app is quite enjoyable for your eyes, as it is kind of fun, as well.

It is needless to say that, if you are going to do a specific “operation” to the video, such as cropping, you will already have figured out which one of your footage you want to crop and pan. So, it’s wise to jump on the button which says: Create New.

![crop-video-kinemaster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-kinemaster-4.jpeg)

This will take you to the editor. Even though in the media section you will find the video you want to work on, but you might be struggling to notice a Crop button. It is because unfortunately, it’s not possible to crop your video right away in KineMaster – first, you will need to add a background, for example, a black one.

![crop-video-kinemaster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-kinemaster-5.jpeg)

Then, you will go back to the menu and find Media section again to add the video clip you want to crop.

![crop-video-kinemaster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-kinemaster-6.jpeg)

After adding it to the editor, you need to tap on the video file which has appeared in the sequence – this will show you different features you can use on the right. You have to scroll down a little and Voila! – here you find Cropping. After having clicked on that, a little cropping window will appear on the screen.

![crop-video-kinemaster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-kinemaster-7.jpeg)

![crop-video-kinemaster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-kinemaster-9.jpeg)

How come Kinemaster is not only a software you can download, pay for, and use on your computer, which, on its behalf, should also be a powerful one? It would be a logical question, but remember, we are in 2022 already, so, no limits are put to the technology of today!

Even though Kinemaster deserves a bigger article with more explanation of each tool, for now, we will only be focusing on cropping a video in this app. First off, why crop a video at all? – well, sometimes we have a wonderful footage but the aspect ratio just doesn’t work for us. It might be because we want to upload our clip on a platform needing a specific aspect ratio, or, we just need to crop and pan (which means to move around within a clip or an image) because we don’t like some things shown in the original video – we might as well need to zoom in and out, in order to get the best out of our footage.

So, it makes you feel like you are at least close to what video editors who work on their computers represent. The interface of the app is quite enjoyable for your eyes, as it is kind of fun, as well.

It is needless to say that, if you are going to do a specific “operation” to the video, such as cropping, you will already have figured out which one of your footage you want to crop and pan. So, it’s wise to jump on the button which says: Create New.

![crop-video-kinemaster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-kinemaster-4.jpeg)

## How to Convert SRT to DOCX

**SRT to Word: How to Convert an SRT File to Docx file?**

The SubRip Text (SRT) format is a popular subtitle format used in many videos. While SRT files are simple text files that can be edited with any text editor, they are not as convenient to work with as MS Word documents.

For one thing, it cannot be easy to format text in a way that is easy to read. In addition, SRT files do not support features such as spell checking and grammar checking.

As a result, converting SRT to Word can be a useful way to improve the quality of subtitles. In addition, it can also make it easier to translate subtitles into other languages.

Other than that, you might need to convert an SRT to a Word document when you need to edit the subtitles for a video you're working on or you want to create a transcript of a recorded conversation.

You might think that converting a speech to text is difficult or impossible. But it's not!

Here's how you can easily convert SRT to DOCX files. Let's begin.

## What is an SRT file?

SRT files are used for subtitles. Subtitles are the audio track of a video or movie. Subtitles are displayed alongside a video or movie on your TV or computer screen. They allow the viewer to understand what is being said in the language they speak.

People have recently begun using online streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Video, and Hulu to watch movies and television shows. While streaming services offer thousands of movies and shows, there are still many that only exist in a form that can be viewed in their entirety. This requires the user to download the entire file (usually in a format known as a .srt file).

## Why do we need to convert SRT files into Word?

Subtitles are a great way to enjoy movies and TV shows in different languages. They provide text on the screen that tells you what the characters are saying, so you can follow along even if you don't speak the language. However, SRT files can be difficult to work with because they are incompatible with all software programs**.** So, they need to be converted into Word. Some other reasons include:

* It allows your content to be viewed within a web browser or mobile device without downloading .srt file.
* If you need to embed the video into another site, you can do so easily with the.docx file.
* Learning a new language by downloading SRT subtitles from video.

## Convert SRT to word file without downloading any software

## Convert SRT to Word file Manually

You must first remove the time codes to convert an SRT file to a Word document. Open the SRT file in a text editor (such as Notepad++ or Sublime Text) and delete all the lines that begin with numbers. These lines will typically look something like "00:00:01,000 --> 00:00: 02,000." Once you have removed the time codes, save the file and open it in Microsoft Word.

The text from the SRT file will now be visible in the Word document. You can then format the text as desired and save the document.

## What is an SRT file?

SRT files are used for subtitles. Subtitles are the audio track of a video or movie. Subtitles are displayed alongside a video or movie on your TV or computer screen. They allow the viewer to understand what is being said in the language they speak.

People have recently begun using online streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Video, and Hulu to watch movies and television shows. While streaming services offer thousands of movies and shows, there are still many that only exist in a form that can be viewed in their entirety. This requires the user to download the entire file (usually in a format known as a .srt file).

## Why do we need to convert SRT files into Word?

Subtitles are a great way to enjoy movies and TV shows in different languages. They provide text on the screen that tells you what the characters are saying, so you can follow along even if you don't speak the language. However, SRT files can be difficult to work with because they are incompatible with all software programs**.** So, they need to be converted into Word. Some other reasons include:

* It allows your content to be viewed within a web browser or mobile device without downloading .srt file.
* If you need to embed the video into another site, you can do so easily with the.docx file.
* Learning a new language by downloading SRT subtitles from video.

## Convert SRT to word file without downloading any software

With the advent of the SRT (SubRip) format, videos can now be enjoyed on both computers and mobile devices. This means that videos can be viewed anywhere and anytime. Converting videos to SRT is relatively easy, but some online converters offer more flexibility than others.

Not only do online SRT to word converters save time, but they can also ensure that your captions are accurate and properly formatted. Whether you're captioning a home video or creating professional subtitles for a film, an online SRT to-word converter can be a valuable tool. Some of them include:

## Convert SRT to Word file Manually

You must first remove the time codes to convert an SRT file to a Word document. Open the SRT file in a text editor (such as Notepad++ or Sublime Text) and delete all the lines that begin with numbers. These lines will typically look something like "00:00:01,000 --> 00:00: 02,000." Once you have removed the time codes, save the file and open it in Microsoft Word.

The text from the SRT file will now be visible in the Word document. You can then format the text as desired and save the document.

Keep in mind that this manual method will not retain any formatting from the original SRT file, so you may need to do some additional editing to get the final results you want.
