## Part 2: Discussing Some Practical Uses of LUTs in Video Editing

LUTs, also known as look-up tables, are unique video editing tools. They use mathematical instructions to map input color values into output color values. This way, consistent color gradings are applied across video content. In video editing, LUTs can be used for a variety of practical uses:

### 1\. Special Effects

By using LUTs, you can add special effects to your videos. This includes different effects, including dreamy, moody, or surreal. The videos will look more professional and enchanting with attractive looks. So you don’t need to pursue video editing in a deep way.

### 2\. HDR Display

With LUTs, users can add a dynamic touch of HDR display to the videos. After all, they can convert SDR footage to HDR footage using special filter presets. This allows for different color contrasts within the video.

### 3\. Color Enhancement

Enhancing color schemas is easier and more convenient using LUTs. These editing tools can adjust color contrast, balance, and saturation. Hence, your video is upscaled with an improved color display for vintage or cinematic looks.

### 4\. Match Footages

Different cameras produce videos with diverse quality, which is unsatisfying. Through LUTs, you can match the color of your footage with a consistent appearance. The color schemes and tone contrasts are optimized in a collective way.
