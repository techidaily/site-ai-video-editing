## Complete Guide to Change Video Resolution in Filmora

With the vast number of devices available in the market today, storing data and video files has become difficult. Frequently in cases where the devices share different forms of resolution, it makes sharing videos a hassle.

In those situations, changing the resolution of your video can be a great idea. It will also allow you to save storage. In this article, you'll adjust the resolution in just a few clicks by Wondershare Filmora. But before we learn how to change a video's resolution, let's look into what a video resolution is!

## Part 1\. What Is a Video Resolution?

A video resolution, in short, is the quality of the video visible. A video is rendered at a specific rate whenever you watch a movie or go to a cinema. A screen is made up of **tiny pixels** and arranged in an order that determines the resolution of a screen.

Video resolution is rendered in a **vertical** and **horizontal** orientation. Therefore, whenever you play a video on YouTube, the resolution scale is available for you to choose from, i.e., **480p**, **720p**, **1080p,** etc.

In most cases, a resolution is dictated by the full abbreviation. So, for example, a **720p** video is **1280 x 720,** and a **1080p** video is a **1920 x 1080** resolution.

**Note:** The number written before is the number of horizontal pixels in a video. And the number written after is the vertical pixels in a video.

Before we adjust the resolution of a video, let's look at a comparison between different types of video resolution.

## Part 2\. 7 Different Types of Video Resolution

It has been established that a video resolution is not a constant number and changes according to the screen. Scroll below to look at the different forms of video resolutions available!

### 360p

The full resolution is **480 x 360**. This resolution is a minimal video resolution. On a big screen, **360p** will look blurry. That is why a **360p** resolution is the best for smaller devices such as Mobile phones.

### 480p

The full resolution is **853 x 480**. Although an upgrade from the latter, this resolution is available on many devices. It's mainly used in devices such as smaller **TVs**, **laptops,** and **Desktop** computers. It is also available for Burn-in **DVDs**.

### 720p

The full version of the resolution is **1280 x 720**. This resolution is called **HD**, short for High Definition. **720p** quality looks good almost on every device and is also reasonably available.

Most modern devices, such as **Mobile phones**, **Touch Tablets**, **Laptops,** and **PCs,** are calibrated in **720p** Resolution.

![high definition resolution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-2.png)

### 1080p

The resolution in its complete form is **1920 x 1080**. This resolution is also known as **FHD**, short for **Full High Definition. 1080p** resolution is the quality in which many high-quality devices are constructed. As a result, the screens of these devices have a clear and clean display.

![a youtube video in fhd resolution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-3.png)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** It is usually recommended to share videos on social media in 1080p resolution.

### 1440p

This resolution is also called **QHD (Quad HD**). The length and width of this resolution are **2560 x 1440**. As the name suggests, its quality is quad (four times) than that of a standard **720p** resolution.

The screens of devices constructed in this resolution usually have a high-end purpose. For example, this resolution is commonly used in **Gaming monitors** and **High-end smartphones**.

![a gaming monitor in 1440p resolution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-4.png)

### 2160p

The screens constructed in this resolution are considered among the best available in the market. **2160p (3840 x 2160)** is also known as **UHD**, which is short for **Ultra High Definition**. It is also known as **4K** because it offers four times the power of **1080p** or **FHD** (Full High Definition.)

These screens are usually available for high-end competitive gaming monitors or big screen **LCD** and **LED** Television. In addition, some of the flagship smartphones are also built with **4K** resolution.

![difference between hd fhd and 4k resolution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-5.png)

### 4320p

This resolution is also known as **8K**. The length and width of the pixel arrangement are **7680 x 4320**. The pixels are arranged in these screens to offer sixteen times the average power of a **1080p** (FHD) monitor.

This resolution is only available on several devices, such as commercial TVs and monitors. However, this is the most significant resolution available in the modern market. Therefore, even if your monitor cannot support a larger resolution, you can test whether your PC can render an **8K** resolution.

![difference between a 4k and 8k resolution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-6.png)

## Part 3\. Why Do You Need to Change a Video Resolution?

There are numerous cases where you will want to change the resolution of a video. Some of them are described below.

### Decreasing a Video Resolution

Sometimes, you are trying to upload a video from a smartphone. Or, in general, you want to transfer videos to a smartphone. The resolution of your video can play a significant role in the transfer process.

If your video file has a higher resolution, it will take up more space on your phone. As well as, if your PC has a higher resolution, say a **4K** resolution, and your phone is of **1080p** resolution. You might not be able to play it.

To counter situations like these, you need to change the resolution of your video.

### Increasing a Video Resolution

Similarly, there are instances where you would need to change the resolution of your video to increase it.

A good example would be to burn a low-quality **DVD**. To maintain good quality on a **DVD**, you need to increase its resolution before transfer.

Changing the exact resolution of a video is only possible in some cases because you cannot change the precise pixel of the video it is recorded in. But software like Wondershare Filmora allows you to change the resolution of your video easily.

Now let's move to understanding the steps involved in changing the resolution of a video!

## Secret Tips & Tricks to Use in Filmora

Wondershare Filmora is a great video editing software with millions of users worldwide. It has many features that it provides to its users. However, there are some other features hidden up its sleeve.

This article will share some "secrets" of Wondershare Filmora features you may not know that they exist in Filmora. Scroll below to see the features that level up your editing skills.

## Part 1\. Shared Media Folder

You might have had the hassle of importing the same videos for a considerable time in a different project. It can become a problem for you. It may be fine if you have organized your videos from the start.

**Shared Media Folder** in Filmora, now called the **Global Media Folder,** can store video and audio that you've imported for future projects. So you don't have to keep re-importing your media for future videos.

![wondershare filmora global media folder](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/secret-tips-in-wondershare-filmora-1.png)

Moreover, when you have imported files into the **Shared Media Folder,** you can create new **Sub-Folders**. You can name these folders according to the types of media you are going to use.

Suppose you are a content creator and want to spice up your content with **memes**. You can create a meme folder to import recent memes into your videos.

Once you have imported them into the [Wondershare Filmora's](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) Shared Media Folder, you can access them anytime. Doing so will allow you to save time and build a base for your future projects.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

## Part 2\. Customize Proxy Files

Before understanding the custom proxy settings, let us know what proxy files are.

### Proxy Files

Proxy files in Wondershare Filmora allow you to render and edit **4K** and other higher-resolution videos easily, regardless of your computer's processing power.

No one wants to compromise PC performance when editing videos. But if you are importing a video with a higher resolution than your PC, you can only play it sometimes. Other than that, your PC might get stuck and slow down.

If your PC has a built-in resolution of **1080p,** but the video you are going to import is **2160p**, you can encounter rendering and performance problems. But in the case of Wondershare Filmora Proxy files, you can smoothly edit your videos without any trouble.

### How to Customize Proxy Files in Filmora

Although Wondershare Filmora automatically creates proxy files when it encounters resolutions more significant than the PC performance. But you can also set them to your preference.

And customize your proxy files takes some simple and easy steps. But first, follow the steps mentioned below.

Step1 Find the **File** option on the top left corner of the Wonderhsare Filmora home interface.

Step2 Click on Files and go to **Preferences**.

Step3 A window will pop up, and here you can see multiple options.

Step4 Go to the **performance**.

Step5 In the performance tab, scroll down till your see **Proxy**.

Step6 Here check the box that says, **"Automatically create proxies when resolution higher than:"**

![wondershare filmora customizing proxy files](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/secret-tips-in-wondershare-filmora-2.png)

Step7 Below you can see multiple options. In these options, select the **resolution** that you want.

Step8 You can also **click** on the box below to automatically delete the proxies when you close your project.

Now, whenever you encounter a resolution of a higher video than the one you selected, Wondershare Filmora will do its magic.

## Part 3\. Delete Project Render Cache

Another hack you can use to save space on your hard drive is Deleting the Render cache. But before we do that, let us understand what Render cache is!

### What is Render Cache?

Rendering can be a giant leap to give you a smooth performance experience. However, when you import your videos into the timeline, you can always render to have an uninterrupted playback experience.

Doing so will allow you to work in your zone quickly and efficiently. You can do a manual rendering before you begin the editing process. Or you can also opt to choose automatic rendering. In the automatic rendering option, you can continue your editing process. In the meantime, your timeline will be rendered.

### How to Delete Render Cache in Filmora

To save up storage space on your computer, you can delete your render cache by following the steps.

Step1 Click on **files** in the top left corner of the Wondershare Filmora home interface.

Step2 Go to **Preferences**.

Step3 A window will pop up and go to **Performance**.

Step4 In the performance tab, scroll down below to the **Preview Render**.

Step5 Check the box saying, **"Automatically delete render files when a project is closed."**

![wondershare filmora deleting render cache](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/secret-tips-in-wondershare-filmora-3.png)

Step6 Click on **OK** to save your changes.

Now, whenever you close your project, your render cache will be deleted and would have given you extra space on your computer.

## Part 4\. Remove Split Button on Playhead

In some instances, when you are moving the playhead on the timelines, it can distract you from doing your editing. Or even more, you can mistakenly click on the Split button to split the clips you don't want them to.

Well, no worries at all! Wondershare Filmora takes care of that for you. You can hide or remove the Split button on the playhead. It only takes a few simple and easy steps. Follow the steps mentioned below to remove the Split button:

Step1 You will notice the **File** option on the top left corner of the Wonderhsare Filmora home interface.

Step2 Click on **Files** and go to **Preferences**.

Step3 A window will pop up, and here you can see multiple options.

Step4 Go to the **editing**

Step5 In the editing tab, scroll down till your see the **Split button**.

![wondershare filmora removing the split button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/secret-tips-in-wondershare-filmora-4.png)

Step6 Check the box. Then, click **OK** to save your changes.

Doing so would have removed the Split button from your playhead. So now you can edit your videos without any distractions.

## Part 5\. Copy and Paste Effects

Copy and paste are one of the oldest tricks in editing procedures. Wondershare Filmora comes with a range of commands and features that allow you to save time and be reliable.

Suppose you want to add an effect to a video clip in the timeline. Then, after adding the effect to your video, make custom changes to make it look more closely to the style you want.
