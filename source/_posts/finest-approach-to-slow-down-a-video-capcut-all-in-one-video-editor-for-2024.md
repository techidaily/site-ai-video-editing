* **Drop**: It appears on top of the text box
* **Flicker**: This one is like a candle's flicker, and text flashes disappear and appear before staying.
* **Fade**: Opacity can be changed from 0% to 100%.
* **Pop:-** This grows the text more extensive than the text box and shrinks back to the place.
* **Reveal:-** Rolls from the left side to the right side
