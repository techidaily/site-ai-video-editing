## Other Useful Apps for Blurring Faces in Videos on iPhone

You can also use other apps to blur faces in videos on your iPhone. A video blur app allows you to blur any part of your video, including the face. It also lets users add blur video effects to their streams. With that in mind, here are some of the applications you can use to blur faces in videos if you are using an iPhone.

#### 1\. Blur Video Background

Compatible with iOS 13.0 or later, Blur Video Background can help you blur out moving objects or apply blur filters to videos. You can try radial or rectangular blur shapes and then resize the tool to blur perfectly. Users can also choose from a range of blurry effects, including Pixelate and Gaussian blur.

Additionally, this video blur app allows you to blur multiple objects in your videos. The application has a video keyframe feature that allows users to obscure moving objects and faces in a video. All you have to do is place the keyframe on the area of the video you would like to conceal and keep adjusting the position. Indeed, this video blur app has made censoring videos a breeze.

You can choose from several blurred backgrounds, such as Sepia, Matrix, Fade, or Vignette, and renovate your movies. When you complete making the edits, you can export your video in 4K resolution, Full HD, or HD. What's more? You can share your edited videos through social profiles with ease.

To learn how to blur part of a video on iPhone using this application, you first need to launch the app on your device. You can select videos from the Gallery or record one directly with your iPhone camera. Next, you have to choose the blur shape you prefer: either circular blur or rectangular blur.

Use your finger to drag the blurred area on the face to get a pixelated face. Once you have done this, you need to adjust the strength of the blur tool with the slider until you get the desired blurred faces. Export your video by tapping the save icon. Getting censored videos or blurry faces has never been this easier.
