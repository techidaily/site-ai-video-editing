There are several transition effects in Adobe Premiere Pro, and there are countless ways to customize them to fit your film. It is quite easy to locate transitions and add them. The Effects panel, which is accessible from the very top options bar, contains all the transition options. A panel will show up on the right when you choose this.

![drag and apply transitions pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/drag-and-apply-transitions-pr.jpg)

* In Premiere, there are several possible transitions, and some can be more suitable for your project than others.

### Add Visual Effects

The Essential Graphics panel was added by Adobe to Premiere Pro. Users now have a much different workflow than they had with the few prior title panels. Now that everything is in one panel, you can easily create, animate, and use VFX. Some of the VFX shots were just building miniature towns and adding pieces, while others involved the standard green screen removal and backdrop replacement.

* Simply importing and uploading your video and audio files into Premiere Pro is the first step. The procedure of clicking through is fairly simple. Choose "New Project." Press the Media Browser panel button and find the Ultra Key tool by opening the Effects panel.

![press meida browser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/press-meida-browser.jpg)

* First, equalize the audio. You have thus eliminated your stutters and the buzz from the audio track of your speaker. You may use the Parametric Equalizer effect under Effects > Audio Effects to give your voices a last boost of clarity and flow.

![audio effects panel pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/audio-effects-panel-pr.jpg)
