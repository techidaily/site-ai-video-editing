### 03Make Your GIF

After creating GIF, you can easily share it by downloading it to your system and then using the short link to upload it. Droplr saves all GIFs, screen recordings, screenshots to the Cloud and generates a short URL for each file. You can use this link to paste into Discord (or another platform) to display the screen share into the platform.

## Part 1 What GIF/Video Can Crash Discord (Explained)?

As a result of the fact that some GIFs/Videos can crash Discord due to the RAM overload method within the GIF/Video file, hidden contents out of frame probably. More so, there are GIF/ Video that makes your Discord client reload. As soon as you see it play, your Discord will reload like it does when pressing "ctrl + r."
