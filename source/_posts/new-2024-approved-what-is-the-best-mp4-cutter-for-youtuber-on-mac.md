Now that we have discussed how to add background to green screen video with the help of Filmora let’s now discuss how to add a background to a video without a green screen.

## Part 2 Add background to video without a green screen

Let us learn how to add a background to a video without a green screen. In Filmora, there is a special effect called the Human segmentation effect to isolate people from the backgrounds without a green screen. All it takes is a few clicks. Once you remove the surround, you can add an image or a video clip to go well with your original video. Another unique feature is that after removing the background from the video clip, you can add it to the overlay of another video clip. It works well when it has a natural and single person in front of the camera.

Let’s discuss how to add background without a green screen.
