## AI Has Influenced All Video Editors to Speed up Editing. This Article Discusses the Significance of AI Slow Motion and the Tools that Offer It

The prediction was that AI would take over the world with its advanced algorithms and efficiency. Many believe that AI can achieve task completion better than humans. Even though it hasn't been able to replace the human race, it surpasses many fields. One such field is the media and entertainment industry for content editing. Today's article topic revolves around AI editing and editors.

Specifically, we will dive into understanding **AI slow motion** in depth. We will discuss its purpose, significance, and process along the way. You can find many slow-motion AI tools to compare and choose a suitable one. The article will conclude by recommending an AI slow-motion tool that tops all.

**Slow Motion Video Maker** Slow your video’s speed with better control of your keyframes to create unique cinematic effects ![Make A Slow Motion Video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [Make A Slow Motion Video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [More Features](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## Part 1: How Does AI Improve Slow Motion Video Editing?

AI can enhance the quality of content and the mechanism of crafting **slow-mo AI** video. It not only contributes to task achievement but also improves various aspects. Find out about the influence that AI has in achieving a perfect slow-mo effect below:

### 1\. Frame Interpolation

If you create an **AI slow-motion** video, the slow motion is often abrupt. To resolve this problem and bring smoothness to slow-mo, AI frame interpolation can help. Users must activate this function, and AI will handle all the technicalities. The AI adds extra frames to your video to ensure a smooth, slow motion.

### 2\. Minimizing Artifacts

When you convert a video into slow motion, certain changes take place. It introduces artifacts such as motion blur or unwanted distortions. They decline the quality of content, and the view becomes distorted. Reducing these factors magnifies the slow-motion effect and brings perfection to it.

### 3\. AI Auto Enhancement

Many **slow-motion AI** creators have a built-in auto enhancement feature or effect. They incorporate this function to minimize the negative elements. They increase sharpness for clarity and light settings for visual appeal. While slowing down footage, these enhancements act as a helping hand.
