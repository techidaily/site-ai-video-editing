## How to Add Font Effects to Videos

Adding titles and texts to a video clip during the post-production phase is a common thing. You may need to add texts in the intro and outro of the video as well as to highlight important parts in the middle of the video. Showing regular and static texts and titles is very unappealing, and that is why everyone includes font effects to animate the texts.

There are different types of font effects available to apply to the texts and titles in your video. There are premium video editors available with a wide range of effects such as After Effect font effects. If you are an occasional video creator, you can use online font effects while you edit your videos on the go. We will illustrate how to add font effects to videos on any device.

## Part 1\. Add Font Effects to Video on Windows PC

If you have the video where you want to edit and add font effect on your Windows PC, you will need a video editor where the font effects are available.

You can add texts and titles and add animation to the text conveniently without any prior knowledge or experience.

[Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) has a wide range of effects and animations that you can add to the text of the video.

There are different types of video font effects available on iMovie starting from animated titles to credits and callouts. You can get similar font for After Effect on iMovie. Here are the steps to add video font effects on Mac.
