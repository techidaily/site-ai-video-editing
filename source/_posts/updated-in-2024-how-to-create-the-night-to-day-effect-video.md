## How to Create the Night-to-Day Effect Video

Do you wish you could control when it's nighttime to daytime? It would make getting ready in the morning much faster! This tutorial will show you how to use the keyframe and mask feature in [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to make a remarkable night-to-day transition.

## How-to Guide

**_1) Preparation_**

For this effect, you will need to shoot two footage shots with the same frame. The first is for the daytime clip, and the second is for nighttime.

But before that, you need to prepare some things, such as:

1. Tripod to ensure your camera stays at the same point, so the frame doesn't change.
2. Mark the place where you want to shoot the scene. You can put a marker on the floor to ensure that you perform at the same spot in different shots.

Once done, let's start shooting to get the footage.

**_2) Steps_**

**Shooting footages**

First, get the daytime shot. For this tutorial, we will pretend that you are walking and transitioning into nighttime at the spot you have marked.

![get the daytime shot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-1.gif)

Now, let's film the nighttime clip. You will walk through the living room and do the same movement again at the same spot. You can dim the light and change the camera's white balance settings to bluer to create a night feeling.

![film the nighttime clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-2.gif)

After you have both clips that you need, let's go to Filmora and start editing.

**Night-to-day transition**

Step1 Launch Filmora and import the footage into the program. If you haven't installed it, you can download Filmora on their website here: <https://filmora.wondershare.com>

Step2 Place the nighttime video clip on the first video track of the timeline and place the daytime clip on the top.

![place the daytime clip on the top](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-3.jpg)

Step3 Find the spot where you want to create a transition between the day and nighttime. Then, you can delete the unwanted part.

![create a transition](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-4.jpg)

Step4 Since the transition for this tutorial is where the subject started waving, make sure to place the daytime clip at the same time the subject started waving in the nighttime clip. Hence, the timing in both clips syncs.

**Masking transition**

For the next step, we will make a masking transition with the Filmora mask feature.

Step1 Double-click the daytime clip on the timeline. In the Filmora setting, find the **Mask section > Circle**. You can see the mask is applied in the preview screen.

![double-click the daytime clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-5.jpg)

Step2 Scroll down the setting and click add a keyframe at the beginning of the clip.

![scroll down the setting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-6.jpg)

Step3 Change the scale of the mask to the smallest number and adjust the Width and Height down to 0\. You can set the blur strength to 15 to make the transition edge smoother.

![change the scale of the mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-7.jpg)

Step4 Move the play head to find the spot where you want the mask fully opens up, then add another keyframe. Change the scale of the mask to 2 and the Width and Height to 50\. Make sure the mask occupies the whole frame.

![add another keyframe](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-8.jpg)

Now, if you play back, you can see the nighttime becomes daytime through the mask.

![nighttime becomes daytime through the mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-9.gif)

If the movement in the two clips is a bit off, you can fix it by adding more keyframes on the mask.

**_3) Pro tips_**

You can add one more effect in Filmora to make it more magical. To do this, open the Effects window on the top left and find “Heartbeat” under the Basic section.

![add one more effect in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-10.jpg)

Drag and drop it onto the third video track and start the effect when the mask opens up. Then, trim the effect length to match the movement. Adjust the speed of this effect if needed.

The final result will look like this:

Content creators can also use the freeze-frame effect on fast-moving objects to draw the viewers' attention. Have a few examples of the most popular freeze frames used in the movies.

### Examples of freeze frames in popular movies

Alfred Hitchcock used the first-ever freeze-frame in his film Champagne (1928). There is a long list of many famous tv shows and movies in which the freeze frame effect has been used since then. But to count a few, three examples are given here.

![pulp fiction's freeze frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-2.png)

**2\. The Breakfast Club (1985)**

The ending of Breakfast Club is an iconic example of the freeze-frame effect. With a powerful narration, the freeze frame conveys the movie's central idea to the audience.

![the breakfast club's freeze frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-3.png)

**3\. Suicide Squad (2016)**

![take a screenshot of the action frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-9.gif)

Make sure to keep the playhead the same after you've taken the snapshot. You can find your screenshot in the media tab.

##### Step6 Add the screenshot to timeline

Let's drag your screenshot onto video layer 2 and align it on the right side of the playhead. Then extend the screenshot so it lasts as long as your central clip.

![extend the screenshot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-10.png)

![hide the main video layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-12.gif)

## Conclusion

The article emphasized the importance of video background removers and their benefits. In addition, we discussed **replacing sky After Effects** in detail. In the end, we provided a simple alternative for those looking for it. This is because Adobe After Effects might have a technical editing interface.

Wondershare Filmora, on the other hand, can carry on the process with efficiency and simplicity. If you haven't yet used this software, visit its website to download it.
