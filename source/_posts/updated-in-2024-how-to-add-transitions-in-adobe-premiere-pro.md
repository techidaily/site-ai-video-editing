## How to Create A Freeze Frame Sequence in Video

_Are you considering getting your video editing skills to a new high level? Are you worried about spicing your videos with stylish shots and bringing attention to particular aspects of your video?_

Freeze frame sequence is one the most stunning effects that can help you greatly. The freeze frame sequence has been used in many classic and present-day movies. And it will never go out of fashion.

Here, we will guide you on creating freeze frame sequences in your videos using Filmora. It is critical here to know what exactly the freeze frame sequence is. So let's jump right into it!

## Part 1\. What Is A Freeze Frame?

A freeze frame is a specific single frame of the video clip shown repeatedly in the video. It gives the illusion of a static picture. It is used to draw the viewers' attention to the minute details of a specific moment, to set up a powerful narrative, or to introduce your main characters.

![freeze frame effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-1.jpg)

Content creators can also use the freeze-frame effect on fast-moving objects to draw the viewers' attention. Have a few examples of the most popular freeze frames used in the movies.

### Examples of freeze frames in popular movies

Alfred Hitchcock used the first-ever freeze-frame in his film Champagne (1928). There is a long list of many famous tv shows and movies in which the freeze frame effect has been used since then. But to count a few, three examples are given here.

**1\. Pulp Fiction (1994)**

In the beginning scene of Pulp Fiction, where robbery is about to occur, a freeze-frame effect is used to engage the audience. Later in the movie, it was relieved what would happen next. It was a dramatic pause to draw attention. It is a strong example of the freeze-frame effect.

![pulp fiction's freeze frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-2.png)

**2\. The Breakfast Club (1985)**

The ending of Breakfast Club is an iconic example of the freeze-frame effect. With a powerful narration, the freeze frame conveys the movie's central idea to the audience.

Now, double-click on the screenshot. It will open the "Video" menu, then go into the "Mask" menu. Choose a mask shape and edit it so that it only covers where your subject is in the screenshot. **For example,** we choose the **"**Circle" mask shape in this video.

![choose your mask shape](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-11.png)

If you need help seeing what you're masking, hide the main video layer and edit your mask like this.

![hide the main video layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-12.gif)

Move the playhead forward and clean up your "mask." Next, Increase the blur to soften the edges. But not too much because it may become visible on your subject.

## Part 3\. Tips To Use Freeze Frame Sequence

You've known how to make the freeze frame sequence. However, don't miss essential tips to improve your video at the next stage.

### Tip 1: Making a steady shot is important

First, ensure **a steady shot with no camera shake** while filming. You can use a tripod or a stable surface to keep your camera still.

![keep your camera still](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-18.png)

**Why is it necessary to make a steady shot?**

* It helps you to make smooth, fluid shots.
* It is much more professional.
* It will take your editing skills to a new level.
* It grabs the attention of the viewers.
* It makes your editing easier.

### Tip 2: No crossing over

Make sure **your subject only crosses the same spot once**. Otherwise, you would need help editing the video.

![crossing over should be avoided](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-19.gif)

**Why is it necessary to avoid crossing the same spot?**

* It prevents misalignment of the shots, and your print won't get damaged, primarily when you use pieces of the same image.
* It helps to create an illusion of holding specific moments.

Do you wonder how some pictures or videos look so stunning? As you keep reading you will discover the secrets of achieving similar quality for your content. You need a video or photo-editing software such as Adobe Premiere Pro and LUTS. Premier Pro luts are file types that you use to make color corrections to your content. They are available in different formats, each with varying capabilities. Below is everything you need to improve your editing skills using Adobe’s software and premiere luts.

![how to use luts in adobe primere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/premiere-luts-1.jpeg)

01 [How does Premiere Pro Classify LUTS?](#part1)

02 [How to use Luts in Adobe Premiere Pro?](#part2)

03 [How to save and export your LUTS?](#part3)

## How does Premiere Pro Classify LUTS?

A premiere pro lut can fall into two categories depending on its core function. These are:

#### • Looks

These are premiere luts you use to make changes to your video or photo’s appearance and color scheme. They are available as presets under the Lumetri Color Panel and offer quick fixes to your content.

#### • Input Lut

You use these premiere pro luts to interpret log footage. Additionally, they are the first step of your color correcting process and work best on DSLR footage. However, keep reading to discover how to use luts in Adobe Premiere Pro.

## How to use Luts in Adobe Premiere Pro?

Now that you are aware of how the program classifies the Luts, here is how you can correct your footage.

#### 1\. Get the latest version of the program

You can purchase and download the program from your region's Adobe Website. The program is available for both macOS and Windows. However, it is quite heavy on the system. According to reports, the below requirements are sufficient.

* You need a processer with 8 cores and clock speeds upwards of 3.2GHz.
* 16 GB of Ram is ideal for macOS. However, you do require upwards of 32GB if you are running Windows.
* Graphics cards from Nvidia and AMD are best if you also want to improve the program’s performance. You request one that can handle the Adobe Premiere Pro from your supplier.
* Furthermore, invest in a high-capacity storage device to save your projects since some outputs can be very large after color correction. The program allows you to render 4K files which are the largest.
* Finally, the above requirements are sufficient to run the following versions OF Adobe Premiere Pro:  
i. Adobe Premiere Pro 22.2  
ii. Adobe Premiere Pro 22.1.2  
iii. Adobe Premiere Pro 22.1.1  
iv. Adobe Premiere Pro 22.0

#### 2\. Select the video you want and put it on the timeline

![use luts in adobe primere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/premiere-luts-2.jpeg)

#### 3\. Premiere luts are accessible from two sections of the program

Input luts are available under the Basic Correction tab from the Lumetri Panel as above.

Alternatively, you can get them by accessing the Basic Correction tab from the Lumetri Section of the Effects Control Panel.

#### 4\. Then, open the Input LUT dropdown menu and choose the premiere lut you want

Adobe Premiere Pro has preset input LUTs. However, you can also add your own by clicking browse. Doing so opens your computer’s File Explorer and you can locate your custom premiere luts. The software applies the premiere lut, after which you can use the tools to make adjustments.

Additionally, Adobe Premiere Pro allows you to install custom LUT files to use. Below is the process for macOS users.

1. Create these target directories in your Adobe Premiere Installation files. • For shared devices  
/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Common/LUTs/Creative  
/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Common/LUTs/Technical  
• You need to create these files if you have administrator access.  
/Users//Library/Application Support/Adobe/Common/LUTs/Creative  
/Users//Library/Application Support/Adobe/Common/LUTs/Technical
2. Copy your custom LUT files to each of the folders.
3. These will be available in your Lumetri Panel next time you launch Adobe Premiere Pro.

The process is the same for Windows Users. However, the target directories are different.

* For shared devices:  
C:\\ Program Files\\ Adobe\\Common\\LUTs\\Creative  
C:\\ Program Files\\ Adobe\\Common\\LUTs\\Creative
* You need to create these files if you have administrator access.  
C:\\Users\\yourusername\\AppData\\Roaming\\Adobe\\Common\\LUTs\\Creative  
C:\\Users\\yourusername\\AppData\\Roaming\\Adobe\\Common\\LUTs\\Technical

Adobe Premiere Pro accepts .look and .cube file types, allowing you more creative freedom. Additionally, you can save and export any custom premiere luts to use in other projects. The next section offers a step-by-step guide on how to do that.

Finally, Looks allow you to make quick adjustments to your videos using the presets available on the Lumetri Panel. You can access these from the Effects Panel. Furthermore, it also allows you to preview the result. The intensity of the look can vary depending on where the slider is on the effects panel.

## How to save and export your LUTS?

Most filmmakers prefer to save their premier luts for later use. Here is how to do it:

1. Follow the above process through to step 5.
2. Once you finish your editing, click on the Lumetri Pop Up menu and choose Save Preset.
3. Fill the respective fields with your custom information and click OK. The program will then save the clip to the location you specify.
4. You can save custom luts in the following ways:  
Scale only applies the new lut to the video. As such, all other luts you use are deleted. Therefore, if your video is one hour, your custom settings will run through the clip’s entire length.  
Anchor To In Point only saves the section of the clip where your custom settings are active. Additionally, the software will add all pre-existing luts to the section without scaling.
5. Additionally, you can repeat the process and export your LUTs in the following formats:  
.look exports the LUT as an Adobe Premiere Pro file to a location on your device.  
.cube saves the Lumetri preset you can use on other color grading software. For example, you can use your .cube custom lut with Filmora.

.look exports the LUT as an Adobe Premiere Pro file to a location on your device.  
.cube saves the Lumetri preset you can use on other color grading software. For example, you can use your .cube custom lut with Filmora.

03 [How to save and export your LUTS?](#part3)

## How does Premiere Pro Classify LUTS?

A premiere pro lut can fall into two categories depending on its core function. These are:

#### • Looks

These are premiere luts you use to make changes to your video or photo’s appearance and color scheme. They are available as presets under the Lumetri Color Panel and offer quick fixes to your content.

#### • Input Lut

You use these premiere pro luts to interpret log footage. Additionally, they are the first step of your color correcting process and work best on DSLR footage. However, keep reading to discover how to use luts in Adobe Premiere Pro.

## How to use Luts in Adobe Premiere Pro?

Now that you are aware of how the program classifies the Luts, here is how you can correct your footage.

#### 1\. Get the latest version of the program

You can purchase and download the program from your region's Adobe Website. The program is available for both macOS and Windows. However, it is quite heavy on the system. According to reports, the below requirements are sufficient.

* You need a processer with 8 cores and clock speeds upwards of 3.2GHz.
* 16 GB of Ram is ideal for macOS. However, you do require upwards of 32GB if you are running Windows.
* Graphics cards from Nvidia and AMD are best if you also want to improve the program’s performance. You request one that can handle the Adobe Premiere Pro from your supplier.
* Furthermore, invest in a high-capacity storage device to save your projects since some outputs can be very large after color correction. The program allows you to render 4K files which are the largest.
* Finally, the above requirements are sufficient to run the following versions OF Adobe Premiere Pro:  
i. Adobe Premiere Pro 22.2  
ii. Adobe Premiere Pro 22.1.2  
iii. Adobe Premiere Pro 22.1.1  
iv. Adobe Premiere Pro 22.0

#### 2\. Select the video you want and put it on the timeline

![use luts in adobe primere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/premiere-luts-2.jpeg)

#### 3\. Premiere luts are accessible from two sections of the program

Input luts are available under the Basic Correction tab from the Lumetri Panel as above.

Alternatively, you can get them by accessing the Basic Correction tab from the Lumetri Section of the Effects Control Panel.

#### 4\. Then, open the Input LUT dropdown menu and choose the premiere lut you want

Adobe Premiere Pro has preset input LUTs. However, you can also add your own by clicking browse. Doing so opens your computer’s File Explorer and you can locate your custom premiere luts. The software applies the premiere lut, after which you can use the tools to make adjustments.

Additionally, Adobe Premiere Pro allows you to install custom LUT files to use. Below is the process for macOS users.

1. Create these target directories in your Adobe Premiere Installation files. • For shared devices  
/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Common/LUTs/Creative  
/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Common/LUTs/Technical  
• You need to create these files if you have administrator access.  
/Users//Library/Application Support/Adobe/Common/LUTs/Creative  
/Users//Library/Application Support/Adobe/Common/LUTs/Technical
2. Copy your custom LUT files to each of the folders.
3. These will be available in your Lumetri Panel next time you launch Adobe Premiere Pro.

The process is the same for Windows Users. However, the target directories are different.

* For shared devices:  
C:\\ Program Files\\ Adobe\\Common\\LUTs\\Creative  
C:\\ Program Files\\ Adobe\\Common\\LUTs\\Creative
* You need to create these files if you have administrator access.  
C:\\Users\\yourusername\\AppData\\Roaming\\Adobe\\Common\\LUTs\\Creative  
C:\\Users\\yourusername\\AppData\\Roaming\\Adobe\\Common\\LUTs\\Technical

Adobe Premiere Pro accepts .look and .cube file types, allowing you more creative freedom. Additionally, you can save and export any custom premiere luts to use in other projects. The next section offers a step-by-step guide on how to do that.

Finally, Looks allow you to make quick adjustments to your videos using the presets available on the Lumetri Panel. You can access these from the Effects Panel. Furthermore, it also allows you to preview the result. The intensity of the look can vary depending on where the slider is on the effects panel.

## How to save and export your LUTS?

Most filmmakers prefer to save their premier luts for later use. Here is how to do it:

1. Follow the above process through to step 5.
2. Once you finish your editing, click on the Lumetri Pop Up menu and choose Save Preset.
3. Fill the respective fields with your custom information and click OK. The program will then save the clip to the location you specify.
4. You can save custom luts in the following ways:  
Scale only applies the new lut to the video. As such, all other luts you use are deleted. Therefore, if your video is one hour, your custom settings will run through the clip’s entire length.  
Anchor To In Point only saves the section of the clip where your custom settings are active. Additionally, the software will add all pre-existing luts to the section without scaling.
5. Additionally, you can repeat the process and export your LUTs in the following formats:  
.look exports the LUT as an Adobe Premiere Pro file to a location on your device.  
.cube saves the Lumetri preset you can use on other color grading software. For example, you can use your .cube custom lut with Filmora.
