## Detailed Steps to Add Border to Video Using Premiere Pro

The border is really important as it frames up all the video. It makes the video eye-catching and gives a vivid effect. It also fixes the automated cropping issues, especially on Instagram. Along with this, it helps the viewers to watch the video as you can add effects about fun, travel, guides and etc. accordingly. Adding a border is super easy and it’s not more than fun!

So let’s start…

## **How to Add Borders to Videos in Premiere Pro**

Today we are going to discuss how to add borders to the video clips or images in premiere pro. It’s pretty simple to make borders of different colors and sizes for your video clips.

So, here are the two different ways we can use to add borders to our videos or images.

1. Adding a border to the video using a grid effect
2. Adding a border to the video using the essential graphics panel

### **Way 1\.** **Using a Grid Effect**

While working on the project, make sure the aspect ratio of the video is 16:9, and project settings are HD (1080P) and UHD 4K in premiere pro.

Let’s start step by step.

* Drag all the video clips by stacking them on video tracks in the timeline.
* Hit the **Effects** tab and write the **grid** in the search panel.
* Simply drag the **grid** option into the timeline of the videos.

* Select the **anchor value** to **0** for the x and y.
* Change the **size** to **width and height slider.**
* Change the **width** to **1920** and **height** to **1080**.

Now we have borders added as you can see below.

You can also change the width of the borders.

* Change the **width** to **30**.

You have the option to change the color of the border.

* Select the **blending mode** to **normal**.
* Select the **color picker** tool and change the color of your desire.

### **Way 2\.** **Using the Essential Graphics Panel**

First of all, you wanna be in your premium pro graphics workspace. This will pull off your graphics panel on your right. The good thing about the essential graphics panel is, that it is vector-based. So the different video clips with different resolutions will not pixelate.

Let’s dive in…

Now, to use the graphics panel you need to perform the following steps.

* **Import** the videos and drag them into the timeline.
* Select the **effects**
* Find **“alpha adjust”** and drag it into the effects control.

* Create a **4-point polygon mask**.

A rectangular mask will be created. You can edit it according to the frame requirement.

* Go to the corner of the mask border and press the shift key. Drag the border to resize and scale it proportionally.

* Again go to effect controls, under **opacity** hit **invert alpha**.
* Under **mask** hit **inverted**.

* Go to **motion** settings, change the **position**, and
* Go to **Alpha adjust** and set the **mask feathering** to **0**.

* Now go back to the **effects** panel and search the **paint bucket**.

* Under effects controls, hit the **alpha channel** under the **fill selector**
* Then hit **stroke** under the **stroke**
* You can turn up the **stroke width** to make it a bit thicker.
* Hit the **color** tab to change the color of the border as desired.

**Export and Burn Video into DVD**

You can also directly burn your video to a DVD. Even though video to DVD isn't as common as it used to be, it's still nice to be able to do it, especially if you like making DVDs.

![export and burn video into dvd](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/export-video-in-filmora-4.jpg)

**Export Video to Other Devices**

Go to the "Devices" option if you want to export your video to specific devices with everything looking good on that particular device. For instance, if you want to export your video to iPhone, you can see the size will be 41MB, and the resolution will be 1080p. All those things are going to look much better on an iPhone.

![export video to other devices](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/export-video-in-filmora-5.jpg)

**Export Videos in High Res Quality**

In the “Format” option you can choose the file extension, the format, or the codec. Exporting your video based on format is good if you prefer to save your video on your computer since maybe you may upload your video on YouTube, Instagram or other social media platforms.

![export videos in high res quality](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/export-video-in-filmora-7.jpg)

You can choose "Apple Prores" if you want the least amount of compression possible and don't care about the file size. For example, if you want to export a video from Filmora and then import it into another video editor without losing too much quality, you should definitely choose "Apple Prores."

![choose apple prores](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/export-video-in-filmora-8.jpg)

Before exporting, there is the option to upload to the cloud. If you do not know what it is, Wondershare has its own Drive, which allows you to save and remotely view your video files.

In the meantime, if you have a decent PC, you can enable "Hardware acceleration for video encoding." This option will utilize as much computer power as you have to export the video and make the process significantly faster. Once everything is finished, click "Export."

![click export](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/export-video-in-filmora-9.jpg)

When you click Export, you can see the progress with thumbnails and everything. Lastly, your video has been exported successfully when the exporting process reaches 100%.

## Hot FAQs on converting SBV to SRT

### 1\. How do I download SRT files from YouTube?

You can download the DRT files from YouTube by using the transcription option included below the video player: For this, press the small dot icon below the video, Then choose "open the transcription," where you can copy and paste a complete transcript, in SRT format, of any video!

### 2\. Can you download auto-generated subtitles from YouTube?

Yes, you can download auto-generated subtitles from YouTube. [DownSub](https://downsub.com/) is a web-based application that can download automatically generated subtitles directly from YouTube, VIU, Viki, Vlive, and more. It supports downloading all subtitles/captions formats such as SRT, TXT, and VTT.

It doesn't force our users to download or install any extensions or third-party software. It provides an online method to download subtitles by just entering the URL of the video and clicking Download.

### 3\. What program opens an SBV file?

You can open the SBV file using any text editor, such as Notepad (Windows), TextEdit (Mac), or Atom. You can also see an SBV file's contents by dragging the file into any web browser. Plus, it also allows you to edit.

## Final words

By default, YouTube allows those files created in various formats such as SRT, SBV, MPSUB, etc. But the drawback is that the site automatically converts the SBV format once uploaded.

We've explained above the variety of online video converters and desktop software. You can convert the SBV files to SRT in no time.

After converting, editing, or merging the .srt file is necessary. For this, a variety of software is available, but [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is one of the best video editing software.

Download Filmora and edit the content the way you want.
