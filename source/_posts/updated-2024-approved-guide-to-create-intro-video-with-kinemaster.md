## What Is the Difference Between Cutting and Trimming a Video?

If you are new to video editing, you might find that cutting and trimming video files sound the same to you. At first sight, you'll see that these two operations are similar because they involve the cutting of videos. Let's look at the differences between these two operations.

### Trimming

Trimming is the process of cutting off a portion of the end or beginning of your video to reduce its length, leaving the desired content only. Trimming is vital when you want to ensure your video starts swiftly and your viewers will not get bored while waiting for something captivating to occur.

The first seconds of a video are what draw viewers' attention and convince them to continue watching the entire video. When you apply it intelligently, video trimming allows you to remove unnecessary frames from the beginning and end of your video and leave content that your audience will like.

### Cutting

Cutting is also a fundamental video editing skill, and it involves removing a portion of a video clip by cutting in two places. You'll then lift out the middle area and combine the leftover video back together.

This operation is helpful when you want to polish your video and cut off meaningless snippets. What's more? You can apply cutting if you intend to insert a section of your video clip into another one.

You might want to consider cutting when you want to share your video on social networks and need to cut it into pieces due to the video length limits.

People often confuse trimming with cutting because they are all about deleting sections of the video. However, trimming involves deleting the beginning and end of a video, while cutting refers to cutting a part of a video file from somewhere else. Understanding this crucial difference will allow you to edit your videos like a professional.

## How to Trim videos in Premiere Pro in Different Ways

You can trim video Premiere Pro on the timeline or program. Let's look at these two methods.

### Method 1:Trim Clips on Timeline

If you are wondering: What is a timeline? It's the area Premiere Pro where you arrange your videos and map out the edits you want to apply. You will see all your video clips, transitions, effects, and more laid out in chronological order while you are working on your project. You can Premiere Pro trim video clips on the timeline, and at any point, play your project to check how your edits will look.

Remember that edits on the Premiere Pro timeline don't alter your source files, and they are previews of how your edits will appear. That means you can untrim a video clip to extend it to its original length without consequence.

To learn how to trim video in Premiere Pro on the timeline, follow the steps below.

1. Double click on the video file you want to trim in Premiere Pro.
2. Adjust the timings of your edits. Drag the ends of your video clip as if you are resizing a window to shorten or extend by trimming. As your cursor gets closer at the edge of the video clip, you'll see a red arrow.

## Extra Tips About Trimming Videos in Premiere Pro

We have provided some tips that you should keep in mind when using Adobe Premiere trim video.

### How to Trim a Video without Re-Rendering?

When adding a video to Premiere Pro, it will be rendered by this software application to ensure high-quality playback and speed. Rendering takes time afterward, leading to loss of quality; however, it makes sure you have gotten the best video quality as much as possible by removing skipped frames and lag from the video playback.

If you are wondering how to trim videos in Premiere Pro without re-render follow the steps below:

1. Import your video to Premiere Pro by launching the application and choosing 'Import Media to Start'. Browse and select the video you want to trim.
2. The video will appear in the media library area at the bottom of the screen.
3. Drag and drop the video from the media library to the timeline. You'll see the complete video clip duration in the timeline.
4. You can crop the video by dragging the blue time marker to the duration where you would like to start the video.
5. Hold the 'Ctrl' key on your keyboard, then drag the starting end of the video clip to the time marker position. You'll remove unnecessary video content from the beginning of your video.
6. You can trim the video from its other end by following the same steps but from the opposite direction. You can only use this method to trim from one of the ends of your video clip.
7. Choose the 'Laser Tool' located at the side menu of the timeline to trim from the center of the video clip. Now, click on the clip at the position you want to trim, and the application will cut the video from this position.
8. Follow steps 2 to 4 to trim from cuts you've just made.

![trim video without re-rendering in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-trim-videos-in-premiere-pro-6.png)

### Unlink Audio and Video for Trimming

When you upload a video file to Adobe Premiere Pro and take it into the timeline, the audio tracks and video will be synced and locked. Essentially, this ensures there is no misalignment when the program converts the video to another format. For example, importing it into another video editor can cause a mis-sync between audio and video if the two tracks are not locked or linked.

Video editing professionals avoid this by locking the two tracks together. As such, you might want to unlink or unlock the two before doing anything. To do this, you need to import the video into the application and take it to the timeline with the associated tracks. Then, select the video track alone.

![unlink audio from video in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-trim-videos-in-premiere-pro-7.png)

Next, right-click the video track and select the Unlink option. The software will separate the audio from the video track. You can now trim either of these.

### How to Trim and Re-Encode Videos without Re-Rendering

Follow the method below to trim video Premiere Pro and encode it without rendering it.

1. Launch Premiere Pro and navigate to File, then choose import. Find the video that you want to trim and double click on it.
2. Drag and drop the video into the timeline.
3. Choose the 'Ripple Edit Tool' and then Press 'Sequence'. Head to 'Sequence Settings' and set or modify the codec, bitrate, name, format, and much more.

5. Now, finalize the trim by choosing 'File' and tap 'Export'. To 'Export Settings,' elect 'Media'.

## What Is the Difference Between Cutting and Trimming a Video?

If you are new to video editing, you might find that cutting and trimming video files sound the same to you. At first sight, you'll see that these two operations are similar because they involve the cutting of videos. Let's look at the differences between these two operations.

### Trimming

Trimming is the process of cutting off a portion of the end or beginning of your video to reduce its length, leaving the desired content only. Trimming is vital when you want to ensure your video starts swiftly and your viewers will not get bored while waiting for something captivating to occur.

The first seconds of a video are what draw viewers' attention and convince them to continue watching the entire video. When you apply it intelligently, video trimming allows you to remove unnecessary frames from the beginning and end of your video and leave content that your audience will like.

### Cutting

Cutting is also a fundamental video editing skill, and it involves removing a portion of a video clip by cutting in two places. You'll then lift out the middle area and combine the leftover video back together.

This operation is helpful when you want to polish your video and cut off meaningless snippets. What's more? You can apply cutting if you intend to insert a section of your video clip into another one.

You might want to consider cutting when you want to share your video on social networks and need to cut it into pieces due to the video length limits.

People often confuse trimming with cutting because they are all about deleting sections of the video. However, trimming involves deleting the beginning and end of a video, while cutting refers to cutting a part of a video file from somewhere else. Understanding this crucial difference will allow you to edit your videos like a professional.

### Unlink Audio and Video for Trimming

When you upload a video file to Adobe Premiere Pro and take it into the timeline, the audio tracks and video will be synced and locked. Essentially, this ensures there is no misalignment when the program converts the video to another format. For example, importing it into another video editor can cause a mis-sync between audio and video if the two tracks are not locked or linked.

Video editing professionals avoid this by locking the two tracks together. As such, you might want to unlink or unlock the two before doing anything. To do this, you need to import the video into the application and take it to the timeline with the associated tracks. Then, select the video track alone.

![unlink audio from video in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-trim-videos-in-premiere-pro-7.png)

Next, right-click the video track and select the Unlink option. The software will separate the audio from the video track. You can now trim either of these.
