## How to Make Loop Video in PowerPoint

Loop videos are a great way to showcase your content. They're easy to make, and they're also easy to edit. You can have a loop video where the slides keep repeating in the same order, or you can change it up by putting different images on each slide.

You're probably already familiar with the concept of looping video in PowerPoint. However, there are some instances where looping videos can be a real-time saver. To do this, you need to make sure that your visuals are engaging and unique. You can achieve this by using video loops in PowerPoint presentations.

Or you can use PowerPoint if you have a very long video that you want to show in one go. You can also use it for suggesting different angles for your audience and making their eyes move from one point to another without making them bored.

## Part 1: How to Make a Slideshow Loop in PowerPoint
