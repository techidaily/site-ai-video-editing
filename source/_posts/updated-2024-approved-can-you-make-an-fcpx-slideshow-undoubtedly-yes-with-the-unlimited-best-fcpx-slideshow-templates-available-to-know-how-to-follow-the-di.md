After Effects is utilized by professionals working in the film business to create aesthetically spectacular work for cinema, television, video, and the online. The most significant drawback to After Effects is the fact that it requires an average beginner around eight weeks to learn the program by watching training videos and going through tutorials. In addition, the fee to join Adobe's Creative Cloud Suite membership service is quite high.

### Canva

However, some limitations to using Canva include the fact that it only supports a limited number of output formats and there is a possibility that you will experience connectivity troubles while attempting to save and export your video introductions.

When it came to design, I previously relied on a combination of Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, and PicMonkey until I discovered Canva. After some time, we were able to navigate both with ease, but we found that Canva was more difficult to use than PicMonkey. Canva had a steep learning curve and lacked some of the features I was looking for in a design program.

We choose to disregard it. But I decided to give it another shot about two or three years ago, and this time I was impressed enough to switch PicMonkey out for it in my collection of editing tools. Canva had added a large number of features that made the program simpler to use and gave users the ability to accomplish more.
