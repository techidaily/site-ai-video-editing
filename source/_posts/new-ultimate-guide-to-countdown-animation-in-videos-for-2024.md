**How to make a countdown animation with Canva**

Canva offers a range of great-looking countdown templates that'll help you create one in just a few minutes. And if you need a simple countdown animation, you can download one of their free templates. Let's make it from scratch:

##### Step1 Select The Background

With Canva, you get a wide range of free backgrounds. Click on the button labeled "Search." Now choose the "light old film" background element and click Add.

![select background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/3-actionable-ways-to-create-animation-for-videos-12.png)

##### Step2 Enter Your Text (Number)

Then select the text tab and choose any font style, color, and size.

![enter your number](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/3-actionable-ways-to-create-animation-for-videos-13.png)

##### Step3 Animate Text

Next, select the font again, and then, at the top, there's an option for Text Animation.

Adding text animation to your countdown timer will make it more realistic and match your background better than a straight-up countdown timer.

![animate text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/3-actionable-ways-to-create-animation-for-videos-14.png)

##### Step4 Edit The Page Timing

![edit page timing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/3-actionable-ways-to-create-animation-for-videos-15.png)

##### Step5 Duplicate The Page

Now, select the duplicate page option and change the number of duplicate pages from 3 to 2,1, with the same design and formatting.

![duplicate the page](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/3-actionable-ways-to-create-animation-for-videos-16.png)

##### Step6 Export / Download Video

You're finally done! Click the Download button to export your design.

The background of this photo is not a static image, so you cannot select the JPG, PNG, or SVG. You must choose an MP4 video or a GIF when creating an animation.
