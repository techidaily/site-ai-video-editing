## How To Speed Up Video With Lightworks Video Editor

You must have watched videos where certain parts have different speeds. Have you ever wondered why video creators change the speed of the video? The slow-motion video has some eye-pleasing effects. But the video creator's intention could be to draw attention to the detail. Similarly, they speed up the video to go through boring parts faster than usual.

Apart from that, the speeding up of a video clip may make it look funny. Sometimes, speeding up a video is necessary to limit its duration. You will need a feature-rich video editor to speed up your video. Lightworks is a powerful video editor that can speed up or slow down your video. We will illustrate how to change video speed in Lightworks.

All you need to do is reposition the playhead and click the "C" icon to split the video. Thereafter, you can select any split portion of the video and follow the steps to change the speed.

## Discover the Art of Masking in After Effects: A Comprehensive Guide

Masking is a powerful feature in After Effects that allows you to hide, reveal, or manipulate specific parts of a layer. Whether creating animations, visual effects, or enhancing your video content, masking can be a valuable tool in your arsenal. However, it can be intimidating for beginners, as it requires a good understanding of key concepts and techniques.

This article aims to demystify masking in After Effects and provide a comprehensive guide on getting started. Whether a beginner or an experienced user, you'll find useful tips, tricks, and a creative alternative to masking that will take your skills to the next level. So let's dive in and discover the art of masking in After Effects!

![masking in after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/after-effects-masking.JPG)

## Overview of Masking in After Effects

Masking in After Effects hides or reveals certain layer parts, such as an image or video. This is achieved through masks, paths that determine the visibility of specific layer parts. Masks are an incredibly versatile tool in Adobe After Effects, allowing users to cut out and combine elements, create professional transitions, isolate objects in photos or videos, and build shapes, among other things.

Masks in After Effects are made up of two parts: the mask and the fill. The mask controls what is visible, while the fill determines the color or image used to fill the masked area.

By default, when a mask is created, it is set to "inverted," meaning the masked area is visible, and the rest is hidden. However, this can easily be changed by pressing "M" to access the mask settings in the timeline and selecting the invert checkmark. Alternatively, the mode can be changed to subtract.

Overall, masks are an essential tool in After Effects, and it's worth taking the time to learn as much as possible about them. The possibilities are endless, and mastering masks can greatly enhance your projects.
