It helps to indulge the audience with your content and show the after and before transitions. You can try this with any object or any character. But first, let's figure out the requirements for rotating effects.

## Part 2\. Prerequisites to Make a Rotating Video Effect

You will need a few items to create a rotating transition video. First, look at the fundamental priorities for creating this feature.

### The Subject Matters

To record a successful rotating video, you need a person or a subject to perform in front of the camera. It can be a model hired by a brand, a social influencer, or maybe it's you. Keep in mind the following things before recording:

* The person should get two different costumes.
* All the actions need to be rehearsed before shooting
* Show affinity and control of the camera.

![character of the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/rotating-video-effect-2.png)

### Shotting Equipment

To record a professional video, you need a good camera. You can use a smartphone to record this footage. There is no need to have a tripod stand or any gear to hold the camera because the camera will be in a rotating position, the same as the subject's hand.

For this, you need a filmmaker or any person living with you. Just give instructions as shown below to him to record a perfect video for yourself:

* Record the whole video in just one direction.
* Don't **shake** the camera because it gives blurry footage.
* Ensure to **focus** on the subject during recording.
* Don't **zoom** in or out while recording the video.
* Keep the subject in the **middle** of the frame during the recording process.
* The **hand rotation** timing is the same as the camera's rotation.

**Note:** Ensure to record one footage multiple times so that you can choose the perfect one later for editing.

![smartphone for filming](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/rotating-video-effect-3.png)

### Filming of the First Footage

To make the footage for the rotating video illusion, we have to record it at least twice to get crystal clear and high-resolution results. Therefore, ensure that we have camera movement in the same direction during all recording times.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You can film the video either in the vertical format of the camera or in horizontal format. It all depends upon your script!

Follow the below-mentioned steps to record the first footage for the video:

* Hold the camera in a perfect format, whatever you choose.
* Let the subject stand or sit in the middle of the frame.
* The filmmaker can rotate the camera when the subject's hand rotates.
* Try your best to rotate the camera 180 degrees.
* Ensure that the camera lens faces the ground at the end of the rotation.

![filming scenes of first footage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/rotating-video-effect-4.png)

After filming the first footage for the video, it's time to record the second footage to transition between the two.

### Filming of the Second Footage

To create a second shot, you have to remember that the costume and location of the filming are different from the first footage. Follow the below steps to record it:

* The first step is to hold the camera in the same direction as the first footage.
* When editing, make sure the subject's position matches the first footage.
* Make sure the subject's hand movement is in the opposite direction from the first shot.

![filming scenes of second footage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/rotating-video-effect-5.png)

![add text behind objects by filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-1.png)

## Part 1\. What Are The Benefits of Adding Text Behind Objects in Videos?

Your videos must maintain quality to create content worthy of a huge audience. You may have a YouTube channel or be starting down the road. Then you must give this a try because

### Give a cool look

Adding text behind an object in a video looks cool! Now, your object could be a silhouette of a person or a huge skyscraper. You can add a text tile behind the object, creating the illusion. Due to this, the text will be flying in real-time.

### Show creativity

Blasting your channel with innovative and creative content is the key to building a big audience. But, of course, you can always opt for many ways to create a video showing your creativity. One of those ways is to add text behind your object.

You can create an attractive intro by adding text behind objects that captivate the viewer. It ensures that your subscribers stay tuned to your channel and your content.

### Build up a solid audience

Every day can be a real struggle if you are a daily content creator on YouTube. The audience demands good content. But your daily videos can get boring if you do not use new methods to edit your videos.

## Part 2\. What Will You Need To Add Text Behind Videos?

Now there are a few things that you will need to add text behind videos. First, take a look at the basic priorities to perform this feature.

### 1\. A Static Object Video

Adding text behind an object can be tricky if the object isn't static. For example, the effect will be ruined if an object moves around a lot in a video.

Our goal is to create a smooth text behind the video effect. And this can only be achieved if the target object remains static in the video and does not move about its position.

### 2\. A Video Editing Software - Wondershare Filmora

* You have to start by importing your video in the import library.
* From the import library, you can click on the video and drag it down below to the timeline.

![adding video to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-3.png)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Adding video to the timelines will allow you to create a workspace to edit your video.

Now let's move on to how we will add the text tile to our video.

##### Step3 Add the Text Tile

It is time to add the text tile you will animate behind the object. To do that, follow the steps mentioned as such.:

* Go to the **Titles** icon on the bar above the import library.
* A drop-down option will be available on the left side.
* Scroll down to the **Plain text**.
* Here, you can see many text tiles to add to your video.
* You can choose anyone you like.
* The most commonly used tile is the **Basic 6**.
* When you add the text tile to the timeline, you must ensure that the text is of equal length to the video.
* To do that, drag the right corner of the text tile and drag it to the right to match the length of the video.

![choose the text tile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-4.png)

##### Step4 Edit the Text Tile

After you have added the text tile you desire, you need to type in the text. For this article, we will keep it simple. We will be typing a simple statement such as "**Hello, World.**"

* Double-click the Text tile to open the settings menu.
* After the settings menu is opened, type in the text box on the import window.

You will notice changes on the main window that your text has changed.

![edit the text tile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-5.png)

* After the text appears, you can make the font look as desired.
* Look above the text window, and you will see the type of text font selected.
* Click on the drop-down option and choose whatever you like.

Let's move on to animate the text tile.

##### Step5 Animate the text tile

After adding text, it is time to animate it. This animation will decide how your text will appear behind the target object.

* First, you must open the text settings by **double-clicking** on the text tile in the timeline.
* In the settings opened in the import window, you will have to click on the animation tab in the upper left corner, aside from the **Preset**
* Now scroll down to where you will see the **Right Roll**
* Click on **Right Roll** and then click on the **OK** in the bottom right corner of the import window.

![animate the text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-6.png)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You may notice now that the text appears in front of our object. Don't worry now! We are getting there. With a few simple steps, we will see the results.

Now let us move on to the more significant part of the editing, masking the object. Again, look ahead to see how you can mask the object!

##### Step6 Mask the Object

To mask our object, we will need to be technical. We will begin by adding the same footage of the static object on our timeline. Follow the steps mentioned below:

* Drag and drop the static object footage above the timeline text. Make sure the text stays in the middle of the sandwich.

![add the main video above the text tile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-7.png)

* We will hide the video in the first track to simplify things. In addition, this will make our editing easier.
* We will have to look in the effects library to insert the masking effect.
* You can see the **Effects** icon on the bar at the top.
* Click on the **Effects**.
* You will see the search bar at the top of the import window.
* In the search bar, type in Image mask.
* Drag the **Image mask** effect on the video above the text tile.

Now the masking effect has been added. But we would have to adjust so that it stays upon our object.

* **Double-click** on the video and the settings option will open up.
* Go into the **Effects**

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You must select your target object's mask shape exactly as its shape.

* We have to mask out a building, so that we will need a vertical rectangle.

![change the shape of the image mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-8.png)

* After you have selected the shape of your object, we will need to convert it to the object's size so that it only masks the building.
* To do that, scroll down below the import window to the settings.
* Here you can see the X, Y, and width settings.
* First, move the width bar so that it matches the width of the building.

![change the width of the mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-9.png)

* Now drag the X bar until the mask is confined to the building. You would have created the mask only limited to the building.

![change the position of the mask by dragging x](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-10.png)

* Once you complete this step, click OK in the bottom right corner.
* Now un-hide the original video that you imported in the beginning.

Finally, play the video in the main play window from the beginning.

![final result of the static video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-11.gif)

After typing in the text, you will notice in the main play window that your text still appears in front of your object. Therefore, we want to take it behind the object. To do so, first, you will need to take a snapshot.

Follow the steps mentioned to take a snapshot:

* Hide the main video. You can see the Eye icon aside from your main video in the edit column on the left side of the timeline.
* Click on the Eye icon to hide the main video.
* In the **main play** window, you will notice that the screen turns black, which leaves only the text on the screen.

Now that we have taken a snapshot, we will need to import it into the timeline. Scroll below for more.

##### Step4 Add the snapshot

After taking it, your goal is to import it into the timeline. To perform this action, perform the following steps:

* Before adding the snapshot to the timeline, we must delete the main text tile.
* Then drag and drop the snapshot from the import library into the timeline above the video.
* Make sure that the snapshot is aligned well with the length of the video.
* If it is **longer** than the video, drag it from the right to match the length of the video.
* If its length is **smaller** than the video, drag it to the right to increase its length.

![adjust the length of the snapshot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-17.png)

After adding the snapshot, we will have to change its blending mode.

##### Step5 Change the blending of the snapshot

To create the effect of your text behind the video, you must alter the main text's blending mode. In this case, it will be the snapshot we took.

![adding video to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-3.png)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Adding video to the timelines will allow you to create a workspace to edit your video.

Now let's move on to how we will add the text tile to our video.

##### Step3 Add the Text Tile

It is time to add the text tile you will animate behind the object. To do that, follow the steps mentioned as such.:

* Go to the **Titles** icon on the bar above the import library.
* A drop-down option will be available on the left side.
* Scroll down to the **Plain text**.
* Here, you can see many text tiles to add to your video.
* You can choose anyone you like.
* The most commonly used tile is the **Basic 6**.
* When you add the text tile to the timeline, you must ensure that the text is of equal length to the video.
* To do that, drag the right corner of the text tile and drag it to the right to match the length of the video.

![choose the text tile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-4.png)

##### Step4 Edit the Text Tile

After you have added the text tile you desire, you need to type in the text. For this article, we will keep it simple. We will be typing a simple statement such as "**Hello, World.**"

* Double-click the Text tile to open the settings menu.
* After the settings menu is opened, type in the text box on the import window.

You will notice changes on the main window that your text has changed.

![edit the text tile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-5.png)

* After the text appears, you can make the font look as desired.
* Look above the text window, and you will see the type of text font selected.
* Click on the drop-down option and choose whatever you like.

Let's move on to animate the text tile.

##### Step5 Animate the text tile

After adding text, it is time to animate it. This animation will decide how your text will appear behind the target object.

* First, you must open the text settings by **double-clicking** on the text tile in the timeline.
* In the settings opened in the import window, you will have to click on the animation tab in the upper left corner, aside from the **Preset**
* Now scroll down to where you will see the **Right Roll**
* Click on **Right Roll** and then click on the **OK** in the bottom right corner of the import window.

![animate the text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-6.png)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You may notice now that the text appears in front of our object. Don't worry now! We are getting there. With a few simple steps, we will see the results.

Now let us move on to the more significant part of the editing, masking the object. Again, look ahead to see how you can mask the object!

##### Step6 Mask the Object

To mask our object, we will need to be technical. We will begin by adding the same footage of the static object on our timeline. Follow the steps mentioned below:

* Drag and drop the static object footage above the timeline text. Make sure the text stays in the middle of the sandwich.

![add the main video above the text tile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-7.png)

* We will hide the video in the first track to simplify things. In addition, this will make our editing easier.
* We will have to look in the effects library to insert the masking effect.
* You can see the **Effects** icon on the bar at the top.
* Click on the **Effects**.
* You will see the search bar at the top of the import window.
* In the search bar, type in Image mask.
* Drag the **Image mask** effect on the video above the text tile.

Now the masking effect has been added. But we would have to adjust so that it stays upon our object.

* **Double-click** on the video and the settings option will open up.
* Go into the **Effects**

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You must select your target object's mask shape exactly as its shape.

* We have to mask out a building, so that we will need a vertical rectangle.

![change the shape of the image mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-8.png)

* After you have selected the shape of your object, we will need to convert it to the object's size so that it only masks the building.
* To do that, scroll down below the import window to the settings.
* Here you can see the X, Y, and width settings.
* First, move the width bar so that it matches the width of the building.

![change the width of the mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-9.png)

* Now drag the X bar until the mask is confined to the building. You would have created the mask only limited to the building.

![change the position of the mask by dragging x](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-10.png)

* Once you complete this step, click OK in the bottom right corner.
* Now un-hide the original video that you imported in the beginning.

Finally, play the video in the main play window from the beginning.

![final result of the static video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-11.gif)

You have successfully created a text behind the object effect. Now that you know how to add text behind static objects let us move to learn how to add text to a video that has high contrast and a clean background.

### Add text behind a high contrast and clean background

##### Step1 Import the video into the timeline

* Import the video from the location in your PC media.

## If You Want to Add an Effect Like a VHS Overlay Free Effect to Enhance Your Videos, You Can Do It on After Effects. Read More to Learn How

The 90s generation is familiar with Video Home System video. Today, Moviemakers use VHS static overlay to give their videos an antique and vintage look.

The VHS glitch overlay has become increasingly popular as it changes the video's theme, tone, and whole look. Let's see how we can add DIY VHS overlay in after effects-

## Part 1：Step by Step DIY VHS Overlay in After Effects?

The retro "VHS Look" has become relatively trendy in recent years. The memories associated with the popular VHS trend has helped the trend make a comeback. Creating this effect in After Effects may seem to be a complicated process if you have not tried it before. But we have made it easier for you to add VHS overlay in Adobe After Effects. Follow the steps to add it in after effects-

Before you begin, download and install VHS preset if you haven't already. Remember that VHS preset only works with After Effects CC 2018 and up. So, make sure you have the recent version of After Effects or the one not older than the 2018 version.

Step 1: To create a VHS look on your video, drop any video of your choice into the project panel and give it a name, let's say, "VCR static overlay". Set the width and height to 1920 and 1080 px, respectively.

![changing composition settings on after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/changing-composition-settings-on-after-effects.jpg)

Step 2: Right-click on your video and select New Comp from Selection. Drag your video to a new composition and then go to Lumetri Color < Basic Correction. Add some contrast. You can set it to 50 or any other number of your choice. Then bring the white level down to -55.

![getting lumetri color effect to get vhs look](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/using-lumetri-color-effect-to-get-vhs-look.jpg)

Then open the Creative tab. Increase the faded film to 40\. Set sharpening to -70\. Bring vibrance to -30.

Note: Here, I changed the number to get the effect I wanted. You can change the numbers and set the values as per your requirements.

Now, click on the Curves option. Drag down the white curve and then align it with the original curve. Move the green curve up a bit and bring down the blue curve. Then comes the Vignette tab. Open it and set the number to -1.

![changing white green and blue curves on after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/changing-white-green-and-blue-curve-on-after-effects.jpg)

Step 3: Now, we will give our video a subtle RGB spit appearance. For that, we need to use the Channel Blur effect twice. First, go to Effect < Blur & Sharpen < Channel Blur. Set red blurriness to 20\. Turn on the repeat edge pixels. Then change the Blur Dimensions from horizontal and vertical to vertical.

![giving rgb split appearance to video with channel blur](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/giving-rgb-split-appearance-to-video-with-channel-blur.jpg)

Step 4: Again, go to Effect < Blur & Sharpen < Channel Blur. Set blue blurriness to 30\. Repeat the process of checking the repeat edge pixels box. Change the Blue Dimensions from horizontal and vertical to horizontal.

Step 5: Next comes giving the video artificial sharpening look using Unsharp Mask. So, go to Effect < Blur & Sharpen < Unsharp Mask. Under the Unmask Mask menu, set the amount to 100 and the radius to 10.

![using unsharp mask to give you video sharpening look](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/using-unsharp-mask-to-give-your-video-sharpening-look.jpg)

Step 6: To add a font to your video, simply search VHS font on Google. Look for the one you want to use in your video and download it. To give your video that authentic VHS-style look, we suggest downloading free VCR OSD Mono font and installing the font on your system.

Step 7: Go to Layer < New < Solid and choose any color. We chose white. Now, under Effects & Presets, search for a number. Drag it to the white solid. Choose the font VCR OSD Mono. You can change the number to time or date. You can also add time manually. Select the text tool, go to the source text, hold alt, and click on the stopwatch. Write "timeToCurrentFormat() and time will be displayed on the video. Let us say we want to see the date on the video instead of time. So, change the time to date. Drag the date to the bottom right of the video to give it the look of an old VHS tape.

If you are a beginner and want a simple VHS effect, you can follow these easy steps and create the VHS video that will transport you back to the 90s.
