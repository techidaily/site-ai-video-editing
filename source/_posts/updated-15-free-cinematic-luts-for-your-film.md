## 4 Methods to Resize a WebM File

People resize videos for many reasons, the most common one being to reduce file size. Others might be to meet a specification, or for compatibility. When you resize a video file, you reduce its file size considerably- making it load faster on devices, reduce processing time, and save a lot of space. Most people prefer watching videos that are smaller in size compared to larger ones, that’s why some social media sites like Instagram, Tiktok, etc have preferred video resolutions, so if you are a user on these sites you might want to resize your video to fit.

The biggest concern most people have about resizing videos is whether it will retain its quality, another concern is that you don’t want to crop out your video while resizing. If the format of the video is mp4, wmv, avi, etc which usually have very large size, resizing it might be a bit of a problem because the video quality will reduce a lot, but if it’s a WebM video file, you can still achieve a good video quality even after multiple compression or changing its resolution, that’s because its codecs- VP8 and VP9 were designed specifically for that, and it’s supported by all browsers.

In the course of this article, we’re assuming you already have a WebM video and you want to resize it, and still maintain its quality so you can upload on your favourite websites without any hassles. We have handpicked some proven methods to help you with that, let’s see them:

## Method 1: Resize WebM file with Wondershare Filmora

Wondershare [Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is a great video editing software that comes with a lot of features. You can easily perform basic editing techniques in a few minutes. It also comes with lots of filters to make your videos pop.

For video resizing, Filmora offers you a couple of options: First you have an option of changing the resolution just before you export your video; you also have the option of cropping your videos to your preferred size and cutting out redundant parts of your videos to save space; but the third option is what we’ll show you in this guide, because we imagine you already have your video exported and you just want to resize. You can easily do that by changing the aspect ratio and we’ll show you in a few steps:

Select your preferred aspect ratio from the list of options- 16:9 (widescreen), 4:3 (standard), 1:1 (Instagram), 9:16 (portrait). For example, if you import a 16:9 video file into Filmora, and set it to 1:1 aspect ratio then, the final output file will be 1:1, which is the perfect aspect ratio for Instagram posts.

You’ll see below that I selected 1:1 for instagram. After you are done selecting your preferred aspect ratio, hit ‘New Project’.

## Method 2: How to resize WebM file with VLC

VLC is a free and open source multimedia player. It is arguably the best media player out there and that’s for a reason- it can play almost everything without the need for any external codecs.

The playback feature is amazing but that’s not the only thing it can do. VLC outshines most other media players because of some extra features it possesses. It resizes and converts media files, downloads and adds subtitles, records screen, as well as is customizable in settings and expandable via plugins.

What we want to use in this guide is its media resizing feature, so let’s show you how you can use it in these steps:

**Step 1**: Download VLC Media player from the official VLC page and install it on your windows or Mac PC.

**Step 2**: Launch VLC after installing by double-clicking on the software.

**Step 3**: Click "Media" in the toolbar.

**Step 4**: Select "Convert / Save". You can also tap shortcut keys Ctrl + R to quickly open a new window.

## Method 2: How to resize WebM file with VLC

VLC is a free and open source multimedia player. It is arguably the best media player out there and that’s for a reason- it can play almost everything without the need for any external codecs.

Filmora is a versatile desktop software that offers multiple AI and other features. It keeps upgrading its interface and has recently launched its V13 update. This update brought many features, and here are some of its new and existing ones:

* [**AI Image:**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) Whether it is a slideshow or video, both are incomplete without graphical reference. With Filmora’s AI, you can generate a desired picture by explaining it in words. This generative AI crafts the outcome from your description in three resolutions. You can later select the one that fits your video or sharing site.

* [**Instant Mode**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**:** Why settle for dull videos when Filmora can bring life to them? You can now upload a video using its Instant Mode, and the AI will auto-edit it. It integrates suitable effects, adjusts lighting, and offers suitable templates for your videos.

* [**Screen Recorder**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**:** Without visual reference, comprehending stuff becomes 10X difficult. Create tutorials with video references using Filmora's screen recorder. It allows you to customize the display settings, microphone, and webcam settings. You can create a professional-grade video tutorial using this recorder.

* [**Green Screen**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**:** Have you ever heard of replacing a boring background with a new one? The technique uses a green screen for better results. You just need to record yourself in front of a green background and enable it. The Chroma Key functionality will auto-eliminate the background. You can later replace this background with any video or image.
