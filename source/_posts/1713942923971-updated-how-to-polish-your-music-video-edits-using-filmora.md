### How to smooth out cuts

Adding cuts in the beats is one part of the job, not the whole job. After adding these cuts, you have to smoothen them. With it, the point of interest for the audience becomes clear.

Indeed, you would not want your audience to have this experience. Head to the following techniques to understand how to smooth out video cuts

##### Technique 1: Showing multiple perspectives

This technique keeps the audience focused on the point of interest while giving them a different perspective of the scene.

Filmora offers multiple mask options to infuse effects and filters to specific parts. However, the V13 upgrade introduced an AI masking feature for improved results. By enabling this feature, you can choose to mask objects or backgrounds.

#### 4\. AI Thumbnail Creator

Thumbnails increase video views by evoking the audience's interest in seeing a video. In Filmora, you can employ the AI Thumbnail creator to auto-create thumbnails. It analyzes the best frame out of your video and chooses it as a thumbnail. You can further apply many templates to this thumbnail according to context.

## Conclusion

This article has expanded your knowledge and expertise about two powerful video editors. With **how to slow down video in After Effects**, we introduced you to the software. There is no limitation of features in either software as both bring out the best in videos.

However, we recommend Wondershare Filmora as it is a more accessible alternative. Creating a slow-mo in this software is easier and requires no effort. In addition, you can also access its built-in effects and presets for task productivity.
