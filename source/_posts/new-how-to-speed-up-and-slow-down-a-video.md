## How to Speed Up and Slow Down a Video

Speeding and slowing down the speed of a video is a marvel in the video editing world. In the older days, this feat was accomplished only by the big-budget filming industry.

This article will dive into how you can access the modern-day features available in video editing software. From these features, you can alter the speed of your video easily. However, before we get into the step-by-step guide, let's understand what fast and slow-mo videos are.

## Part 1\. What Are Fast and Slow Motion Videos?

As the name suggests, fast-motion videos are the ones that have been sped up from their average speed.

![difference between normal and fast speed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-1.gif)

Similarly, slow-motion videos are the ones that have been slowed down from their average speed. The slow-motion effect, also known as the slow-mo effect, is widespread in modern cinema.

![difference between normal speed and slow speed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-2.gif)

Now that we know what Fast and slow-motion videos are. Let's understand their applications. Or how you can use them in your videos. Scroll below to learn more!

## Part 2\. Why Should You Change the Speed of Your Videos?

The answer to this question would be that it's a personal creative decision that will allow you to make your videos more engaging.

### Fast Motion Videos

Fast-motion videos are used in many areas of filming. For example, you can speed up your videos to create a funny video or shorten its length.

The fast-motion effect has many applications, such as cooking tutorial videos. For example, the step-by-step process of a cooking tutorial can be too long to fit into a single video. Or it could also help you in cases where you want to keep the length of the video short.

The fast motion of the steps will allow the viewer to quickly grasp the whole process without watching the entire video.

### Slow Motion Videos

You can also slow down your videos to give the viewers a more detailed perspective of a scene. Or you can also create a slow-mo video that offers a general surreal vibe.

A famous example is in action films. The producers of the first **Matrix** film used the Slow-mo effect in the famous bullet dodging scene.

![famous bullet dodging scene in the matrix](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-3.png)

You may wonder how the film producers made the slow-mo effect. The technology at that time was less developed than the recent day. So, even you can create a slow-mo effect.

Before we get into the editing process, let's first understand what you will need to change the speed of your videos!

## Part 3\. What Will You Need to Change the Speed of Your Videos?

You will need the following essentials to change the speed of a video:

### 1\. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

To begin, you will need a good video editor. Wondershare Filmora is the best video editing software available. It has a very engaging system UI that allows inexperienced users to learn how to use it quickly. It also has a diverse collection of stock media. And not only that! It allows you to access reliable features to change the speed of a video.

You can change the speed of the video on Filmora by the speed adjustment panel or by the duration panel present above the timeline. It will adjust in just seconds with a few clicks. This feature makes Filmora more prior with editing tools.

### 2\. Video Clips

Well, it is evident that to change the speed of your videos, you will need video clips. But there are a few things you can keep in mind before adjusting the speed of a video.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Slowing down a video requires a shot at a higher frame rate. The greater the frame rate, the better will be the slow-mo quality. On the other hand, speeding up videos does not have a strict frame rate requirement.

## Part 4\. How Can You Change the Speed of Your Videos?

Here you will learn two ways in which you can change the speed of your videos. The two methods to change the speed of your video are mentioned:

* The speed adjustment panel.
* Duration panel settings.

Let's get started with the editing process. The first method we will look into is the Speed Adjustment panel.

### 1\. Change Speed With the Speed Adjustment Panel

The Speed Adjustment panel is the speed adjuster in the Wondershare Filmora software. This feature will give you a drag bar to adjust the speed of your video.

You can move the bar to the right to increase the speed of your video. Similarly, you can move it to the left to decrease the rate.

But before we use this feature, we will need to download the Filmora video editing software. So please scroll below to learn how to download it!

##### Step1 Download Filmora

First and foremost, you must have access to Filmora. For this, download Wondershare Filmora. Then, activate this app or software on your PC.

##### Step2 Import The Video Files

The next step after downloading Filmora is to import your video clips. To accomplish this, follow the steps outlined below:

* Locate and select the **Import** icon on the top left side of the Filmora Home Interface.
* It takes you to your computer's library.
* Select the videos to be edited and then click **OK**.

![wondershare filmora importing video clips from pc directory](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-5.png)

You can also import the files by another method. After you have opened Filmora, you can restore the Filmora Window size and import by dragging and dropping the clips:

* **Drag** the cursor to select the video clips you want.
* Then, drop them in the Filmora import window.

![import video clips by drag and drop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-6.png)

Filmora supports various formats for your video clips. They include the **Mp4**,   **AVI**, **MOV**, **GIFs,** and more.

After you have imported your video clips, add them to the timeline as shown below!

##### Step3 Add The Video Clips to The Timeline

After you've imported clips in the Import window, drag them onto the timeline. Follow the steps outlined below to accomplish this:

* **Drag** the clips into the import window and select them.
* Then, **insert** them into the timeline.

![wondershare filmora adding clips to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-7.png)

Now that we have our video clips in the timeline, we can start adjusting the speed.

##### Step4 Open the Speed Adjustment Panel

The speed adjustment panel, or the Uniform Speed, is the feature of Filmora that allows you to change the speed of your video. For example, to open the Unifrom Speed panel, do as follows:

* **Double-click** on the video clip.
* In the **pop-up** column, scroll down till you see the **Unifrom Speed** option and click on it.
* The speed controls will be shown in the import window.

![wondershare filmora unifrom speed tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-8.png)

In the speed control panel, you can see the speed adjuster slider. A number will usually mark this at the end. This number tells you the current speed your video is calibrated in and how fast or slow the motion effects will be.

**1.00** is always the average speed. **0.5** being half and **2.00** being double the average speed. To control the speed through the slider, you will need to do the following:

* **To increase the speed:** Type in the number you want your rate to be. Or, drag the slider to the right as you wish.
* **To decrease the speed:** Type in a number less than the standard 1.00, or you can drag the slider to the left as you wish.

The number of your speed can be an inconvenience if you have no prior experience. Instead, render the video and play it from the beginning with the changes that you made. It gives you a better idea of the speed of your video.

![wondershare filmoa opening the speed adjustment panel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-9.png)

##### Step5 Detach The Audio

The corresponding audio also gets affected when you slow down or speed up a video. In this scenario, you can also choose to detach the audio beforehand. It allows you to maintain the original playback speed. To detach the audio, follow the steps as mentioned:

* **Right-click** on the video clip.

It will create an audio file in a separate audio tab in the timeline. You can adjust this audio according to your liking. You can edit the detached audio by:

* **Double-click** on the audio file.
* A settings menu will open in the import window.
* Adjust the **Fade** options for your Audio.
* Drag the **Fade out** slider to the right to Fade out your Audio.
* To Fade in your Audio, drag the **Fade in** slider to the right.

![wondershare filmora adjusting detached audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-11.png)

You can also remove the background noise and the pitch of the audio if you want. You can also replace the video's original audio with a new one. Click on the audio file and press **Del** on the keyboard to delete it. To add new audio, do as mentioned ahead:

* Click on The **Audio** icon above the import window.
* Browse The Audio that matches the vibe of your video.
* Drag and drop it below your video clip.

![wondershare filmora adding custom audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-12.png)

Doing so would have created alternate audio for your video. Play the video from the start and confirm your changes.

##### Step6 Save Your Project

These were the methods by which you can change the speed of your video using the Speed Adjustment panel. Now let's move on to the following method to adjust the speed via the Duration panel.

### 2\. Change Speed via the Duration Panel

The duration panel is one the most valuable features of Wondershare Filmora as it allows you to change the video speed by duration adjustment.

This feature is typically helpful when you have a space between video clips and want to fill it. By measuring the time between the two clips, you can adjust the duration of your video.

It will ultimately hasten the speed of your video. The hastening in rate will depend upon the gap. The smaller the gap, the faster the video will be. Similarly, the greater the gap is, the longer the video will be.

Apart from the Speed Adjustment Panel, the Duration Panel has the advantage of editing the speed of your video by simply typing in the text.

##### Step1 Import Video Clips to Timeline

After downloading Filmora, the next step is importing your video clips. To do so, follow the steps outlined below:

* Locate and click the **Import** icon in the upper left corner of the Filmora Home Interface.
* Choose the videos to be edited, then click **OK**.

Now that you have imported files into Filmora, you can add them to the Timeline. Notice the steps mentioned ahead:

* Drag the clips into the import window and select them.
* Then, insert them into the timeline.

You can begin the editing process now that the clips are in the timeline.

##### Step2 Open The Duration Panel

The Duration Panel comes attached to the **Unifrom Speed Panel**. To access the Duration Panel, follow the steps ahead:

* **Right-click** on the video clip.
* In the pop column, scroll below to **Unifrom Speed**.

It will open the uniform speed panel in the import window. Below the speed of the controls, you can notice The Duration Panel.

##### Step3 Change The Speed of The Video

In The Duration Panel, you can see the average speed of your video clip. Now, if you want to **reduce** the speed of your video, you have to **increase** the duration of your video. Similarly, if you're going to **increase** the speed of your video, you would have to **decrease** the duration.

##### Slow Down The Video

To slow down the video clip, follow the steps mentioned below:

* In The Duration Panel, **Increase** the time of the video.
* Type in a number bigger than the normal value

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** If the average speed of the video is **00:01:00:00,** increasing the value of the duration to **00:02:00:00** will reduce the speed of your video by half.

![wondershare filmora adjusting slowing down the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-17.png)

##### Speed Up The Video

To increase the speed of your video, follow as guided ahead:

* In The Duration Panel, **decrease** the time of the video.

This method is used to focus attention on certain parts of your video, which has a huge impact on your editing. It provides just the right amount of zing to keep your audience interested and excited about your presentation.

### Examples of Speed Ramping

The properties section allows you to designate which portions of the timeline are affected by the ramp, as well as change factors like the curve type and bias.

### Steps To Use Speed Ramping In Premiere Pro

Follow the below-mentioned steps to learn how to use speed ramping in premiere pro:

* Download and install Adobe Premiere Pro. Once installed, launch the application.
* Create a new project in Premiere by clicking the New Project button. After that, import the film that you want to speed ramp. It is the simplest and most straightforward method of importing film into Premiere to just click and drag the clip into the project window.
* Before commencing any work with speed, click and drag the video track in the timeline to make it taller by increasing the height of the track. This will guarantee that you can see the speed ramp as you go to the next stages.
* To create a sequence if you don't already have one, drag a clip into the timeline and drop it where you want it to appear. Using the clip's parameters, Premiere will automatically generate a sequence with the necessary settings.
* Decide when you want to apply the speed ramp and mark the spot on the screen where you will do so. The key to a pleasant speed ramp is movement, so choose a time when the environment is very active. You can specify in and out points, cut the clip with "Command+K," or divide the clip into parts using the razor blade tool (which is accessible through the "Command+K" shortcut).
* Keyframes will be created at this point. It's first and foremost important that the keyframes be clearly visible. Access the proper view by selecting "Show Clip Keyframes" from the context menu when you right-click on your clip.
* Another drop-down option will appear, from which you'll choose "Time Remapping" and then press the "Enter" key.
* Select "Speed" from the drop-down menu.
* To create a keyframe, choose the pen from the toolbar (or just use the "P" key on your keyboard) and click on the white line running across the video track. If you wish to make a speed ramp, you'll need at least two keyframes: one to indicate where the speed ramp should begin and another to indicate where it should terminate.
* If you wish to create more sophisticated speed ramps, you may do so by including more keyframes in your animation.
* Switch back to the selection tool when you've finished placing your keyframes. "V" is the shortcut key for this.
* Now comes the critical moment: it's time to change the speed. This is a task that Premiere Pro makes rather simple. The only thing you have to do now is click on the white line between the keyframes you have created and drag it either up or down, depending on your preference for speed or slowness.
* It's not finished yet; we still need to smooth it out a little more. With the selection tool selected, click and drag one of the keyframe markers to the other side of the screen. The number of frames across which the speed shift will occur will be stretched out as a result of this. The longer and more gradual the speed ramp will be, the greater the distance between the two sides of the keyframe indication is separated.
* Complete the process with the other keyframe, and your speed ramp will be complete!

## Techniques to Make Speed Ramping Smooth

In this section, we will be viewing some advanced time remapping features of Adobe Premiere Pro, which are as follows.

### Keyframe Interpolation

When creating a speed ramp, keyframes are used to indicate the beginning and finishing points of the speed shift. However, there are a number of methods in which Premiere may transport the clip from point A to point B.

In the video industry, filling in the data between the two locations is known as keyframe interpolation.

* Simply dragging to divide a keyframe, like in the previous example, results in an equitable speed increase between the keyframes in the animation. Linear interpolation is the term used to describe this process.
* Instead of using Bezier Interpolation, you may utilize it to produce a smoother, more natural speed ramp. With Bezier Interpolation, the pace at which the speed increases will likewise accelerate, giving the effect of a more pronounced ramp.
* To build an S-curve shape, choose a keyframe and drag the Bezier handles to the desired position. Make adjustments until you are satisfied with the outcome.

### Speed Ramp Transition

Speed ramp transitions are easy to make and may be utilized to add visual interest to a wide range of video genres. This effect is achieved by boosting the clip speed at the end of a clip before transitioning into a cut.

* In the second clip, the tempo is abruptly boosted and subsequently decreased to provide a smooth transition between situations. It may symbolize the passage of time, a character's perplexity, or simply add flair to a commercial film.
* Using Premiere Pro, create a ramp-up at the end of your first clip and a ramp-down at the start of your second clip. The speed rubber band will be curved like a bell curve across the two clips when finished.

Adding speed ramps to films in Premiere Pro may improve the usefulness and looks of a variety of movies, from narrative features to social media posts. In Premiere, you may easily create and adjust speed duration directly in the timeline to meet any needs.

This effect may be used for a number of reasons, including clip transitions, speeding up a clip to make it shorter, and slowing down a clip to make it longer. Speed ramping may be used with a number of various effects.

According to the business, Adobe Premiere Pro is one of the most widely used video editing products on the market today. The ability to alter the speed of individual clips is one of Premiere Pro's most important capabilities.

## What is Speed Ramping?

A speed ramp is used to gradually increase the speed of a video clip as it accelerates or decelerates. It is guaranteed that a smooth transition between two separate speeds will take place. The method is crucial in changing the tempo of the film and, as a consequence, creating a dramatic impression. The film's required velocity is achieved by the employment of super-fast visual effects.

A speed ramp, as opposed to a rapid shift in speed, provides for a more smooth transition between two drastically differing speeds. This method is used to focus attention on certain parts of your video, which has a huge impact on your editing. It provides just the right amount of zing to keep your audience interested and excited about your presentation.

### Examples of Speed Ramping

It works especially well when utilized to focus the viewer's attention on a certain moment or action in your videos, such as a tough jump or an impending bullet. Another name for this approach speeds ramping (sometimes known as time remapping). It may also be used to create a visually pleasing transition between two clips or pictures inside a single movie.

You may also use Speed Ramping to alter the runtime of your video to fit the time limits of other social media sites, such as Instagram and Vine. If you just have 30 seconds to deliver your video, the following are the two most common places where people apply speed ramping techniques:

Assume you are shooting a person walking and want the clip to play in slow motion so that viewers can clearly see the person's face. In this scenario, speed ramping is precisely what you need since it enables you to do precisely that.

Do you remember the famous movie “The Matrix” scene, when Neo dodges the bullets? It's not some typical scene; it’s a pretty good example of speed ramping.

## How to Create Speed Ramping/Time Remapping in Premiere Pro?

### Steps To Use Speed Ramping In Premiere Pro

Follow the below-mentioned steps to learn how to use speed ramping in premiere pro:

* Download and install Adobe Premiere Pro. Once installed, launch the application.
* Create a new project in Premiere by clicking the New Project button. After that, import the film that you want to speed ramp. It is the simplest and most straightforward method of importing film into Premiere to just click and drag the clip into the project window.
* Before commencing any work with speed, click and drag the video track in the timeline to make it taller by increasing the height of the track. This will guarantee that you can see the speed ramp as you go to the next stages.
* To create a sequence if you don't already have one, drag a clip into the timeline and drop it where you want it to appear. Using the clip's parameters, Premiere will automatically generate a sequence with the necessary settings.
* Decide when you want to apply the speed ramp and mark the spot on the screen where you will do so. The key to a pleasant speed ramp is movement, so choose a time when the environment is very active. You can specify in and out points, cut the clip with "Command+K," or divide the clip into parts using the razor blade tool (which is accessible through the "Command+K" shortcut).
* Keyframes will be created at this point. It's first and foremost important that the keyframes be clearly visible. Access the proper view by selecting "Show Clip Keyframes" from the context menu when you right-click on your clip.
* Another drop-down option will appear, from which you'll choose "Time Remapping" and then press the "Enter" key.
* Select "Speed" from the drop-down menu.
* To create a keyframe, choose the pen from the toolbar (or just use the "P" key on your keyboard) and click on the white line running across the video track. If you wish to make a speed ramp, you'll need at least two keyframes: one to indicate where the speed ramp should begin and another to indicate where it should terminate.
* If you wish to create more sophisticated speed ramps, you may do so by including more keyframes in your animation.
* Switch back to the selection tool when you've finished placing your keyframes. "V" is the shortcut key for this.
* Now comes the critical moment: it's time to change the speed. This is a task that Premiere Pro makes rather simple. The only thing you have to do now is click on the white line between the keyframes you have created and drag it either up or down, depending on your preference for speed or slowness.
* It's not finished yet; we still need to smooth it out a little more. With the selection tool selected, click and drag one of the keyframe markers to the other side of the screen. The number of frames across which the speed shift will occur will be stretched out as a result of this. The longer and more gradual the speed ramp will be, the greater the distance between the two sides of the keyframe indication is separated.
* Complete the process with the other keyframe, and your speed ramp will be complete!

## Techniques to Make Speed Ramping Smooth

In this section, we will be viewing some advanced time remapping features of Adobe Premiere Pro, which are as follows.

### Keyframe Interpolation

When creating a speed ramp, keyframes are used to indicate the beginning and finishing points of the speed shift. However, there are a number of methods in which Premiere may transport the clip from point A to point B.

In the video industry, filling in the data between the two locations is known as keyframe interpolation.

* Simply dragging to divide a keyframe, like in the previous example, results in an equitable speed increase between the keyframes in the animation. Linear interpolation is the term used to describe this process.
* Instead of using Bezier Interpolation, you may utilize it to produce a smoother, more natural speed ramp. With Bezier Interpolation, the pace at which the speed increases will likewise accelerate, giving the effect of a more pronounced ramp.
* To build an S-curve shape, choose a keyframe and drag the Bezier handles to the desired position. Make adjustments until you are satisfied with the outcome.

### Speed Ramp Transition

Speed ramp transitions are easy to make and may be utilized to add visual interest to a wide range of video genres. This effect is achieved by boosting the clip speed at the end of a clip before transitioning into a cut.

* In the second clip, the tempo is abruptly boosted and subsequently decreased to provide a smooth transition between situations. It may symbolize the passage of time, a character's perplexity, or simply add flair to a commercial film.
* Using Premiere Pro, create a ramp-up at the end of your first clip and a ramp-down at the start of your second clip. The speed rubber band will be curved like a bell curve across the two clips when finished.

Adding speed ramps to films in Premiere Pro may improve the usefulness and looks of a variety of movies, from narrative features to social media posts. In Premiere, you may easily create and adjust speed duration directly in the timeline to meet any needs.
