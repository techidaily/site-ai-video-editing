## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **How to Insert Audio to Video Clip in Da Vinci Resolve?**

There may be times that your video may require the addition of music, background audio, or wooshing sounds.

To begin, open Resolve and import your audio clip:

1. Navigate to the "Edit" page.
2. Select the tab "Media Pool."
3. Right-click and choose "Import Media" or push "Ctrl + i."
4. Pick your audio clip and browse to your location.
5. Select "Open."

The audio clip is now imported into the "Media Pool." After that, you'll need to figure out which part of the audio track you'll use.

Double-click the audio clip to play it. In the "Source Viewer," it will appear.

Set the needed audio parts in (press I) and out (press O). Alternatively, if you need the entire soundtrack, there's no need to set in and out.

Drag & drop the audio track (from the media pool) underneath the video you want to use. It will then add the sound file with the selected portion of the audio. You can now modify the audio to match the visual.

### **How to Link Your Audio and Video in DaVinci Resolve?**

It's best to link the soundtrack (music, sound effect, or background music) to the relevant video once you've adjusted the audio file.

Here's how to connect audio and video in a timeline:

1. Press "Ctrl" or "Cmd" to toggle both the video and audio.
2. Right-click and choose "Link Clips." You may also use the shortcuts “Ctrl + Alt + L" or "Option + Command + L."
3. The sound and visual are now both connected.

Thus, you can rest guaranteed that the audio will follow your movie wherever it goes. There will be no issues with out-of-sync!

### **How Do You Link Many Audio and Video Files Together in DaVinci Resolve?**

Several video and audio segments can be linked together to form a single one. You can rearrange them anywhere in the timeline, and they will not be out of sync.

This is how you connect many clips:

1. By holding down the "Ctrl" or "Cmd" key, you can choose all the video and audio clips you want.
2. Right-click and choose "Link Clips." You may also use the shortcut keys "Ctrl + Alt + L" or "Option + Command + L".
3. Now, all your video or audio files are linked together.

### **Is Any Music Available to Use for Editing?**

Understanding copyright law can be complicated. It's best to use free music for video editing if you don't want to be accused of copyright violation.

Additionally, you can purchase two licenses to avoid copyright concerns. The producer controls the synchronization license, and the master license to use the song recording is managed by the publishing company.

If you don't want to go into legal trouble, the only thing you need to remember is never to utilize any illegal video.

### **Is There Any Free Music in DaVinci Resolve?**

DaVinci Resolve does not include any free music; however, it does include royalty-free sound effects noise. To get started, you can download and install the available sound package.

### **What Software Provides Free Music?**

The Audio Collection in Wondershare Filmora has over 50 royalty-free audio tracks for videos, with more to come.

For video production, you can acquire free background music.

In addition, Filmora has 25 sound effects, including animal sounds, video game sounds, and beeps. With Filmora, you may use more advanced editing features like keyframing, background noise elimination, cut, trim, crop, PIP effects, green-screen effects, and more to add free-choice music to your film.

Filmora will enhance the appeal of your video by giving free background music. You may also tweak the background sound, such as speeding up and slowing down, fade-in and fade-out.

### 02How can I record a slide show PowerPoint?

There are a few ways to record a slide show PowerPoint, including using the PowerPoint recording option. If you are using PowerPoint, you should be able to find the option in your presentation settings. But if you are not fond of trying it out, you can use **Filmora.** This is one of the best video editing tools available, with some exclusive features. This has the simplest interface, and users can get their presentation recorded needs catered for sure.

### 03How can I use my recorded slideshows in different presentations?

There are many ways to do this. You could export the slideshow as a .mp4 file and then import it into another presentation for reuse. You could also just load the slideshow on your laptop's screen and use it that way instead of having a projector or screen. If you wish to integrate some effects into it, you can try out **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**, the ultimate video editing tool available for people around.

### 04How long does it take to create a single recording slide show PowerPoint?

It takes a lot of time and effort to create a single recording slide show PowerPoint. This is because of the time it takes to go through all the slides and find the right images.

It is best if you start by finding out what you want to say with your presentation. Then, select images that support your message, and finally, create slides that tell your story.

This process will save a lot of time and effort when it comes to creating slide shows for presentations.

### 05How long can a recording slide show PowerPoint be recorded?

The length of a PowerPoint recording is determined by the length of the slide show. The default setting for the length of the slide show is 60 minutes, but it can be changed to any duration.

## **●** Ending Thoughts **→**

**●** Recorded slide show presentations are best to consider when one wishes to save the efforts of creating the same presentation again and again.

**●** Filmora is one of the best video editing tools available to users for doing the editing in the recorded slideshow presentation if needed.

**●** Recording a slideshow is relatively an easy task if one is aware of the right steps. But if there is a lack of knowledge, they will not be able to do it.
