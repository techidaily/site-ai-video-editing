## Troubleshooting Problems with KMPlayer if Rotate Video Not Working

Despite the fact that you've seen that KMPlayer can rotate and edit videos, there are some disadvantages to using this particular video player. The following are some of the most frequently encountered issues when using KMPlayer to rotate video.

* After rotating a video, the video appears without a black bar, which may be irritating to some of you who are used to seeing black bars. In addition, there is no workaround for this because it is the default setting of the software.
* You may occasionally receive an error message such as "class not registered," which will cause your videos to be closed while you are watching them.
* Additionally, the screen may turn blue.
* The message "Login required" appears from time to time, which is a source of considerable irritation.
* It is also not uncommon to see that some portions of a media file are able to run while other portions of the same media file are unable to run.

If we talk about reliable and affordable alternatives to KM Player, Wonder Share Filmora is the best alternative for rotating videos.

Despite the fact that it is one of the most user-friendly pieces of software currently available, this video spinning software achieves its goal without sacrificing image quality in the process.

Users have been experiencing difficulties while editing films on the platform, according to the company, and the most recent update to Filmora includes a new manual rotation option in the video editing interface, which the company claims will alleviate this issue.
