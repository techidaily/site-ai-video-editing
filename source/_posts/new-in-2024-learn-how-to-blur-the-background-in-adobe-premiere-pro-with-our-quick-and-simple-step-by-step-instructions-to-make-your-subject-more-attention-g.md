The best thing about the software is that you can quickly blur the background of your footage to add a bit of depth and interest, as well as to make your subject stand out more.

To make things simpler for you, we’ve compiled this comprehensive guide to walk you through the step-by-step process of **how to blur the background in Premiere Pro** so that you notice a big difference in your videos!

## Part 1\. Why Do You Need To Blur The Video Background?

The blurred background effect is a useful technique used by many professionals to create a focus on the element in the video and remove any distortions. By doing so, they add emphasis on the most important on-screen subject and make it pop on the screen.

You may need to blur the video background for several reasons. Perhaps you're recording a tutorial and want to add focus on one element, or maybe you're filming a scene in a crowded public place and wish to minimize distractions in your video.

Blurring the BG can also be a way to add a creative touch to your video or make them more immersive, polished, and professional.

## Part 2\. How To Blur Your Background In Premiere Pro?

Below, we’ve provided a step-by-step guide to help you **blur the background in Premiere Pro:**

Step1 In the first step, open a browser and visit the [Adobe Premiere Elements](https://www.adobe.com/in/products/elements-family/premiere-elements/download-trial/try.html) download page. Log in with your Adobe ID or [create a new one](https://helpx.adobe.com/in/manage-account.html#CreateanAdobeID). Choose the platform and language, and click **“Download”** to get the installation file.

Click the downloaded installer to install the software and launch it. Now, click the **“File”** option from the top toolbar and select **“Import”** to open the **File Explorer** window. Locate your video footage and click **“Open”** to import it to Adobe Premiere.

![importing file to premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/importing-file-to-premiere-pro.png)

Step2 In the next step, click the **“Window”** option from the top toolbar and select **“Effects”** from the drop-down menu to open the **“Effects Panel.”**

In the Effects Panel, type **“Blur”** in the search bar and scroll down to find the **“Gaussian Blur”** effect. Drag and drop the effect on the clip in the timeline to apply.

Step3 Now, click **“Window”** in the top toolbar and select **“Effect Controls”** to open its panel. Scroll down to **“Gaussian Effect”** in the panel and increase the blurriness amount.

Step5 Checkmark the **“Inverted”** option under the **Mask Expansion** header in the **Effects Control Panel** to make your background blurry. Click the **“Play”** icon to preview your video and if you find any hard edges around the subject, click **“Mask”** and choose the selection tool.

Step6 If your subject moves around in some parts, click the toggle next to **“Mask Path”** to create keyframes. Now, move through the timeline and adjust the mask on the subject to make a professional-looking video.

**Frame blending** is a video editing technique used to create smooth transitions between two video frames. This process is often used to create special effects or transition between two different video clips. Frame blending can be done manually or with the help of software.

When **frame blending** is done manually, the editor will take two consecutive frames and blend them. This is done by using a process called cross-fading. Cross-fading is when the first frame gradually fades out while the second frame gradually fades in. The result is a seamless transition between the two frames.

Frame blending can also be done with the help of software. Many software programs offer frame blending capabilities Like Adobe Premiere Pro and more. These software programs typically have a user interface that allows the user to select the two frames that they want to blend. The software will then perform the cross-fading process automatically.

**Frame blending** is a video editing technique used to create smooth transitions between two video frames. This process is often used to create special effects or transition between two different video clips. Frame blending can be done manually or with the help of software.

When **frame blending** is done manually, the editor will take two consecutive frames and blend them. This is done by using a process called cross-fading. Cross-fading is when the first frame gradually fades out while the second frame gradually fades in. The result is a seamless transition between the two frames.

Frame blending can also be done with the help of software. Many software programs offer frame blending capabilities Like Adobe Premiere Pro and more. These software programs typically have a user interface that allows the user to select the two frames that they want to blend. The software will then perform the cross-fading process automatically.
