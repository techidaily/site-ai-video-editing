## An Ultimate Guide on the Significance of Music in Videos and How to Choose the Right Music for Your Videos with Wondershare Filmora

No video is complete without suitable audio. Adding audio to a video is not that difficult, but choosing the right audio can be a hassle. You want something that captures the ears of the audience but, at the same time, compliments your video. The best way to do this is by adding music to your videos with [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

The following passage will guide you through everything you must consider while choosing music for your videos. But first, we'll show you how easy it is to alter your video with music using Wondershare Filmora.

## How different types of music affect your videos

You can easily change the viewer's perception using different music, even with the same visuals. The right song will elevate your video to another level and assist in relaying your feelings and emotions to the viewers. The following examples will illustrate how changing the audio changes the impression of the video.

### Example #1

Let's say you have a video of someone walking through the woods. Now without music audio, your video will be boring. You can quickly fix this by adding an upbeat song to make your video more energetic.

![adding an uplifting beat to your video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/the-power-of-music-in-videos-1.gif)

Using the same visuals, you can add a more tense and dramatic song, like from a horror movie. You have successfully changed the entire vibe of the same video from "inspiring" to "sinister." It proves the importance of the balance between audio and visuals.

![adding scary music to your video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/the-power-of-music-in-videos-2.gif)

### Example #2

For a better understanding, let's look at a movie scene we all know and love. Take the entrance scene from Avengers: Endgame. The music used by the producer aims to excite the audience while building up the hype for the upcoming battle. However, if we change the audio of this scene, we end up with a completely different set of emotions that might not go too well with the shot.

![changing the music of a movie scene](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/the-power-of-music-in-videos-3.gif)

Now that we've seen how crucial audio can be in a video, let's see how to choose the best music audio for your video.

## Tip #1: Identify the mood

As we've demonstrated before, the audio can change the entire mood of the video. The right music for any video will be the one that compliments the spirit of the visuals and relays the emotions the producer intended.

![identifying the mood of the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/the-power-of-music-in-videos-4.gif)

Rewatch your recorded clips until you know the mood portrayed by the visuals. Select music that matches the spirit of your visuals. For example, you would use different music for a sunny day compared to a cloudy day. Once you've figured out the mood and understand the emotions you want to elicit, search for audio that achieves this and balances out your visuals.

## Tip #2: Video and music style

We've already established that different styles of music complement other types of videos. So, keep the type of your video in consideration. For example, is your video fast-paced and full of action, or is it more serious in nature, like an interview or documentary?

![matching the video and audio styles](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/the-power-of-music-in-videos-5.gif)

Once you have music that matches your video style, check the audio wave. The four most common patterns are steady, ascending, descending, or furious. The audio wave will help you select the visuals that best match that audio.

![identifying the audio wave](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/the-power-of-music-in-videos-6.gif)

For example, if you're using audio with an ascending audio wave, you would use visuals that build up with the audio. The beat drop will signal the transition to reveal a powerful shot.

## Tip #3: Don't force the music

As emphasized before, your music should match your video. We all have a favorite music genre, but sometimes that may not go well with our visuals. For example, you love country music but have a video about the nightlife in the city. Using country music in a video about the town does not match well and will confuse your audience.

![adding mismatched audio to a video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/the-power-of-music-in-videos-7.gif)

To get music that best suits our video, we must be open and explore all music genres. You'll see how easy it is to scout a song that fits perfectly with your visuals. The easiest way is to choose a song that gives out the same emotions as intended by the visuals.

## Final Words

Now, you clearly understand the importance of music in videos. The right music can uplift your video into a viral sensation, while the wrong music track will turn your video into a catastrophe. Remember to review the legalities of copyright and infringement before using any music in your videos to avoid legal issues. Make sure you have permission to use the music or use royalty-free music.

## Step by Step to Cut Videos in Adobe Premiere Pro

Video editing is an essential skill in a world that has a growing focus on creative fields. And if you work with videos, knowing which clips to use and where to cut is essential in conveying your story and increasing its impact. So, if you are a beginner and want to familiarise yourself with steps and terms used in video editing, in this article, we will go through the steps you will need to cut your video file in Adobe Premiere Pro and Wondershare Filmora.

_This guide uses Adobe Premiere Pro 2022 and Wondershare Filmora X._

## How to cut video in Adobe Premiere Pro?

Once you have Adobe Premiere Pro open on your computer, follow the steps listed below.

**Step 1:** Create a new project in Premiere Pro.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-1.jpeg)

During project creation, we recommend keeping an eye on the file name set and the storage location; this can help reduce the time spent in locating the Premiere Project.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-2.jpeg)

**Step 2:** Import a video file into Premiere Pro with a double click in the marked area and choose the file from its stored location.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-3.jpeg)

**Step 3:** Double click on any imported media to activate it and send it to the Source Window.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-4.jpeg)

You can continue to import more media by double-clicking within the marked area. For better organization, users can also create **Bins**, which are folders within a Premiere Pro File that are often in use to sort out imported media.

_Users can create Bins with a right-click in the red box marked area (refer to image above)._

**Step 4:** Select either the whole clip or a part of it from the Source Window and drag it onto the Timeline.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-5.jpeg)

**Step 5:** Select the Razor Tool from the Tools Window. Now, pick the point where you want to introduce a cut and confirm with your left mouse button; this will split your video track into two parts.

Make a second cut where desired, following which you can move around the newly generated clip or delete it.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-6.jpeg)

**Tip:**You can also select the Razor Tool by pressing C on the keyboard_._

We also recommend using the _Snap in Timeline_ feature (activated with (S) on your keyboard or by choosing the magnet option), which will match your mouse pointer with the Playhead to ensure your cut will match the exact frame shown on your screen.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Some more tips for Adobe Premiere Pro:**

1. Using the I and O keys on your keyboard while playing a video in the Source Window will allow you to set an **In Point**and an **Out Point.** These markers will allow you to move a specific part of your video file into the Timeline, thus, reducing the amount of time spent making the right cut.

_We have tagged the Mark In and Mark Out buttons with a Green Box in the image below._

1. Clicking on the Step Frame Buttons \[marked in Yellow\] will also help increase the accuracy of your cut by allowing you to select the exact moment you desire.
1. You can also mark a Point of Interest in your video file with the help of Markers in Premiere Pro. These afford you the ability to come back to the moment at a later time and see why it interested you in the first place, as editing sessions can often take hours at an end.

For Win 7 or later (64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For macOS 10.14 or later

**Note:** If you don’t have Wondershare Filmora installed, you can get the video editor by visiting its [official website](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Once the setup program download completes, execute it and begin the installation process.

Once you have the editing software open, follow the steps listed below.

**Step 1:** Import a video file by clicking on the import window.

The default project setting for Filmora X is 1920x1080 at 25 frames per second. Users can change this to match their video file by going into Project Settings under the File tab or by accepting the automatic prompt that appears when dragging the video file onto the Timeline.

**Note:** If you have a PC with weak hardware, Wondershare Filmora gives you the option to create Video Proxies that will reduce the load on your computer by creating smaller clips that are lower in size, resulting in a smoother and faster experience. You can also do this in Premiere Pro, but Filmora does it for you automatically once given permission.

**Step 2:** Drag the video file onto the Timeline to begin previewing it in the Playback Window and commence editing operations.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-9.jpeg)

**Step 3:** Locate where you want to cut in the video file and click on the orange scissors option to split the video file.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-10.jpeg)

**Tip:** You can also use the keyboard shortcut (CTRL+B) to cut without using a mouse click, in case you make use of a trackpad while editing.

The Bottom Line

As said earlier, knowing where to cut is essential in improving the feel of your video, and we hope this guide showed you exactly how to perform the actions to create your best project. If you are a beginner, the simplistic approach of Wondershare Filmora will be more welcoming and easier to navigate. In addition, the software is also free to download, with added features that you can activate by paying a monthly, yearly, or one-time fee. Adobe Premiere Pro is an option worth considering if you plan on using third-party plugins and other applications from the Creative Cloud Suite.

During project creation, we recommend keeping an eye on the file name set and the storage location; this can help reduce the time spent in locating the Premiere Project.

**Step 2:** Import a video file into Premiere Pro with a double click in the marked area and choose the file from its stored location.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-3.jpeg)

**Step 3:** Double click on any imported media to activate it and send it to the Source Window.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-4.jpeg)

You can continue to import more media by double-clicking within the marked area. For better organization, users can also create **Bins**, which are folders within a Premiere Pro File that are often in use to sort out imported media.

_Users can create Bins with a right-click in the red box marked area (refer to image above)._

**Step 4:** Select either the whole clip or a part of it from the Source Window and drag it onto the Timeline.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-5.jpeg)

**Step 5:** Select the Razor Tool from the Tools Window. Now, pick the point where you want to introduce a cut and confirm with your left mouse button; this will split your video track into two parts.

Make a second cut where desired, following which you can move around the newly generated clip or delete it.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-6.jpeg)

**Tip:**You can also select the Razor Tool by pressing C on the keyboard_._

We also recommend using the _Snap in Timeline_ feature (activated with (S) on your keyboard or by choosing the magnet option), which will match your mouse pointer with the Playhead to ensure your cut will match the exact frame shown on your screen.

**Some more tips for Adobe Premiere Pro:**

1. Using the I and O keys on your keyboard while playing a video in the Source Window will allow you to set an **In Point**and an **Out Point.** These markers will allow you to move a specific part of your video file into the Timeline, thus, reducing the amount of time spent making the right cut.
