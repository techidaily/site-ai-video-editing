## This Is the Method Employed During Every Evening Weather Broadcast: The Newscaster Is Standing in Front of a Blank Screen, but the Viewers at Home See a Weather Map

Chroma key with gimp green screen is the method by which photographers (and videographers) use a monochromatic backdrop, then replace the blue or green "screen" with a virtual background. This is the method employed during every evening weather broadcast: the newscaster is standing in front of a blank screen, but the viewers at home see a weather map.

Green screen Chroma key can also be used with photography. Subjects can be photographed in front of a monochromatic screen, and a virtual background can be put behind the subject once the screen is removed. For example, a duck can be photographed in front of a green or blue tarp, which is then replaced by a photograph of a river.

## How to use green screen in gimp

If you take a picture with a solid colored background (blue or green works best), then you can have a computer program pull out the blue or green pixels and replace them with another color or a transparent layer. This process is called "chroma key" and is used in weather forecasts and other special effects. The terms "green screen" and "blue screen" also refer to the chroma key process.

These directions outlined below describe how to use GIMP to add a transparent layer and remove blue or green pixels from an image. This allows you to layer images on different backgrounds or use pictures as Sprites in Scratch or Greenfoot.

Brief outline of process:

1. Start GIMP
2. Open the picture file.
3. Create an "Alpha Channel" (Transparent Pixels)
4. Select "Like Colored Pixels" (Click on the Green or Blue background)
5. Control->K to delete the pixels and reveal the Transparent background.
6. Save the picture as a .gif file. (Not .jpg!)

Detailed Directions:

1. Start GIMP: (The "Gnu Image Manipulation Program")
2. Click the "K" menu
3. Select "Graphics"
4. Select "GIMP Image Editor"

Note about the GIMP:

Most computer applications run in one window. GIMP will run different windows for each function or object you are working with. (Separate windows for paintbrush menus, images, backgrounds, etc . . .)

1. Select "File-> Open"
2. Navigate to your File Area and select a chroma key picture
3. Once your picture opens, add the "Alpha Channel"  
a. Select "Layer" from the picture menu bar  
b. Select “Transparency”  
c. Select "Add Alpha Channel"
4. Click the "Select Region by Color" icon.
5. Click once on the green or blue color in the background.
6. Press "Control -> K" on the keyboard to delete the colors. The background will appear as a gray checkerboard pattern.
7. Repeat the click and "Control-K" process to remove the background colors.
8. Once the background colors are removed, save the picture:  
a. Select "File-Save As" from the menu bar.  
b. Type "LastnamePicture.gif" as the filename.
9. Select "Convert to Indexed" - Click Export
10. Click “OK”
11. the picture should save.
12. You can now use this picture in Scratch for a sprite, or in other graphics projects to combine with backgrounds.

### Paint.Net

Paint.net is a free and very capable image editing software for Windows. Great alternative to Photoshop for people that do not need all the stuff PS offers.

In order to handle multiple images easily, Paint.NET uses a tabbed document interface. The tabs display a live thumbnail of the image instead of a text description. This makes navigation very simple and fast. Extensive work has gone into making Paint.NET the fastest image editor available. Whether you have a netbook with a power-conscious Atom CPU, or a Dual Intel Xeon workstation with 16+ blazingly fast processing cores, you can expect Paint.NET to start up quickly and be responsive to every mouse click.

Key Features

* ****Performance**

Extensive work has gone into making Paint.NET the fastest image editor available. Whether you have a netbook with a power-conscious Atom CPU, or a Dual Intel Xeon workstation with 16+ blazingly fast processing cores, you can expect Paint.NET to start up quickly and be responsive to every mouse click.

* ****Layers**

Usually only found on expensive or complicated professional software, layers form the basis for a rich image composition experience. You may think of them as a stack of transparency slides that, when viewed together at the same time, form one image.

* ****Automatically Updated**

Updates are free, and contain new features, performance improvements, and bug fixes. Upgrading to the latest version is very simple, requiring only two clicks of the mouse.

* ****Special Effects**

Many special effects are included for enhancing and perfecting your images. Everything from blurring, sharpening, red-eye removal, distortion, noise, and embossing are included. Also included is our unique 3D Rotate/Zoom effect that makes it very easy to add perspective and tilting. Adjustments are also included which help you tweak an image's brightness, contrast, hue, saturation, curves, and levels. You can also convert an image to black and white, or sepia-toned.

* ****Powerful Tools**

Paint.NET includes simple tools for drawing shapes, including an easy-to-use curve tool for drawing splines or Bezier curves. The Gradient tool, new for 3.0, has been cited as an innovative improvement over similar tools provided by other software. The facilities for creating and working with selections is powerful, yet still simple enough to be picked up quickly. Other powerful tools include the Magic Wand for selecting regions of similar color, and the Clone Stamp for copying or erasing portions of an image. There is also a simple text editor, a tool for zooming, and a Recolor tool.

* ****Unlimited History**

Everybody makes mistakes, and everybody changes their mind. To accommodate this, __every_ action you perform on an image is recorded in the History window and may be undone. Once you've undone an action, you can also redo it. The length of the history is only limited by available disk space.

### Adobe Photoshop

Adobe Photoshop is the commercial image editor that set the standard in creative illustration and design work with a sophisticated, layer-based workflow and robust, professional feature set.

Over the years, Photoshop developed from a small photo editing tool to an Industry-leading software that dictates the global graphic designing and multimedia industries. With every new version, Adobe introduces in the Photoshop; the graphic designing communities wait to check out the next big leap where Photoshop can take them.

Key Features of Adobe Photoshop

* **Layers**

With Layers palette, you can draw or design various elements of your document independently in layers and stack them up as per the order of display. With this advantage, control over every single object is catered at the click of a mouse. Mistakes happen, but the effects of the mistake are limited to the part of the canvas; you can choose to work on the particular part and leave the rest of the canvas as it is. This benefit is lacking in the traditional painting method. Artists are not allowed to relax at any part of the drawing or painting once their concentration is diverted and a stroke of painting goes wrong! They are bound to change the whole canvas.

* **Selection Tools**

Photoshop’s selection tools are so handy to use that designers worldwide are addicted to the set of selection tools Photoshop offers. However, there are a bunch of competitive software and open-source software designed to give tough competition for Photoshop. Users are still stuck with Adobe’s torch bearer software due to the ease its tools provide.

* **Pen Tool**

Today, Photoshop cannot be imagined without a Pen tool. Though the pen tool, by nature, works for drawing paths along with the anchor points, the creative scope it provides is limitless. The tool is designed so flexibly that the designer can draw any shape or edit the existing shapes as good as he is using his bare hand. The amount of control we have through placing the anchor points in the right places is taken further with the three types of Anchor points that can allow you to draw and edit paths precisely.

* **Shapes**

The outlook of the shape layers in Photoshop may be limited, but the capabilities of the feature go a step further than what we assume about it. In the traditional marquee selection tools, the selection is limited to the raster process, and in many cases, the output will result in the sharp pixilated edges, which are never good looking. But the shape layers can act as an individual object within the document with its attribute to maintain the finest quality.

* **Vector Mask**

The layer masks create a masking portion of an object by using the grayscale color combination (Shades of Gray). Once the masking part is done, the area of the object under the layer mask disappears.

* **Retouching Tools**

Retouching tools are an accumulation of various tools such as Stamp tool, Pattern Stamp tool, Spot Healing tool, Healing tool, Patch tool, Redeye tool and much more. Though the numbers are more, every tool has its importance. The development of retouching tools did not happen overnight. Adobe was working hard identifying the problems of the photographers and finding the solutions for the problems from time to time.

### Affinity Photo

Affinity Photo is a professional, full-featured raster graphics editor. Working in Affinity Photo is always live and you can pan and zoom at 60fps, with live previews and non-destructive application.

Whatever your genre of choice, be it landscapes, portraits, macro or anything else, Affinity not only has an unbeatable set of tools to help you, but it’s also laid out in an intuitive way that is ideal for newcomers and those switching from other software alike. There are a series of modules, called Personas, that bring you dedicated interfaces, such as Tone Mapping, RAW Developing and even a powerful liquify interface that makes complex reshaping a breeze! Even better, you can take the full functionality of the desktop app on the road, thanks to the iPad version, which is the most powerful mobile editing solution available. With so much on offer for so little, it’s time that you incorporated Affinity Photo into your workflow and moved your photography to the next step. To get you started, we’re going to give you some great tips to get the most from this brilliant software and get you well on the way to creating your own Masterpieces.

* ****Develop RAW Files Like A Pro**

The first milestone in any photographer’s journey is unquestionably learning to shoot RAW. This image format captures even more data than JPEG and can be tweaked to create the perfect image or a solid base for further editing. To take advantage, all you need to do is open up your RAW file of choice into Affinity Photo and the Develop Persona will load up automatically. From here you can apply exposure adjustments, recover highlights and shadows and even craft a split toning effect. There’s a Curves adjustment for precision tweaks, a savvy noise reduction component and a lens correction module to combat distortion. It has everything you need for that all-important first step to brilliance.

* ****Professional Skin Retouching At The Click Of A Button**

If you shoot portraits, you’ll doubtless know about the power of frequency separation. This technique is favored by many pros to get that glossy high-end look that screams professional. While it may sound complicated, in Affinity Photo it’s as simple as going to the Photo Persona and clicking on Filters>Frequency Separation. Once you’ve done this, you can set your Gaussian Blur amount in real-time, click Apply and the software will split your shot into two layers, one with the color and one with the detail. From here, you can remove blemishes, add your own dodge and burn and tidy up colors – a game changer!

* ****Ramp Up Your Dynamic Range With Tone Mapping**

Amazingly, Affinity Photo has its very own Tone Mapping Persona with a full suite of tools to get your well on the way to high dynamic range images, whether you have a series of bracketed shots – identical photos taken at different exposures – or a single shot as we’ve used. Opening this Persona brings up a toolbar on the right-hand side with the usual exposure and enhancement tools, though also gives you access to Tone Compression, Local Contrast and detail sliders. There’s even a series of presets to get you started. Like most of Affinity, the effects can be seen in real-time and are completely reversible, meaning there’s no such thing as a permanent mistake. What we love most about the Tone Mapping Persona is the subtlety compared to others on offer, meaning you’re able to keep your shots looking natural while still getting the most from your work!

* ****Adjustments Are Plentiful And Powerful**

Adjustments refer to a series of functional layers that apply specific effects to your shots. These can be as simple as Exposure, Vibrance or Brightness and Contrast, which do what they say on the tin, all the way up to more powerful options like Gradient Maps, Channel Mixers and Color Balance for creative effects and color corrections. Because they’re layers, they can be altered at any time in your editing process and moved around as you see fit. They affect any layers below them in the Layer palette but can be set to cast an effect on only a single-pixel layer by using the brilliant Mask to Below feature. You can also stack as many Adjustments as you wish, giving you a huge amount of flexibility to fine-tune your work in any way possible.

* ****Layers Offer You The Ultimate Creative Freedom**

An editing software that doesn’t allow Layers will really set back your creative choices. Happily, Affinity Photo gives you full control over its layer system. This means that you can bring in additional elements into your scene. You can then take advantage of Affinity’s hugely powerful selection engine to select the parts you wish to cut out or scroll through the full list of Blending Modes for a more refined and creative look. To add the birds to our shot, we took one landscape and added in a shot of birds taken against a white sky. From here, it’s as easy as setting the Blending Mode to Multiply and voila, the white sky has gone. Of course, there’s no need to stop there, and you can find yourself creating in-depth composites that are truly only limited by your imagination - set yourself free!

### Pixlr

This makes your interaction with the app, over the net, is secure. Also, Pixlr does not store any copy of your images in their systems.

**Key Features**

* ****Free and Safe**

Pixlr, for now, is free. There is also no indication that the company will charge users soon. It is a legitimate site that does not engage in fraudulent activities or perpetuate any hidden charges. The images that you edit or make on Pixlr are also free for commercial use.

You do not have to open your laptop or go to your desktop for simple needs.

* ****Spot heal**

Super useful, the spot heal tool can help remove scratches or blemishes by simply clicking on the area. Additional options: Besides size of brush, you have a choice of Pixlr choosing to blend the area with nearby area values or generate a pattern. Generally, you will only want to choose a pattern if you’re blending an area that has a pattern (e.g., a chain-link fence).

* ****Dodge**

Use the dodge tool to lighten specific areas. Note that this is a tool that deals with contrast (light vs. dark) and not color, although color may sometimes appear to change based on your lightening. Additional options: You can change brush size and exposure settings. You can also choose to focus your lightening on shadows, midtones, or highlights.

* ****Sponge**

The sponge tool enhances or sops up color, depending on your settings. It’s a great tool for saturating or desaturating specific areas of an image. Additional options: You can change the brush size and brush strength, but the most important setting is whether you want to saturate (increase) or desaturate (decrease) coloring.

## Conclusion

When choosing an object for use in chroma key, it is important to verify the background "screen" color does not exist on the object. For example, choosing a blue background for a blue butterfly would be a poor choice: portions of the butterfly would be deleted along with the background.In addition, it would be a good idea to become familiar with basic GIMP functions before attempting this tutorial: a basic knowledge of the Layers dialog and toolbox items is necessary prior to attempting this photo editing technique.

Once you’ve done this, you can set your Gaussian Blur amount in real-time, click Apply and the software will split your shot into two layers, one with the color and one with the detail. From here, you can remove blemishes, add your own dodge and burn and tidy up colors – a game changer!

* ****Ramp Up Your Dynamic Range With Tone Mapping**

Amazingly, Affinity Photo has its very own Tone Mapping Persona with a full suite of tools to get your well on the way to high dynamic range images, whether you have a series of bracketed shots – identical photos taken at different exposures – or a single shot as we’ve used. Opening this Persona brings up a toolbar on the right-hand side with the usual exposure and enhancement tools, though also gives you access to Tone Compression, Local Contrast and detail sliders. There’s even a series of presets to get you started. Like most of Affinity, the effects can be seen in real-time and are completely reversible, meaning there’s no such thing as a permanent mistake. What we love most about the Tone Mapping Persona is the subtlety compared to others on offer, meaning you’re able to keep your shots looking natural while still getting the most from your work!

* ****Adjustments Are Plentiful And Powerful**

Adjustments refer to a series of functional layers that apply specific effects to your shots. These can be as simple as Exposure, Vibrance or Brightness and Contrast, which do what they say on the tin, all the way up to more powerful options like Gradient Maps, Channel Mixers and Color Balance for creative effects and color corrections. Because they’re layers, they can be altered at any time in your editing process and moved around as you see fit. They affect any layers below them in the Layer palette but can be set to cast an effect on only a single-pixel layer by using the brilliant Mask to Below feature. You can also stack as many Adjustments as you wish, giving you a huge amount of flexibility to fine-tune your work in any way possible.

* ****Layers Offer You The Ultimate Creative Freedom**

An editing software that doesn’t allow Layers will really set back your creative choices. Happily, Affinity Photo gives you full control over its layer system. This means that you can bring in additional elements into your scene. You can then take advantage of Affinity’s hugely powerful selection engine to select the parts you wish to cut out or scroll through the full list of Blending Modes for a more refined and creative look. To add the birds to our shot, we took one landscape and added in a shot of birds taken against a white sky. From here, it’s as easy as setting the Blending Mode to Multiply and voila, the white sky has gone. Of course, there’s no need to stop there, and you can find yourself creating in-depth composites that are truly only limited by your imagination - set yourself free!

Generally, you will only want to choose a pattern if you’re blending an area that has a pattern (e.g., a chain-link fence).

* ****Dodge**

Use the dodge tool to lighten specific areas. Note that this is a tool that deals with contrast (light vs. dark) and not color, although color may sometimes appear to change based on your lightening. Additional options: You can change brush size and exposure settings. You can also choose to focus your lightening on shadows, midtones, or highlights.

* ****Sponge**

The sponge tool enhances or sops up color, depending on your settings. It’s a great tool for saturating or desaturating specific areas of an image. Additional options: You can change the brush size and brush strength, but the most important setting is whether you want to saturate (increase) or desaturate (decrease) coloring.

## Conclusion

When choosing an object for use in chroma key, it is important to verify the background "screen" color does not exist on the object. For example, choosing a blue background for a blue butterfly would be a poor choice: portions of the butterfly would be deleted along with the background.In addition, it would be a good idea to become familiar with basic GIMP functions before attempting this tutorial: a basic knowledge of the Layers dialog and toolbox items is necessary prior to attempting this photo editing technique.

## How to use green screen in gimp

If you take a picture with a solid colored background (blue or green works best), then you can have a computer program pull out the blue or green pixels and replace them with another color or a transparent layer. This process is called "chroma key" and is used in weather forecasts and other special effects. The terms "green screen" and "blue screen" also refer to the chroma key process.

These directions outlined below describe how to use GIMP to add a transparent layer and remove blue or green pixels from an image. This allows you to layer images on different backgrounds or use pictures as Sprites in Scratch or Greenfoot.

Brief outline of process:

1. Start GIMP
2. Open the picture file.
3. Create an "Alpha Channel" (Transparent Pixels)
4. Select "Like Colored Pixels" (Click on the Green or Blue background)

### Adobe Photoshop

Adobe Photoshop is the commercial image editor that set the standard in creative illustration and design work with a sophisticated, layer-based workflow and robust, professional feature set.

Over the years, Photoshop developed from a small photo editing tool to an Industry-leading software that dictates the global graphic designing and multimedia industries. With every new version, Adobe introduces in the Photoshop; the graphic designing communities wait to check out the next big leap where Photoshop can take them.

Key Features of Adobe Photoshop

* **Layers**

With Layers palette, you can draw or design various elements of your document independently in layers and stack them up as per the order of display. With this advantage, control over every single object is catered at the click of a mouse. Mistakes happen, but the effects of the mistake are limited to the part of the canvas; you can choose to work on the particular part and leave the rest of the canvas as it is. This benefit is lacking in the traditional painting method. Artists are not allowed to relax at any part of the drawing or painting once their concentration is diverted and a stroke of painting goes wrong! They are bound to change the whole canvas.

* **Selection Tools**

Photoshop’s selection tools are so handy to use that designers worldwide are addicted to the set of selection tools Photoshop offers. However, there are a bunch of competitive software and open-source software designed to give tough competition for Photoshop. Users are still stuck with Adobe’s torch bearer software due to the ease its tools provide.

* **Pen Tool**

Today, Photoshop cannot be imagined without a Pen tool. Though the pen tool, by nature, works for drawing paths along with the anchor points, the creative scope it provides is limitless. The tool is designed so flexibly that the designer can draw any shape or edit the existing shapes as good as he is using his bare hand. The amount of control we have through placing the anchor points in the right places is taken further with the three types of Anchor points that can allow you to draw and edit paths precisely.

* **Shapes**

The outlook of the shape layers in Photoshop may be limited, but the capabilities of the feature go a step further than what we assume about it. In the traditional marquee selection tools, the selection is limited to the raster process, and in many cases, the output will result in the sharp pixilated edges, which are never good looking. But the shape layers can act as an individual object within the document with its attribute to maintain the finest quality.

* **Vector Mask**

The layer masks create a masking portion of an object by using the grayscale color combination (Shades of Gray). Once the masking part is done, the area of the object under the layer mask disappears.

* **Retouching Tools**

Retouching tools are an accumulation of various tools such as Stamp tool, Pattern Stamp tool, Spot Healing tool, Healing tool, Patch tool, Redeye tool and much more. Though the numbers are more, every tool has its importance. The development of retouching tools did not happen overnight. Adobe was working hard identifying the problems of the photographers and finding the solutions for the problems from time to time.

### Affinity Photo

Affinity Photo is a professional, full-featured raster graphics editor. Working in Affinity Photo is always live and you can pan and zoom at 60fps, with live previews and non-destructive application.

Whatever your genre of choice, be it landscapes, portraits, macro or anything else, Affinity not only has an unbeatable set of tools to help you, but it’s also laid out in an intuitive way that is ideal for newcomers and those switching from other software alike. There are a series of modules, called Personas, that bring you dedicated interfaces, such as Tone Mapping, RAW Developing and even a powerful liquify interface that makes complex reshaping a breeze! Even better, you can take the full functionality of the desktop app on the road, thanks to the iPad version, which is the most powerful mobile editing solution available. With so much on offer for so little, it’s time that you incorporated Affinity Photo into your workflow and moved your photography to the next step. To get you started, we’re going to give you some great tips to get the most from this brilliant software and get you well on the way to creating your own Masterpieces.

* ****Develop RAW Files Like A Pro**

The first milestone in any photographer’s journey is unquestionably learning to shoot RAW. This image format captures even more data than JPEG and can be tweaked to create the perfect image or a solid base for further editing. To take advantage, all you need to do is open up your RAW file of choice into Affinity Photo and the Develop Persona will load up automatically. From here you can apply exposure adjustments, recover highlights and shadows and even craft a split toning effect. There’s a Curves adjustment for precision tweaks, a savvy noise reduction component and a lens correction module to combat distortion. It has everything you need for that all-important first step to brilliance.

* ****Professional Skin Retouching At The Click Of A Button**

If you shoot portraits, you’ll doubtless know about the power of frequency separation. This technique is favored by many pros to get that glossy high-end look that screams professional. While it may sound complicated, in Affinity Photo it’s as simple as going to the Photo Persona and clicking on Filters>Frequency Separation. Once you’ve done this, you can set your Gaussian Blur amount in real-time, click Apply and the software will split your shot into two layers, one with the color and one with the detail. From here, you can remove blemishes, add your own dodge and burn and tidy up colors – a game changer!

* ****Ramp Up Your Dynamic Range With Tone Mapping**

Amazingly, Affinity Photo has its very own Tone Mapping Persona with a full suite of tools to get your well on the way to high dynamic range images, whether you have a series of bracketed shots – identical photos taken at different exposures – or a single shot as we’ve used. Opening this Persona brings up a toolbar on the right-hand side with the usual exposure and enhancement tools, though also gives you access to Tone Compression, Local Contrast and detail sliders. There’s even a series of presets to get you started. Like most of Affinity, the effects can be seen in real-time and are completely reversible, meaning there’s no such thing as a permanent mistake. What we love most about the Tone Mapping Persona is the subtlety compared to others on offer, meaning you’re able to keep your shots looking natural while still getting the most from your work!

* ****Adjustments Are Plentiful And Powerful**

Adjustments refer to a series of functional layers that apply specific effects to your shots. These can be as simple as Exposure, Vibrance or Brightness and Contrast, which do what they say on the tin, all the way up to more powerful options like Gradient Maps, Channel Mixers and Color Balance for creative effects and color corrections. Because they’re layers, they can be altered at any time in your editing process and moved around as you see fit. They affect any layers below them in the Layer palette but can be set to cast an effect on only a single-pixel layer by using the brilliant Mask to Below feature. You can also stack as many Adjustments as you wish, giving you a huge amount of flexibility to fine-tune your work in any way possible.

* ****Layers Offer You The Ultimate Creative Freedom**

An editing software that doesn’t allow Layers will really set back your creative choices. Happily, Affinity Photo gives you full control over its layer system. This means that you can bring in additional elements into your scene. You can then take advantage of Affinity’s hugely powerful selection engine to select the parts you wish to cut out or scroll through the full list of Blending Modes for a more refined and creative look. To add the birds to our shot, we took one landscape and added in a shot of birds taken against a white sky. From here, it’s as easy as setting the Blending Mode to Multiply and voila, the white sky has gone. Of course, there’s no need to stop there, and you can find yourself creating in-depth composites that are truly only limited by your imagination - set yourself free!

The tool is designed so flexibly that the designer can draw any shape or edit the existing shapes as good as he is using his bare hand. The amount of control we have through placing the anchor points in the right places is taken further with the three types of Anchor points that can allow you to draw and edit paths precisely.

* **Shapes**

The outlook of the shape layers in Photoshop may be limited, but the capabilities of the feature go a step further than what we assume about it. In the traditional marquee selection tools, the selection is limited to the raster process, and in many cases, the output will result in the sharp pixilated edges, which are never good looking. But the shape layers can act as an individual object within the document with its attribute to maintain the finest quality.

* **Vector Mask**

The layer masks create a masking portion of an object by using the grayscale color combination (Shades of Gray). Once the masking part is done, the area of the object under the layer mask disappears.

* **Retouching Tools**

Retouching tools are an accumulation of various tools such as Stamp tool, Pattern Stamp tool, Spot Healing tool, Healing tool, Patch tool, Redeye tool and much more. Though the numbers are more, every tool has its importance. The development of retouching tools did not happen overnight. Adobe was working hard identifying the problems of the photographers and finding the solutions for the problems from time to time.

### Affinity Photo

Affinity Photo is a professional, full-featured raster graphics editor. Working in Affinity Photo is always live and you can pan and zoom at 60fps, with live previews and non-destructive application.

Whatever your genre of choice, be it landscapes, portraits, macro or anything else, Affinity not only has an unbeatable set of tools to help you, but it’s also laid out in an intuitive way that is ideal for newcomers and those switching from other software alike. There are a series of modules, called Personas, that bring you dedicated interfaces, such as Tone Mapping, RAW Developing and even a powerful liquify interface that makes complex reshaping a breeze! Even better, you can take the full functionality of the desktop app on the road, thanks to the iPad version, which is the most powerful mobile editing solution available. With so much on offer for so little, it’s time that you incorporated Affinity Photo into your workflow and moved your photography to the next step. To get you started, we’re going to give you some great tips to get the most from this brilliant software and get you well on the way to creating your own Masterpieces.

* ****Develop RAW Files Like A Pro**

The first milestone in any photographer’s journey is unquestionably learning to shoot RAW. This image format captures even more data than JPEG and can be tweaked to create the perfect image or a solid base for further editing. To take advantage, all you need to do is open up your RAW file of choice into Affinity Photo and the Develop Persona will load up automatically. From here you can apply exposure adjustments, recover highlights and shadows and even craft a split toning effect. There’s a Curves adjustment for precision tweaks, a savvy noise reduction component and a lens correction module to combat distortion. It has everything you need for that all-important first step to brilliance.

* ****Professional Skin Retouching At The Click Of A Button**

If you shoot portraits, you’ll doubtless know about the power of frequency separation. This technique is favored by many pros to get that glossy high-end look that screams professional. While it may sound complicated, in Affinity Photo it’s as simple as going to the Photo Persona and clicking on Filters>Frequency Separation. Once you’ve done this, you can set your Gaussian Blur amount in real-time, click Apply and the software will split your shot into two layers, one with the color and one with the detail. From here, you can remove blemishes, add your own dodge and burn and tidy up colors – a game changer!

* ****Ramp Up Your Dynamic Range With Tone Mapping**

Amazingly, Affinity Photo has its very own Tone Mapping Persona with a full suite of tools to get your well on the way to high dynamic range images, whether you have a series of bracketed shots – identical photos taken at different exposures – or a single shot as we’ve used. Opening this Persona brings up a toolbar on the right-hand side with the usual exposure and enhancement tools, though also gives you access to Tone Compression, Local Contrast and detail sliders. There’s even a series of presets to get you started. Like most of Affinity, the effects can be seen in real-time and are completely reversible, meaning there’s no such thing as a permanent mistake. What we love most about the Tone Mapping Persona is the subtlety compared to others on offer, meaning you’re able to keep your shots looking natural while still getting the most from your work!

* ****Adjustments Are Plentiful And Powerful**

Adjustments refer to a series of functional layers that apply specific effects to your shots. These can be as simple as Exposure, Vibrance or Brightness and Contrast, which do what they say on the tin, all the way up to more powerful options like Gradient Maps, Channel Mixers and Color Balance for creative effects and color corrections. Because they’re layers, they can be altered at any time in your editing process and moved around as you see fit. They affect any layers below them in the Layer palette but can be set to cast an effect on only a single-pixel layer by using the brilliant Mask to Below feature. You can also stack as many Adjustments as you wish, giving you a huge amount of flexibility to fine-tune your work in any way possible.

* ****Layers Offer You The Ultimate Creative Freedom**

An editing software that doesn’t allow Layers will really set back your creative choices. Happily, Affinity Photo gives you full control over its layer system. This means that you can bring in additional elements into your scene. You can then take advantage of Affinity’s hugely powerful selection engine to select the parts you wish to cut out or scroll through the full list of Blending Modes for a more refined and creative look. To add the birds to our shot, we took one landscape and added in a shot of birds taken against a white sky. From here, it’s as easy as setting the Blending Mode to Multiply and voila, the white sky has gone. Of course, there’s no need to stop there, and you can find yourself creating in-depth composites that are truly only limited by your imagination - set yourself free!

### Pixlr

Pixlr makes it easy to transform everyday images into stunning works of art. Whether you’re applying a quick fix to your photos or adding your personal touch with effects, overlays, or borders, Pixlr has everything you need to make your moments beautiful.

This makes your interaction with the app, over the net, is secure. Also, Pixlr does not store any copy of your images in their systems.

**Key Features**

* ****Free and Safe**

Pixlr, for now, is free. There is also no indication that the company will charge users soon. It is a legitimate site that does not engage in fraudulent activities or perpetuate any hidden charges. The images that you edit or make on Pixlr are also free for commercial use. For freelance artists and small businesses, this is the perfect starter app. For enterprises with content creators in the field, it is good to let employees know about Pixlr’s no-cost offer.

* ****Versatile and Lightweight**

* ****Quick Fix**

Pixlr is known for being the lightweight app that packs so many editing tools and functionalities at no cost. But, maybe, more importantly, it also includes many tools for quick fixes. This is something essential for people on the go or those that just need minor adjustments. Just open your browser on any device and apply touch-ups. You do not have to open your laptop or go to your desktop for simple needs.

* ****Spot heal**

Super useful, the spot heal tool can help remove scratches or blemishes by simply clicking on the area. Additional options: Besides size of brush, you have a choice of Pixlr choosing to blend the area with nearby area values or generate a pattern. Generally, you will only want to choose a pattern if you’re blending an area that has a pattern (e.g., a chain-link fence).

* ****Dodge**

Use the dodge tool to lighten specific areas. Note that this is a tool that deals with contrast (light vs. dark) and not color, although color may sometimes appear to change based on your lightening. Additional options: You can change brush size and exposure settings. You can also choose to focus your lightening on shadows, midtones, or highlights.

* ****Sponge**

The sponge tool enhances or sops up color, depending on your settings. It’s a great tool for saturating or desaturating specific areas of an image. Additional options: You can change the brush size and brush strength, but the most important setting is whether you want to saturate (increase) or desaturate (decrease) coloring.

## Conclusion

When choosing an object for use in chroma key, it is important to verify the background "screen" color does not exist on the object. For example, choosing a blue background for a blue butterfly would be a poor choice: portions of the butterfly would be deleted along with the background.In addition, it would be a good idea to become familiar with basic GIMP functions before attempting this tutorial: a basic knowledge of the Layers dialog and toolbox items is necessary prior to attempting this photo editing technique.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

##### Step1 Download and install Wondershare Filmora

First, you need to download and install the video editor, Filmora. If you've already done that, then launch the software right away. But if you haven't, then download it below. Once the download finishes, install the software on your computer.

When you launch the Filmora, click on "New Project."

![new project of wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-2.png)

##### Step2 Make the structure of your graphics

For creating anything, we first need a flawless structure. Here, we can make the structure of Subscribe channel graphics using different colors, icons, texts, and channel photos. We'll start by adding color layers.

**1\. Add color layers**

* Go to the "Media" on the top left corner of the interface and Click on "Sample Color." Here find the Green color and add it in the panel below as the first video layer by the drag-n-drop function.

![adding a bright green color layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-3.png)

* We will key this layer at the end, so make sure not to use any other green graphics for your animation.
* Let's lock this layer because we will no longer use it. For this, click on the "Lock" icon on the layer's left side.
* Add white and red colors and stack them on top of the green color layer.

![white and red color layers added](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-4.png)

After adding all three color layers, it's time to crop these layers to make the structure of our graphic.

##### **Crop the Color Layers**

* Go to the "Effects" tab from the top bar and search for the "Crop" effect. Then drag the effect and add it to the white and red layers on the panel.

![adding the crop effect on color layers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-5.png)

* First, click on the "Eye" icon beside the red color layer to hide it. Then double-click the white layer to see its properties. When the properties appear, select "Effects" from there.

![cropping the white color layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-6.png)

* You can also enable the safe zones from the display settings on the right side of the panel. After that, crop the white layer first, then show the red layer and crop it too. It will look like this.

![enabling the safe zones](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-7.png)

That's it, folks. Our color backgrounds are here. Now we have to add our channel photo to this. So let's move on to see how to do it.

**2\.** **Add a channel photo**

* To add the channel photo, you can upload the image. Here we are going to use some images from the stock media. No matter the image, drop it down on the panel above the red color layer.

![adding an image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-8.png)

* Now double-click on the image layer, and from the properties, go to the "Mask" option and select the circle. You can also select any other shape you like.

![select a shape for our image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-9.png)

* After that, scroll down and make the circle even by matching all numbers. Then scale it down and place it on the left corner of the white layer.

![adjusting the channel image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-10.png)

It's done. Let's add our channel text now.

**3\.** **Add texts**

* For adding text, go to the "Titles" from the top bar and add the title you like to the panel.

![adding the channel text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-11.png)

* Now double-click this layer and add the text you want. You can also change the color of the text, scale it down and place it where ever you want.

![editing the channel text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-12.png)

* Now, let's add another title for the subscribe button. You have to place it on the red layer.

![subscribe button text added](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-13.png)

We can't finish our structure without icons, can we? So let's move on to them.

**4\.** **Add icons**

* Hit the "Element" from the top bar and search for the "Bell" icon. You will find the short animations of the bell. Add the suitable one to the panel.

![adding a bell icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-14.png)

* Now find a suitable place in the animation, stop it at that point, right-click on the element layer and add a freeze frame.

![adding a freezeframe of the bell icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-15.png)

* You can also extend the freeze frame and remove the other parts. Then reduce its size and place it beside the "Subscribe" text.

![adjust the bell icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-16.png)

* Similarly, add "Thumbs Up" and "Mouse Cursor" icons on the panel.

![thumbs up and mouse cursor icons added](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-17.png)

Finally, our structure is finished. Now let's start animating.

##### Step3 Animate the graphics

First, we'll make it so that all these graphics come in from below the view.

* Go to the white layer first and double-click on it. Then hit the "Animation" option and scroll down. Here add a new keyframe by clicking "Add." Now move the playhead to the beginning and place the white color layer out of the frame.

![adding a new keyframe on the white color layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-18.png)

* Now, do the same for channel photos and icons. The whole animation will look like this.

![successfully animated the graphics](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-19.gif)

* As you can see, the text appears before the color layers. Let's correct it. Double-click the text layer. Select the" Type Writer' form and hit the "Advanced option.

![selecting type writer style for text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-20.png)

* Here, you can adjust the text with the color layers.

![adjusting the speed of the text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-21.png)

* After adjusting both the channel name and subscribe button texts, your animation will appear like this.

![the speed of the text adjusted](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-22.gif)

If you've managed so far, then that's great. We have done most of the work. Now we need to animate the graphics of the mouse cursor so that it clicks on the bell icon, thumb icon, and our subscribe button. The process is somewhat similar because we will need to add different keyframes. But still, let's see it in detail.

##### Step4 Animate the mouse cursor

* Go to the "Mouse Cursor" icon layer and double-click on it. First, place the icon on the "Thumbs Up" so that when it animates in, it goes directly to the said icon. Then you have to add another keyframe after some time. And when you add a third one, place the "Mouse Cursor" icon on the subscribe button text.

![adding new keyframes on the mouse cursor icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-23.png)

* Then add a similar pair of keyframes with some space from the last one and place the "Mouse Cursor" icon on the "Bell" icon.

![mouse curson on the bell icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-24.png)

* The last keyframe we have to add will place this "Mouse Cursor" icon out of our view. After that, you need to adjust these keyframes to set the speed of the moving "Mouse Cursor' icon according to your taste.

The final product up till now will be like this.

![successfully animated the mouse cursor icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-25.gif)

We are nearing our end, guys. Now we just need to make the graphics animate out of our view, and our work will be done. So let's dive right into it.

##### Step5 Animate the graphics out

The process of animating out your graphics is like how we animated in our video. We just need to reverse those steps. So here's how it's done.

* Go to the white color layer and double-click on it to open its properties.
* Now, from the "Animation" option, add a new keyframe a little before the end of the video.
* After that, you have to add another keyframe at the end of your video. But in this keyframe, place the white color layer out of your view. Like this,

![removed the white color layer from the frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-26.png)

* Repeat the same steps for the red color layer, channel image layer, and icons layer.
* After it's done, the whole graphics will look like this.

![animated the color, image, and icons layers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-27.gif)

* The only thing that remains is to fix the text layers. For this, double-click on the channel text layer and go to the "Advanced" settings, just like before.

![click on the advanced option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-28.png)

* From here, fix the text speed and end with your other graphic elements. After it's done, we will do the same for the "Subscribe" button text.

![adjust the text with your graphics](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-29.png)

Finally, our graphic is completed. "Export" it from the software to your computer.

![completed subscribe channel graphics](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-30.png)

Whenever you want to use this graphic on your video, you have to import it first and enable the "Green Screen" option. It will remove the green background color. Then you can upload your video and place this graphic on it to add to the video. And that's all.

## Conclusion

Creating the Subscribe channel graphics is like picking stars from the sky for any video creator, especially if you are a beginner. However, now you don't need to go for the professionals anymore. Wondershare Filmora has got you covered. So follow this detailed guide and create excellent subscribe channel graphics for your videos.

![cropping the white color layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-6.png)

* You can also enable the safe zones from the display settings on the right side of the panel. After that, crop the white layer first, then show the red layer and crop it too. It will look like this.

![enabling the safe zones](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-7.png)

That's it, folks. Our color backgrounds are here. Now we have to add our channel photo to this. So let's move on to see how to do it.

**2\.** **Add a channel photo**

* To add the channel photo, you can upload the image. Here we are going to use some images from the stock media. No matter the image, drop it down on the panel above the red color layer.

![adding an image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-8.png)

* Now double-click on the image layer, and from the properties, go to the "Mask" option and select the circle. You can also select any other shape you like.

![select a shape for our image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-9.png)

* After that, scroll down and make the circle even by matching all numbers. Then scale it down and place it on the left corner of the white layer.

![adjusting the channel image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-10.png)

It's done. Let's add our channel text now.

**3\.** **Add texts**

* For adding text, go to the "Titles" from the top bar and add the title you like to the panel.

![adding the channel text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-11.png)

* Now double-click this layer and add the text you want. You can also change the color of the text, scale it down and place it where ever you want.

![editing the channel text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-12.png)

* Now, let's add another title for the subscribe button. You have to place it on the red layer.

![subscribe button text added](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-13.png)

We can't finish our structure without icons, can we? So let's move on to them.

**4\.** **Add icons**

* Hit the "Element" from the top bar and search for the "Bell" icon. You will find the short animations of the bell. Add the suitable one to the panel.

* Now find a suitable place in the animation, stop it at that point, right-click on the element layer and add a freeze frame.

![adding a freezeframe of the bell icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-15.png)

* You can also extend the freeze frame and remove the other parts. Then reduce its size and place it beside the "Subscribe" text.

![adjust the bell icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-16.png)

* Similarly, add "Thumbs Up" and "Mouse Cursor" icons on the panel.

![thumbs up and mouse cursor icons added](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-17.png)

Finally, our structure is finished. Now let's start animating.

##### Step3 Animate the graphics

First, we'll make it so that all these graphics come in from below the view.

* Go to the white layer first and double-click on it. Then hit the "Animation" option and scroll down. Here add a new keyframe by clicking "Add." Now move the playhead to the beginning and place the white color layer out of the frame.

![adding a new keyframe on the white color layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-18.png)

* Now, do the same for channel photos and icons. The whole animation will look like this.

![successfully animated the graphics](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-19.gif)

* As you can see, the text appears before the color layers. Let's correct it. Double-click the text layer. Select the" Type Writer' form and hit the "Advanced option.

![selecting type writer style for text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-20.png)

* Here, you can adjust the text with the color layers.

![adjusting the speed of the text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-21.png)

* After adjusting both the channel name and subscribe button texts, your animation will appear like this.

![the speed of the text adjusted](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-22.gif)

If you've managed so far, then that's great. We have done most of the work. Now we need to animate the graphics of the mouse cursor so that it clicks on the bell icon, thumb icon, and our subscribe button. The process is somewhat similar because we will need to add different keyframes. But still, let's see it in detail.

##### Step4 Animate the mouse cursor

* Go to the "Mouse Cursor" icon layer and double-click on it. First, place the icon on the "Thumbs Up" so that when it animates in, it goes directly to the said icon. Then you have to add another keyframe after some time. And when you add a third one, place the "Mouse Cursor" icon on the subscribe button text.

![adding new keyframes on the mouse cursor icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-23.png)

* Then add a similar pair of keyframes with some space from the last one and place the "Mouse Cursor" icon on the "Bell" icon.

![mouse curson on the bell icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-24.png)

* The last keyframe we have to add will place this "Mouse Cursor" icon out of our view. After that, you need to adjust these keyframes to set the speed of the moving "Mouse Cursor' icon according to your taste.

The final product up till now will be like this.

![successfully animated the mouse cursor icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-25.gif)

We are nearing our end, guys. Now we just need to make the graphics animate out of our view, and our work will be done. So let's dive right into it.

##### Step5 Animate the graphics out

The process of animating out your graphics is like how we animated in our video. We just need to reverse those steps. So here's how it's done.

* Go to the white color layer and double-click on it to open its properties.
* Now, from the "Animation" option, add a new keyframe a little before the end of the video.
* After that, you have to add another keyframe at the end of your video. But in this keyframe, place the white color layer out of your view. Like this,

![removed the white color layer from the frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-26.png)

* Repeat the same steps for the red color layer, channel image layer, and icons layer.
* After it's done, the whole graphics will look like this.

![animated the color, image, and icons layers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-27.gif)

* The only thing that remains is to fix the text layers. For this, double-click on the channel text layer and go to the "Advanced" settings, just like before.

![click on the advanced option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-28.png)

* From here, fix the text speed and end with your other graphic elements. After it's done, we will do the same for the "Subscribe" button text.

![adjust the text with your graphics](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-29.png)

Finally, our graphic is completed. "Export" it from the software to your computer.

![completed subscribe channel graphics](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/how-to-create-your-own-subscribe-channel-graphics-30.png)

Whenever you want to use this graphic on your video, you have to import it first and enable the "Green Screen" option. It will remove the green background color. Then you can upload your video and place this graphic on it to add to the video. And that's all.

## Conclusion

Creating the Subscribe channel graphics is like picking stars from the sky for any video creator, especially if you are a beginner. However, now you don't need to go for the professionals anymore. Wondershare Filmora has got you covered. So follow this detailed guide and create excellent subscribe channel graphics for your videos.

## How to Be a Good Podcast Host (2024 Updated)

You may be a blogger who has the habit of writing long articles. Or you may be a YouTuber with a hi-fi channel with many subscribers, but a podcast is a different thing in general.

This article will look at how to prepare, call guests, warm them up, and give practical ideas about how to host a podcast. Let's start the article by learning how to get prepared to host a podcast.

## #1 Get prepared to host a podcast

A good podcast host always gets prepared, sets up his goals, and gets easy tips to set apart from everyone in the marketplace. For this, you have to follow the below instructions and tips:

### 1\. A proper pre-interview process

Before starting the podcast, the host should have quality and organic content. The content is related to the guest or any foremost personality related to the topic.

The host should be confident and relaxed to kill the anxiety process. If the host has low confidence, he may suffer from nervousness. This will kill the authenticity.

### 2\. Share questions with the audience

A good understanding of how to pan out a situation makes you a good host. You must share the question on and off during podcasts to build engaging criteria with the audience.

You don't need to sound the script on the screen like a robot. Scripts can be helpful but only if read in a conversational mood.

### 3\. Find the right location

A good location means good conversation. A proper set prepared for the guest and the podcast will help you boost your conversation skills and get yourself and the guest into the mood of your show.

Before the show, you can change the settings or have a monotone set that fits every mood.

## #2 Warm up the audience

**Warming up** is a necessary part of the show. A warmup works just like gas in a car before a long drive. You have to do this by asking any question or by telling them an inspirational or motivational story.

A good host must realize that a warm show has a high chance of becoming viral, and you won't get that if the guest is nervous, tired, or not in the mood.

### Tip 1\. Setting the mood

Your goal is to set the mood of the audience according to the topic. Warming up the audience before getting to the guest.

You have to set the tone according to the topic of your podcast to warm them up. In this way, you need to make the connection between the guest, you, and your voice.

### Tip 2\. Build an emotional connection

Building an emotional connection helps to engage the audience till the end of the show. To make this possible, you can share a funny story with them or about a recent event or any recent incident.

### Tip 3\. Polls and questionnaires

Modern media has connected everything through the internet. You need to interact with the audience by asking questions from them and giving them a chance to answer them by live calling or on social media.

You can also do this on Instagram polls or by posting a story and asking them to select an upcoming topic for the podcast. Introducing this concept will boost your podcast views and help you engage more followers on your other social media platforms.

## #3 Try to be authenticity

You need to have authenticity if you want your podcast to be successful. An authentic show attracts a larger audience, while a show whose mood resembles a person with a multiple personality disorder will throw off the whole vibe of the podcast. And the listeners will eventually press back buttons to escape the colossal wreck.

### Tips to have authentic content

* Your topic may be emotional, happy, or of any other information.
* A good host needs to have the skills of a good actor to convey the emotions that the audience will perceive more efficiently.
* An idea of how the audience will perceive you and how to make your voice tone with emotions on podcasts.
* Don't go for a more serious tone.

**Things to Avoid**

* What you should opt away from is, **faking**
* Don't try to get **excited** about something that you're not.
* Do not pretend to **care** about something when you do not.
* The fakeness will only result in the downfall of your podcast, as the listeners will eventually grow tired and leave.
* You must act well and sell yourself more efficiently to develop that trust with the audience.

The more the audience trusts you, the more authentic you seem.

## #4 Storytelling

Tales are as old as time. As time moves on, more and more stories pile up. Your podcast has the potential to be the best if you know how to utilize those storytelling skills of yours. **It's never about information alone!**

You may have a bland topic to discuss or a guest who is tough to break character. These are the situations where your charm and concern will play their part. So you also want to learn how to make your podcasts enjoyable through stories? Then check out the short tips below:

### How to add stories to your podcasts

* First, you should have the skill to **read** the room and the mood.
* If you start telling a story about **yourself** that has no relation to the topic whatsoever will only lead to the guest being annoyed.
* You may have **called** the **guest** for a reason. This reason should tally with your topic as it will make you ask about their experience.
* Asking the right questions is important.
* You'd better not begin with leading statements such as, **"Obi-wan Kenobi is a good TV show."** the guest may simply reply, **"I do not care."**
* You should approach with question statements such as, **"Did you know that your son is a big fan of the Obi-wan Kenobi TV show."** These are **indulging** questions to help your audience be more involved in your podcasts.

The audience and the guest will also develop an interest in the conversation that will lead to a successful show for the day.

## #5 Transcribe your episodes

A good podcast also looks to give you quality content for each episode. You may call on guests upon guests and promote your podcasts in many ways. One of the ways you can also allow your podcasts to be recognized more is by the use of transcribing.

### What is transcribing?

Transcribing means converting the speech in the audio of your podcasts to a text format. Your podcast may raise some eyes if the content is desirable to the audience.

It may happen your podcast gets around a person whose brother suffers from hearing loss. By a transcription, you offer a chance to let them involved in your podcast. You can accomplish this feat in one of two ways.

* Either use an AI-powered audio editing program, like Wondershare [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), to get you through the speech-to-text transcription by default or a more auto way.
* Convert your text into audio, but this article will not look at it.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

Our main focus would be manually converting speech to text using a human transcriber. And we will be doing so by using the Wondershare Filmora app.

### Transcribing podcasts with Wondershare Filmora

Filmora is an all-in-one video editing tool. In the following steps, we will learn the step-by-step process of transcribing podcast by using Wondershare Filmora.

##### Step1Add audio files or footage

* First of all, drag the imported audio files or footage into the timeline.

![adding footage into the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/adding-footage-into-the-timeline.jpg)

##### Step2Add subtitles

* Select the tile icon on the bar above.
* In the window that pops up, select your favorite subtitle format.

![adding subtitle tile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/adding-subtitle-tile.jpg)

##### Step3Adjust the size

For better playout and matching the audio with subtitles, you have to adjust the size of the video as:

* Add a subtitle tile above the video.
* Then adjust the size of the video.

![sizing the subtitle tile with the video clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/sizing-the-subtitle-tile-with-the-video-clip.jpg)

##### Step4Convert speech into text

* At last, type the speech into text in the subtitle box.

![typing in the speech](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/typing-in-the-speech.jpg)

In this way, you have created speech-to-text using a human transcriber rather than an AI. Doing this will ensure no mistakes are recorded and make it even more efficient.

## #6 Put yourself in audiences' shoes

And if you feel like the general audience would want to make sense of a particular statement, ask the guest about it. This is what differentiates a good host from a bad one! A general understanding of the audience's point of view would always allow you to process your podcast accordingly.

* You should understand the general sentiments of the audience.
* When you feel a particular subject will attract more audience, do the process accordingly.
* Maybe they like how you process a story and evaluate it. Do that!

All qualities of a good podcast are there, and it's your job to identify them and make the most of them.

## #7 Understand why the guest is here

You are the host of the podcast. Your job is to be sincere with the guest. Moreover, useful information or a valued thought might be a reason why the guest has come to your show. Understand that reason and try to make the most of it.

* The guest might have **heard** about your podcast, or they could be a **constant**
* Your approach to the guest should **tally** with the topic of the podcast.
* The guest might be going through a tough time that makes them a **suitable guest** for that particular episode.
* Or it could be that your podcast attracted them, and now they want to use your interview to promote a book or any other service they think is best.
* As a host, you should allow the guest to have some **control** over the podcast.
* Develop a **sense of trust** between the host and the guest.
* The more you allow the guest to speak freely about themselves, the more they will feel interested in your podcast.

Your goal should be to captivate the guest as much as you can. If the guest is entertained, the more chances are that they will recommend you to other guests. **An experience gone wrong will be bad for the podcast.**

## #8 Invite the right guest

A podcast can be an excellent tool for attracting the audience to your content. And as podcast hosts guests, your first step is finding the right guests for your audience.

Is it necessary to search for a host before calling? Yes! It's quite a complicated and sensitive step to call out guests. A guest is the only one who can make or break the Podcast show. It's important to study the nature of guests too. Because a guest is also considered as a co-host of the show.

If a guest is bored and doesn't take much interest, then there are 100% chance that the show will fail. To find who is more compatible, we have to take assistance from a tool.

You can do this by plugging your podcast into a tool like **Sparktoro**. Sparktoro allows you to see what your audience is engaging with. It could be other platforms of podcasts such as youtube or other social media platforms.

**For example,** If we search for "the art of product podcast" on the Sparktoro website. It will direct us to demographic data, providing information about the content the audience is interacting with.

* It will show **different hashtags** and **frequently used phrases**.

![sparktoro search](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/sparktoro-search.jpg)

* Here you can see the top words in bios, hashtags, and frequent phrases.
* On the left window, you can search for other related podcasts your viewers are watching.

![sparktoro search for similar podcasts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/sparktoro-search-for-similar-podcasts.jpg)

* Similarly, you can also use the YouTube option to look at what kind of content your audience watches on youtube.

Following the above methods could give you **50-100** potential clients. Your main goal will be creating a list allowing you to call guests on your show. You can divide the list according to the priorities.

* **Close friends:** the ones who are going to be available whenever you call upon them.
* **The probable list:** the ones who would most probably agree to come on your podcast.
* **The premium list:** these guests will resemble a dream list of guests you want to call on your podcast.

Start by writing emails and promoting content that will attract these guests. Your chances are increased by how much you polish your podcast into creating **premium content**. The more premium the content is, the more premium your chances are of inviting those dream guests.

## The Bottom Line

Podcasts are tricky to promote. Many other alternatives are available in the market that provides a more Visual representation. And it's no lie; an audience like to sit and watch rather than sit and listen.

Following the steps, tips, and tricks mentioned above, you can build a strong base for being a good podcast host. Although it will take time to set off on your dreams, consistency and determination will eventually bear fruit.

**For example,** If we search for "the art of product podcast" on the Sparktoro website. It will direct us to demographic data, providing information about the content the audience is interacting with.

* It will show **different hashtags** and **frequently used phrases**.

![sparktoro search](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/sparktoro-search.jpg)

* Here you can see the top words in bios, hashtags, and frequent phrases.
* On the left window, you can search for other related podcasts your viewers are watching.

![sparktoro search for similar podcasts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/sparktoro-search-for-similar-podcasts.jpg)

* Similarly, you can also use the YouTube option to look at what kind of content your audience watches on youtube.

Following the above methods could give you **50-100** potential clients. Your main goal will be creating a list allowing you to call guests on your show. You can divide the list according to the priorities.

* **Close friends:** the ones who are going to be available whenever you call upon them.
* **The probable list:** the ones who would most probably agree to come on your podcast.
* **The premium list:** these guests will resemble a dream list of guests you want to call on your podcast.

Start by writing emails and promoting content that will attract these guests. Your chances are increased by how much you polish your podcast into creating **premium content**. The more premium the content is, the more premium your chances are of inviting those dream guests.

## The Bottom Line

Podcasts are tricky to promote. Many other alternatives are available in the market that provides a more Visual representation. And it's no lie; an audience like to sit and watch rather than sit and listen.

Following the steps, tips, and tricks mentioned above, you can build a strong base for being a good podcast host. Although it will take time to set off on your dreams, consistency and determination will eventually bear fruit.
