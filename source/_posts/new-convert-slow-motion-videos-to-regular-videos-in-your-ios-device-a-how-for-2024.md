### 01Select a Royalty Free Music Plan

Adding suitable background music can uplift the appeal of your slideshow presentation to greater extents. While most of the slideshow creator programs available today are equipped with extensive varieties of inbuilt audio for visibly any presentation setting, you can also opt to choose your own music plan in case you don’t get anything specific.

However, you do need to take care of certain factors when deciding on your music plan, most importantly, the pricing concerns. Go for selecting a royalty free, unlimited audio license via an affordable paid subscription from recognized and leading music hubs and online audio websites.

### 02Browse the Recommended Audio Choices

When looking through the diversity of music options available on any audio website, do not forget to pay attention to the user and website recommended playlists and music categories.

![Recommended Audio Choices](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/How-to-create-a-clideo-slideshow-10.JPG)

### 03Synchronize the Slideshow Music and the Contents

The credibility of your background audio lies in adding additional spark and integrity to the stills and videos of the presentation. When selecting the music elements for your slideshow, make sure that your choices are well in accordance with the content and mood of your creation. The most important aspect here is that the music you choose to add should complement the story being depicted, while captivating the viewer’s attention.

Avoid choosing a random audio just because you have heard a buzz of the same on popular platforms or a peer recommendation, lest the contents and background score of your presentation may take opposite paths and disrupt the information flow, while resulting in a distracted audience. To escape the hustle, you may seek help from the diversity of stock audio websites for a keyword and category oriented music search.

If you are interested in adding depth to your background audio, consider using the stem files of a selected song to obtain the latter’s instrumental note recordings. This will help to add a unique layer to the song, while uplifting its mood to a different level.

### 01Select a Royalty Free Music Plan

Adding suitable background music can uplift the appeal of your slideshow presentation to greater extents. While most of the slideshow creator programs available today are equipped with extensive varieties of inbuilt audio for visibly any presentation setting, you can also opt to choose your own music plan in case you don’t get anything specific.

However, you do need to take care of certain factors when deciding on your music plan, most importantly, the pricing concerns. Go for selecting a royalty free, unlimited audio license via an affordable paid subscription from recognized and leading music hubs and online audio websites.

### 02Browse the Recommended Audio Choices

When looking through the diversity of music options available on any audio website, do not forget to pay attention to the user and website recommended playlists and music categories. These tend to have a collection of the most preferred audio choices and there are high chances of you getting your exact music piece from within these playlists.

![Recommended Audio Choices](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/How-to-create-a-clideo-slideshow-10.JPG)

### 03Synchronize the Slideshow Music and the Contents

The credibility of your background audio lies in adding additional spark and integrity to the stills and videos of the presentation. When selecting the music elements for your slideshow, make sure that your choices are well in accordance with the content and mood of your creation. The most important aspect here is that the music you choose to add should complement the story being depicted, while captivating the viewer’s attention.

Avoid choosing a random audio just because you have heard a buzz of the same on popular platforms or a peer recommendation, lest the contents and background score of your presentation may take opposite paths and disrupt the information flow, while resulting in a distracted audience. To escape the hustle, you may seek help from the diversity of stock audio websites for a keyword and category oriented music search.

If you are interested in adding depth to your background audio, consider using the stem files of a selected song to obtain the latter’s instrumental note recordings. This will help to add a unique layer to the song, while uplifting its mood to a different level.

![Selecting the Appropriate Background Music](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/How-to-create-a-clideo-slideshow-11.JPG)

All you need to do is, add each track to the presentation elements, while taking care that every inclusion matches with the content it is supposed to complement.

Take care to restrict your choices in line with the length of the slideshow; else you may end up stuffing the footage with too many music pieces, leading to a miscoordinated arrangement. Check if you need just a single song or a complete soundtrack.

03 [How to Convert a GIF File](#Part 3)

04 [6 Places to Find the Best Gifs](#Part 4)

## Part 1 What Is a GIF File?

**GIF** is an acronym for Graphics Interchange Format. Talking of the explicit **GIF meaning**, this one is a short motion snippet created from a set of serially arranged still images in a looping motion. Talking of the origin of GIFs, these were first introduced in 1987 by Steve Wilhite from the US based online service provider CompuServe, precisely on June 15.

**GIFs** serve as portable image formats for still and animated images, and are primarily small sized files. However, these are very well compatible with large content files too. In today’s times, GIFs are a trending means of entertainment based content sharing and intensified message delivery to target audience. Additionally, you can conveniently use motion images in the **GIF format** as effective tools of improvising and upgrading your marketing straggles for an enhanced brand promotion.

Considering the immense content varieties of GIFs, these are an eminent part of blogs, social media posts and product websites. You can even use them to objectify your emotions and feelings when conversing with peers through the latest instant messaging applications. The bottom line is, GIFs are an integral part of today’s modern and dynamic communication patterns and needs.

## Part 2 Are GIF File Subject to Copyright?

These essentially constitute an original copyrighted creation, or may even originate from an existing copyright protected work. However, you may encounter potential glitches when choosing to work with **GIF images** while sticking with legal constraints.

Talking of the potential issues with the legality of GIF usage, there are two major concerns; the first being the sharing of unlicensed copyrighted GIF content, while the absence of legalized methods for licensed commercial use of these short motion clips being the second. Talking of possible reasons, there is again a duel. At present, there no copyright exercise from the end of original creators of GIF content, along with the absence of exact copyright claim constraints that can be imposed by content owners.

This scenario poses a potential need to look for suitable mitigation methods to curb copyright claims and disputes resulting from illegal use of GIFs. As a matter of fact, the development of a proper legal framework for undisputed GIF usage is a time consuming process. However, you can stay cautious by adhering to the following measures in the meantime:

**●** Refrain from using GIFs in a manner that would appear unsolicited to you, had you been the content owner.

**●** Take a note to credit the original creators in case3 you are using the GIF content from a known copyright source.

**●** Avoid drawing content from doubtful sources, instead search for trusted alternatives, or creating a GIF of your own would be an even better and safe choice.

## Part 3 How to Convert a GIF File

You can ensure an effective reach and impact of your brand if you include these catchy, short animation loops in your promotion strategy.
