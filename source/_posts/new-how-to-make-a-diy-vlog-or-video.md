### Plan your video

Ask yourself first of what you are trying to accomplish by producing the video. Remember that video is a tool and that it can hurt your channel if you don’t take it seriously and come properly prepared. Get organized and take down note if you have to.

Understand your target audience you need to know who you’ll be speaking to through your video content.

![plan your video 02](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/plan-your-video-02.jpg)

### Write a script

Making a script in your video is one way guide for you not to rattle or messed up everything, for me DIY vlog is different from product reviews or unboxing vlog. You can either write a word-by-word script for the video or just the general topics you aim to cover in the video. Either way, the point is to have a reference note so you don’t accidentally forget to cover an essential topic when you begin filming the video. DIY vlogs need to plan and make scripting because this is a more on tutorial video and you don’t like to missed one instruction on your video that is why making a script is a must unless you already doing it over and over again. You don’t have to be perfect and you don’t have to memorize any script. You just have to be relatable and authentic, yet professional.

## The Power of Music in Videos (+Filmora Editing Tricks)

No video is complete without suitable audio. Adding audio to a video is not that difficult, but choosing the right audio can be a hassle. You want something that captures the ears of the audience but, at the same time, compliments your video. The best way to do this is by adding music to your videos with [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

The following passage will guide you through everything you must consider while choosing music for your videos. But first, we'll show you how easy it is to alter your video with music using Wondershare Filmora.

## How different types of music affect your videos

You can easily change the viewer's perception using different music, even with the same visuals. The right song will elevate your video to another level and assist in relaying your feelings and emotions to the viewers. The following examples will illustrate how changing the audio changes the impression of the video.

### Example #1

Let's say you have a video of someone walking through the woods. Now without music audio, your video will be boring. You can quickly fix this by adding an upbeat song to make your video more energetic.

![adding an uplifting beat to your video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/the-power-of-music-in-videos-1.gif)

Using the same visuals, you can add a more tense and dramatic song, like from a horror movie. You have successfully changed the entire vibe of the same video from "inspiring" to "sinister." It proves the importance of the balance between audio and visuals.

![adding scary music to your video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/the-power-of-music-in-videos-2.gif)

### Example #2

For a better understanding, let's look at a movie scene we all know and love. Take the entrance scene from Avengers: Endgame. The music used by the producer aims to excite the audience while building up the hype for the upcoming battle. However, if we change the audio of this scene, we end up with a completely different set of emotions that might not go too well with the shot.

![changing the music of a movie scene](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/the-power-of-music-in-videos-3.gif)

Now that we've seen how crucial audio can be in a video, let's see how to choose the best music audio for your video.

## Tip #1: Identify the mood

As we've demonstrated before, the audio can change the entire mood of the video. The right music for any video will be the one that compliments the spirit of the visuals and relays the emotions the producer intended.

![identifying the mood of the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/the-power-of-music-in-videos-4.gif)

Rewatch your recorded clips until you know the mood portrayed by the visuals. Select music that matches the spirit of your visuals. For example, you would use different music for a sunny day compared to a cloudy day. Once you've figured out the mood and understand the emotions you want to elicit, search for audio that achieves this and balances out your visuals.

## Tip #2: Video and music style

We've already established that different styles of music complement other types of videos. So, keep the type of your video in consideration. For example, is your video fast-paced and full of action, or is it more serious in nature, like an interview or documentary?

![matching the video and audio styles](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/the-power-of-music-in-videos-5.gif)

Once you have music that matches your video style, check the audio wave. The four most common patterns are steady, ascending, descending, or furious. The audio wave will help you select the visuals that best match that audio.

![identifying the audio wave](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/the-power-of-music-in-videos-6.gif)

For example, if you're using audio with an ascending audio wave, you would use visuals that build up with the audio. The beat drop will signal the transition to reveal a powerful shot.

## Tip #3: Don't force the music

As emphasized before, your music should match your video. We all have a favorite music genre, but sometimes that may not go well with our visuals. For example, you love country music but have a video about the nightlife in the city. Using country music in a video about the town does not match well and will confuse your audience.

![adding mismatched audio to a video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/the-power-of-music-in-videos-7.gif)

To get music that best suits our video, we must be open and explore all music genres. You'll see how easy it is to scout a song that fits perfectly with your visuals. The easiest way is to choose a song that gives out the same emotions as intended by the visuals.

## Final Words

Now, you clearly understand the importance of music in videos. The right music can uplift your video into a viral sensation, while the wrong music track will turn your video into a catastrophe. Remember to review the legalities of copyright and infringement before using any music in your videos to avoid legal issues. Make sure you have permission to use the music or use royalty-free music.

Share this article with your friends and family interested in making stunning videos with perfect music audio. Comment below on your favorite scene from a movie or show where the music perfectly matched the visuals and left you with goosebumps.

## How to Add a Custom Transition to OBS

OBS Studio is an open-source video editor that is widely popular for live streaming on online platforms. Even though OBS is a completely free application, its features are comparable to any premium video editor. We always look for available transition effects in a video editor and OBS takes it to the next level by allowing users to add custom transitions.

Among custom transitions, Stinger transitions have gained a lot of traction from the users. Stinger transitions are made popular by sports channels who use Stinger frequently whenever there is a change in the scene. We will illustrate how to add custom transitions in OBS and apply Stinger transitions in your video.

## Part 1\. What is Stinger in OBS

Stinger is a special type of customized animated video transition effect that is available in the latest version of OBS Studio. It is a combination of a transparent video animation and a cut transition. Stinger begins with the transparent video animation that grows into full-screen overlay, and it is followed by the cut transition. After the cut transition, you place the next scene or video clip. You will notice Stinger transition whenever sports channels show an instant replay during a live match.

The transparent video animation starts on top of the current video you are editing. When the animation expands and covers up the entire screen, you place the cut transition, and thereafter, you place the next video clip or scene as per your requirement. Some customized stinger effect also includes audio effects along with video effect.

## Part 2\. How to add stinger transitions to OBS

The Stinger transition is available on OBS Studio and Streamlabs, and both of them are open-source and free applications. Before you add stinger transition, you should have a video animation ready that you will play on top of the current video followed by the cut transition effect. You can download several stinger video animations from the internet and include any of them in OBS while adding stinger transition. Here are the steps on how to add a custom transition to OBS.

Step1 Go to Scene Transitions section and click on Effects option to open the drop-down menu.

Step2 From the drop-down menu, click on “Add: Stinger” option.

![add stinger obs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/add-stinger-obs.jpg)

Step3 Give a name to the Stinger transition and click Ok button.

![name stinger transition obs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/name-stinger-transition-obs.jpg)

Step4 You will see Properties window now. Click on Browser button against Video file and select the transparent video animation file that you want to play on top of the current video before applying the cut transition effect.

![apply cut transition effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/apply-cut-transition-effects.jpg)

Step5 For Transition Point Type, select Time(milliseconds) option. In the Transition Point field, add the duration of the transparent video animation so that the transition to the next scene takes place immediately after the video animation gets completed.

![select transition point field](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/select-transition-point-field.jpg)

Step6 If your video animation has audio, go to Audio Monitoring and select Monitor and Output option from the dropdown. For Audio Fade Style, you can select Crossfade option for better output.

![audio monitor output obs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/audio-monitor-output-obs.jpg)

Step7 Scroll down and click on Preview Transition button to check if the stinger transition is taking place as expected. You can adjust the transition point and other parameters to get it perfect.

![preview stinger transition](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/preview-stinger-transition.jpg)

Step8 Finally, click on Ok button and play the video to check out the stinger transition on the big screen.

The steps on how to add a custom transition to Streamlabs OBS are almost similar, and therefore, you can add stinger transition using Streamlabs comfortably.

## Part 3\. OBS Alternative to Add Transitions

There is no denying the fact that OBS Studio has a complicated user interface. That is why most amateur video editors find OBS Studio difficult to learn quickly even though there is no dearth of features. Apart from add custom transition OBS, there are very limited effects available on OBS Studio. That is why many users look for an OBS alternative to add transitions to their videos.
