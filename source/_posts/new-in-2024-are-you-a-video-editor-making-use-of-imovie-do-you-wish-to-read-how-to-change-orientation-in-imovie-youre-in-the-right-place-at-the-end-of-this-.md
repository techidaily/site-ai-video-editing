## **Part 1: What is Rotating Video and Why**

Rotating a video means changing its orientation. A video clip can turn in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction, in 90° increments. Different video-making and editing software or applications have other steps to carry out this process. However, the result is the same for all, a change in the orientation of the video.

People rotate video clips for a variety of reasons. Here are some reasons as to why you may want to change video orientation in iMovie:

* Video stylization: While a rotated video may look disoriented, editors sometimes use the technique to convey a particular mood or emotion.
* Continuity: Video clip rotation can help you correct production errors or last-minute effect changes.
* Correct disorientation: Sometimes, as a result of errors while shooting, especially when using a mobile device, some video clips may appear in a lateral direction; video rotation can help fix this.
* Create horizontal videos: With a change in video orientation, you can make some footage like backgrounds appear vertically or horizontally.

Now that you know what video rotation is and some of the reasons people choose to change a video's orientation, let's now dive right into rotating videos in iMovie. And move ahead to lead from other video editors with this change orientation of video in iMovie technique going to discuss below.
