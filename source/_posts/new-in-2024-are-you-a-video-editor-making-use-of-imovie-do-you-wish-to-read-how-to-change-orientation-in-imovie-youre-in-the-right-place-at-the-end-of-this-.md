#### Step 2： Rotate the MP4 clips

Now, from the User's Album, drag the MP4 file to be rotated to the video track on the timeline. Double click the MP4 video thumbnail to reveal the Rotate options, allowing you to rotate your video in one click. There are four rotation related options in Wondershare Filmora:

* Rotate the clip 90° in a clockwise direction and continuously. This way, you can rotate the clip 90°, 180°, and 270°.
* Rotate the clip 90° in an anticlockwise direction and constantly.
* Flip the Video horizontally in an upside-down fashion.
* Flip the Video vertically left to right.
