## Movavi Slideshow Maker Is a Powerful Video Editing Tool that Can Be Used to Add Rich Effects to Videos Easily. This Guide Will Introduce the Features and Show You How to Apply Effects to Videos with This Tool

Many video editors won't be late in their artwork. They tend to use different effects to light up their crafts. For them, editing videos with effects applications gives more life to the story. In this composition, you will learn more about Effects, and if you are just about to do your video editing right now, these details are definitely for you.

## What are Video Effects?

According to the dictionary, an effect is brought about by a cause or an agency.

In video editing, there are a few video effects you must know to apply them to your video project. Video effects can alter the speed and produce distortions, reflections, aesthetic filters, stylistic color grading, animation transitions, and more. They can also contain 3D features like CGI. When used well, these effects improve the narrative, the atmosphere, and the images' overall impact.

Let's dissect a few of the major effects, which will be most helpful to you.

**Pans and Tilts**

Your first thought upon hearing these two words may be tripod motions. Pans and tilts are a quick way to add additional movement and sensation to your video, making it more dynamic.

**Change the Speed/Duration**

One feature that virtually every NLE or Non-Linear Editing software gives us is the option to modify the playback speed of your video while reducing or increasing the actual duration and tempo of your segments. Slowing down your footage to match the frame rate at which the video was initially captured is one of the critical explanations for doing this.

To incorporate some frantic or chaotic moments into your production, you can use this to generate slow-motion shots and fast-forward effects. This effect can also quickly pan through footage for humorous effect. Find the "Speed/Duration" option under Effects controls to accomplish this.

**Light Leaks and Flares**

Nothing gives your video a more ethereal vibe than gentle, warm light emerging from the scene. A direct source visible in the photo may be the source of this light, or it may enter the frame from the edge. You've probably seen these flares and leaks countless times in movies, whether they were added in post-production or resulted from the cinematographer's lens choice. You can select where the light comes from if it doesn't distract from the task. Remember that these spills and flares must contribute to the narrative while remaining barely perceptible to the viewer.

**Retro/VHS Effects**

While light leaks and lens flares give your movie or film a timeless feel, nothing gives it a dated or, one would say, "scrappy" vibe. The grunge appearance of the '90s is in right now, and one of the most popular effects is the VHS look.

There are several ways to get this effect. Applying a preset, essentially a LUT (look-up table or filter), to your color grade will make the image appear fuzzier, desaturated, and blurrier (using the different alpha and gamma channels). This will cause "chroma errors," which result from poor recordings and a lack of a flying erase head (a function that enables you to record over previously filmed video; imagine formatting your SD card while the video is still present on the card and you are simply recording over it), giving your images an outline of distorted blues and reds.

**Color Grading and Color Correction**

Besides actual editing, color grading and correction are arguably the most significant post-production steps. With the help of these tools, you may alter skin tones, highlight, and shadow levels, add vignettes, experiment with contrast, and much more. We'll briefly go through one aspect of color grading—the ability to adjust particular colors in your image—even though this subject needs its ebook.

**Adding Overlays**

Although we've talked about adding overlays, such as VHS effects or light leaks, you may use many other editing overlays to add particular components to your shot, including weather particles!

**Using Titles and Motion Graphics**

Motion graphics and clean titles are essential for any video that wishes to appear professional. These could be subtitles, and the animation logo reveals post-credits, lower thirds, or even major titles. There are various free typefaces available that you may use to make your project stand out, regardless of the program you're working in.

Once you've selected the appropriate font, color, and weight, it's time to move on to motion graphics. These are crucial because they may transform a clear, ageless title or text into a lively, entertaining illustration of the product or concept your movie is attempting to market.

The abundance of tutorials nowadays makes learning the fundamentals of motion graphics a piece of cake. As I previously stated, you can access all the various effects and movements you might need, regardless of the editing program, you use.

These various methods and approaches need the practice to perfect, just like any other component of filmmaking. As you add these video editing effects to your editing toolkit, there will undoubtedly be a lot of trial and error. Still, eventually, they will become second nature to your workflow.

**Importance of Applying Effects to your Video**

Almost from the first motion film, cinematic storytelling and video effects have gone hand in hand. They can improve a scene, create something that doesn't exist, hide an error, and do much more. In essence, they assist a filmmaker in telling a tale in the manner they desire.

## Applying Effects using Movavi Slideshow Maker

## Adding Transition Effect

Transitions guide your audience.

From the opening to the very end, they structure the movie. There are numerous typical forms, including the wipe, dissolve, split-cut, and many others. Film editors use transitions to transfer a scene from one video clip to another practice. Transitions don't need to be visible.

Step1 Click the **Transition** tab.

![click transition movavi slideshow maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/click-transition-movavi-slideshow-maker.jpg)

Step2 Choose your desired Transition effect depending on your preferred category.

![preview filter effect movavi slideshow maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/preview-filter-effect-movavi-slideshow-maker.jpg)

Step4 If you finally chose a Transition effect, drag it between each imported video.

**_Note:_** Transition effects can also be applied even if you have only one video. You can put transitions effects either at the start of the video, which could make your video introduction more appealing. Also, you can set the Transition effect at the end of the video, which could give you a pleasant closing.

_Transition Effect at the end_

Point your cursor either on the left side of the symbol; the cursor will become a horizontal double-arrow to change the span of your Transition effect on the left video or on the right end side of the symbol to change the span of the Transition effect on the right video._

## Applying Titling Motion Effect

A logo is a brand image of a company, it's the face of a company and it represents the company out there in the market. In today's world, the most famous companies are recognized worldwide via their brand image. Be it the "big M" of McDonald's or the "horses" of Ferrari, we very well know these brands by their respective logos. A company's logo is hence one of the most essential parts of branding and marketing. Moreover, a logo is one of the first steps towards brand building. Only after deciding on a specific logo can a company begin its commercial operations. Therefore, an attractive transparent logo is highly essential. Wondering what a transparent logo PNG is? Well, today we shall tell you everything about a transparent logo, for instance, the transparent WhatsApp logo!

#### In this article

01 [What Is a Transparent Format and Where to Use a Transparent Logo](#Part 1)

02 [When Should You Use the PNG or Vector Format?](#Part 2)

03 [7 Popular Transparent Logo Examples You Might Want to Learn](#Part 3)

04 [How to Create One transparent Logo](#Part 4)

05 [How to Insert Transparent Logo in Video](#Part 5)

## Part 1 What Is a Transparent Format and Where to Use a Transparent Logo

A transparent logo is just a format of logos. It is generally in PNG format or vector format. So what differentiates a normal logo from a transparent logo? Well, the key differentiator between a regular logo and a transparent logo is that in a transparent logo, the background of the image file is transparent i.e. you cannot see a white or any other background in a transparent logo. This makes the logo more prominent and attractive. Since a logo is a key part of branding, an attractive transparent becomes all the more important for your brand's success and prosperity!

## Part 2 When Should You Use the PNG or Vector Format?

What's the difference between a white background and a transparent background? Well, a white background tends to outshine the logo and reduces the fanciness of the logo. On the other hand, a transparent background logo goes well with any background. For instance, if the page behind the logo is black, if you were to place a white background logo on a black page, it'd look absurd. On the other hand, if your logo's background is transparent, the color of the page wouldn’t matter. Your logo would look good irrespective of the background's color. Since you will use your logo on not just one but multiple platforms, it becomes highly important to have a transparent background for your logo. For instance, if you use your logo on a website with an off white background, a transparent logo would suit much better than a generic white background logo.

## Part 1 What Is a Transparent Format and Where to Use a Transparent Logo

A transparent logo is just a format of logos. It is generally in PNG format or vector format. So what differentiates a normal logo from a transparent logo? Well, the key differentiator between a regular logo and a transparent logo is that in a transparent logo, the background of the image file is transparent i.e. you cannot see a white or any other background in a transparent logo. This makes the logo more prominent and attractive. Since a logo is a key part of branding, an attractive transparent becomes all the more important for your brand's success and prosperity!

## Part 2 When Should You Use the PNG or Vector Format?

What's the difference between a white background and a transparent background? Well, a white background tends to outshine the logo and reduces the fanciness of the logo. On the other hand, a transparent background logo goes well with any background. For instance, if the page behind the logo is black, if you were to place a white background logo on a black page, it'd look absurd. On the other hand, if your logo's background is transparent, the color of the page wouldn’t matter. Your logo would look good irrespective of the background's color. Since you will use your logo on not just one but multiple platforms, it becomes highly important to have a transparent background for your logo. For instance, if you use your logo on a website with an off white background, a transparent logo would suit much better than a generic white background logo. Using a white background logo would make it look clumsy and would leave a disregarding first impression.
