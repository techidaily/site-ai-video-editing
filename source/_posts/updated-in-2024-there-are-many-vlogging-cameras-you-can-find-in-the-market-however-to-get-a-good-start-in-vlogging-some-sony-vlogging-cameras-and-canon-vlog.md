### 3\. GoPro Hero8 Black

Price: $349.98

GoPro is considered a department of professionals. However, we won't recommend the latest top-of-the-line models to beginners.

With live streaming under 1080p, this vlogging camera is the best option for rough vlogs.

Hyper-stabilization makes it quite compelling overall. Users are recommended to make great use of this vlogging camera if they're making a start in vlogging. Are you hyped up?
