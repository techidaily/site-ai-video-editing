![change the color of the outline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/neon-dance-effect-7.png)

##### Step6 Create Multiple Outlines

It would help if you created multiple outlines to achieve the Neon Dance effect. These multiple outlines will be produced by exporting them multiple times with the color you want. Follow the below points to get it instantly!

* When you have selected the color for your outline, export the video by clicking on the **Export** icon in the top right corner.

![export the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/neon-dance-effect-8.png)

* When you have exported the video, move back to the timeline to edit again.
* As we had selected the **Blue** color for reference, now choose another color you wish.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Export as many times as you want with the color of your choice. **E.g., 5 colors = 5 exports.**

##### Step7 Import the exported videos

* Now you have to import the videos that you exported.
* Before doing that, first, delete the video in track 2\. (The video on which we applied the **Difference**)
* Now select all the exports from your library and import them onto the import window.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You don't want all the outlines to play simultaneously. Otherwise, the outlines will not appear to be separate.

* To do so, stack the videos on each other on different tracks.

**Tip:** The trick here will be to offset the video by a few seconds so that each video plays a little later than the other.

![offset the videos by a few seconds](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/neon-dance-effect-9.png)

![change the blending mode to lighten](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/neon-dance-effect-10.png)

##### Step8 Add the Glow effect

To make the outlines glow like Neon lights, we will need to add another effect from the effects library.

* Go to the effects tab and search for "**Glow**."
* Click and **drag** the glow effect to each of the exported videos.

![add the glow effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/neon-dance-effect-11.gif)

AI can enhance the quality of content and the mechanism of crafting **slow-mo AI** video. It not only contributes to task achievement but also improves various aspects. Find out about the influence that AI has in achieving a perfect slow-mo effect below:

Users must activate this function, and AI will handle all the technicalities. The AI adds extra frames to your video to ensure a smooth, slow motion.

### 2\. Minimizing Artifacts

When you convert a video into slow motion, certain changes take place. It introduces artifacts such as motion blur or unwanted distortions. They decline the quality of content, and the view becomes distorted. Reducing these factors magnifies the slow-motion effect and brings perfection to it.
