## How Can You DIY VHS Overlay in After Effects?

The 90s generation is familiar with Video Home System video. Today, Moviemakers use VHS static overlay to give their videos an antique and vintage look.

The VHS glitch overlay has become increasingly popular as it changes the video's theme, tone, and whole look. Let's see how we can add DIY VHS overlay in after effects-

## Part 1：Step by Step DIY VHS Overlay in After Effects?

The retro "VHS Look" has become relatively trendy in recent years. The memories associated with the popular VHS trend has helped the trend make a comeback. Creating this effect in After Effects may seem to be a complicated process if you have not tried it before. But we have made it easier for you to add VHS overlay in Adobe After Effects. Follow the steps to add it in after effects-

Before you begin, download and install VHS preset if you haven't already. Remember that VHS preset only works with After Effects CC 2018 and up. So, make sure you have the recent version of After Effects or the one not older than the 2018 version.

Step 1: To create a VHS look on your video, drop any video of your choice into the project panel and give it a name, let's say, "VCR static overlay". Set the width and height to 1920 and 1080 px, respectively.

![changing composition settings on after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/changing-composition-settings-on-after-effects.jpg)

Step 2: Right-click on your video and select New Comp from Selection. Drag your video to a new composition and then go to Lumetri Color < Basic Correction. Add some contrast. You can set it to 50 or any other number of your choice. Then bring the white level down to -55.

![getting lumetri color effect to get vhs look](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/using-lumetri-color-effect-to-get-vhs-look.jpg)

Then open the Creative tab. Increase the faded film to 40\. Set sharpening to -70\. Bring vibrance to -30.

Note: Here, I changed the number to get the effect I wanted. You can change the numbers and set the values as per your requirements.

Now, click on the Curves option. Drag down the white curve and then align it with the original curve. Move the green curve up a bit and bring down the blue curve. Then comes the Vignette tab. Open it and set the number to -1.

![changing white green and blue curves on after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/changing-white-green-and-blue-curve-on-after-effects.jpg)

Step 3: Now, we will give our video a subtle RGB spit appearance. For that, we need to use the Channel Blur effect twice. First, go to Effect < Blur & Sharpen < Channel Blur. Set red blurriness to 20\. Turn on the repeat edge pixels. Then change the Blur Dimensions from horizontal and vertical to vertical.

![giving rgb split appearance to video with channel blur](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/giving-rgb-split-appearance-to-video-with-channel-blur.jpg)

Step 4: Again, go to Effect < Blur & Sharpen < Channel Blur. Set blue blurriness to 30\. Repeat the process of checking the repeat edge pixels box. Change the Blue Dimensions from horizontal and vertical to horizontal.

Step 5: Next comes giving the video artificial sharpening look using Unsharp Mask. So, go to Effect < Blur & Sharpen < Unsharp Mask. Under the Unmask Mask menu, set the amount to 100 and the radius to 10.

![using unsharp mask to give you video sharpening look](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/using-unsharp-mask-to-give-your-video-sharpening-look.jpg)

Step 6: To add a font to your video, simply search VHS font on Google. Look for the one you want to use in your video and download it. To give your video that authentic VHS-style look, we suggest downloading free VCR OSD Mono font and installing the font on your system.

Step 7: Go to Layer < New < Solid and choose any color. We chose white. Now, under Effects & Presets, search for a number. Drag it to the white solid. Choose the font VCR OSD Mono. You can change the number to time or date. You can also add time manually. Select the text tool, go to the source text, hold alt, and click on the stopwatch. Write "timeToCurrentFormat() and time will be displayed on the video. Let us say we want to see the date on the video instead of time. So, change the time to date. Drag the date to the bottom right of the video to give it the look of an old VHS tape.

If you are a beginner and want a simple VHS effect, you can follow these easy steps and create the VHS video that will transport you back to the 90s.

![filmora video editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/reverse-option-filmora-toolbar.jpg)

Speaking of the best AMV video maker, I would recommend Filmora as the first choice. It is easy to learn and use for beginner, and come with rich video editing features: split screen, key framing, motion tracking, speed ramping, instant mode, speech to text, audio ducking and more.

Meanwhile, it also helps teachers or business people to record tutorials, files or PowerPoint from their screen wit no limit. For vloggers and other advanced users, Filmora provides green screen, AI Protrait, colorful video effect templates, color match and so forth. You can directly share the video to YouTube, Vimeo and other social media platforms.

**Adobe Premiere**

Best For: Animators, professional cartoonists, and marketers

Supported OS: Windows and Mac

![adobe premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-premiere-pro.jpg)

Adobe Premiere is a video editing program that can be used to create and edit all types of video projects including AMVs. It has numerous features that can make it very easy to come up with the most professional video that you want to create. Because of these very many, but very useful features, using Adobe Premiere can be difficult at first. But once you gate a hang of it, it is one of the best ways to create any video including AMVs.

Adobe Premiere can be used on both Mac and Windows operating systems and it is compatible with most video and audio formats. But like most Adobe software it is not a free solution. You do get a 7-day free trial that you can use without limitation, but you will need to pay a subscription fee to continue using it.

**Apple iMovie**

Best For: Marketers, freelancers, YouTubers, Bloggers

Supported OS: Mac

![apple imovie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/imovie-interface.jpg)

Apple iMovie is one of the best video editing programs for Mac and is therefore one of the best tools to choose if you will be creating your AMV on a Mac. It has all the basic video editing features that you need for a project of this magnitude including the ability to merge videos and apply filters.

This makes it the most ideal tool for creating AMVs since you typically need to break a file into various sections for your AMV. You can then add audio to the video and choose one of the effects and filters to add to it. Once the video is complete, you can then export it in 4K resolution or upload it to YouTube directly.

**Sony Vegas**

Best For: Animators, Marketers, Video Editors and Bloggers

Supported OS: Windows and Mac

![sony vegas](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vegas-pro.jpg)

If you are looking for a program that is designed with AMVs in mind then Sony Vegas might be a good choice. Its main purpose is to help users create stunning anime videos and it has all the necessary features to make that happen.

Sony Vegas comes with a universal editor that allows you to create your video using the multi-cam editing feature or crossfades. You can also add various effects to the video including various colors and other special effects. But as you can probably guess, Sony Vegas may be a bit complicated for the beginner user, although there are numerous tutorials to help you through this process.

**Final Cut Pro**

Best For: Marketers, Animators, YouTubers, Freelancers, and Professional video editors

Supported OS: Windows and Mac

![final cut pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/final-cut-pro.jpg)

Final Cut Pro is another professional and highly effective video editor that you can use to create AMVs. It has very many video editing capabilities, allowing you to edit your video in numerous ways including cropping, rotating, blending, and more. It also has over 100 different transitions and more than 149 different visual effects to create your video any way you want to.

But perhaps the best feature that Final Cut Pro has when it comes to creating and editing AMV videos is the ability to organize and crop videos easily. The “Compounding Clips” feature, in particular, will come in handy when combining footage, soundtracks, and effects into one perfect AMV.

**Lightworks**

Best For: YouTubers, Freelancers, Bloggers, and Marketers

Supported OS: Windows and Mac

![lightworks video editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lightworks-video-editor.jpg)

Lightworks is an easy-to-use solution that you can use to create stunning AMV videos. The drag and drop interface makes it the most ideal solution even for beginners and it offers a lot of options for designing and customizing the videos. One other major benefit of choosing Lightworks is that it does come with a free version that is not as limited as you would expect.

The timeline is easy to use, allowing you to create AMVs from scratch or merge clips to create the video. You can also use numerous effects on the video and even add music to the video.

**Windows Movie Maker**

Best For: Freelancers, bloggers, marketers, and YouTubers

Supported OS: Windows

![windows movie maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/windows-movie-maker.png)

Windows Movie Maker is one of the most popular video editing tools on the Windows OS and it has all the necessary editing features that you will need when you want to create AMV videos. On this free video editing tool, you can cut, split and crop the video or even add audio files and subtitles as needed,

It can work with numerous video and image formats, offering a wide range of options when it comes to video editing. Some of the functions that you can expect to use include video trimming, which can easily be done by simply dragging the slider to the desired location. But you will find that Windows Movie Maker lacks some of the features that can make your AMVs truly stand out.

## Best AMV Maker for Mobile Phones

If you want to make AMVs on your mobile device, the following are some of the best options;

**Filmora**
