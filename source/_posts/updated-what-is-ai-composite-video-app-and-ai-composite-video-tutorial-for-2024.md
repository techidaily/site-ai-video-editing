Handbrake is a video editing tool that allows you to rotate videos. It is a free and open source software that is available on Windows, Mac, and Linux. It is used to convert video files from one format to another. You can use it to compress videos, add subtitles, or create chapters. It also allows you to rotate videos in different directions. You can use it to fix videos that are not aligned properly or that have been filmed upside down. A handbrake is a popular tool because it is easy to use and it has a variety of features.

## Step-by-step on how to rotate videos using Handbrake

When you import a video into the Handbrake software, it will by default be in a "landscape" orientation, with the long edge of the video oriented horizontally. If you want to rotate the video 90 degrees counterclockwise so that it appears "vertical," or if you want to rotate it 180 degrees so that it is upside down, you can do so by following these two steps:

Step 1: Open the Handbrake software and import your video.

Step 2: Click on the "Dimensions" tab at the top of the Handbrake window.

Step 5: Click on the "Preview" button at the bottom of the Handbrake window to see a preview of how your rotated video will look. When you are satisfied with the rotation, click on the "Start Encode" button to begin the encoding process.

![rotate-video-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-handbrake-5.png)

The Handbrake software also offers a "Flip" option which you can do after rotating it, which allows you to slip the video after rotating it. To use this option, follow these steps:

Under the "Orientation and Cropping" section, Go to Rotation and choose the degrees that best is best for your rotation requirements.

![rotate-video-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-handbrake-6.png)

Click on "Flip" to flip your video horizontally.

![rotate-video-handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-handbrake-7.png)

## Part 2: Different Sony Cameras Offering S&Q Feature

There is no lack of devices that help you capture any scene with perfection. Someone obsessed with videography can understand the worth of a high-quality camera. Sony launched two such products named A7iii and **Sony ZV E10 slow motion**. Both are high-output, professional-grade cameras to assist in slo-mo creation. Here is a brief review of these cameras for you to compare and select better:

### 1\. Sony A7 III

**Sony** **A7iii slow motion** camera launch occurred in 2018 with a bundle of features. This camera offers 120fps video capture for creating slomos or high-speed effects. It has an APS-C size, 24.2-megapixel, and an Exmor CMOS sensor for more precise results. In addition, it possesses a 4K Ultra-High Resolution of 3840 x 2160 for videos. The camera also has an LCD touch screen, which proves productive in settings.

### 2\. Sony ZV-E10

This is an upgraded **S&Q** **mode** **Sony** camera that first emerged in 2021 with a fully articulated screen. It has an APS-C size, 24.2-megapixel, and an Exmor CMOS sensor for balanced shooting.

## Part 3: How to Slow Down Video in Sony Vegas Pro?

[Vegas Pro](https://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/us/vegas-pro/) stands amongst the top video editors who excel at creating slow motions. With its powerful speed manipulation, it can curate cinematic slo-mo effects. In addition, the tool offers an Optical Flow option for ultra-high-quality slomos. It offers a non-linear timeline editing, which means selective durations to apply this effect. Given below is the step-by-step guide to **Sony V** **egas** [**slow motion**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**:**

##### Step 1

After launching the software, import the video and bring it to the timeline.

![import media in timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/slow-motion-videos-with-sony-sq-7.jpg)

##### Step 2

Navigate towards the editing panel where the clip and audio track are showing. Place your cursor at the finishing line of the clip and stretch it throughout the timeline. This will add a slow-motion effect to your video.

![drag the import media in timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/slow-motion-videos-with-sony-sq-8.jpg)

## Part 4: Wondershare Filmora: Comprehending the Best Alternative for Slowing Down Videos

All the above slow-motion solutions are adequate but not reliable. This is because shooting in **So** **ny** **S&** **Q mode** declines video quality upon export. In addition, the **Sony** **Vegas slow motion** subscription plans start at more than $500\. This seems expensive for someone who just started editing and is a beginner.

[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is the perfect alternative to **S** **ony** **ZY** **E10 slow motion** and other devices. It offers an intuitive speed change interface at affordable prices. In addition, there is more than one method to alter its speed with optical flow. Moreover, the software offers extensive export settings to set video resolution.
