## Part 2: How to Create LUTs Using LUT Generator Free Download?

If you don't want to apply online LUTs that are available, you can create your own. To do so, you have to download the LUT Generator tool and follow these simple steps to create LUTs.

##### Step1

To create a LUT of your liking, search for the LUT Generator free download on your browser and download the tool.

##### Step4

Click the "Convert to CUBE" button in the LUT Generator and select the modified PNG HALD you saved in the previous step.

##### Step5

In Preferences, choose the desired size of the 3D LUT as .CUBE format. You can choose between 25x25x25 or 64x64x64\. After selecting your desired size, your customized LUT will be created in .CUBE format.

## Part 3: How to Create Online LUTs Using Online LUT Creator?

There are two methods to create a LUT online and offline. Previously you've learned to generate LUTs using offline tools. However, you can also create LUTs online without installing any tool. This portion will teach you how to create online LUTs in this step-by-step guide.

##### Step1

Import your photo into Lightroom by dragging and dropping it. You can also import the file by clicking the "File" button and selecting "Import Photos and Video." For best results, ensure that the photo you will edit is still.

![import media to lightroom](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/06/create-luts-with-luts-generator-2.jpg)

##### Step2

Edit your photo inside the “Develop” module in Lightroom with your desired preference and style. Only apply changes affecting the colors, not adjustments like noise reduction, vignette, or grain.

![open develop module and make changes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/06/create-luts-with-luts-generator-3.jpg)

##### Step3

Download the original PNG from <www.onlinelutcreator.com/lutcreator>. Import it into Lightroom as you did in the first step.

![download identity png](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/06/create-luts-with-luts-generator-4.jpg)

##### Step4

Right-click on your edited photo in the Develop module. Click "Develop Settings," and select "Copy Settings." After that, a new window will pop up; make sure you have the same things checked as in the screenshot.

![open develop module and copy settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/06/create-luts-with-luts-generator-5.jpg)

##### Step5

Right-click the original downloaded PNG file in the Develop module. Go to "Develop Settings," and choose "Paste Settings." This will paste the settings from your edited photo onto the original PNG.

![paste settings in original png](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/06/create-luts-with-luts-generator-6.jpg)
