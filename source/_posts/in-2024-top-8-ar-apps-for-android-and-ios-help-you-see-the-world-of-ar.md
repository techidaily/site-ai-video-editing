Masks are a feature of editing software that allows you to choose a particular portion of the video or utilize video overlays to hide, duplicate, reveal, or change your footage.

Chroma-keying: Chroma-keying is a type of masking that makes use of color to isolate a particular area of the frame. For example, this is often used to remove a green or blue screen from the footage, but can also be used to isolate other colors.

## Cropping a Video in Davinci Resolve [Step by Step]

Sometimes, when it comes to editing a video, we don’t even know where to start, because there are too many options –online platforms which instantly help us edit our clips, without lengthy process of downloading and installing computer programs;

Mobile applications with user-friendly interface, allowing us to manipulate the footage quickly, easily choose our preferred formats and effects and adjust the clips according to the requirements our target platforms set; more time-consuming and advanced software with even more options, but which seem to require us to be more skilled and experienced in editing.

Even though editing, as other innovative and creative actions, is limitless in its possibilities, sometimes we just need to make a little change in our project and it’s quite enough for us to be satisfied with our work and material. One of the things which is rather simple to do, but sometimes essential, when it comes to making our clips better and more picturesque for the audience, is cropping a video.

Cropping, in its essence, is great to “hide” some unnecessary objects in our video, and/or highlight the main ones. In this article, we discuss how to crop a video in a software called DaVinci Resolve, in simple little steps, how to export our work and lastly, what would be the alternate way to do the same in other computer program.

## Part 1\. How to crop a video in Davinci Resolve

First and foremost, let’s get to know Davinci Resolve! As mentioned above, it is a software, so let’s be well-aware that we have to download and install it on our computer systems. Of course, it takes a bit of time, but to be able to use an advanced software, it’s totally worth it. If we are to search for the information about Davinci Resolve, we come across the following description: “color grading and non-linear video editing application for macOS, Windows, and Linux”. So, no matter which system we have, we can count on this software, which is a real advantage!

![crop-video-davinci](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-davinci-1.jpeg)

To touch upon the functions, Davinci Resolve includes modules for video editing, color correction, audio mixing and effects, and visual effects. The interface of it is quite advanced, but would be well and soon understandable for someone who has ever used a similar editing software, such as Adobe Premiere Pro. If you are interested in everything the software has to offer, we recommend watching this very viral beginner [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63Ln33O4p4c).

Now, back to cropping – so, you want to crop the video you took or got somehow, and you also think about using Davinci Resolve? Cropping, in most cases, meaning different applications, platforms and software, is not a complicated task at all, and you can do it in a very short amount of time in Davinci Resolve, too. Therefore, let’s delve into the steps on how to do it!

First, download and install the software, and when it is finished, launch it. You will see a totally clean program, until you add the video you want to work on. To do so, you have to find File in the top menu, find Import and then choose Media.

![crop-video-davinci](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-davinci-2.jpeg)

Then it will open a new window where you can choose your file…

![crop-video-davinci](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-davinci-3.jpeg)

Your chosen file will be added in Media Pool, and to direct it into the sequence, you have to drag and drop it there.

![crop-video-davinci](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-davinci-4.jpeg)

![crop-video-davinci](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-davinci-5.jpeg)

And then you might have difficulty to find the crop button. But here it is – below the screen, on the left, there are two icons, and the second one says – Tools…

![crop-video-davinci](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-davinci-6.jpeg)

 Click on the Tools button and more options will appear down the screen where the video clip is shown. And there, you will notice the famous Crop icon, just the second one, which will put your clip in a new window with the option below to crop each side, plus, to add feather around the cropped video.

![crop-video-davinci](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-davinci-7.jpeg)

When you are ready to make a video bigger and adjust it to a frame size, you need to choose Transform button, left to the Crop icon. You can “touch” the dots on the video and manually manage the size of your cropped clip.

![crop-video-davinci](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-davinci-8.jpeg)

![crop-video-davinci](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-davinci-9.jpeg)

## Backup and Organize Your Tons of Footage in Minutes

Backing up your data is deemed significantly necessary among video editing communities. Files get corrupted easily. Having a backup drive can save your day and countless hours. You can back up your data any way you deem fit. However, it will do you right if you follow the advice of professionals.

The article is written explicitly after due consideration and suggestions from the professional video editor. You can follow the steps in it to make backup files. Let us start with very straightforward steps to help you understand the professional way of backing up and organizing your footage.

## Part 1\. Back Up Your Files

Backing up your files gives you peace of mind. If one file is lost, the whole project becomes vulnerable to failure. Therefore, every effort must be made to ensure the protection of files. The best way to protect the files from any misfortune is to back them up.

Remember, there is no specific way to back up your files. Depending on the project's requirements, you can do that differently. The following steps will light up how you can back up your files.

##### Step1Back up your files in two different places

It is crucial to do that. If one backup drive corrupts, you have the second option. It gives you an opportunity to back up files.

* You can make two different external backup hard drives.

![back up your data on two different external drives](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/back-up-your-data-on-two-different-external-drive.jpg)

* You can also use your internal and external devices as two backup options.

![back up your data on an internal and external hard drive](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/back-up-your-data-on-an-internal-and-external-hard-drive.jpg)

##### Step2Make specific folders for each purpose of the video

The next step is how you back up your files properly and safely. Make separate folders for the different formats you are importing in your drive. Always use the primary source to make a copy of your files.

Follow the steps below to understand how to back up your files in two drives.

* Create a folder in your drive.
* Name it. You can name it according to the given format. The choice is yours.

![format for naming your file](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/format-for-naming-your-file.jpg)

* Your backup folder is created.
* Make new folders based on the files that are imported into the file. We are making two folders for the project, 01 Footage, and 02 Audio.  
  * 01 Footage is for the original footage.  
  * 02 Audio is for audio files provided by the music artist.

![make folders for different formats in the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/make-folders-for-different-formats-in-the-video.jpg)

##### Step3Repeat the same process in your second backup drive

* Make the same folders and sub-folders in your secondary backup drive.

![secondary storage device with same folder names](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/secondary-storage-device-with-same-folder-names.jpg)

##### Step4Transfer files to your primary and secondary folders

* Transfer files to folders and sub-folders in your first backup drive.
* Transfer files to folders and sub-folders in your secondary backup drive.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Most people make the mistake of making a backup drive and then using the same drive to make the second backup. The approach needs to be corrected.

We are done with backing up our files. It is time to organize the files in your drive.

## Part 2\. Organize Your Files in [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Organizing your files is vital for any operation in video and editing. It makes everything streamlined. The risk of losing your data become negligible. Let us enlighten you on how you can organize your files.

##### Step1Create new folders to lay the foundation for your video editing project

You can imitate the format we have chosen. However, you can choose any way you deem fit.

* Create 02 Project Files and 03 Exports.
* 02 Project contains the files that we will edit in [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).
* 03 Exports will have files that will be exported out of Filmora.

![create more folders for the different formats of data](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/create-more-folders-for-the-different-formats-of-data.jpg)

* In the 01 Media folder, create a new folder, 03 Graphics. It will contain graphics the artist will provide, such as a logo. You can also add your graphics to the folder if you want.
