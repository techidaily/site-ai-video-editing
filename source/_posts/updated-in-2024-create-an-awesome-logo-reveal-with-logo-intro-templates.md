## People Also Ask

Before we bid you goodbye, let's answer some commonly asked questions about template intro logo and logo reveals.

### Q1\. What Is a Logo Intro?

You have probably seen a logo intro before, even though you didn't know what you were looking at. A logo intro is a short clip of a company's logo that features before a movie.

Recently, companies have started warming up to logo intros to create a lasting impression on their visitors and prospective clients. You could use a logo intro to portray your unique character and encapsulate what you stand for. In addition, a logo intro is a sure way to gain a competitive advantage over your rivals.

### Q2\. What Is a Logo Reveal?

Contrary to the logo intro that features at the beginning of the clip, a logo reveal comes at the tail end. This short animation is a depiction of your logo, which helps cement your marketing strategy and display your brand in a more interactive manner.

A logo reveal is also known as a logo stinger or sting. Since the average attention span of Internet users is pretty short, it would be a great idea to keep the logo reveal to a maximum of 10 seconds. The shorter the video, the higher the chance your audience will grasp your message and remember your brand.

### Q3\. What Are the 5 Rules of a Good Logo?

You cannot create an unforgettable logo reveal without designing the logo first. Since your company logo appears on almost anything concerning your business, it would be wise to make a valiant effort to ensure it fits the bill. Below are some of the qualities of a good logo.

![5 rules of a good logo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/rules-of-good-logo.jpg)

**Unique**

It would be a shame if your logo looked like someone else's. Ensure your logo is your own creation and can easily be associated with your brand. Copying someone else's logo could make your audience mistake you for someone else.

**Simple**

Complex logos are hard to recognize. They are also much harder to enlarge or reduce. It would help to incorporate strong lines and letters into your logo as opposed to thinner ones.

**Versatile**

Your logo should look good with or without colour. If you must add colour, ensure you don't exceed four colours in the design. Remember that printing your logo when it contains too many colours becomes an expensive affair.

**Scalability**

It would help to ensure that your logo looks good in a big or small size. Remember that you will use your logo on letterheads and perhaps on large banners.

**Balanced**

Lastly, you should ensure that no element within your logo overpowers the rest. Ensure you keep all the elements in the centre because an asymmetrical logo with all the details in the corner doesn't look aesthetically pleasing.

### Q4\. What Are the 7 Elements of a Good Logo?

The seven elements of a good logo include the following.

**Memorability**

A good logo is one that your audience can remember off-head. Simple doesn't always have to mean simplistic.

**Relevance**

It would be wise to ensure your logo relates to your industry in one way or the other.

**High-quality typography**

The wrong font on your logo can negatively impact your business. Your typography should also be easy to read from afar.

**Well-balanced colors**

Your choice of colors can subconsciously influence your target audience's buying decisions and how they perceive you. For instance, blue communicates honesty and reliability, while yellow elicits feelings of happiness.

**Versatility**

Lastly, it would be wise to ensure that you can use your logo in numerous instances, like on a letterhead or on your social media platforms.

## Part I. The Most Successful Video Practises of Brand Storytelling

### 1\. Spotify - All Ears On You

Since 2008, Spotify has continued gathering as much information (personal preferences, likes, and dislikes) about their audiences as possible. It has helped them set personalized ad campaigns that will best fit their customers’ interests.

One of their latest, popular campaigns is ‘All Ears On You.’ Take a glimpse of this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCXJrqUdrk) to check how the video ad appears. Launched in June, this campaign focuses on celebrating your weird listening habits. It leveraged the users’ in-app experience to let them be proud of their unique choices. This helped Spotify to strengthen its emotional relationship with its listeners.

**Learn From Spotify’s Famous Marketing Practices:**

* **Get the Most Out of Big Data:** The customer insights and data helped Spotify make precise, on-point ads. Your firm should also acquire customers’ data and later leverage it to amplify the user experience and make marketing campaigns more relatable.
* **Leverage User-Generated Content:** Your audience is more interested in what other customers think and say about your business. The most successful video ads don’t involve facts about the company but the customers instead. Make a video using clips where your customers tell a story about themselves and their experience with your brand.
* **Utilize The Trending Hashtags &** **Topics**: Social medial trends and news feed is what attracts today’s customers the most. Spotify’s advertisement team always wraps their ad campaigns into a package of top-events-and-stories. Find the most popular and trending hashtags and topics related to your business niche and incorporate them in your brand storytelling video.

Some other marketing practices that teach valuable lessons to businesses for brand video marketing include:

* Leveraging the mentions on social media platforms
* Going for a customer-centric marketing approach with personalized interactions

### 2\. Airbnb - The Story of a Symbol of Belonging

The center of focus of [Airbnb’s brand story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMITXMrrVQU) revolves around the basic ideology of ‘belonging.’ The brand found its mission - to shape the world into a place where individuals can ‘belong anywhere.’

Their official tagline also turned out to be ‘Belong Anywhere,’ which eventually led to the development of their whole brand story and new logo. This symbol was created to make sure it’s instantly recognizable.

**Valuable Storytelling Lessons From Airbnb’s Marketing Practices:**

* **Let Your Customers Be At The Heart Of Your Organization**: After interviewing users, Airbnb found out that no one can better inform them about their company than the community of their regular users. The conversations and interviews with such users helped Airbnb to prepare its entire brand story. Thus, you should, too, keep your customers at your core.
* **It’s Never Too Late To Discover Your Story**: Although launched in 2008, the company Airbnb realized they’d need to discover their business mission to scale and progress. They are an example that it’s never too late for your brand to find the brand story.
* **Content Is The King:** Airbnb always keeps posting content on its own blog and YouTube channel. Most of their content is based on user experiences and revolves around stories from within the brand’s community. Such high-quality content helped them to engage with the customers more efficiently.

### 3\. Apple - Chase

Chase recently announced via email their latest introduction to the market - Apple Pay. They introduced it in collaboration with Apple as the new mode to pay. Chase leveraged this email communication to inform people about their latest collaboration with Apple.

They also used email to reinforce their commitment to helping people to buy Apple products like the [iPhone 14 pro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=175GAmhgzSk) with accessible funds. While ensuring to align with Apple’s marketing strategy for the Apple Pay service announcement (primarily based on social media), Chase put more emphasis on real-time media.

Their marketing practice used direct, real-time media to connect with the on-the-go audience seemingly ready to buy an Apple product with a quick source of funds. Their brand story ad focused more on the ‘on-the-go’ audience who would readily agree to make such a purchase.

### 4\. Nike - Most Powerful Brand Story Videos

If you’ve watched a Nike video ad featuring [LeBron James](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=%5FdIAMe1sQno) or others, you’ll know how much emphasis on emotions and inspiration. They don’t go for the direct marketing of their brand and products. Instead, they produce video ads with a powerful message drawn from a compelling storyline.

This makes Nike unique from numerous other brands as it has been an expert in brand storytelling for years now. Every piece of video ad from their collection triggers the audience’s feelings and emotions, which can only be met and satisfied by using Nike products.

There’s a lot of power within emotional branding, and Nike has shaped and transformed its whole marketing model into a storytelling form that motivates the audience to take action - ‘Just do it with Nike products. Some of the marketing strategies that have helped them grow over the years include the following:

* They promote the advantages of their product’s features rather than simply highlighting and promoting the features. This is called **benefit-based marketing practice**.
* They **sell brand stories more than their products**, which has always been their primary marketing strategy.
* Nike is very strong in the **social media game**. They leverage user-generated content to create their video ads.
* **Collaborating with influencers** like LeBron James and Cristiano Ronaldo has always been at the core of their marketing strategy.

### 5\. Bells - Reader

The marketing manager of Bell - Thami Silwana - revealed that the idea behind the ‘Bells-Reader’ campaign is to assist men in acknowledging, comprehending, and speaking about their personal victories.

They realized that sometimes it could be troublesome for men to interact with one another and acknowledge their inside feeling and emotions when one of them have achieved something. Their tagline, ‘Give That Man a Bell, ’ best fits in terms of a man-to-man acknowledging something worth the celebration.

Here is what the video ad director Greg incorporated in the video to make it hit the marketing campaign’s motto:

**Sentimentality:**

* Greg incorporated an excellent blend of drama, emotion, and sentimentality in this two minutes video ad, which was as good as a two-hour Hollywood movie.
* The video hit the emotions on so many levels that you’ll feel like drinking a glass of whisky at the end of the ad.
* Your brand should also create a brand story video where you help your customers to acknowledge themselves by hitting their emotions at different levels.
* To know how just take a look at the ad yourself: [https://www.youtube.com/watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy7fxLwfOnQ&list=PL7tol-2iOCrEp2GQB0K1LxjIStnbFPi1f).

### 6\. Dove - You’re More Beautiful Than You Think

The Real Beauty Ad Campaign by Dove focuses on women’s natural charisma and beauty. The ad emphasizes promoting the self-esteem of every woman. In their ‘[Dove Real Beauty Sketches’](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=litXW91UauE) video ad, you’ll find the events to be chosen, arranged, connected, and assessed as meaningful for a specific set of audience.

Although the video ad’s primary focus is women's empowerment, it’s still a commercial that promotes Dove products. The ad ends with the phrase ‘you’re more beautiful than you think,’ and a Dove brand logo appears.

Significantly, Dove desires women to know that they are always encouraged, supported, and acknowledged for their real beauty. This storytelling helped Dove boost its product sales without making any direct references.

### 7\. El Gordo - The Spanish Christmas Lottery Ad 2021

Conventionally, you’ll get to know about the arrival of Christmas in Spain when you’ll find the Spanish Christmas Lottery hitting the screens as a commercial. The [Christmas Lottery’s 2021 ad version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcWQ3PdDLj4) was recorded and created in the picturesque and snowy town of Elizondo.

The ad signifies the spirit of the Christmas festive season and amazingly resonates with the motto of El Gordo - the greatest prize is to share it. They used aesthetics and scenic beauty to allure the viewers and drive them into buying the lottery.

They used the marketing practice of hitting people's emotions during Christmas when they could truly immerse themselves into enjoying things like winning the lottery.

One of their latest, popular campaigns is ‘All Ears On You.’ Take a glimpse of this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YCXJrqUdrk) to check how the video ad appears. Launched in June, this campaign focuses on celebrating your weird listening habits. It leveraged the users’ in-app experience to let them be proud of their unique choices. This helped Spotify to strengthen its emotional relationship with its listeners.

**Learn From Spotify’s Famous Marketing Practices:**

* **Get the Most Out of Big Data:** The customer insights and data helped Spotify make precise, on-point ads. Your firm should also acquire customers’ data and later leverage it to amplify the user experience and make marketing campaigns more relatable.
* **Leverage User-Generated Content:** Your audience is more interested in what other customers think and say about your business. The most successful video ads don’t involve facts about the company but the customers instead. Make a video using clips where your customers tell a story about themselves and their experience with your brand.
* **Utilize The Trending Hashtags &** **Topics**: Social medial trends and news feed is what attracts today’s customers the most. Spotify’s advertisement team always wraps their ad campaigns into a package of top-events-and-stories. Find the most popular and trending hashtags and topics related to your business niche and incorporate them in your brand storytelling video.

### 2\. Airbnb - The Story of a Symbol of Belonging

The center of focus of [Airbnb’s brand story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMITXMrrVQU) revolves around the basic ideology of ‘belonging.’ The brand found its mission - to shape the world into a place where individuals can ‘belong anywhere.’

### 4\. Nike - Most Powerful Brand Story Videos

If you’ve watched a Nike video ad featuring [LeBron James](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=%5FdIAMe1sQno) or others, you’ll know how much emphasis on emotions and inspiration. They don’t go for the direct marketing of their brand and products. Instead, they produce video ads with a powerful message drawn from a compelling storyline.

This makes Nike unique from numerous other brands as it has been an expert in brand storytelling for years now. Every piece of video ad from their collection triggers the audience’s feelings and emotions, which can only be met and satisfied by using Nike products.

There’s a lot of power within emotional branding, and Nike has shaped and transformed its whole marketing model into a storytelling form that motivates the audience to take action - ‘Just do it with Nike products. Some of the marketing strategies that have helped them grow over the years include the following:

* They promote the advantages of their product’s features rather than simply highlighting and promoting the features. This is called **benefit-based marketing practice**.
* They **sell brand stories more than their products**, which has always been their primary marketing strategy.
* Nike is very strong in the **social media game**. They leverage user-generated content to create their video ads.
* **Collaborating with influencers** like LeBron James and Cristiano Ronaldo has always been at the core of their marketing strategy.

### 5\. Bells - Reader

The marketing manager of Bell - Thami Silwana - revealed that the idea behind the ‘Bells-Reader’ campaign is to assist men in acknowledging, comprehending, and speaking about their personal victories.

They realized that sometimes it could be troublesome for men to interact with one another and acknowledge their inside feeling and emotions when one of them have achieved something. Their tagline, ‘Give That Man a Bell, ’ best fits in terms of a man-to-man acknowledging something worth the celebration.

Here is what the video ad director Greg incorporated in the video to make it hit the marketing campaign’s motto:

**Sentimentality:**

* Greg incorporated an excellent blend of drama, emotion, and sentimentality in this two minutes video ad, which was as good as a two-hour Hollywood movie.
* The video hit the emotions on so many levels that you’ll feel like drinking a glass of whisky at the end of the ad.
* Your brand should also create a brand story video where you help your customers to acknowledge themselves by hitting their emotions at different levels.
* To know how just take a look at the ad yourself: [https://www.youtube.com/watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yy7fxLwfOnQ&list=PL7tol-2iOCrEp2GQB0K1LxjIStnbFPi1f).

## Part 1\. What Is TS Video Format?

A TS format file is a Video Transport Stream file. The TS file extension is used to store video data, mostly on DVDs. The video files are standardly compressed with .MPEG video compression. If you are looking for a file extension to save streamed or broadcast videos, TS video format is ideal for this. Are you worried about how to play a TS file?

![what is ts format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/ts-file-format-1.jpg)

Well, a video file with this format can easily be played on a certain media player or [video editing program](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Various video playback apps, video development tools, and also DVD creation programs support the TS format. The .ts file extension can also contain any data, and TS files don't always need to store media or documents.

## Part 2\. Pros and Coins about TS Video Format

Everything has its beneficial factors and disadvantages, so does TS video format has. Are you ready to know more about the TS file format? After learning about the format, it’s time to share its advantages and drawbacks with you. Let’s get started!

### Advantages of TS File Format

A great thing about TS format is that, after each keyframe, the file information is added automatically. The format is impressive when it comes to maintaining transmission integrity. This is because of all the elementary streams, synchronization patterns, and error corrections; everything is encapsulated in a container format.

Do you know what else benefits TS format has? It is widely used for broadcasting because broadcasting doesn’t need the complete stream for playing it. You can easily share large files over the communication media in real-time as tiny chunks of the audio or video file are sent. Along with this, the error is easily detected as extra information is shared with every chunk, helping in error detection.

### Drawbacks of TS File Format

For instance, a built-in media player like Windows Media Player does not support the format; eventually, users must change the file format.

Do you know another significant disadvantage? You cannot share TS files online. Different platforms like Facebook, YouTube, etc., support other famous formats, so hence, sharing TS video files requires a format converter. Do you know how much space does a TS file occupies? Well, it acquires a significant storage space, more than other file formats.
