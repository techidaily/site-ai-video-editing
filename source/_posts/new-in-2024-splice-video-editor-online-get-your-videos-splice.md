![difference between normal speed and slow speed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-2.gif)

Now that we know what Fast and slow-motion videos are. Let's understand their applications. Or how you can use them in your videos. Scroll below to learn more!

## Part 2\. Why Should You Change the Speed of Your Videos?

The answer to this question would be that it's a personal creative decision that will allow you to make your videos more engaging.

### Fast Motion Videos

Fast-motion videos are used in many areas of filming. For example, you can speed up your videos to create a funny video or shorten its length.

The fast-motion effect has many applications, such as cooking tutorial videos. For example, the step-by-step process of a cooking tutorial can be too long to fit into a single video. Or it could also help you in cases where you want to keep the length of the video short.

The fast motion of the steps will allow the viewer to quickly grasp the whole process without watching the entire video.

### Slow Motion Videos

You can also slow down your videos to give the viewers a more detailed perspective of a scene. Or you can also create a slow-mo video that offers a general surreal vibe.

A famous example is in action films. The producers of the first **Matrix** film used the Slow-mo effect in the famous bullet dodging scene.

![famous bullet dodging scene in the matrix](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-3.png)

You may wonder how the film producers made the slow-mo effect. The technology at that time was less developed than the recent day. So, even you can create a slow-mo effect.

Before we get into the editing process, let's first understand what you will need to change the speed of your videos!

## Part 3\. What Will You Need to Change the Speed of Your Videos?

You will need the following essentials to change the speed of a video:

### 1\. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

### 2\. Video Clips

Well, it is evident that to change the speed of your videos, you will need video clips. But there are a few things you can keep in mind before adjusting the speed of a video.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Slowing down a video requires a shot at a higher frame rate. The greater the frame rate, the better will be the slow-mo quality. On the other hand, speeding up videos does not have a strict frame rate requirement.

## Part 4\. How Can You Change the Speed of Your Videos?

Here you will learn two ways in which you can change the speed of your videos. The two methods to change the speed of your video are mentioned:

* The speed adjustment panel.
* Duration panel settings.

Let's get started with the editing process. The first method we will look into is the Speed Adjustment panel.

### 1\. Change Speed With the Speed Adjustment Panel

The Speed Adjustment panel is the speed adjuster in the Wondershare Filmora software. This feature will give you a drag bar to adjust the speed of your video.

You can move the bar to the right to increase the speed of your video. Similarly, you can move it to the left to decrease the rate.

But before we use this feature, we will need to download the Filmora video editing software. So please scroll below to learn how to download it!

##### Step1 Download Filmora

First and foremost, you must have access to Filmora. For this, download Wondershare Filmora. Then, activate this app or software on your PC.

##### Step2 Import The Video Files

The next step after downloading Filmora is to import your video clips. To accomplish this, follow the steps outlined below:

* Locate and select the **Import** icon on the top left side of the Filmora Home Interface.
* It takes you to your computer's library.
* Select the videos to be edited and then click **OK**.

![wondershare filmora importing video clips from pc directory](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-5.png)

You can also import the files by another method. After you have opened Filmora, you can restore the Filmora Window size and import by dragging and dropping the clips:

* **Drag** the cursor to select the video clips you want.
* Then, drop them in the Filmora import window.

![import video clips by drag and drop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-6.png)

Filmora supports various formats for your video clips. They include the **Mp4**,   **AVI**, **MOV**, **GIFs,** and more.

After you have imported your video clips, add them to the timeline as shown below!

##### Step3 Add The Video Clips to The Timeline

After you've imported clips in the Import window, drag them onto the timeline. Follow the steps outlined below to accomplish this:

* **Drag** the clips into the import window and select them.
* Then, **insert** them into the timeline.

![wondershare filmora adding clips to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-7.png)

Now that we have our video clips in the timeline, we can start adjusting the speed.

##### Step4 Open the Speed Adjustment Panel

The speed adjustment panel, or the Uniform Speed, is the feature of Filmora that allows you to change the speed of your video. For example, to open the Unifrom Speed panel, do as follows:

* **Double-click** on the video clip.
* In the **pop-up** column, scroll down till you see the **Unifrom Speed** option and click on it.
* The speed controls will be shown in the import window.

![wondershare filmora unifrom speed tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-8.png)

In the speed control panel, you can see the speed adjuster slider. A number will usually mark this at the end. This number tells you the current speed your video is calibrated in and how fast or slow the motion effects will be.

**1.00** is always the average speed. **0.5** being half and **2.00** being double the average speed. To control the speed through the slider, you will need to do the following:

* **To increase the speed:** Type in the number you want your rate to be. Or, drag the slider to the right as you wish.
* **To decrease the speed:** Type in a number less than the standard 1.00, or you can drag the slider to the left as you wish.

The number of your speed can be an inconvenience if you have no prior experience. Instead, render the video and play it from the beginning with the changes that you made. It gives you a better idea of the speed of your video.

![wondershare filmoa opening the speed adjustment panel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-9.png)

##### Step5 Detach The Audio

It will create an audio file in a separate audio tab in the timeline. You can adjust this audio according to your liking. You can edit the detached audio by:

* **Double-click** on the audio file.
* A settings menu will open in the import window.
* Adjust the **Fade** options for your Audio.
* Drag the **Fade out** slider to the right to Fade out your Audio.
* To Fade in your Audio, drag the **Fade in** slider to the right.

![wondershare filmora adjusting detached audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-11.png)

You can also remove the background noise and the pitch of the audio if you want. You can also replace the video's original audio with a new one. Click on the audio file and press **Del** on the keyboard to delete it. To add new audio, do as mentioned ahead:

* Click on The **Audio** icon above the import window.
* Browse The Audio that matches the vibe of your video.
* Drag and drop it below your video clip.

![wondershare filmora adding custom audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-12.png)

Doing so would have created alternate audio for your video. Play the video from the start and confirm your changes.

##### Step6 Save Your Project

These were the methods by which you can change the speed of your video using the Speed Adjustment panel. Now let's move on to the following method to adjust the speed via the Duration panel.

### 2\. Change Speed via the Duration Panel

The duration panel is one the most valuable features of Wondershare Filmora as it allows you to change the video speed by duration adjustment.

This feature is typically helpful when you have a space between video clips and want to fill it. By measuring the time between the two clips, you can adjust the duration of your video.

It will ultimately hasten the speed of your video. The hastening in rate will depend upon the gap. The smaller the gap, the faster the video will be. Similarly, the greater the gap is, the longer the video will be.

Apart from the Speed Adjustment Panel, the Duration Panel has the advantage of editing the speed of your video by simply typing in the text.

##### Step1 Import Video Clips to Timeline

After downloading Filmora, the next step is importing your video clips. To do so, follow the steps outlined below:

* Locate and click the **Import** icon in the upper left corner of the Filmora Home Interface.
* Choose the videos to be edited, then click **OK**.

Now that you have imported files into Filmora, you can add them to the Timeline. Notice the steps mentioned ahead:

* Drag the clips into the import window and select them.
* Then, insert them into the timeline.

You can begin the editing process now that the clips are in the timeline.

##### Step2 Open The Duration Panel

The Duration Panel comes attached to the **Unifrom Speed Panel**. To access the Duration Panel, follow the steps ahead:

* **Right-click** on the video clip.
* In the pop column, scroll below to **Unifrom Speed**.

It will open the uniform speed panel in the import window. Below the speed of the controls, you can notice The Duration Panel.

##### Step3 Change The Speed of The Video

In The Duration Panel, you can see the average speed of your video clip. Now, if you want to **reduce** the speed of your video, you have to **increase** the duration of your video. Similarly, if you're going to **increase** the speed of your video, you would have to **decrease** the duration.

##### Slow Down The Video

To slow down the video clip, follow the steps mentioned below:

* In The Duration Panel, **Increase** the time of the video.
* Type in a number bigger than the normal value

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** If the average speed of the video is **00:01:00:00,** increasing the value of the duration to **00:02:00:00** will reduce the speed of your video by half.

![wondershare filmora adjusting slowing down the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-17.png)

##### Speed Up The Video

To increase the speed of your video, follow as guided ahead:

* In The Duration Panel, **decrease** the time of the video.
* Type in a number smaller than the normal value

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** If the normal video speed is **00:01:00:00,** decreasing the value of the duration to **00:00:30:00** will increase the speed of your video by double.
