## 1\. More Engaging Than Text or Images

When you're scrolling through your feed, what's more, likely to stop you in your tracks: a picture or a video? For most people, the answer is video. In general, video is more engaging than image because it captures our attention more effectively and holds it for longer. Studies have shown that the human brain processes video 60,000 times faster than text, and that viewers retain 95% of a message when they watch it in a video, as opposed to 10% when they read it in text. Furthermore, video is more likely to evoke an emotional response than an image. We can't help but be drawn in by the movement, sound, and facial expressions of the people in the video, which makes us more likely to feel connected to them. So next time you're trying to capture someone's attention, think about using video instead of a still image.

## 2\. Build a Relationship with Audience

Video can help you build a relationship with your audience on social media. That's because people like to watch videos. They're fun and interesting. You can show people what you're doing and what's going on in your life. And people can leave comments and talk to you on the video. The more you interact with your audience, the more they'll like you.

Plus, video is a great way to show off your products or services. You can give people a tour of your store or office. Or show them how to use your product. If you have a new product, you can create a video to show it off. People are more likely to buy a product if they can see it in action.

## 3\. Promote Your Brand or Product

Video allows you to show, rather than just tell, potential customers what your brand is all about. You can give them a behind-the-scenes look at your company, or showcase your products in action. And because people are more likely to watch a video than read an article or blog post, you're more likely to reach a wider audience with your message.

Creating a video doesn't have to be expensive or time-consuming. You can use your smartphone or a simple video camera to get started. And there are plenty of free or low-cost video editing software programs available if you want to get fancier with your finished product.

If you're not sure where to start, try creating a short video that introduces your brand and tells viewers what they can expect from your products or services. Then post it on your website and social media channels and see how it goes! You might be surprised at how well it performs.

## 4\. Drive Traffic to Your Website

Website traffic refers to the number of visitors who visit a website. This can be measured in a number of ways, including the number of unique visitors, the number of page views, and the amount of time spent on the site.

If you're looking for a way to give your website a boost, you may want to consider using videos. By posting engaging videos on social media sites, you can drive traffic to your site and increase your visibility. And, with more people visiting your site, you'll have a better chance of converting visitors into customers. Of course, creating videos can be time-consuming and requires some level of creative talent. But it's worth the effort if you're looking for a way to improve your web traffic.

So, if you're ready to take your social media marketing to the next level, why not give video a try?

## 5\. Increase Your Social Media Reach

Social media reach is the number of people who see your content. It's the potential audience for your message. The more people who see it, the more likely it is that someone will engage with it. The size of your reach depends on the platform you're using and how many followers you have. Some platforms, like Facebook, make it easy to reach a large audience.

The best way to increase your reach is to create compelling video content that people want to share. Videos are highly shareable, and if they are well-made and engaging, they can quickly attract a large audience. In addition, videos are a great way to build brand awareness and show potential customers what your business is all about. By including videos in your social media marketing strategy, you can reach a wider audience and create more opportunities for customer engagement.

## 6\. Boost your SEO

SEO is an acronym that stands for "search engine optimization." It is a process of improving the visibility and ranking of a website or web page in search engine results pages (SERPs). The higher a website or web page appears in the SERPs, the more likely it is to be clicked by users.

If you're like most people, you probably spend a good chunk of your day scrolling through social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. And when you're not scrolling through your feed, you're probably watching videos. Whether it's a funny cat video or a cooking tutorial, chances are you've watched a video online in the past 24 hours. What you may not realize is that videos can also be used to boost your SEO.

That's right - by creating and posting engaging videos, you can attract more visitors to your website and improve your search engine ranking. Here's how it works: when people watch your videos and share them with their friends, they are effectively giving your website a "vote" of approval. This helps to improve your visibility on search engines and attracts more visitors to your site. In addition, videos help to keep people on your website for longer periods of time, which is also a positive signal to search engines. So if you're looking for a new way to improve your SEO, consider adding videos to your website. You might just be surprised at the results.
