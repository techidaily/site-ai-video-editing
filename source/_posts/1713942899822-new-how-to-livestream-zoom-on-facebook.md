![startup window 01](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/startup-window-01.png)

##### Step2Add Color Templates

After installing, wait until the installation is finished. Launch Wondershare Filmora and go to MEDIA tab at the top left of the interface and select the best suitable background color for your intro video from the dropdown menu in the MEDIA tab. Drag your cursor over the tile of the color you wish to use as a background and click to add the icon that appears in the center to add it to the timeline.

![media for use 01](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/media-for-use-01.png)

If you want to listen to a track from the inbuilt library collection of audio and music, double click on the thumbnail.
