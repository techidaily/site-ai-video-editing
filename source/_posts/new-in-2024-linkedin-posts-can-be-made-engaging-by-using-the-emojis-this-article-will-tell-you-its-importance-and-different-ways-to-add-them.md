## Part 1 What GIF/Video Can Crash Discord (Explained)?

As a result of the fact that some GIFs/Videos can crash Discord due to the RAM overload method within the GIF/Video file, hidden contents out of frame probably. More so, there are GIF/ Video that makes your Discord client reload. As soon as you see it play, your Discord will reload like it does when pressing "ctrl + r." This bug does not work on the iOS client since the Gif appears as an image (so far tested in windows and iOS clients)
