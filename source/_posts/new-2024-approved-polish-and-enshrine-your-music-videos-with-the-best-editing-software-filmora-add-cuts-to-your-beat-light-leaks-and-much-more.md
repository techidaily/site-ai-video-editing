## Part 2\. Polishing Your Music Video

Just like ladies apply polish to their nails to make them more attractive, you can use editing to your music video to get the same result. Ladies can go to the beautician if they want. You can go to a professional editor if you like it.

However, these options are pretty expensive. The best way is to do it yourself. It is fun. Also, you can let loose your hidden artist for a while. Stick to the following points to understand how to begin polishing your music video.

Moreover, the video will lose its charm if you put cuts on every beat. People will not be able to enjoy, let alone understand, what is happening in the film.

##### What are the beats?

Beats are pieces of music that recur in a pattern. They are essential for music videos. It adds attraction for the viewers. Also, without beats, no music video can go viral. In the digital age, beats boost your music video.

### How to smooth out cuts

Adding cuts in the beats is one part of the job, not the whole job. After adding these cuts, you have to smoothen them. With it, the point of interest for the audience becomes clear.

To maintain the audience's attention on our video, we have to smoothen the cuts so that our audience quickly understands the ongoing story in our video. If sudden changes occur on the screen, watching it gets disconcerting.

Indeed, you would not want your audience to have this experience. Head to the following techniques to understand how to smooth out video cuts

##### Technique 1: Showing multiple perspectives

The focal person in the video must occupy the same spot in the previous shot as it maintains in the current shot.

![focusing on the main lead in the first shot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/smooth-out-cuts-1.jpg)

* **Shot 2**: The actress occupies the same spot in the subsequent shot.

![focusing the actress in the second shot from a different angle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/smooth-out-cuts-2.jpg)

* **Third Shot**: The shot shows the wide angle of the bus from the inside. The actress is still sitting in the same position and the same place.

![focusing the actress in the third shot from a different angle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/smooth-out-cuts-3.jpg)

This technique keeps the audience focused on the point of interest while giving them a different perspective of the scene.

##### Technique 2: Using light leaks

The technique is quite helpful for the transition between two cuts. It uses different levels of colors to shine between cuts, adding smoothness and providing coherence.
