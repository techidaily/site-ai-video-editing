Step 1: Open Filmora and remove all the pieces of the footage. Then arrange the rest of the footage as you see fit. Click on "Effects" on the upper left corner of your screen and then on "Filters". Click on the Old Video effect and then drop it. After you add the filter on the segment of your video, you can drag the end of it to cover the whole duration of the movies. Click twice on the filter if you want to adjust the filter settings. Enter the desired values on the "Fade" parameter, "Frequency", and "Alpha" options. Press "OK", and this step is concluded.

Step 2: You can apply the black and white filters to any project in Filmora. It is very simple. Add one of the filters above the video you want to add the effect and drag one of the corners to adjust the duration. You can change the intensity through the alpha slider.

Step 3: In Filmora, you can add sepia tone rise or sun-kissed filters to your video. You are able to add desaturated filters while keeping colors like blue and green and with that create the old film style. If you want more brown and red tones, you can use the Sun-Kisser filter that highlights those colors. Adjust the filters with the alpha slider to change intensity.

![old film overlay 3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vintage-videos-3.png)

Step 4: Under the black and white subcategory, you can find Ash and Willow filters. What these do is desaturate the contrast or exposure values as well as preset brightness and bring an older tone to your videos.

Step 5: You can correct any kind of filter. With the Advanced Color Correction Tab, you can navigate through features like Preset and Adjustment and desaturate your video. By clicking on the "Preset tab," you can open a larger variety of presets, including the Old Film and Black & White presets.

## Part 4: Pro Tips to Create Stunning Retro Video

You can make your video look retro with a few simple tips:

* Use several vintage apps like Retro VHS, 8mm Camcorder, and others.
* Keep low highlights and low contrasts.
* Keep low saturation and control the hue, saturation, and luminance of your video.
* Film Overlays. With this, you can bring the mood just right. If you add a soft light overall to start with, it will instantly look slightly more vintage.
* By decreasing contrast, you are darkening your videos and giving them a grainier old look.
* If you bring up the black levels, you will leave more space for other tones to shine and turn the mood around your videos.
* In contrast, if you bring down the whites in your videos, making even the brightest colors turn grey.

### Conclusion

There are various ways to turn your videos into old relics. Using Filmora, you have a powerful tool in your hands to change any desired media, and with this step-by-step guide, you will get there in no time.

## Step by Step to Cut Videos in Adobe Premiere Pro

Video editing is an essential skill in a world that has a growing focus on creative fields. And if you work with videos, knowing which clips to use and where to cut is essential in conveying your story and increasing its impact. So, if you are a beginner and want to familiarise yourself with steps and terms used in video editing, in this article, we will go through the steps you will need to cut your video file in Adobe Premiere Pro and Wondershare Filmora.

_This guide uses Adobe Premiere Pro 2022 and Wondershare Filmora X._

## How to cut video in Adobe Premiere Pro?

Once you have Adobe Premiere Pro open on your computer, follow the steps listed below.

**Step 1:** Create a new project in Premiere Pro.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-1.jpeg)

During project creation, we recommend keeping an eye on the file name set and the storage location; this can help reduce the time spent in locating the Premiere Project.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-2.jpeg)

**Step 2:** Import a video file into Premiere Pro with a double click in the marked area and choose the file from its stored location.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-3.jpeg)

**Step 3:** Double click on any imported media to activate it and send it to the Source Window.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-4.jpeg)

You can continue to import more media by double-clicking within the marked area. For better organization, users can also create **Bins**, which are folders within a Premiere Pro File that are often in use to sort out imported media.

_Users can create Bins with a right-click in the red box marked area (refer to image above)._

**Step 4:** Select either the whole clip or a part of it from the Source Window and drag it onto the Timeline.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-5.jpeg)

**Step 5:** Select the Razor Tool from the Tools Window. Now, pick the point where you want to introduce a cut and confirm with your left mouse button; this will split your video track into two parts.

Make a second cut where desired, following which you can move around the newly generated clip or delete it.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-6.jpeg)

**Tip:**You can also select the Razor Tool by pressing C on the keyboard_._

We also recommend using the _Snap in Timeline_ feature (activated with (S) on your keyboard or by choosing the magnet option), which will match your mouse pointer with the Playhead to ensure your cut will match the exact frame shown on your screen.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Some more tips for Adobe Premiere Pro:**

1. Using the I and O keys on your keyboard while playing a video in the Source Window will allow you to set an **In Point**and an **Out Point.** These markers will allow you to move a specific part of your video file into the Timeline, thus, reducing the amount of time spent making the right cut.

_We have tagged the Mark In and Mark Out buttons with a Green Box in the image below._

1. Clicking on the Step Frame Buttons \[marked in Yellow\] will also help increase the accuracy of your cut by allowing you to select the exact moment you desire.
1. You can also mark a Point of Interest in your video file with the help of Markers in Premiere Pro. These afford you the ability to come back to the moment at a later time and see why it interested you in the first place, as editing sessions can often take hours at an end.

## An alternative way to cut video with Wondershare Filmora

In Wondershare [Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) , the steps to cut a video are simplified and don’t require as many steps as seen earlier. Opening the application throws you straight into a project, and following this, you can import a video file and begin editing. From the process you will learn below, it is easy to assume that Wondershare Filmora is more convenient for beginners and provides software features that match paid professional software.

**Note:** If you don’t have Wondershare Filmora installed, you can get the video editor by visiting its [official website](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Once the setup program download completes, execute it and begin the installation process.

Once you have the editing software open, follow the steps listed below.

**Step 1:** Import a video file by clicking on the import window.

The default project setting for Filmora X is 1920x1080 at 25 frames per second. Users can change this to match their video file by going into Project Settings under the File tab or by accepting the automatic prompt that appears when dragging the video file onto the Timeline.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-8.jpeg)

**Note:** If you have a PC with weak hardware, Wondershare Filmora gives you the option to create Video Proxies that will reduce the load on your computer by creating smaller clips that are lower in size, resulting in a smoother and faster experience. You can also do this in Premiere Pro, but Filmora does it for you automatically once given permission.

**Step 2:** Drag the video file onto the Timeline to begin previewing it in the Playback Window and commence editing operations.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-9.jpeg)

**Step 3:** Locate where you want to cut in the video file and click on the orange scissors option to split the video file.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-10.jpeg)

**Tip:** You can also use the keyboard shortcut (CTRL+B) to cut without using a mouse click, in case you make use of a trackpad while editing.

The Bottom Line

As said earlier, knowing where to cut is essential in improving the feel of your video, and we hope this guide showed you exactly how to perform the actions to create your best project. If you are a beginner, the simplistic approach of Wondershare Filmora will be more welcoming and easier to navigate. In addition, the software is also free to download, with added features that you can activate by paying a monthly, yearly, or one-time fee. Adobe Premiere Pro is an option worth considering if you plan on using third-party plugins and other applications from the Creative Cloud Suite.

During project creation, we recommend keeping an eye on the file name set and the storage location; this can help reduce the time spent in locating the Premiere Project.

Technology has always been in the business of amazing man with its extraordinary abilities. The brain of man has a role to play in this awe as these inventions are not without man's input. As such, daily improvements are ensured to build upon the existing technology - the computer system.

We have always had one reason or the other to hire voiceover artistes. This could be for the purpose of storytelling and narration, advertisement and so on. As beautiful and reliable as that is in executing our tasks, many seem to consider it a waste of resources in terms of funds, energy and time. This is one of the reasons why the innovation of text-to-speech was established. It comes in handy when we do not need voiceover artistes as it serves as a perfect substitute.

Text-to-speech, which is also known as TTS, is a type of supportive technology that assists in reading digital text aloud. It’s sometimes called “read aloud” technology. The benefit of this technology cannot be overemphasised as it has gained a wide reach and global use across many devices such as computers and smartphones of different brands. With the help of softwares for computers (Windows and Mac), applications for smartphones (Android, iPhone, iPad) as well as online platforms, text-to-speech has been made possible and easy as technology keeps evolving.

Today, content creators are grateful for this life-saving innovation as it has dispelled the thoughts of having to do voiceovers themselves (which could be difficult for many). As such, this article comes in handy as it seeks to discuss ten applications or softwares and online platforms for TTS.
