### Steps to Slow Down Video in Filmora

In this section, we will discuss the Filmora Speed Ramping feature to create a slo-mo. If you are a beginner and have never edited before, this feature suits you the best. It has over 6-speed ramping templates for adding creative speed change effects. You can modify these models to fashion a slo-mo, and here is how to do it:

##### Step 1Access the Speed Feature

After opening Filmora and opening a project, select the clip in the timeline and go to the settings panel. From there, reach the "Speed" > "Speed Ramping" tabs and select a preset. If you don't like the featured presets, click on "Customize" for manual editing.

##### Step 2Add Video Frames

#### 3\. Motion Tracking

Create animations from mere graphics to insert in your videos using this AI. Just add any graphical emoji, text, or sticker and link it with a moving object.

You can also apply an effect or filter to a specific portion throughout the video using making and motion-tracking options.
