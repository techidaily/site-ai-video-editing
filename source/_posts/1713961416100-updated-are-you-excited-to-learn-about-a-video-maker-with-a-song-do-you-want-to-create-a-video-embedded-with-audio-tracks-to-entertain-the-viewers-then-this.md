## Why Do We Need To Add A Camera Shake Effect To The Video?

Have you ever tried to add a simple camera shake effect to your videos? You know, those cool shake effects that you may have seen on an amateur or professional video on the web? Well, if you have, then you probably thought it was impossible. The camera shake effect is a technique applied to the clips where shaky camera movements cause the image to appear more cinematic and real. Applying a camera shake effect is to hide your flaws when shooting a video.

Camera shake is often mistaken for poor cinematography. It can enhance your video. For instance, if you're filming something like a car chase or any other scene where there's lots of movement and action, the inclusion of a camera shake can help make it more realistic.

A camera shake effect can be an excellent way of adding a sense of realism to your videos. Whether you're making a video that's meant to be taken as a real scene, such as one depicting a robbery, or one that's supposed to be shot in a documentary style, such as making a movie, you can use this as an effective tool. You can consider adding camera shakes to your videos due to the following reasons:

* This camera shake effect makes your video more creative. If you want to make, your video different from those other businesses produce, adding this effect will be a good idea.
* Your audience will be able to relate better to your video if they've seen similar videos before.
* Adding a camera shake to your video will make it more interesting and engaging for your viewers.
* It's a great way to mask any mistakes you might have made during the video production. After all, we aren't perfect humans, so we can't make perfect videos every time!"
* You can use camera shakes to simulate the feeling of being in an environment that is free from control (such as being on a boat).
* You can use them to create a sense of urgency for the viewer/audience by adding motion blur to the sequence.

## How to add camera shake to video in After Effects

When it comes to video editing, knowing how to make a layer shake in After Effects is a very useful skill. Using it correctly can add subtle motion to a static frame, emphasize an important object, and even make a character quiver in fear! In this tutorial, you will learn how to effectively use the wiggle expression to affect a layer throughout the Composition.

### Step 1\. Select the layer you want to shake from your After Effects file

Suppose you have an image or video of an object and want to apply it to shake effect, then it is quite easy. Just follow the steps described below.

![camera shake effects for premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/camera-shake-after-effects-1.jpg)

### Step 2\. Press the alt/option key, then click the stopwatch next to "position."

You are adding an "expression" to the timeline when the position text turns red, and you begin typing. Using a coding language adapted from javascript, you can apply complex motion to layers.

By pressing the alt/option again on the stopwatch, you can edit your expression anytime-or by clicking the arrow beside "position" and then double-clicking the text in the timeline.

![use camera shake in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/camera-shake-after-effects-2.jpg)

### Step 3\. Enter "Wiggle (3,8)" and adjust the settings accordingly

In this expression, the first number indicates the frequency of Wiggle -- basically, how quickly it appears to tremble. Its amplitude is the second number, which indicates how far it moves. The numbers are adjustable as you wish. Layers will shake dramatically but slowly when they use Wiggle (2,40). The "Wiggle (10,3)" command makes a layer move quickly without too much movement in one direction.

### Step 4\. Adjust the frame rate of your Composition

In order to make the overall effect more "choppy," you can reduce the frame rate of the video by going to Composition> Composition settings. After Effects uses a frame rate of 24.5, you can go as low as "8" if you want a choppy feel.

![how to use camera shake in premiere pro - adjust frame rate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/camera-shake-after-effects-3.jpg)

Your entire Composition will become choppier if you reduce the frame rate, so it might not be worth it if you have other moving elements in your Composition. Only adjust the frame rate of the layer containing the wiggling object if you want it to affect that layer.

## Bonus! Camera Shake Presets for After Effects

* Adding a camera shake to your video will make it more interesting and engaging for your viewers.
* It's a great way to mask any mistakes you might have made during the video production. After all, we aren't perfect humans, so we can't make perfect videos every time!"
* You can use camera shakes to simulate the feeling of being in an environment that is free from control (such as being on a boat).
* You can use them to create a sense of urgency for the viewer/audience by adding motion blur to the sequence.

## How to add camera shake to video in After Effects

When it comes to video editing, knowing how to make a layer shake in After Effects is a very useful skill. Using it correctly can add subtle motion to a static frame, emphasize an important object, and even make a character quiver in fear! In this tutorial, you will learn how to effectively use the wiggle expression to affect a layer throughout the Composition.

### Step 1\. Select the layer you want to shake from your After Effects file

Suppose you have an image or video of an object and want to apply it to shake effect, then it is quite easy. Just follow the steps described below.

![camera shake effects for premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/camera-shake-after-effects-1.jpg)

### Step 2\. Press the alt/option key, then click the stopwatch next to "position."

You are adding an "expression" to the timeline when the position text turns red, and you begin typing. Using a coding language adapted from javascript, you can apply complex motion to layers.

By pressing the alt/option again on the stopwatch, you can edit your expression anytime-or by clicking the arrow beside "position" and then double-clicking the text in the timeline.

### Step 3\. Enter "Wiggle (3,8)" and adjust the settings accordingly

In this expression, the first number indicates the frequency of Wiggle -- basically, how quickly it appears to tremble. Its amplitude is the second number, which indicates how far it moves. The numbers are adjustable as you wish. Layers will shake dramatically but slowly when they use Wiggle (2,40). The "Wiggle (10,3)" command makes a layer move quickly without too much movement in one direction.

### Step 4\. Adjust the frame rate of your Composition

In order to make the overall effect more "choppy," you can reduce the frame rate of the video by going to Composition> Composition settings. After Effects uses a frame rate of 24.5, you can go as low as "8" if you want a choppy feel.

![how to use camera shake in premiere pro - adjust frame rate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/camera-shake-after-effects-3.jpg)

Your entire Composition will become choppier if you reduce the frame rate, so it might not be worth it if you have other moving elements in your Composition. Only adjust the frame rate of the layer containing the wiggling object if you want it to affect that layer.
