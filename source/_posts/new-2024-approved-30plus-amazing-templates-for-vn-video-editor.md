When going forth with film post-production, video game creation, and television production, almost every video editor's goal is to produce outstanding results. Usually, this cannot be achieved by using mediocre tools. One of the top-notch software video editors need to use is Adobe After Effect. Adobe After Effect is a motion graphics, digital visual effect, and compositing application developed by the Adobe system.

Adobe After Effects has tons of tools, and an exceptional one is a Lumetri color. With this functionality, you can easily carry out your color correction and color grading. Read this article and get to the bottom line on how to use Lumetri Color in Adobe After Effects.

Let's dig in!

#### In this article

01 [Does After Effects have Lumetri Color?](#part1)

02 [How to use Lumetri Color in Adobe After Effects](#part2)

03 [Is there a simple way to Unionise the Color of my Video?](#part3)

## Does After Effects have Lumetri Color?

Yes, there is lumetri color in After Effects. Lumetri Color allows you to adjust contrast, light, and color to your video based on your preference. With After Effects, you can carry out various color customizations in the Lumerti panel without exiting your current project.

Furthermore, the Lumetri color panel in Adobe After Effects allows you to export your settings to another different premiere pro project wholly. Usually, the file is exported as a .cube file – This relieves you from the wearisomeness of creating new grading features.

## How to use Lumetri Color in Adobe After Effects

You don't need to be a pro for you to use Lumetri Color in Adobe After Effects. The color workspace in Adobe After Effect is designed to be straightforward and user-friendly.

The Lumetri Color panel in Adobe contains the histogram, vectorscope, parade scope, and waveform monitor. The histogram, parade scope, and waveform monitor display image intensity, whereas the vectorscope display hue and color saturation.

Lumetri Color is considered an ultimate choice by most editors due to its wide range of functionalities. Some of the functionalities in the Lumetri panel include:

#### 1\. Vignettes

Vignette is an outstanding feature that effortlessly allows Lumetri users to adjust lightness and darkness using sliders.

Vignettes allow you to darken the borders and highlight certain parts. You will therefore create more emphasis on highlighted parts in your clip.

#### 2\. HSL Secondary

When you want to get exceptional footage controls, HSL Secondary (Hue, Saturation, and Luminance) is often the best functionality. HSL Secondary easily separates your footage and works on a selected piece.

With the functionality, you can easily manipulate the skin tones in your footage and refocus images.

![how to use lumetri color in after effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/lumetri-color-after-effects-1.jpg)

#### 3\. Curves

The Lumetri panel in Adobe After Effects renders its users the curves functionality. There are two curves in the Lumetri Panel, i.e., Hue Saturation curves and luminesce curves.

The Hue/Saturation curve uses the red, green, and blue (RBG) flagship, whereas the luminance curve helps manage the frame curve's tone.

![lumetri color in after effect - curves](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/lumetri-color-after-effects-2.jpg)

#### 4\. Fx Bypass

Fx Bypass is a new functionality feature in the Lumetri panel. It allows you to bypass and reset effects without switching to the controls panel.

### How to use Lumetri Color

With your Adobe After Effects, you can make quick and advanced color changes to your clips. Here are the simple steps on how to use Lumetri Color.

### Step 1\. Add your footage to the timeline

First, open your Adobe After Effect and add your video file to the software. Drag and drop to add it to the timeline.

![how to use lumetri color in after effects- add footage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/lumetri-color-after-effects-3.jpg)

### Step 2\. Open Lumetri Color

Here, you highlight your video in the timeline, then head over to the “Window” menu. From the drop-down menu, select “Effects & presets” > "Lumetri Color."

Alternatively, you can go to the "Effects" menu, which is at the left-hand side of your interface, then select "Color Correction"> "Lumetri Color."

![how to use lumetri color in after effects- open lumetri color](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/lumetri-color-after-effects-4.jpg)

### Step 3\. Carry out your Color Grading and Saturation

With the "Lumetri Color" functionality, you can carry out various adjustable settings such as tone, hue, saturation and color grading.

To carry out saturation:

Click on the " Hue/Saturation " from the drop-down menu in "Lumetri Color." You can change the color of the entire footage by adjusting the "Master Hue" from the Effects Control Panel.

Alternatively, you can opt to fine-tune the freshly selected color by using the "Master Saturation" and Master Lightness."

To carry out color grading:

* After opening the "Lumetri Color" panel as in step 2 above, click on the eyedropper to select the curve you want to use.
* Click the color in your footage that you wish to adjust. Usually, when you use the eyedropper, three points will be added to the graph. The two bottom points restrict color selection to a minimum range, whereas the first represents your selected color.

### How to Use Lumetri Scope

Besides the Lumetric Color, Lumetric Scope is another essential tool for post-film production in Adobe After Effects. The color correcting tool, Lumetric scope guarantees its users' accurate results when used correctly.

When carrying out color corrections in films, it is advisable to use quality monitor calibrators and paint your workspace walls neutral grey. Usually, it reduces lighting distraction and the external color effect, respectively.

However, not every editor can meet all the required basics, and that is where Lumetri scope comes in. Lumetri Scope allows one to get the best color results in their videos. Here are the steps on how to use Lumetri Scope:

![how to use lumetri scope in after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/lumetri-color-after-effects-6.jpg)

### Step 1\. Open Lumetric Scope

First, open your Adobe After Effect application and add your footage to the timeline. Go to the " Window " menu at the top-left-hand side of your interface.

In the drop-down menu, select "Lumetri Scopes" or "Workspaces," then click on the "Color" option.

The Lumetri Scope tab will be displayed adjacent to the timeline footage.

### Step 2\. Evaluate Hue and Saturation using Vectorscope

In the Lumetri Scope tab, click on the wrench icon, and a drop-down menu will be displayed. From the menu, select "Vectorscope YUV" and read the saturation. When reading saturation, begin from the center going outwards.

Hue, on the other hand, is read in a circular direction.

![how to use lumetri scope in after effects - evaluate hue and Saturation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/lumetri-color-after-effects-7.jpg)

### Step 3\. Evaluate the tonal values and Brightness using Histogram

The histogram in Lumetri Scope displays an image's tonal values and brightness levels.

To measure the brightness and tonal values, go back to the Lumetri Scope panel and click on the wrench icon. Click on "Presets" from the drop-down menu and select "Histogram."

## Guide to Create a Timelapse Video in After Effects

Time-Lapse movies are great for a variety of projects; you can use them as establishing shots in sitcoms, corporate marketing videos, and they can make lovely backgrounds for animated slideshows. A time-lapse video is essentially a series of photographs taken at regular intervals to depict how the environment changes gradually over a shorter period of time. In this article, we'll demonstrate how you may quickly and easily build an After Effects time-lapse effect.

With that said, let's start!

## Step 1\. Create a new composition

Calculating your composition length to accommodate the frame rate and number of images is the first step in generating a time-lapse video.

1. Verify the number of images you have for your Sequence.
2. New Composition Creation. Selecting a frame rate: A time lapse film produced at 30 frames per second will flow smoothly, but you can select any frame rate you like.
3. To determine the duration of your composition, divide the number of photographs you have by the frame rate you've chosen. For instance, if you use 600 photos at 30 frames per second, your composition will last 20 seconds.

## Step 2\. Import your images

You are prepared to make a time-lapse sequence if all of your photographs are saved to the same folder and are in the same order. If you are working directly from your Camera, you will likely have Camera Raw files, although this procedure works with PNG and JPEG sequences.

1. Press Command/Control I on your keyboard or select File > Import. Find the folder holding your image sequence.
2. To begin, select the first picture in the sequence. If all of your images have accurate names, After Effects will be able to identify a sequence of images.
3. Make sure the Force Alphabetical Order and Camera Raw Sequence checkboxes are selected. Your Time-Lapse Sequence will display in the Project Browser Panel after you click Import.
4. Once you've watched how it plays, you can adjust the Frame Rate by right-clicking the Sequence in the Project Browser and selecting Interpret Footage > Main.
5. To update your time-lapse, modify the Frame Rate setting and click OK.

![import images into after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/import-images-into-after-effects.jpg)

## Step 3\. Create movements

1. After Effects' Time-Lapse Sequence can be used just like any other standalone clip. This implies that you may give your time-lapse clip movement by adding Keyframes and Effects.
2. Place your Playhead at the beginning of the clip after choosing the Image Sequence. Make a keyframe for the scale or position.
3. To generate a second Keyframe for the value of your choice, move to the end of the clip. Make any necessary Clip modifications.
4. Right-click on the timeline, choose New > Adjustment Layer, then add your effects to the Adjustment Layer to add effects like noise and grain.

## Step 4\. Create slow motion from a video

You can import your video after you've shot it to prepare it for editing. The same steps, including naming your photos in order, must be taken for the Time Lapse sequence. It may be advantageous to entirely rename both your Image Sequence and Performer clip.

1. Drag the finished Time Lapse sequence to your Timeline after completing it as previously explained.
2. Over the Time Lapse, add the Performer Clip to the Timeline.
3. Choose Time>Time Stretch by performing a right-click on the performer clip.
4. You can alter the Stretch Factor or Duration in the dialogue box. When you alter one parameter, the other will reflect the new Stretch Factor or Duration for you.

## Step 5\. Make an overlay

You can alter the Stretch Factor or Duration in the dialogue box. When you alter one parameter, the other will reflect the new Stretch Factor or Duration for you.

1. Find Luma Key in the Effect Control Panel and drag it to your clip.
2. Change the Key Type setting in the Effect Control Panel to Key Out Brighter.
3. The Threshold, Tolerance, and Edge settings should be adjusted until only the silhouette is visible.
4. Use the Pen or Mask Tool to create a circle around the parts you want to delete if you discover any corners of your clip that are still visible.
5. Add any Effects, such as Light Leaks, to your Adjustment Layer by choosing "Right-click > New > Adjustment layer."

![make an overlay after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/make-an-overlay-after-effects.jpg)

After Effects CC must be opened, a new project must be created, the Import File menu option must be selected, and the appropriate folder containing the altered still images must be located and selected before the time-lapse photos can be turned into a film. You need to make sure that the JPEG Series box is checked, as well as the Force Alphabetical Order box.

Once you have clicked on the first image in the sequence. The time-lapse video that you uploaded appears in the project library. After performing a right-click on the filename, select "New Comp from Selection" from the context menu.

## Step 6\. Exporting your video

After getting our sequence to perform some kind of slow, understated animation so that it appears as though the camera is moving dramatically, we will need to export a video file. Go to File > Export > Add to Render Queue, then open the Render Queue dialog box by going to Window > Render Queue. From there, you can choose the Output Module and change the settings in the options dialog box. Finally, choose the Output To option and select the location on your computer where you would like to save the video clip that we are currently rendering and exporting.

![add to render queue after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/add-to-render-queue-after-effects.jpg)

## Conclusion

No matter how you make your time lapse videos, After Effects has a ton of features you can use to modify and enhance the way they look. Now that you are familiar with the fundamentals, you can play with the Frame Rates and Composition options.
