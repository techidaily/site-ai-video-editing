**Lightworks speed up part of a video** \- If you want to speed up only a certain part of your video, you need to split the video. All you need to do is reposition the playhead and click the "C" icon to split the video. Thereafter, you can select any split portion of the video and follow the steps to change the speed.

**Audio Video Syncing** \- You can alter the speed of the video as well as the audio on Lightworks. When you are performing speed-up video in Lightworks, you should ideally change the speed of the audio. This will make the video and the audio stay in sync so that it does not sound awkward.

**Work with Frame Rate** \- If you know beforehand that you will change the speed of a certain scene, you should set the frame rate accordingly. If you want to slow down a video, you should shoot it at a higher frame rate. Similarly, if you want to speed up your video, you should shoot it at a lower frame rate. This is because, after the change of speed in Lightworks, the frame rate will be usual rather than abnormal. The video will be soothing to the eyes of the viewers.

## Part IV. Is There an Easier Way to Change Video Speed?

There is no doubt that most users find Lightworks difficult to operate. This is because the user interface is not tailor-made for beginners. It is more for advanced video creators who have experience in video editing. If you are looking for an easier way to change video speed, we recommend Wondershare Filmora.

Filmora is a professional video editor like Lightworks. However, Filmora has wider popularity because of its intuitive user interface. Anyone can use the video editor without prior experience, and they can easily locate the required options. In fact, Filmora has a better collection of stock media files, video effects, and graphical elements. You can also save the edited video file in different file formats as per your requirements.

As a matter of fact, Filmora offers more options than Lightworks on how to speed up the video. You can choose from presets, customize speed uniformly as well as vary the speed through the video through curvy graphs. We will illustrate all the different ways to change the speed of your video on [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).
