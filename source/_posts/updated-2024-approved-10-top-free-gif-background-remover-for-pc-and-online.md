## Part 5 Use stock images to pep up your text collage

The text is the additional elements of the collage to make them look more interesting while the images and photos remain as the main content. So, no matter how interesting your text and its design are, if the images in the collages are not interesting, the collage will be of no good.

So, if you do not have interesting pictures matching your theme in high quality, no need to worry as there are several tools that can help you use their stock images for creating a collage or other purposes. One such superb tool we suggest here is **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** which is a complete video editing tool that also has an impressive collection of pictures and other stick media in high quality.
