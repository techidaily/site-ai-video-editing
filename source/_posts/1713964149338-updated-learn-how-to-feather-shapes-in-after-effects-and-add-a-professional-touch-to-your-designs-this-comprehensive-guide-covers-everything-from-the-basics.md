## Learn How to Feather Shapes in After Effects and Add a Professional Touch to Your Designs. This Comprehensive Guide Covers Everything From the Basics to Advanced Techniques. Perfect for Beginners and Experts Alike

Feathering shapes in After Effects can greatly enhance your designs' overall look and feel. This technique involves creating a soft, blurred edge around the shapes, which adds a sense of depth and dimension. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced After Effects user, understanding how to feather shapes is a valuable skill to have in your arsenal.

This guide will cover everything you need about feathering shapes in After Effects. From the basics to advanced techniques, you'll learn how to add a professional touch to your designs and take your skills to the next level.

Whether you're creating a logo, animation, or visual effect, the ability to feather shapes will help you achieve the desired look and feel for your project. So, let's dive in and explore the world of feathering in After Effects!

## What Is Mask Edge Feather in After Effects?

Mask Edge Feather in After Effects is a feature that enables you to create a soft or blurred transition between the masked and unmasked areas of your composition. The mask feather setting can be found in the properties and is measured in pixels. Increasing the feather value increases the softness or blurriness of the mask's edges, creating a smoother transition between the masked and unmasked parts of the image.

One of the key benefits of feathering masks is that it allows you to blend the masked object with its background, making the effect look more natural and convincing. The mask feather tool can also create custom feather shapes anywhere along the edge of the mask. To access the mask feather tool, switch to the pen tool by pressing the "**G**" key and selecting the feather pen.

The mask edge feather feature in After Effects is a powerful and versatile tool that can help you achieve a wide range of creative effects. Whether you're creating an animation or visual effect, or want to add a professional touch to your designs, understanding how to use the mask feather tool is an essential skill in your After Effects toolkit.

### How To Feather a Shape in After Effects?

Feathering a shape in After Effects is a simple process that can greatly enhance the look and feel of your designs. By following these steps, you'll be able to easily feather shapes in After Effects and add a professional touch to your designs.

Keep in mind that the feather value can be adjusted to your preference and the needs of your project, so feel free to experiment and see what works best for you.

There are two options to feather the edge in After Effects:

### How To Use Variable Mask Feather in After Effects?

Variable mask feather in After Effects allows you to create masks with variable feathering. It means you can have different feather values for different parts of the same mask. This feature gives you greater control and flexibility over your masks, allowing you to easily create complex effects and transitions.

With variable mask feathers, you can create complex effects, such as a shape that feathers more in one direction than the other. Or you can create a mask with a soft transition in one area and a hard transition in another.

By experimenting with different feather values and mask shapes, you can achieve a wide range of creative effects in After Effects. To use variable mask feather in After Effects, you'll need to follow these steps:

Step1 Use the pen tool to create corner points.

## Easily Sync Audio With Video With Filmora

Syncing audio with video is an integral part of video editing for any video creator. But believe me; it's not such a difficult task if you know what to do. The point is IF YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO.

That's why in this brief guide, we'll show you the simplest way to sync audio with video using a fantastic video editor easily. But wait a minute, some of you might be confused about why we even need to sync separate audio & video when a single camera can record both. So let's first answer this simple question.

## Part 1: Why Do We Need to Sync Separate Audio & Video?

Creating great video needs extraordinary video graphics, content, and top-notch audio. And you can't expect a single camera to achieve all these goals. That's why all professional video creators use a specialized camera for recording with a separate audio recording device.

You might think it's an exaggeration, but this small change can have massive effects on the quality of your video. Especially the background noise removal effect of separate external microphones.

![recording audio and video separately for higher quality](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/recording-audio-and-video-separately-for-higher-quality.jpg)

But the downside of using this method is that after the recording is complete, you must sync these audio and video files. And if you don't do it right, all the effort goes to the drain within a split second. Well, nobody wants to watch a video with an audio lag. Isn't it?

Correctly synching an audio file with a video is easier than you think. You just need to prepare beforehand and use a suitable video editing tool. So considering these factors, let's first see what preparations we need. After that, we'll recommend a top-class video editing tool to achieve this goal in detailed steps. Why are we still waiting? Let's begin our journey.

## Part 2: Preparation for Syncing Audio With Video During Recording

You must make some preparations to sync an audio file with a video properly. It's to have a sound spike to match the footage properly with the separate audio file. And it might look disturbing, but even a simple Clap might do the job.

And if you want a professional way, just imagine the clapper board. You must have seen it in the film industry. This clapper board is used not only to mark the shot but also to create a sound spike when it claps. We use this audio spike as a reference to sync the audio files with the video.

![a clapper board used to start a film scene](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/film-start-clapper-board.jpg)

Every time you cut your shot, remember to clap on camera again the next time you roll. It's best to clap before you say "Action" or speak so that it's easy to find and sync when editing. But if you forget, you can also clap at the end of the shot before you cut. That is called a **Tail Slate**!!!

After you've recorded your video like this, the next step is pretty simple. The video editor we recommend is no other than the world's leading tool in the market, Wondershare Filmora. Let's move forward and see how to sync audio with video using [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

## Part 3: How To Sync Audio With Video Using Filmora

Before we dive into the step-by-step guide, here's a brief overview of Filmora.

### **Wondershare Filmora**

![wondershare filmora official website interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/wondershare-filmora-official-website-interface.jpg)

As far as the audio synching is concerned, you can do it either manually or with auto synchronization. And we will explain both of these processes in a stepwise manner to give you complete mastery over your audio synching. Let's start with the manual process first.

### Steps To Manually Sync Audio With Video Using Filmora

##### Step1Download & install

If you haven't downloaded the latest version of Filmora yet, click the button below to download it without any cost. And after the download is completed, you can install it on your device right away.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

##### Step2Import your files

The next step is to import all the files. Launch the Filmora and click on the "New Project" button from the opening interface.

![click on the new project](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/create-a-new-project-on-filmora.jpg)

When a new project is created, you'll see an "Import Media" section on it. Click on this section to browse your audio and video files from the computer. Or you can also drag and drop these files here to import them.

![import your media files](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/import-media-section-in-filmora.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

##### Step3Prepare your files

Now, it's time to prepare our files for synchronization. First, drag the video file down to the timeline from the "Import Media" section. After that, drag the audio file in the same way below the video on the panel.

![drag the media files to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/drag-the-media-files-to-the-timeline.jpg)

##### Step4Sync the audio & video files using the audio spike

Now that the video and audio files are on the timeline, you'll have to find the moment you clap your hands. Look at the waveform from the in-camera audio and the independent audio track. At the moment you clap, we'll see a spike.

**_Bonus Tip:_** _If you can't find the audio spike, zoom the panel to make it easier._

![find the sound spike on video and audio files](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/find-the-sound-spike-on-video-and-audio-files.jpg)

Now take the independent audio clip and align it so that both the spikes match.

![align the sound spikes with each other](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/align-the-sound-spikes-with-each-other.jpg)

That's it! We just need to remove the in-camera audio now. Let's see how to do it now.

##### Step5Remove the audio from the video footage

To detach the audio in the video footage, right-click on this file and select the "Detach Audio" option. Or you can also use the "Ctrl+Alt+D" as the hotkey.

![detach audio from video file](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/detach-audio-from-video-file.jpg)

## Part 4: FAQs About Synching Audio With Video

### Is auto synchronization better than manual syncing?

Many situations may arise where you may be left with no choice but to use the manual syncing of separate audio and video files. So make sure to properly learn both these methods, and each one of them will definitely come in handy someday.

### How can we sync audio & video for free?

As far as the audio synching is concerned, you can do it either manually or with auto synchronization. And we will explain both of these processes in a stepwise manner to give you complete mastery over your audio synching. Let's start with the manual process first.

### Steps To Manually Sync Audio With Video Using Filmora

##### Step1Download & install

If you haven't downloaded the latest version of Filmora yet, click the button below to download it without any cost. And after the download is completed, you can install it on your device right away.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

##### Step2Import your files

The next step is to import all the files. Launch the Filmora and click on the "New Project" button from the opening interface.

![click on the new project](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/create-a-new-project-on-filmora.jpg)

When a new project is created, you'll see an "Import Media" section on it. Click on this section to browse your audio and video files from the computer. Or you can also drag and drop these files here to import them.

![import your media files](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/import-media-section-in-filmora.jpg)

##### Step3Prepare your files

Now, it's time to prepare our files for synchronization. First, drag the video file down to the timeline from the "Import Media" section. After that, drag the audio file in the same way below the video on the panel.

![drag the media files to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/drag-the-media-files-to-the-timeline.jpg)

##### Step4Sync the audio & video files using the audio spike

Now that the video and audio files are on the timeline, you'll have to find the moment you clap your hands. Look at the waveform from the in-camera audio and the independent audio track. At the moment you clap, we'll see a spike.

**_Bonus Tip:_** _If you can't find the audio spike, zoom the panel to make it easier._

![find the sound spike on video and audio files](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/find-the-sound-spike-on-video-and-audio-files.jpg)

Now take the independent audio clip and align it so that both the spikes match.

![align the sound spikes with each other](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/align-the-sound-spikes-with-each-other.jpg)

That's it! We just need to remove the in-camera audio now. Let's see how to do it now.

##### Step5Remove the audio from the video footage

To detach the audio in the video footage, right-click on this file and select the "Detach Audio" option. Or you can also use the "Ctrl+Alt+D" as the hotkey.

![detach audio from video file](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/detach-audio-from-video-file.jpg)

Once the audio file has been separated, you can move forward and delete it. To delete this audio, right-click on it and select "Delete."

![delete the detached audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/delete-the-detached-audio.jpg)

##### Step6Enjoy your video with the new audio track

So here we go. Our video file has been synced with the high-quality audio file. You can now hit the Export button to get this edited file. But wait a minute. Didn't we say we'll show you a method to automatically sync audio with video? Let's start this method now.

## How To Use Virtual Green Screen to Shoot Video

We have seen video creators on YouTube using green screen effects to beautify their background to make the video look professional and eye-catching. The same is applicable for gamers who live stream their gameplay on Twitch. Instead of physically hanging green screens in the background, some video creators opt for virtual green screens. Yes, it is possible to shoot videos with a virtual green background, and you do not have to buy screen greens and deal with the problem of hanging them in the background.

The concept of using virtual greenscreen is rather new, but it is getting popular among amateur video creators who do not want to invest in purchasing green screens initially. When you use a virtual background to shoot your video, the actual physical background is replaced completely with a virtual green background. Thereafter, you have to replace this virtual background with anything by using a video editor. In this article, we will illustrate how to use a virtual green screen to shoot video.

## 1\. Free Virtual Green Screen

In order to shoot a video with green virtual background, you cannot shoot your video with your regular camera app. Otherwise, your physical background will get recorded, and replacing that through video editor is going to be time-consuming. Therefore, there are specific apps available through which you have to shoot your video so that your physical background gets completely replaced by virtual greenscreen in real-time.

Snap Camera from Snapchat is a free app through which you can shoot your video to get a virtual green background. The app comes with a Green Screen filter that makes this virtual background effect possible. However, you will need a camera recording app that can record your video with green screen effects from Snap Camera. We will be using OBS Studio for recording the video which is also available for free. Snap Camera is compatible with Windows 10 and Mac 10.11+, and hence, you can use it to shoot video from your computer webcam. Here are the steps to follow –

Step 1: Download and install [Snap Camera app](https://snapcamera.snapchat.com/) on your computer.

Step 2: Set up your webcam perfectly so that its angle is direct to your face.

Step 3: Open Snap Camera app and you will see yourself on the app through your webcam. Select the appropriate Lens(filter) and you have to select Green Screen Snap Filter.

![free virtual green screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/free-virtual-green-screen.jpg)

Step 4: You should see a green virtual background by now. Now, you have to launch OBS Studio (webcam recording software).

Step 5: Go to Sources and click on “+” icon and select Video Capture Device option.

![video capture](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-capture.jpg)

Step 6: While configuration the new device, select Snap Camera as Device. This will enable green screen virtual backgrounds and you can start recording. After recording is done, save the file on your hard drive.

![save the file](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/save-the-file.jpg)

Now that you have recorded the video with green virtual background without green screen, it is time to edit the virtual greenscreen out with the video editor.

## 2\. Best Way To Apply Green Screen Effect To Your Recorded Video

The best video editor to add green effect to your recorded video with virtual green screen is Wondershare Filmora. There are loads of video editors available with green screen feature but Filmora has the simplest steps to add green screen effects. That is why you do not have to be an expert video editor to add green screen effects to your video.
