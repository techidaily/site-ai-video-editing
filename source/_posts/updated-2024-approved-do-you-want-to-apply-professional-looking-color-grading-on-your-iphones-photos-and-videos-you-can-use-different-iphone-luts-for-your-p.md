## How to Color-Correct an S-Log Footage

S-Log is a gamma curve optimized for digital cameras to maximize the image sensor's performance. Although these videos may look flat and washed out, they contain lots of color information. Even better, video creators can use color correction to edit the S-Log videos and make them look as natural as possible. That's what this article is all about.

## How to Color-Correct an S-Log Footage

This tutorial assumes that you already have an S-Log footage. If not, you can record S-Log footage using most Canon, Sony, and Panasonic cameras.

![how to color-correct an s-log footage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/record-s-log-footage.gif)

Let's get to the steps!

##### Step1 Adjust the color settings

Start by adding your video to the timeline on [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and then double-click the video track. Then, click on the **Color** tab before tapping **Advanced**.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

![adjust the color settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/color-correction-basics-1.jpg)

##### Step2 Read and study the histogram

Now you'll see the Advanced Color Correction pop-up window. Here, you'll see a histogram with the brightest point on the right and the darkest point on the left. From our example, you can see that the video has more dark pixels than bright ones. Horizontally, the histogram shows you how many pixels are in a certain range of brightness.

![read and study the histogram](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/color-correction-basics-2.jpg)

##### Step3 Adjust the image colors

Once you've understood the histogram, look for pure black and white parts on the video clip. For example, in this video, you can see that the roofs are pure black and the boat at the bottom-right corner is pure white.

![adjust the image colors](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/pure-blacks-and-whites.gif)

After finding the white and black parts in the video, go to the **Light** section, then adjust the **Highlights** to see if you can get a pure white on the boat. If the boat or any other image of your choice doesn't look pure white, increase the **Whites** slide to make it whiter.

![go to the light section](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/color-correction-basics-3.jpg)

Now adjust the **Shadows** settings to reduce the effect and make the roofs look closer to pure black. If you want the roofs to look darker, drag the **Blacks** slider to the left.

**Pro tip**: Ensure that the darkest and brightest points don't cross the broken lines on the edge, or the video will start losing details.

##### Step4 Adjust the color saturation

Does your video still look a little flat? Probably yes! In that case, click the **Color** section and adjust the **Saturation** slider to the right to make the video less flat. Saturation simply means how colorful a video clip is to the viewer. Apart from the color saturation, you can also adjust the **Vibrance** to make your video objects look more colorful.

![adjust the color saturation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/color-correction-basics-4.jpg)

##### Step5 Preview and compare the video

Now it's time to check and compare the results. To make it easier, click the **Eye** icon at the top-right corner to switch between the original S-Log video and the color-corrected clip. You can also tap the **AB** icon and choose **Split View-Left/Right** to view the clips in the side-by-side mode.

## Consider a LUT to Be a Color Preset that a Filmmaker Can Use to Start Working on a Project Quickly. Sony Engineers Have Developed LUTs to Help Filmmakers Perform Specific Tasks. All of These Are Available for Free

If you've ever worked in the color grading profession, you're aware of how time-consuming and labor-intensive it is to achieve a specific look on a scene. To master color grading, you must practice constantly, one of the reasons for the existence of specialists in this field. While everybody can color grade, not everyone can do it well. People in this business have devised remedies to make the editing workflow considerably more accessible and less time-consuming.

Achieving a specific ambiance in a scene demands ongoing effort and naturally takes longer. LUTs, or Lookup Tables, were created as a result. LUTs are ideal for storing a set of colors to use later or in another program. A LUT is the most effective technique to color or alters your image's colors.

## Benefits of using LUTs

There are numerous advantages to using lookup tables to edit your footage. We've already discussed that it helps to give your films a more polished and professional appearance, which is one of the primary explanations why individuals use LUTs, but there are many more.

### 1\. A beginning towards professionalism

This is a fantastic approach for beginners to have a good idea of how to build their own trademark looks in their videos. The time it takes to develop your color grading craft is unavoidable. So, as a novice, LUTs will come in useful for you to establish your approach and save your ass, big time.

You'll eventually come up with a blend of your own LUTs to use, resulting in your own LUT. Not only will LUTs aid in color grading learning, but they will also save funds and resources. You will not only devote time to learning color grading, but you will also spend a significant amount of money on color grading tools and equipment, such as software and color panels. You'll see why color grading equipment is necessary when you get to this point.

However, for the time being, employing LUTs is the most cost-effective way to obtain a cinematic look.

### 2\. It saves your time

Because LUTs are predefined colors used to establish a specific look on a picture, they save you time. Having a trustworthy LUT to use for video will save the life of freelance editors who are constantly meeting commitments and modifications. Isn't the purpose of color grading to generate a visual emotion for your movie? So, with LUTs, you can create one without going through the time-consuming process of manual color correction. Only one-color preset will be applied to all scenes in a single LUT.

However, there's a good probability that it won't look the same in all of the images. This is where you'll adjust the colors to make them more evenly match the film. It's nothing significant most of the time, just some little saturation adjustments, etc.

### 3\. Work on a budget

Time spent in a color-grade suite may be highly costly, and it can lead your films to go over budget in order to achieve a specific aesthetic. LUTs, on the other hand, are available for free online or for a fee for more complex versions. Even if you buy your LUTs, you could save thousands of dollars based on the size of your film. LUTs can also assist you in meeting tight deadlines, and setting targets too optimistically is something I'm sure we've all done at some point.

Whether it's a client or a personal project, things can often get pushed to the last minute, so having something in your arsenal that can save you time is always a good bonus. There are, however, projects where you need to appear competent without investing a lot of time on them due to budget limits; this is where a lookup table comes in handy because you can modify the complete style of your movie in a matter of seconds by pressing a few buttons. Even complicated editing can be completed quickly, giving you more time to work on other tasks that will earn you more money.

### 4\. It provides an artistic approach

LUTs are beneficial because they allow videos shot with cameras that shoot very dark, discolored images to have more vivid tones and contrast. This is excellent for grabbing viewers' attention and making videos more intriguing and engaging. LUTs add an artistic element to videos and can help you develop a visual artistic identity for your videos if you use the same colors. Another advantage of LUTs is that they enhance the color quality of videos shot on smartphones with particular color schemes. Although this varies significantly from brand to brand, you can use LUTs to make a Smartphone video more vibrant and appealing.
