## Part 1 **What Is Freeze Frame Video Editing?**

**Freeze frame** video editing is a video editing technique that halts movement in a video for a given period. It converts moving pictures into still photography for some time. These video editor effects help filmmakers gear attention to the video editing or filmmaking process. In other words, they are self-reflexive.

## Part 2 **Ways to Use Freeze Frame in Video editing**

Freeze frames can be helpful in 3 significant ways in video editing;

**●** At the beginning of a movie/video: Freeze-frame at the beginning helps you pique the audience's interest and give them a sneak peek of what to expect in the movie. This **freeze-frame** technique was used in the film 'Good Fellas' to pique the audience's interests.

**●** At the end: Using a freeze-frame allows the audience to choose or decide how the movie ends, whether it is obvious. The 'breakfast club' filmmakers use a freeze-frame at the end to emphasize the young boy.

**●** In the middle, subtly capturing intense moments like in the movie 'The Departed.'

## Part 3 **What are the Best Freeze-Frame Video Editing Examples?**

It takes a great deal of skill to employ freeze frame with the best results correctly. It might bore the audience or give another impression other than the intended when not done effectively.

The freeze-frame allows the audience to guess who the winner will be, thus a longer time to think of the movie after watching.

### 04**Thelma and Louise**

![Thelma and Louise](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/best-freeze-frame-video-editing-4.jpg)

In the film, Thelma and Louise are both running from the authorities. Louise killed a man who almost raped her friend, Thelma, thus the run. Things get out of control as they try to escape to Mexico, away from the authorities.

While on the run, they get ambushed by the police towards the grand canyon. The audience, at this point, is in suspense as to whether the ladies will survive or not.

Instead of surrendering, they drive right into the grand canyon, and the movie ends in a **freeze-frame** as they get caught hanging in the air while plunging into the canyon.

Regular movies might decide to give us all the details of the car plunging and exploding.

They open their truck and see a man badly wounded and beaten, Tonny stabs him, and Jimmy shoots him. Henry then closes the truck and looks on in a **freeze-frame** before uttering the lines, "As far back as I can remember, I have always wanted to be a gangster."
