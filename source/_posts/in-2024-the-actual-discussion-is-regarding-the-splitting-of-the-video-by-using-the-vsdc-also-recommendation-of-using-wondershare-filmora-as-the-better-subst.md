## Top 5 Best Video to PPT Converters

Almost three decades after its debut, Microsoft PowerPoint has become a hallmark of professionalism and quality in the presentation software industry. Traditional PPT files produced by PowerPoint have many drawbacks, including the fact that the content of your presentations may be readily edited and reused by others.

The Save to Video option in 2010 and subsequent versions of PowerPoint addresses this problem by allowing users to produce video files that may be readily shared on social media, video sharing sites, or utilized in eLearning courses. The built-in PPT file conversion function in newer versions of PowerPoint has several restrictions that prohibit you from picking the video file type or incorporating embedded media files in the PowerPoint presentation video.

That's why we've compiled a list of the top five video to ppt converter to make the process of turning a PowerPoint presentation into a movie as simple and enjoyable as possible.

Using this sophisticated converter, any PPT files made with 2013 or previous versions of PowerPoint may be quickly converted to movies. RZ PowerPoint video to ppt converter also allows you to create HD video files that can be readily shared online, as well as files that can be burnt to DVDs.

Any current video playback device can play videos generated with this program, and the quality is so outstanding that you can play them on huge LCD displays.

An unencumbered trial edition of this video editing program helps you create professional-looking films from PowerPoint presentations. Camtasia Studio's single-user license is a good alternative for those who just need to convert a few presentations for free, but if you're searching for a full-featured video to ppt converter, you should consider purchasing Camtasia.

Facebook has its aspect ratio as also Instagram, TikTok, Facebook story and reels. This will make your video fit into the platform and make the video come out professionally and grandly.
