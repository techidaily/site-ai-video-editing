## Have the Desire to Create a Stylish Glitch Effect to a Text on Your Video? Use Filmora for the Editing, Following the Given Steps Explained in Detail

Have you noticed the glitching effect that appears when you play a video or in games, creating a sporadic shaky effect on video edges? While this usually signifies a systematic software issue in these cases, the effect itself can work to create a dynamic visual style for different objects when done intentionally.

In fact, many video editors today use the glitch effect on elements in their videos, like the introductory title in movies or trailers. It creates a futuristic look to the text, which highly appeals to viewers who engage more in the video itself.

Suppose you are looking to add a similar effect to the title of your video project or other text-based content that you will add to your video, use a good tool for that.
