**Supported OS: Linux, BSD, Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows**

Avidemux offers three fundamental operations: cutting, encoding, and filtering. Cutting allows users to copy, paste, save, or delete a specific part of a video and is incredibly beneficial when users are only interested in a small portion of a video or want to remove commercials from a TV show that they have recorded.

Encoding, on the other contrary, is the way of transforming a video to various formats so that it can be played on different players. Users of Avidemux can use this feature on videos they want to use for business or archive for personal use. They could also use this to convert a video that they intend to post online.

Users can also use Avidemux to filter their videos, which include incorporating subtitles and color profiles, deinterlacing, resizing and sharpening the image of a video, and increasing or decreasing the overall volume of the audio.

Meanwhile, Avidemux has task automation features that make video processing and editing quick and painless. A feature called Joblist allows users to organize their projects in a queue so that they can access their files from a single location. They can use this queue to handle videos in bulk as well.

**Supported OS: Linux, BSD, Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows**

Avidemux offers three fundamental operations: cutting, encoding, and filtering. Cutting allows users to copy, paste, save, or delete a specific part of a video and is incredibly beneficial when users are only interested in a small portion of a video or want to remove commercials from a TV show that they have recorded.

Encoding, on the other contrary, is the way of transforming a video to various formats so that it can be played on different players. Users of Avidemux can use this feature on videos they want to use for business or archive for personal use. They could also use this to convert a video that they intend to post online.

Users can also use Avidemux to filter their videos, which include incorporating subtitles and color profiles, deinterlacing, resizing and sharpening the image of a video, and increasing or decreasing the overall volume of the audio.

Meanwhile, Avidemux has task automation features that make video processing and editing quick and painless. A feature called Joblist allows users to organize their projects in a queue so that they can access their files from a single location. They can use this queue to handle videos in bulk as well.

**Features:**

* Multiple Formats
* Video Filters
* Advanced Interlacing
* Full Editing Control
* Simple Interface
* Open Source

**Pros:**

* Covers standard formats.
* All essential features are present.

**Supported OS: Linux, BSD, Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows**

Avidemux offers three fundamental operations: cutting, encoding, and filtering. Cutting allows users to copy, paste, save, or delete a specific part of a video and is incredibly beneficial when users are only interested in a small portion of a video or want to remove commercials from a TV show that they have recorded.

Encoding, on the other contrary, is the way of transforming a video to various formats so that it can be played on different players. Users of Avidemux can use this feature on videos they want to use for business or archive for personal use. They could also use this to convert a video that they intend to post online.

Users can also use Avidemux to filter their videos, which include incorporating subtitles and color profiles, deinterlacing, resizing and sharpening the image of a video, and increasing or decreasing the overall volume of the audio.

Meanwhile, Avidemux has task automation features that make video processing and editing quick and painless. A feature called Joblist allows users to organize their projects in a queue so that they can access their files from a single location. They can use this queue to handle videos in bulk as well.

**Supported OS:** Mac and Windows

The best video cutting tool is Joyoshare Media Cutter for Windows (or Mac). As a professional video trimmer, it allows you to cut your media files at a 60X faster rate, allowing you to clip a 60-minute video or audio file in just one minute. The interface design is also simple and clean, allowing you to do it quickly.

Another noteworthy feature is the ability to easily cut and merge both video and audio without sacrificing quality. The cropper supports a variety of video and audio formats, including AVI, MP4, MPEG, VOB, WMV, ASF, RM, RMVB, 3GP, MP3, WMA, M4R, and others, allowing you to save the file in any format and on any device, including Apple.

More notably, this is a capable all-in-one video cutter. In addition to cutting videos and audio, it can convert all popular video formats, extract audio from video files, and merge video and audio files from the same source into a new one.

**Features:**

### Convert to Any File Format

### Merge Video and Audio Files into Multiple Formats

### Improved Accuracy & Efficiency in Cutting Videos

### 60X Fast Conversion

**Pros:**

* Offers an easy way to cut, merge, and convert video files
* Blazing fast video-cutting and file-conversion speed
* Supports multiple audio and video file formats

**Cons:**

* Can only merge videos from the same source. That means you can’t use the program to merge separate videos from your gallery.
* The program doesn’t offer an easy way to remove an unwanted part of a video if it’s in the middle of the video. The only way to do that is by cutting the section before and after the video, then merging them into one.

**Steps:**

### **Step 1: Adding Video**

![cut-video-ffmpeg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/cut-video-ffmpeg-32.jpg)

To add a video, click the “**Open**” button. Locate the video you want to trim from your collection and open it. Alternatively, you can use the drag-and-drop feature.

### **Step 2: Select the Segment to Be Trimmed**

At the bottom of the Joyoshare video window, you’ll be able to see a time slider through which you can skip to your desired timeframe. Move the slider handles attached to the yellow timeline bar to set the starting and ending points of your video.

![cut-video-ffmpeg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/cut-video-ffmpeg-33.jpg)

Once you’ve set your desired starting point, click on the “\[” button to highlight the starting segment, then move the right-hand slider to select the ending point, and click the \] button to set the end segment.

### **Step 3: Choose Your Desired Output Format and Destination Folder**

![cut-video-ffmpeg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/cut-video-ffmpeg-34.jpg)

Click the “Format” button, and a new window will pop up where you’ll be able to choose your preferred output format.

### **Step 4: Trim the Video**

Click the “Start” button to begin trimming the segment. Wait for a minute for the program to finalize trimming the segment, then click the save button. That’s it! You’ve successfully trimmed your first video.

If you wish to cut and merge several segments, click the “+” icon at the bottom of the segments tab, then follow the above procedure to create several segments.

So how to cut MP4 video with Movavi Video Editor Plus? If you want to snip a video into two or more parts, click the file on the Timeline and move the red marker to the place where you want to make the first cut. Then click the Split button with the scissors icon or hit Ctrl+B. Repeat the process as many times as you need.

![cut-video-ffmpeg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/cut-video-ffmpeg-39.jpg)

**XILISOFT VIDEO CUTTER**

![cut-video-ffmpeg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/cut-video-ffmpeg-41.jpg)

**Supported OS:** Mac and Windows

Xilisoft Video Cutter is an effective programming cutter that lets you choose and cut your preferred segments in a single file as well as cut out the segments you don't like. It is compatible with almost all popular video formats, including VCD, AVI, MPEG, MP4, WMV, 3GP, /MPEG-4 AVC, /PSP AVC, MOV, ASF, and others. It enables you to precisely set the start and end points.

While the software cannot cut segments from multiple input files at the same time, it can cut your selected source video into the number of clips you require in a single step. Xilisoft Video Cutter goes beyond standard cutting or slicing by allowing you to convert your video input files to a variety of well-known codecs. It is possible to convert the entire source file or just a specific segment, but this requires removing those unnecessary parts that frequently cause problems (TV advertisements, trailers, etc.).

**Features:**

Easily Cut Video Clips

Multi-trim Video to Whole

Output Clips to Multiple Formats

Instant Preview

Clear Timeline

Advanced Editing

1-2-3 Interface

Multilingual Interface

**Pros:**

Supports all of the most widely used video file formats

Converts your videos between formats

Simple cutting interface

Allows for multiple cuttings from a single source file

**Cons:**

Does not support batch processing

**Steps On How To Cut Your Favored Segments:**

1. **Add Source Video File**

![cut-video-ffmpeg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/cut-video-ffmpeg-42.jpg)

Click the "**Open**" button on the main interface, and select a video file in the pop-up window.

1. **Set Clip Segments**

Click "Play" and click the "Set Start Point" and "Set End Point" buttons successively during playing the video to set the start point and endpoint of the clip.

![cut-video-ffmpeg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/cut-video-ffmpeg-43.jpg)

You can also set several segments. Click the "Show Advanced Mode" button and click the "New Clip" button in advanced mode to set the start and endpoints of the segments. Repeat the above steps to set several segments.

Tip: To delete a segment, please choose the segment in the segment list, and click the "Delete Clip" button on the toolbar; to adjust the segment order, please choose the segment and click the "Move Up" or "Move Down" button to adjust its order.

1. **Output Settings**

Click the "Cut" button at the bottom of the window to open the "Output Settings" window.

1. **Start Cutting**

Click the "OK" button to start video cutting. During cutting, you can check the cutting status by dragging the process bar or canceling the cutting. Tip: After cutting is done, click the "Open Output Folder" button to open the destination folder to check the clippings. Click the "Done" button to go back to the main window.

**WHICH SHOULD I CHOOSE: FREE OR PAID VIDEO CUTTER ON MAC?**

Whether you choose Free or Paid Video Cutter, it still depends on your edit and navigation if the project will succeed like what you’re anticipating. Beginners in the industry can go for Free Video Cutters to practice the craft without worrying about the monthly subscription.

However, if you’re a professional, I highly suggest that you choose Paid Video Cutter to lessen the hassle and create amazing output.

In most cases, trimming only causes a minor loss of video quality. And there is no clear causal relationship between trimming and losing video quality. The main factors that influence video quality are Resolution, Bitrate, and Frame size.

If you are longing to pick up the best video cutter for Mac, you are supposed to evaluate it from different aspects, like operating interface, cutting features, output quality, post-processing ability, etc. Frankly speaking, there is no fixed answer.
