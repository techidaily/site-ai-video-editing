**#1\. Silence Detection**

Filmora has some great audio features, and silence detection is one of them. Silence detection simply recognizes instances of silence and removes them from your video instantly. Silence can make people confused or disappointed. Indeed, Filmora can instantly find the part of no sound and cut it out.

**#2\. Audio Ducking**

Moreover, there is audio ducking, another great audio feature from Filmora. When recording voiceovers, narrations, translations, podcasts, etc., you can automatically lower the volume of one track to make another track clearer by using a Filmora audio feature called "audio ducking."

**#3\. Auto Synchronization**

Meanwhile, you can record videos and additional audio to improve the video's audio quality. Filmora's audio synchronization feature will help the video's sound by perfectly matching the two simultaneously. With audio sync, it'll be easier to match the sound to the video, making it sound clearer.

**#4\. Speech to Text (STT)**

With Filmora's Speech to Text (STT) feature, you can quickly turn your voice into subtitles. Furthermore, using speech-to-text will save you a lot of time on subtitling and speed up the editing process. When you hover on the Speech to Text button, Filmora will instantly detect the speech in your video and turn it into text.

**#5\. Text to Speech (TTS)**

With Filmora's Text to Speech (TTS) feature, adding voice to your video is straightforward. When you click on the button, Filmora could well turn your text files into speech instantly.

**#6\. Audio Visualizer**

Last but not least, Audio Visualizer is an exceptional audio feature that Filmore offer. The Filmora Audio Visualizer will bring your music video to life. The effect will dynamically sync with the sound in your video.

## Conclusion

**Remove audio from video without watermark** is fairly easy. You can choose a tool that has been recommended and read a complete tutorial on how to do it. However, if you are looking for a good online editing maker, we recommend Filmora, considering that Filmora is rich in features.
