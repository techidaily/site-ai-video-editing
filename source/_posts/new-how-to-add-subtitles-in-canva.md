**●** There are a lot of transitions and filters to make the slideshow look amazing.

**●** There are various text templates to help you annotate more effectively.

Let your imagination run wild with editing tools that are both powerful and easy to use.

**Step 1**: Uploading Images and Videos to Filmora

Once the video editor has loaded, go to the Media tab's Import menu and select Import a Media Folder. Navigate to the folder containing the materials for your slideshow, select it with a click, then hit OK to import it into your project.

 **Step 2**: Position the Media Files on the Timeline

 Simply select a file to be added to the timeline and drag and drop it to the preferred location. Repeat this method for all of the images you'd like to include in your slideshow, then organise them in the same order as they'll appear in the presentation.

**Step 3**: Avoid Hard Cuts Between Slides by Using Transitions

A hard cut between two photographs can break the flow of your slideshow, but you can simply correct this by transitioning gently from one slide to the next.

If you double-click a transition after it's been added to the timeline, you'll be sent to the Transition Setting Window, where you can define the default duration for all transitions you add to a slideshow and choose your preferred transition mode.

**Step 4**: Enhance the colours in your slideshow with filters and overlays.

The Effects tab, which is next to the Transitions tab, contains a variety of visual effects that desaturate or brighten the colours in your images. Filmora's visual effects are divided into filter and overlay categories, each with its own subcategories such as Lomography, Sepia Tone, and Light Leaks.

**Step 5**: Incorporating Motion Graphics Elements into Slides

Hundreds of motion graphics templates are available in the Elements tab, which you can rapidly add to the timeline.

**Step 6**: Creating Slideshow Soundtracks and Recording Voiceovers

Select the Record Voiceover tool from the Record drop-down menu on the Media tab. When the Record Audio window appears on the screen, select the microphone you'll use to record the narration and press the Record button.

You may use Filmora's large library of music and sound effects for free. Simply navigate to the Audio tab and browse the subcategories of Electronic, Young & Bright, and Rock until you select the perfect song for the slideshow's soundtrack.

**Step 7**: Exporting Slideshows from Filmora

The final step in the process of creating a slideshow in Filmora is to export the project. Click on the **Export** button and wait for the **Export window** to appear on the screen. You can then select the output file format, set a preferred frame rate or resolution for your slideshow, or export

**●** There are various text templates to help you annotate more effectively.

Let your imagination run wild with editing tools that are both powerful and easy to use.

**Step 1**: Uploading Images and Videos to Filmora

Once the video editor has loaded, go to the Media tab's Import menu and select Import a Media Folder. Navigate to the folder containing the materials for your slideshow, select it with a click, then hit OK to import it into your project.

 **Step 2**: Position the Media Files on the Timeline

 Simply select a file to be added to the timeline and drag and drop it to the preferred location. Repeat this method for all of the images you'd like to include in your slideshow, then organise them in the same order as they'll appear in the presentation.

**Step 3**: Avoid Hard Cuts Between Slides by Using Transitions

A hard cut between two photographs can break the flow of your slideshow, but you can simply correct this by transitioning gently from one slide to the next.

If you double-click a transition after it's been added to the timeline, you'll be sent to the Transition Setting Window, where you can define the default duration for all transitions you add to a slideshow and choose your preferred transition mode.

**Step 4**: Enhance the colours in your slideshow with filters and overlays.

The Effects tab, which is next to the Transitions tab, contains a variety of visual effects that desaturate or brighten the colours in your images. Filmora's visual effects are divided into filter and overlay categories, each with its own subcategories such as Lomography, Sepia Tone, and Light Leaks.

Hundreds of motion graphics templates are available in the Elements tab, which you can rapidly add to the timeline.

You may use Filmora's large library of music and sound effects for free. Simply navigate to the Audio tab and browse the subcategories of Electronic, Young & Bright, and Rock until you select the perfect song for the slideshow's soundtrack.

**Step 7**: Exporting Slideshows from Filmora

**Step 1**: Uploading Images and Videos to Filmora

Once the video editor has loaded, go to the Media tab's Import menu and select Import a Media Folder. Navigate to the folder containing the materials for your slideshow, select it with a click, then hit OK to import it into your project.

 **Step 2**: Position the Media Files on the Timeline

 Simply select a file to be added to the timeline and drag and drop it to the preferred location. Repeat this method for all of the images you'd like to include in your slideshow, then organise them in the same order as they'll appear in the presentation.

**Step 3**: Avoid Hard Cuts Between Slides by Using Transitions

A hard cut between two photographs can break the flow of your slideshow, but you can simply correct this by transitioning gently from one slide to the next.

If you double-click a transition after it's been added to the timeline, you'll be sent to the Transition Setting Window, where you can define the default duration for all transitions you add to a slideshow and choose your preferred transition mode.

Hundreds of motion graphics templates are available in the Elements tab, which you can rapidly add to the timeline.

**Step 6**: Creating Slideshow Soundtracks and Recording Voiceovers

Select the Record Voiceover tool from the Record drop-down menu on the Media tab. When the Record Audio window appears on the screen, select the microphone you'll use to record the narration and press the Record button.

You may use Filmora's large library of music and sound effects for free. Simply navigate to the Audio tab and browse the subcategories of Electronic, Young & Bright, and Rock until you select the perfect song for the slideshow's soundtrack.

**Step 7**: Exporting Slideshows from Filmora

The final step in the process of creating a slideshow in Filmora is to export the project. Click on the **Export** button and wait for the **Export window** to appear on the screen. You can then select the output file format, set a preferred frame rate or resolution for your slideshow, or export

It is important to point out that there are very many animation programs in the market and choosing the best one will depend on your needs, your style, the feature and tools you need, the cost of the program, and even the export options that each tool gives you.

Before we look at the best ways to create animated videos, let’s start by examining why you would need to use an animated video maker in the first place.

## When to Use an Animated Video Maker

There are several reasons why you would want to create an animated video, rather than use traditional video solutions. The following are the most important from a digital marketing standpoint;

**Improve Conversion and Sales**

Animated videos are engaging enough to improve your conversion and sales. Studies have shown that an animated video can increase both conversion and sales by up to 80%. It may therefore be a good idea to use an animated explainer video to show your potential customers how to purchase a product or service on your website.

**Increase Brand Awareness**

Because they can be very entertaining and engaging, animated videos can also be a great way to increase brand awareness. And since they can be created very easily and cheaply, they can be a good way to reach potential customers.

**Generate Online Leads**

Because of the engaging nature of animated videos, you can use them to introduce yourself to potential customers and generate online leads. They have a very high conversion rate, as we have seen before, making them one of the best ways to reach people who would otherwise have never heard of you and your brand.

**Explain Complex Processes**

It can be very difficult to try to explain very complex ideas such as the mechanical aspect of a certain tool using words. But a well-crafted animated video gives you the chance to explain complex ideas in a fun and engaging way, making it easier for your customers to understand and engage with your brand.
