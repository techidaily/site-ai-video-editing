## Part 2: Possible Causes of SRT Subtitles Not Working Properly in VLC

While users can **add subtitles to VLC** since the player supports SRT extension files, some issues can cause them not to appear. Here are some potential causes of the error.

**SRT files corrupted or empty**

In case the SRT file you are trying to access is corrupted or does not contain any content, that will not open in the VLC media player.

**The subtitles setting in VLC Media Player is not turned on**

Sometimes, the SRT files are password protected or only work on video players that allow permission for it to play. So, if you have not enabled SRT access in the settings of the app, the SRT-formatted text will not appear.

**Doesn’t update VLC to the latest version**

In cases when the VLC Media Player itself is corrupted or outdated, it cannot allow access to some subtitle formats. You must upgrade it to the latest official version to allow video and SRT file support.

**Wrong encoding instead of UTF-8**

VLC player app only allows the SRT files that have UTF-8 encoding to play on the platform. Users can view the SRT files on videos if they are using the right encoded text, so make sure that you do not have the wrong encoded file.

**Other unknown bugs**

Other issues can cause the defect to the VLC player and, therefore, cannot open the **VLC SRT file.** These include certain unknown bugs and malware- make sure to check your system to find the errors.

## Part 2: Possible Causes of SRT Subtitles Not Working Properly in VLC

While users can **add subtitles to VLC** since the player supports SRT extension files, some issues can cause them not to appear. Here are some potential causes of the error.

**SRT files corrupted or empty**

In case the SRT file you are trying to access is corrupted or does not contain any content, that will not open in the VLC media player.

**The subtitles setting in VLC Media Player is not turned on**

Sometimes, the SRT files are password protected or only work on video players that allow permission for it to play. So, if you have not enabled SRT access in the settings of the app, the SRT-formatted text will not appear.

**Doesn’t update VLC to the latest version**

In cases when the VLC Media Player itself is corrupted or outdated, it cannot allow access to some subtitle formats. You must upgrade it to the latest official version to allow video and SRT file support.

**Wrong encoding instead of UTF-8**

VLC player app only allows the SRT files that have UTF-8 encoding to play on the platform. Users can view the SRT files on videos if they are using the right encoded text, so make sure that you do not have the wrong encoded file.

**Other unknown bugs**

Other issues can cause the defect to the VLC player and, therefore, cannot open the **VLC SRT file.** These include certain unknown bugs and malware- make sure to check your system to find the errors.

## Part 3: Ultimate Tutorial: How to Open SRT Files in VLC \[100% Working\]

If your system is not affected by any or all of these potential issues, the VLC player allows users to access SRT files easily. The software is available on different devices, so let's discuss the steps on **how to open the SRT file in VLC** for each type.

### Method 1: Open SRT Files in VLC on Computers

VLC is accessible on Windows and Mac computers, including some Linux devices. The process of accessing and opening the SRT files in the media player is mentioned here.

**How to open SRT files in VLC on Windows/Mac?**

Step1 Download the VLC media player software on your computer from the official site. Complete the installation process following all on-screen instructions.

Step2 Launch VLC on your device. If you have not downloaded the SRT file for your video, do it separately.

Step3 On your device, go to the main file manager (Windows Explorer for Windows users or Finder for macOS users). Organize the video file that you will add the SRT file into and the relevant SRT file into one folder.

![organize the video and srt file into one folder](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-open-and-use-srt-file-in-vlc-1.jpg)

Step4 Drag and drop both video and SRT files into the VLC media player you launched on your computer.

Or, double-click on the video file and choose “Open with VLC media player” from the options.

You can directly click on the File tab on your VLC player software and choose Open File.

![choose open file](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-open-and-use-srt-file-in-vlc-2.jpg)

Step5 After the video begins playing on-screen, open the main menu and choose Subtitles > Add Subtitles.

Step6 From your folder, choose the SRT file to upload.

### Method 2: Open SRT Files in VLC on Android

It is possible to use the VLC app version on Android smartphones and tablets to view video and SRT files. The application is available for Android users in two versions- this depends on the type of processor running on the device. The compatible processors are Intel x86 and AMRv7 and higher.

**How to open SRT files in VLC on Android?**

Step1 Download the VLC for Android app on your device.

Step2 Click on the "Pick a File" button and add the video from your storage.

Step3 Tap on the screen in different sections to control specific functions.
