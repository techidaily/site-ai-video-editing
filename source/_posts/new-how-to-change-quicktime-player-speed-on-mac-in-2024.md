## Part 2 How Do You Use Topaz Video Enhance AI?

When we are talking about **topaz labs video enhance AI review,** it's incomplete if we do not talk about the process of using it**.** The whole process of **video enhance AI topaz labs** can be divided into these parts:

### 01Importing of videos

To open a dialogue box showing your videos, click on the center of the screen. You can select more than one video or even drag those videos directly into the app from the dialogue box that has been shown.

![import video topaz](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-topaz-video-enhance-ai-review-and-achieve-powerful-video-conversion-2.jpg)

The videos you have selected will be shown at the bottom of the screen. You can pick each video individually to edit, or you can do a batch edit of all the videos.

![import video topaz 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-topaz-video-enhance-ai-review-and-achieve-powerful-video-conversion-3.jpg)

To remove a video or a video queue, you can click on the delete icon above the video list.

### 02Choosing AI Processing Models

You need to choose the suitable models to edit or enhance your video. Different AI Processing models will be available in the app itself; you can choose if you want to choose from those models.

### 03Settings of the output of the video

The app offers in-built standards to set your output, or you can create your custom settings.

![set output format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-topaz-video-enhance-ai-review-and-achieve-powerful-video-conversion-4.jpg)

For the output of the video, the app allows both picture and video sequence output.

![select output](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/learn-topaz-video-enhance-ai-review-and-achieve-powerful-video-conversion-5.jpg)

Sometimes a black bar appears on the output video when non-standard-sized videos are converted to standard preset.

But there is a solution to this, you fill the frame by clicking on the "Crop to fill frame" option.

### 04Setting a name for your output

With the height, width, and scale of the output video, the current name will be shown by default. You can change this by unchecking the box and selecting the "Use default output name," Then, there will be a dialogue box on your screen.

In that dialogue box, type the name of your output video, select the format or type of your output file, select the location where you want to save your output and then click on the "Save" option.

### 05Preview of the output video

You can see a short clip of 30 rendered framed of your output as a preview.

To preview the render, you need to select and drag the slider on your video's timeline. Position the slider where you want to see the preview of your render or output.

You need to wait for a while so that the clips get processed. After the processing is complete, there will be a split-screen.

One part of the split shows the original video clip, and the other split shows the edited or rendered previews on loop.

### 06Trimming of the output video

To understand simply, the more your output size, the more time it takes to process.

To save the processing time, you can trim only that part of the rendered video you need.

To start with the trimming process, you need to drag the slider along the video's timeline to select the starting timestamp of the video.

After you have positioned your slider, click on the "scissor" icon on your screen to trim the beginning of your rendered video.

To trim from the end of the rendered video, you have to drag the slider to the ending position of your video.

After your slider is perfectly positioned, click on the "scissor" icon on your screen to trim the end part of your rendered video.

A part of your timeline will be highlighted; this highlighted portion will be processed as you edit, enhanced output.

### 07Processing of the final output

To get the final output, you need to process the video.

To start with the processing, click on the "Start Processing" option at the bottom. Your video will be shown frame by frame until the processing of the video is complete.
