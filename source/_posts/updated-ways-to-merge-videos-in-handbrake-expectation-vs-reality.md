## How to Create Video in Text Intro?

Have you ever seen videos on social media apps or movies and seen a video in text like the title as the intro? The highly appealing and unique style makes the video introduction stand out. Not to mention, it creates an illusion of almost-transparent titles that showcase the video playing in a subdued manner in the background, thereby showcasing a modern, funky intro.

![edit flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-5.jpg)

Step 2: Use cutting and splitting tools to edit the video.

The first icon is a picture of a pair of scissors, which is a cutting tool. It's very useful when you need to cut the beginning or end of a film. Place the cursor exactly where you want to cut, then select "Trim start" or "Trim finish" from the dropdown cutting menu (the small triangle next to the scissors icon).

 ![edit flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-6.jpg)

Step 4: Save changes and export video.

Make sure your movie appears exactly how you want it to before exporting it. If the video appears choppy, use the red preview button and lower the preview quality. When the PC's resources are insufficient to process the video in real time, lagging can occur. Keep in mind that it has no bearing on the outcome. When you're finished, navigate to the Export project tab and select an export format.

### **2\.** **Adobe Premiere Pro:**

Professional video editors use Premiere Pro to make everything from YouTube videos to Hollywood films like Mank, a 2021 Oscar candidate. It's also widely utilized in the workflows of designers, animators, and VFX artists, and we can see why after lengthy testing.

We found the software's UI to be simple to use, and it increased our productivity by separating things into various workspaces, such as editing, effects, and audio. When we tested it on both Mac and PC, we discovered that each workspace helps handle a specific activity while minimizing distraction.

Edit the FLV video with Adobe Premiere Pro using the following steps:

## **2 Ways to Edit FlV Video on iPhone:**

### **1\.** **LumaFusion:**

No other software program on the iPhone comes close to the feature set that LumaFusion offers for video editing. It is the only premium app on this list, and it is well worth every penny.

But, of course, YouTubers aren't the only ones who use the program; mobile journalists and professional video producers who don't want to lug along their bulky camera equipment and editing apparatus also use it.

LumaFusion deals with up to six video and audio tracks for photographs, movies, audio, titles, and graphics, and six audio tracks for narration, music, and sound effects. You also receive a magnetic timeline; importing clips is a breeze once they've been imported.

There are many transitions and effects to choose from, all of which can be layered. Finally, it includes much royalty-free music, sound effects, and other assets. So if you need a professional video editing tool for your iPhone, LumaFusion ($29.99) is the way to go.

Follow these steps to edit FLV video using LumaFusion:

Step 1: To create your first project, press + at the bottom of the screen. You can create a new project by tapping that area or by tapping the Plus button.
