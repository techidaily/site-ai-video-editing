Cutting a video is necessary even if you shot a very good video because it contains some irrelevant and unwanted clips. Removing the unnecessary part of the video will make the video short, concise, and to the point. Moreover, it helps in grabbing the attention of your valuable viewers.

If your video has multiple scenes to cut, **the scene detection** function would be helpful.

* Install Filmora video cutter
* Select the New project.
* Select the video in the media library.
* Right-click and select **scene detection** to enter the scene detection window.

![cut-video-quicktime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/cut-video-quicktime-7.png)

Pointing the Marker will help to find the unwanted potion without wasting the important portion of the clip.

Here is all about trimming the video from beginning to end but if you want to cut the video into parts to remove the rest of the fat from the clips. You can follow these steps:

* Click the **split icon** above the timeline.
* Drag the **play head** to make a rectangle to cover the unwanted portion of the video.

Cutting the video by splitting is used when you have a long video and you can easily edit them by splitting them into two parts.

### **2\.** **Trimming a video**

If you are cutting some parts at the beginning and the end of the video, it is called trimming a video. You can say it as removing unnecessary preparation scenes. Normally, professionals start their cameras before the film scene to ensure not to miss any part of the video. Here’s, how to trim video in the QuickTime player.

Let’s dive in…

* Launch **QuickTime**
* Select your **video** from the system.
* Select **edit** from the top menu.
* Select the **trim** or **command T**, or you can select the **hold** option from the drop-down list.

![cut-video-quicktime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/cut-video-quicktime-3.png)

![cut-video-quicktime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/cut-video-quicktime-4.png)

Everything inside the **yellow bars** will remain. You can preview your video anytime during the editing process.
