## How to Turn On/Off Motion Blur in Minecraft?

Minecraft has been one of the most played games in the community. Known among hundreds of thousands of users, this game has been a prominent choice of many YouTube gamers. Streamers from all over the world are fond of playing this strategy game.

Although the game tentatively has a very basic graphic system, it has improved a lot with multiple features. Such is the addition of **Minecraft motion blur,** which has had mixed reviews throughout the community. For this article, we will be working on how to turn on/off the motion blur effect in Minecraft. The discussion covers everything related to the feature and its functionality.

![minecraft motion blur featured image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-minecraft-1.jpg)

## Part 1: What is Motion Blur in Games?

Before you further discuss **Minecraft motion blur,** it might be vital for you to understand what the effect actually is. Motion blur effect has made a mark in video editing for presenting a realistic approach to videos.

For fast-moving objects, you can consider using the motion blur effect to display their swiftness. The use of the effect is consistently based on improving the user experience and showing objects in a realistic environment. The use of motion blur in games is based on providing a similar experience that was considered for videos.

As most games utilize stop-motion animation, it tends to lag at a lower frame rate. Motion blur enhances the gaming effects and smoothens them in a lower frame rate. This allows users to get a smooth game experience at a lower and adjustable frame rate. Motion blur in games has been added with the objective of smoothening the gameplay.

## Part 2: Does Minecraft Have Motion Blur?

Minecraft has provided the option of including the motion blur effect in its game. For a better visual experience, this effect has turned out to be quite beneficial. The existence of motion blur in Minecraft is equivalent to smoother gameplay, which is accomplished under a low frame rate. Rather than having screens with higher frame rates, you can get a low-end option.

All of this is essentially possible with the help of the motion blur effect. Even though Minecraft has a low-graphic display, it does not lag with motion blur. This is why the particular effect is recognized and acknowledged in the market. It has been discovered that Minecraft allows users to add motion blur from the graphic settings.

However, you must ensure that the device you are implementing has the tendency to control and manage the change and smoothness. Improper management of the motion blur under complex conditions will lead to multiple problems.

## Part 3: How to Get Motion Blur in Minecraft?

With an overview of the motion blur effect and what it is, we will now see how it can be obtained in the game. For the following steps, it can indeed work on the latest Minecraft versions, but it is precisely for versions 1.7.10 and 1.8.9.

Furthermore, we will focus on two different techniques to go along for getting motion blur in Minecraft. Let’s proceed to find out **how to get motion blur in Minecraft** by following these two methods:

### Method 1: Using PVP Clients

Step1 You can consider using any appropriate PVP client, such as [Lunar Client](https://www.lunarclient.com/) or [Badlion](https://www.badlion.net/), as they provide the appropriate mods to get motion blur in Minecraft.
