## How to Create Vintage Film Effect 1950S

So, what's the difference between a vintage film shot in the 1920s and 1950s? It's simple; in the 1950s, video-making technologies were slightly advanced, although films were more about rock and roll and poodle skirts. So, without further dilly-dallying, let's learn how to create a retro 1950-style video with this simple Filmora tutorial.

## Preparation

![1950 vintage scene](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/1950-vintage-scene.gif)

Shooting a video to teleport yourself to the 1950s doesn't need to be complicated. You simply need to look the part in the video. For example, you can wear velvet-collar jackets, stovepipe trousers, carefully combed back hair, and other trendy styles in the 50s. It's even better if you can find those vintage chairs in your grandparent's collection.

How to create a 1950s vintage film:

##### Step 1 Add your video on [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

![add your video on filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1950s-1.jpg)

First, fire up Filmora and load the video you want to send back to the 1950s. Then, drag your footage onto the editing timeline.

##### Step 2 Apply a cropping effect to the video

![apply a cropping effect to the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1950s-2.jpg)

Once the video is successfully added to Filmora, click the **Effect** tab on the top menu bar and choose the **Crop** effect under the **Utility** folder. Make sure you add the Crop effect two or three tracks above the original video track.

![click the effect tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1950s-3.jpg)

Double-click the Crop effect, then change the Left and Right values to make the video look like it was shot in the 50s. You can set the values as 10.

##### Step 3 Add a Warm Film color effect

![add a warm film color effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1950s-4.jpg)

Up to here, you'll realize that your video doesn't still look like a 1950s film per se. Double-click your video clip and choose the **3D LUT** option under the **Color** category. Then, open the drop-down menu and choose **Warm Film**. This will make your video look like it was shot using an old camera.

##### Step 4 Apply more graininess to the film

![apply more graininess to the film](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1950s-5.jpg)

Please don't stop there; we want to make the footage slightly grainy. In other words, you need to make the footage have a lot of grain and low light. To do that, tap the **Overlay** menu under the Effects tab, then click **Old Film**. After that, choose the **Random Dust, Dirty Film,** and **Subtle Grain** effects and add them to the tracks above your video clip. Remember to use as much grain as possible to give your footage that vintage look of the 1950s.

## Summary

And that's all there is today! With these steps, you can create an engaging 1950s film without breaking a sweat on Filmora. Remember to visit our other vintage tutorials to learn how to create a film recorded in the 20s, 80s, and 90s. Happy editing, everyone!

Before we dive deeper into this **Easy HDRi** review, let's first discuss how this HDR software rates in some critical aspects:

### 1\. Effectiveness - 4.8/5

The HDRi process on this software is very effective, although you shouldn't have high expectations. It provides manual and automatic lens correction properties, although using the manual option might need a learning curve. Other extras include ghost removal and automatic alignment.

### 2\. Price - 4.7/5

Easy HDR is not necessarily a free program. Although there's a free demo version, it's pretty limited in features. Therefore, purchase the premium plan for $33 or $55 for personal and lifetime licenses. As a seasoned HDR editor, you should know that other HDR programs like Aurora HDR cost way more than this.

### 3\. Supported OS - 5/5

This HDR photography program is compatible with Windows and macOS systems, which is a big plus. You can install it on Windows 7 or newer and macOS 10.12 or newer. Sorry, Linux users!

### 4\. Ease of use - 4.8

Easy HDR is one of the most beginner-friendly HDR processing tools despite the advanced management tools. It features automatic lens correction, ghost removal, and HDR merging capabilities.

### 5\. Best for - Beginner HDRi editors

This program's simple approach makes it perfect for HDRi photographers without prior editing skills. Also, if you're a beginner on a tight budget, easyHDR is the best software for you.

**Our Verdict**

Up to this juncture, you might wonder if Easy HDR is worth the money or not. Well, that depends on what you want. If you have minimal HDR editing knowledge, then this is the best professional program for you.

The straightforward layout boasts automatic HDR editing tools to make your work effortless. In addition, it supports a wide array of image formats, including photos taken using your DSLR camera. And the $33/lifetime price should be manageable by many average Joes.

But on the flip side, Easy HDR lacks in-depth post-processing tools. Also, it lacks the all-important “undo” feature, which is vital in HDR image editing. Other than that, it's the perfect program to make dramatic and realistic HDR photos.

 Pros

* Simple layout.
* Make realistic HDR images with automatic tools.
* Easy HDRi Blender and Adobe Lightroom plugins.
* Standalone Easy HDR desktop program.
* Batch processing supported.
* Compatible with multiple image formats, including RAW.

 Cons

* It doesn't have advanced HDR post-processing tools.
* No HDR feature for editing.

## Part 2\. Detailed Review for Easy HDR

Before diving deeper into the detailed Easy HDR features, it's important to note that the program has a demo version. You can use this version to practice and study the vital components of easyHDR. But be guided that the demo version exports images with a watermark. In addition, users can't save HDRi in TIFF format. Let's get in!

### 1\. High-Quality Bracket Merging

A good quality HDRi software should easily merge different image exposures, making the photo look natural and spectacular. To start incorporating, drag the image brackets to easyHDR and press “Ok” on the pop-up screen. You can now try the different bracket merging effects until you find something that suits your preference.

### 2\. Editing features

EasyHDR goes a step further to provide its users with a comprehensive list of editing features. For example, the “Clone Stamp” tool can remove unwanted objects like cables without blurring the photo. You can also use the “Tone Curve” feature to adjust the brightness of shadows and highlights.

### 3\. Ghost removal

No, this is not the scary ghost that you know. Instead, these ghosting artefacts appear in misaligned photos due to moving objects like leaves, branches, cars, people, etc. With Easy HDR, you can eliminate the “ghosts” manually or automatically. Simply open the photo and turn on “Ghost Removal” to remove them automatically.

### 4\. HDR batch processing

As expected, you can find it pretty tedious to import and merge each HDR bracket individually. For this reason, easyHDR comes with a “Batch Processing” feature that allows users to combine a whole folder of brackets automatically.

### 5\. LDR enhancement

Although we've mainly focused on brackets and photos in this post, it's important to note that easyHDR also works with single images. Instead of having three separate bracketed exposures, LDR (Low Dynamic Range) enhancement allows you to generate exposures from a single JPEG or RAW photo.

## Bonus Tips: The Best Way to Edit HDR videos on your Desktop

Like HDR images, HDR videos offer more comprehensive displays in dark and bright surroundings. In short, these videos allow more colourful and detailed highlight representations. Unfortunately, not all HDR editing programs can merge bracketed exposures effortlessly to produce outstanding results. And those that do can cost you an arm and a leg.

With that in mind, we recommend [Wondershare Filmora 11](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for professional and semi-professional HDR editors. It's a simple but detailed program that allows users to edit HDR materials quickly and easily. It houses thousands of free effects you'll use with the Blending Mode to create nice HDR footage. Filmora 11 works with any video format, including RAW footage from your camcorder. And of course, there are many other editing features like color correction, color grading, image stabilization, chroma key/green screen, etc.

**Steps to add an HDR effect to a standard video on Filmora 11:**

##### Step1Open the video on Filmora 11

![adding a cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-05.png)

Step6 Drag and drop the paper photo onto the second video track of the timeline, and make sure it starts at the cut on the first video track.

![freeze frame has a paper texture](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-08.png)

Step8 Now you can use the new feature of Filmora to export this small portion of the video. First, click and drag the playhead to the start of the freeze frame and press **"I"** on the keyboard to set the **IN POINT**, then move the playhead to the end of this freeze frame and press **"O"** on the keyboard to set the **OUT POINT**.

![setting the in point](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-09.png)

![replaced the freeze frame and paper photo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-012.png)

Step11 Now let's make the second part of the transition effect. You should drag and Drop **Clip 2** onto the timeline and move the playhead to the clip's first frame. Then Add a Freeze Frame; you can also do it by pressing the **Alt+F** keys. Now click and drag the playhead to the end of the freeze frame and make a **Cut**.

![adding clip 2 to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-013.png)

Step12 Drag and drop the paper photo onto the second video track of the timeline and make sure it starts at the beginning of the freeze frame on the first video track. And again, change the blending mode to Multiply as well.

![adding paper photo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-014.png)

![replaced the freeze frame and paper photo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-016.png)

Step16 Now you can add several Filmora transitions to finish the effect. Go to the **Transitions window** and find Evaporate 2.

Step3 Drag and drop **Clip 1** onto the timeline and move the playhead to the last frame of the clip.

Step7 Double-click the paper picture on the timeline to open the settings window and then open the **Compositing** menu. Then Change the **Blending Mode** from Normal to **Multiply**.

In the preview window, we can see that the freeze frame has the paper texture now!

Step8 Now you can use the new feature of Filmora to export this small portion of the video. First, click and drag the playhead to the start of the freeze frame and press **"I"** on the keyboard to set the **IN POINT**, then move the playhead to the end of this freeze frame and press **"O"** on the keyboard to set the **OUT POINT**.

**Note:** If you have the latest version, Filmora will automatically set the OUT POINT on the timeline.

Step9 Then click **Export** and choose **Create Video**. Let's name it **freeze frame 1** and click on Export.

![selecting create a video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-010.png)

It will only export the selected part on the timeline. Once the exporting process is completed, **Right-Click** on the timeline and **Cancel** the selected range.

Step10 Import the **Freeze Frame 1** to the media folder and replace the **Freeze Frame + Paper Photo** with this clip. Then adjust the length of this clip to 1 second.

Step11 Now let's make the second part of the transition effect. You should drag and Drop **Clip 2** onto the timeline and move the playhead to the clip's first frame. Then Add a Freeze Frame; you can also do it by pressing the **Alt+F** keys. Now click and drag the playhead to the end of the freeze frame and make a **Cut**.

![adding clip 2 to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-013.png)

Step12 Drag and drop the paper photo onto the second video track of the timeline and make sure it starts at the beginning of the freeze frame on the first video track. And again, change the blending mode to Multiply as well.

![adding paper photo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-014.png)

Step13 Select the range you want to export by setting **IN and OUT** points as we did before. Press the **I** key on the keyboard to set the in point, drag the playhead to the out point, and press the **O** key.

![selecting in and out points](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-015.png)

Step14 This time use the shortcut **Control + E** to open the export window. Again, let's name it **freeze frame 2** and then export it.

Step15 You can use the keyboard shortcut **Shift + X** to cancel the selected range. Then import **freeze frame 2** into the media folder and replace the freeze frame + paper photo. Adjust the length of this new clip to about 1 second.

![replaced the freeze frame and paper photo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-016.png)

Step16 Now you can add several Filmora transitions to finish the effect. Go to the **Transitions window** and find Evaporate 2.

![select the transition effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-017.png)

Step17 Drag and drop it onto the cut between **clip 1** and **freeze frame 1** and the cut between **clip 2** and **freeze frame 2**. You can also adjust the length of the transition.

Step18 Then, find **Torned Paper Transition 4** in the **Transitions window**. Drag and drop it to the cut between **freeze frame 1** and **freeze frame 2**. Then choose **Prefix** mode in the transition setting video. Adjust the length if needed.
