Some factors to consider when choosing a cloud storage service for videos include how easy it is to use, the number of storage options available, and the price.

Some popular **best video cloud storage** services for videos include Flicker, Wondershare Drive, and Adobe Creative Cloud. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages, so it's essential to consider what you need before making a decision.

Ultimately, the best cloud storage service for videos is one that meets your specific needs. So don't hesitate to try out different services to see which one is best for you.

## Part 1: No.1 Flicker

Flickr is an online image hosting and video hosting service that has been around for a long time. However, SmugMug now owns it, and you can access photos and videos from Flickr without registering an account.

### Flicker Free Storage Policy

Flickr is a great **online video storage** service, but it can be limiting if you want to store many pictures and videos. For example, a Flickr free account can only store 1000 photos and videos, which means it can only hold about 2-3 GB of data.

Flickr also has some limitations when it comes to file size. For example, photos are limited to 200 MB and videos are limited to 1 GB. However, you can get around these limitations by storing the maximum allowed file size (e.g., photo files are limited to 200 MB and video files are limited to 1 GB). Additionally, if you want to share photos and videos with others, you'll need to **upload video to the cloud** or use the Flickr app on a device.

Overall, Flickr is a great online photo and video storage service, but it may not be the best option for you if you're looking for a lot of space or want to share photos and videos with others.
