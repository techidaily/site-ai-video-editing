## Part 2 Tips for a Great Slideshow Video

Videos are gaining much popularity these days. It is an easy way to connect with people and show emotions to them. In the same way, slideshow videos also are important in their place. Slides are the collection of traditional photos or negatives which are out of trend now. And slideshow videos are the perfect way to use those slides and relieve those faded memories with loved ones. Creating the slideshow video is also easy and can be done easily with the help of some tools. You don't need to be professional, but the only need is to follow certain tips carefully. Here, we are sharing the essential tips to prepare a great slideshow video. Also, you will get to know about the best tool for video creation.

**●** **Tell a story**

Prepare the slideshow video in the form of storytelling. Whatever is the theme of your slideshow, prepare the script of the video right from the start. Make a meaningful and impressive story. Select and collect the raw materials according to the requirement.

**●** **Keep it cohesive**

The cohesion of photos or images is very important in a video slideshow. It is advised not to mix and match still photos and videos in 1 slideshow. Also, choose the photos belonging to the same color family. Mixing different varieties of photos divert the attention of the viewer. Also, one warm photo, then one cool and so on are not the efficient choices for a slideshow. All the images should appear as part of one color family and are similar to one another. Always maintain the quality of photos throughout the slideshow. Gradual jumps between grainy portrait mode photos and some screenshots, meanwhile photos of other modes lead to distracting the viewer and blurring their experience.

**●** **Make it personal**

Video slideshows are a powerful tool to show your personality and your personal message. The videos should contain your feelings. So, customize them and make them as personal as you can. Give your uniqueness to your slideshows. For this, you can customize the color palette, text, etc and make them unique and personal. So that the people with whom you share the videos may also feel your touch.

**●** **Keep slideshow videos short**

There might be different aims for creating a slideshow video. You might want to share it with loved ones or any of your friends’ circle. Or you might be wanting it to post as an ad on social media platforms such as Instagram, or Facebook. Whatever the purpose of your making the video, keep them concise and short. Short video clips are best for grabbing the attention of the viewers. Everyone does not find it interesting to watch long-form videos. If you are aiming to make a longer-form video slideshow which contains both images and video clips, then keep each photo for 3 to 5 seconds and each video clip a maximum of 20 seconds. It is recommended to maintain the user’s interest throughout.

**●** **Create a storyboard to plan your slideshow video**

As we have already discussed in the above point, the video should depict your story. Also, it should be in sync to make it more compelling. Creating a storyboard or outline is the perfect way to predict the right flow as well as choose the right elements for the video.

The storyboard helps to prepare a plan and develop the logical sequence of the photos. Also, if you want to add photos, video clips, texts, etc in a single slideshow, the storyboard can help to outline the sequence. With this, you will be able to create a video that will be logically correct.

**●** **Add text to videos and images to convey your message clearly**

Text or captions are very crucial to be added to the slideshow especially if you are preparing them for social media. People these days do watch the videos by keeping the sound off on social media. So, they will not be able to get your message without captions. Keep all your key messages highlighted in the video. The first few seconds of the video play an important role. It is the deciding factor whether the viewer will watch the whole video or will just bounce back. So, give a captivating hook to the slideshow to capture the viewer’s attention and make them hit the unmute button.

## Part 2 Tips for a Great Slideshow Video

Videos are gaining much popularity these days. It is an easy way to connect with people and show emotions to them. In the same way, slideshow videos also are important in their place. Slides are the collection of traditional photos or negatives which are out of trend now. And slideshow videos are the perfect way to use those slides and relieve those faded memories with loved ones. Creating the slideshow video is also easy and can be done easily with the help of some tools. You don't need to be professional, but the only need is to follow certain tips carefully. Here, we are sharing the essential tips to prepare a great slideshow video. Also, you will get to know about the best tool for video creation.

**●** **Tell a story**

Prepare the slideshow video in the form of storytelling. Whatever is the theme of your slideshow, prepare the script of the video right from the start. Make a meaningful and impressive story. Select and collect the raw materials according to the requirement.

**●** **Keep it cohesive**

The cohesion of photos or images is very important in a video slideshow. It is advised not to mix and match still photos and videos in 1 slideshow. Also, choose the photos belonging to the same color family. Mixing different varieties of photos divert the attention of the viewer. Also, one warm photo, then one cool and so on are not the efficient choices for a slideshow. All the images should appear as part of one color family and are similar to one another. Always maintain the quality of photos throughout the slideshow. Gradual jumps between grainy portrait mode photos and some screenshots, meanwhile photos of other modes lead to distracting the viewer and blurring their experience.

**●** **Make it personal**

Video slideshows are a powerful tool to show your personality and your personal message. The videos should contain your feelings. So, customize them and make them as personal as you can. Give your uniqueness to your slideshows. For this, you can customize the color palette, text, etc and make them unique and personal. So that the people with whom you share the videos may also feel your touch.

**●** **Keep slideshow videos short**

There might be different aims for creating a slideshow video. You might want to share it with loved ones or any of your friends’ circle. Or you might be wanting it to post as an ad on social media platforms such as Instagram, or Facebook. Whatever the purpose of your making the video, keep them concise and short. Short video clips are best for grabbing the attention of the viewers. Everyone does not find it interesting to watch long-form videos. If you are aiming to make a longer-form video slideshow which contains both images and video clips, then keep each photo for 3 to 5 seconds and each video clip a maximum of 20 seconds. It is recommended to maintain the user’s interest throughout.

**●** **Create a storyboard to plan your slideshow video**

As we have already discussed in the above point, the video should depict your story. Also, it should be in sync to make it more compelling. Creating a storyboard or outline is the perfect way to predict the right flow as well as choose the right elements for the video.

The storyboard helps to prepare a plan and develop the logical sequence of the photos. Also, if you want to add photos, video clips, texts, etc in a single slideshow, the storyboard can help to outline the sequence. With this, you will be able to create a video that will be logically correct.

**●** **Add text to videos and images to convey your message clearly**

Text or captions are very crucial to be added to the slideshow especially if you are preparing them for social media. People these days do watch the videos by keeping the sound off on social media. So, they will not be able to get your message without captions. Keep all your key messages highlighted in the video. The first few seconds of the video play an important role. It is the deciding factor whether the viewer will watch the whole video or will just bounce back. So, give a captivating hook to the slideshow to capture the viewer’s attention and make them hit the unmute button.

##### Step2Brainstorm and concept development

Once you understand the current trends and styles in the music video. It's time to start brainstorming ideas. You can do it alone or with the help of your team. But remember that you have to think out of the box to make it creative.

##### Step3Consider the lyrics and message

In the planning stage, it is also important to consider the lyrics and message of the song. It would be best if you plan according to the feel and vibe of the song. It will help you to create a concept tied to the song and will help enhance its meaning.

##### Step4Experiment and find the right direction

##### Step5Effort and attention to detail

## Choose a style for your music video

While creating ideas for the music video, it's also important to consider the style of the music video. There are two main styles of music videos:

![types of music video style](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/types-of-music-video-style.jpg)

### 1.Performance-style music video

If you want to showcase energy and charisma in your music video, go for a performance-style music video. This video style focuses on you and your band performing live in front of an audience. You can shoot a video in a single take with minimal cuts or feature different angles and shots. The key is to capture the raw energy and emotion of the performance.

### 2.Narrative-style music video

A narrative-style music video tells a story or conveys a message along with the music. The story can be a visual representation of the lyrics or a multi-layered narrative. You can choose this style to convey a deeper message or story.

You can shoot this video in different locations and can include different scenes. The main motive is to create a video that emotionally connects with the audience.

Once you have an idea of what you want your music video to be about, you can put together a treatment to show the artist what your initial plan for the music video is.

## How to Turn Text Into a Podcast

Being a content creator, either writing or generating videos, requires podcast text-to-speech knowledge. The impact of content depends on how many people see it. It means finding new ways to get it into real and virtual places where customers and users might be.

Depending on the context, podcasting can be a perfect alternative for sharing content.

This article will address your questions about the easiest way to turn a blog into a podcast. Let's begin with the reasons why you should do a podcast.

## Part 1\. Why You Should Podcast

Podcasts are one of the simplest and most cost-effective ways. It helps to advertise yourself and your products to a highly targeted audience. Podcasts are also excellent for engaging with potential clients interested in your content. In your field, you can achieve fame and expertise.

![effective podcast](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/podcast-text-to-speech-1.jpg)

### Repurposing of Content

Podcasters can maximize their potential for successful episodes and repurposing their podcast into multiple content pieces.

This podcasting strategy can help you reach more people by putting your podcasts on more channels and engaging more people who might be interested.

### More Fulfilling than Articles

Unlike music, news, TV, and social media, podcast listeners don't have to watch the screen like they do with YouTube videos or TV shows. This means they can listen while walking or driving home from work.

Podcasts are the best way to get people to pay attention and make fundamental societal changes. They can keep people interested for a long time, so you can go into detail and get personal without turning off your audience.

### Minimal Start-Up Costs

To start a podcast, you can spend a little money. Even some of the most famous podcasts use a microphone, a computer, and software for recording. But it's common to spend more money on advertising and better hosting.

Starting a podcast doesn't cost much, as you can get everything you need for about $145.

### Expansion of Search Potential

In the past few years, many big brands and small to medium-sized businesses have started using podcasts as a marketing strategy. This is because podcasts are becoming more and more popular and can help raise your company's profile.

Podcasting is another way to disseminate your study to a broader audience, whether that audience consists of policymakers or interested citizens.

### Potential to Monetize

Using an affiliate program podcast, you can earn money. Businesses can increase their income by offering paid advertising sponsorships to monetize podcasts. Suppose you accept an affiliate offer to sell ads. In that case, you become the company's voice and put recorded ads in your podcast episodes.

The most common way to make money from a podcast is through sponsorship. It's also the easiest way to make money because you don't have to make or sell anything. You just have to make a deal with a sponsor.

## Part 2\. Why Are Writers Hesitant to Start a Podcast?

Even after knowing all these benefits, writers are still hesitant to start a podcast. One of the main reasons a writer may be reluctant to launch a podcast is the cost of the necessary equipment. You will need at least $80 to $500 for this unpromissing business.

However, let me tell you a secret that many podcastors didn't buy any audio equipment for the launch of their podcast channel on Spotify.

Moreover, many writers don’t want to show their voice through recordings. This is because they couldn’t just make a recording and hand it off to a sound specialist. Besides, finding their voice through the stories they write is the routine.

But we all need to get the truth that many podcastors don't record a single word of the podcast with their own voice. Due to a solution: text-to-speech, technology like this has been around for a while and continues to improve.

The two important issues have been solved, so what are you waiting for? Platform building has always relied heavily on content marketing. With blog posts and social media, additional support was provided, and now podcasts are becoming more commonplace.

## Part 3\. How to Turn a Text Into a Podcast?

### Text To Speech

To turn your text into audible content, Text-to-speech (TTS) is an assistive technology. With a single click, TTS reads your written text aloud. Many people also use it for writing and editing to maintain audience concentration.

Text-to-speech technology is compatible with all digital devices, including computers, tablets, and smartphones. Increasing numbers of websites and products now have developed this function. For example, you can find it within the trusted video editing software like Filmora. With [Filmora's Text to Speech (TTS) feature](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you may add extra aspects to your video by turning your text files into voiceovers.

**Why we regard text to speech as a good**

For writers, imagination is the only tool to construct their stories. To bring our stories to life, all we need is a laptop. The same holds for text-to-speech technologies, which can significantly assist writing and editing by allowing the author to hear their words without using their voice.

* Text-to-speech applications can assist you in repurposing your material.

Your written work can be converted into spoken language or a podcast. A podcast can be converted into a YouTube video with a few alterations. All of these factors can help you reach new audiences.

Repurposing material permits your audience to consume it in a variety of ways. The audience can read, listen to, or view your content.

* Text-to-speech systems enable authors to create information that is accessible.

As per World Health Organization, there are almost 285 million visually impaired persons and 39 million blind people. We writers can create a more inclusive world by constantly keeping accessibility in mind.

**The limitations of text to speech**

Text-to-speech software is becoming increasingly lifelike thanks to technological advancements. However, it cannot still express genuine human emotions. However, this should allow you to utilize these tools. The positives significantly exceed the disadvantages, and technology is continually improving.
