## Go Through This Guide on All Steps in Freezing Frame Sequences in Videos Using Filmora. Details Include Splitting the Clip, Reversing Speed, and More

One can add different effects to videos to create a more appealing movie style. One of the most well-liked and widely used effects is the freeze frame effect, which creates a short frozen frame effect on clips.

You can use different video editing software to create this effect in videos. But not all of them come close to the easy-to-use functionality of [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). On a video, you can utilize this feature to freeze a specific reaction of the character on screen or add a dramatic effect for a pivotal moment, like scoring a touchdown.

Upon enabling this effect, the video clip automatically splits at the frozen moments. Users insert another image file for that duration and activate the background audio and effects. If you are wondering how to carry out this feature on Filmora, read all the steps involved here.

## Launching the Software

The first step is downloading the software on your computer, whether it is macOS-powered or Windows. Go to the software's official website and click on the blue Download button at the top of the home page.

You do not have to do a lot of steps to complete this process since an installer of the app will automatically download into your device at this step. Make sure you are downloading the Wondershare Filmora 11 version since it is the latest version of the software with advanced upgrades, like the Freeze Frame support.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

To install the software, you have to double-click on the app installer that got downloaded and agree to the permissions that it prompts. Then, the installation process will continue. The software will launch automatically after the process ends and you press Start Now.

![install the software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-a-freeze-frame-squence-effect-1.gif)

## Adding the footage

Next, your main step is to add the video you will edit into the Filmora software. First, you must click the Create New Project tab on the homepage. When the editor opens, tap on the "Click here to import media" button and insert the video you will edit from your device. Next, drag it down to the editing timeline for making further changes. Choose the Keep project settings option when the prompt comes up to ensure the same quality of the video.

![insert the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-a-freeze-frame-squence-effect-2.gif)

Still, it would help if you tapped the play button on the screen to see a Preview of the video clip to check its stability and quality. Also, ensure that your main subject is darker than the backdrop in the video clip.

## Adjust the playhead location

On the video clip, you added to the editing timeline, click on the playhead. Then, drag it to move it to the specific point in the video where you will freeze the frame. Click on the Snapshot icon at the right end of the preview window to capture the frame. Press the Lock Track icon after that.

![click the snapshot icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-a-freeze-frame-squence-effect-3.gif)

## Move the image in place

After the previously mentioned step, you should drag the snapshot you just captured to the second layer on the timeline above the clip. Make sure to place the image where the playhead is, marking the point of the freeze frame. Then, drag the slider at the end of the image clip you added to the timeline to match its length with the video clip.

Afterward, you should click on the playhead and move it a little ahead by a few frames. Again, tap the "Lock Track" icon beside the image file to keep it in place. Following that, take another snapshot of the image via the Snapshot icon.

![tap the lock track icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-a-freeze-frame-squence-effect-4.gif)

## Unlock the layers

Repeat this step for a few more layers, like dragging the snapshot image to the timeline > moving the playhead by some frames > Snapshot > Lock Track. Then, after you are done with the number of stages possible with your video clip, unlock all of the locked track layers sequentially from top to bottom.

## Editing the layers

After this, click on the second clip in the layers. Right-click on the top of the clip in the timeline and choose "Edit Properties" from the drop-down menu. Next, click on the Compositing option and tap the tickmark beside it. Then, select the drop-down menu for the Blending Mode option and change Normal to Darken. Press the OK button after you are done.

![change normal to darken](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-a-freeze-frame-squence-effect-5.gif)

Following that, repeat the same for all of the layers of the snapshots to choose the blending mode parameter for them to Darken. After you are done, click on the Preview play button to see how the process worked for creating the freeze frame effect in your video clip.

## Exporting the effect the first time

After completing all the editing steps, you should select the Export button at the top of the screen. Then, choose the Local tab and click on the MP4 as the video file format. Make settings-based changes if needed and press the Export button.

![press the export button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-a-freeze-frame-squence-effect-6.gif)

After that, however, import the edited file to Filmora from your device again.

## Edit the freeze frame video clip

Choose all of the video clip sections you edited on Filmora from the timeline after adding the recently edited video clip to the editor. Then, drag this clip to the primary editing timeline layer on the timeline and drop it.

Then, drag the playhead on the clip to the frame at which the third freeze frame occurs. For this, you can play the Preview of the clip to verify. After placing the playhead at that exact moment, click on the Split icon from the toolbar above the editor timeline or the Scissor icon. Then, remove the second half of the clip.

![drag the playhead and split](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-a-freeze-frame-squence-effect-7.gif)

## Create the freeze frame to reverse the speed effect

After this, right-click on the top of the remaining video clip on your timeline. From the drop-down menu that appears, tap on the Copy option. Then, paste the second half beside the first half on the same layer.

After that, right-click on the second copied clip and choose the Speed option > Click on Reverse. After that, play the Preview to see how the effect appears in your video. Finally, export the video from Filmora.

![play the preview](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-a-freeze-frame-squence-effect-8.gif)

## How to Blur Part of a Video Using OpenShot

Designed for Windows, Mac, and Linux, OpenShot is a free, open-source, and cross-platform video editor. While there's no predefined function or filter in this tool to help you blur part of a video, OpenShot has another way of blurring static parts of your video: it uses an image.

OpenShot blur part of video is free, and you'll use its open-source programs as a base program for the edition of the video and GIMP Image Manipulation software to edit photos. Follow the guide below to learn how to blur out something in a video using OpenShot.

Step 1: Download OpenShot and install it on your device.

![blur part of a video using openshot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-12.png)

Step 2: Take a screenshot from your video, where the part you want to blur is easily visible. You can do this by going to a relevant frame and utilizing Save Current Frame with a camera icon, located on the right side of the video preview window in a standard program configuration.

![blur part of a video using openshot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-11.png)

Step 3: Be sure to save your video screenshot on your computer.

Step 4: Since you have exported a relevant frame from your video as a screenshot, you need to open it in a photo editor that can handle PNG pics and transparency, like the GIMP Image Manipulation program. Use any selection tool to select the area of the picture you want to blur on the video. Depending on your preferences, you can choose the free select tool, the ellipse select tool, or the rectangle select tool.

![blur part of a video using openshot - select blur area](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-13.png)

Step 5: In the blur filters submenu, open the Pixelize tool and adjust the options that suit your preferences. You can use CTRL-Z to cancel the operation, and repeat it until you find the best combination of blurring settings.

Step 6: When you are satisfied with blurring, right-click on the blurred area and select Invert in the Select submenu; this will allow you to select the entire part of the frame that has not been blurred, which is the part you would like to get rid of because you will only have to use the blurred part of your video overlay where necessary.

Step 7: Now, cut the section of the picture you do not want to keep. You can do this by using CTRL-X. The blurred filter for your video is now ready.

![blur part of a video using openshot - cut unwanted section](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-14.png)

Step 8: If after cutting you notice a plain color rather than a checkerboard canvas representing transparency, use CTRL-Z to cancel the cut. Then, use CTRL-I to invert the selection again to get control of the blurred selection again, and copy or cut it using CTRL-X or CTRL-C.

Step 9: Create another image using CTRL-N, and ensure you have navigated to the advanced options and selected transparency as the fill-in color, and paste your selection there.

Step 10: You now have a perfect photo with full transparency, which is represented by a checkerboard canvas, except for the section of the video frames you would like to blur that should be pixelized.

Step 11: Use the Export option under the File menu to export the photo to your PC as a . PNG file. To save a picture with a transparency channel, you need to use the . PNG extension.

Step 12: Now return to OpenShot video editor and import the generated picture with a pixelized portion in the OpenShot video project. Next, add the picture as an overlay track. Make sure it's above the video track.

Step 13: If the program asks you to import the photo as an image sequence, select the NO option because you need to import a still photo, and not a video sequence.

Step 14: The picture will be displayed before the video, blurring only the portion of the video where you modified the frame. The other parts of the video won’t be touched. You can make adjustments to ensure the picture track is only displayed at required moments. And that's how to blur part of a video using OpenShot.

## Conclusion

● Now that you know how to blur out part of a video, you can have fun and censor anything you want in your clips. Use Filmora to blur moving and still parts on your video.

## How to Blur Part of a Video Using OpenShot

Designed for Windows, Mac, and Linux, OpenShot is a free, open-source, and cross-platform video editor. While there's no predefined function or filter in this tool to help you blur part of a video, OpenShot has another way of blurring static parts of your video: it uses an image.

OpenShot blur part of video is free, and you'll use its open-source programs as a base program for the edition of the video and GIMP Image Manipulation software to edit photos. Follow the guide below to learn how to blur out something in a video using OpenShot.

Step 1: Download OpenShot and install it on your device.

![blur part of a video using openshot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-12.png)

Step 2: Take a screenshot from your video, where the part you want to blur is easily visible. You can do this by going to a relevant frame and utilizing Save Current Frame with a camera icon, located on the right side of the video preview window in a standard program configuration.

![blur part of a video using openshot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-11.png)

Step 3: Be sure to save your video screenshot on your computer.

Step 4: Since you have exported a relevant frame from your video as a screenshot, you need to open it in a photo editor that can handle PNG pics and transparency, like the GIMP Image Manipulation program. Use any selection tool to select the area of the picture you want to blur on the video. Depending on your preferences, you can choose the free select tool, the ellipse select tool, or the rectangle select tool.

![blur part of a video using openshot - select blur area](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-13.png)

Step 5: In the blur filters submenu, open the Pixelize tool and adjust the options that suit your preferences. You can use CTRL-Z to cancel the operation, and repeat it until you find the best combination of blurring settings.

Step 6: When you are satisfied with blurring, right-click on the blurred area and select Invert in the Select submenu; this will allow you to select the entire part of the frame that has not been blurred, which is the part you would like to get rid of because you will only have to use the blurred part of your video overlay where necessary.

Step 7: Now, cut the section of the picture you do not want to keep. You can do this by using CTRL-X. The blurred filter for your video is now ready.

![blur part of a video using openshot - cut unwanted section](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-14.png)

Step 8: If after cutting you notice a plain color rather than a checkerboard canvas representing transparency, use CTRL-Z to cancel the cut. Then, use CTRL-I to invert the selection again to get control of the blurred selection again, and copy or cut it using CTRL-X or CTRL-C.

Step 9: Create another image using CTRL-N, and ensure you have navigated to the advanced options and selected transparency as the fill-in color, and paste your selection there.

Step 10: You now have a perfect photo with full transparency, which is represented by a checkerboard canvas, except for the section of the video frames you would like to blur that should be pixelized.

Step 11: Use the Export option under the File menu to export the photo to your PC as a . PNG file. To save a picture with a transparency channel, you need to use the . PNG extension.

Step 12: Now return to OpenShot video editor and import the generated picture with a pixelized portion in the OpenShot video project. Next, add the picture as an overlay track. Make sure it's above the video track.

Step 13: If the program asks you to import the photo as an image sequence, select the NO option because you need to import a still photo, and not a video sequence.

Step 14: The picture will be displayed before the video, blurring only the portion of the video where you modified the frame. The other parts of the video won’t be touched. You can make adjustments to ensure the picture track is only displayed at required moments. And that's how to blur part of a video using OpenShot.
