FLV is basically used to publish or distribute videos on the Internet. Many social platforms and web pages (such as youtube, Hulu, e.t.c.) use .flv files as it provide high-quality synchronized audio and video in compact file size. It was mostly used for embedded videos on these platforms. It is compatible with most browsers and devices even with older phones and computers.

**How to play .FLV files?**

To play .flv files a flash player is required. Which is pre-installed in almost most of the computers and browsers, if that's not the case. Then you need a good video player which supports .flv format. Therefore VLC media prayer is a good choice. It is quite easy to use and has some useful features like Speed, Adding subtitles, Audio sync, e.t.c.

**Is .flv file easy to edit?**

FLV is just a format, It can be edited like any other format. Steps may differ from software to software. But don't worry as I have mentioned the steps of some popular FLV video editors above.

**Can the .flv file be converted?**

If you don't want to stick with the .flv format for long enough and want to switch over to a more convenient format then you can try these converters.

Even better, video creators can use color correction to edit the S-Log videos and make them look as natural as possible. That's what this article is all about.

## How to Color-Correct an S-Log Footage

This tutorial assumes that you already have an S-Log footage. If not, you can record S-Log footage using most Canon, Sony, and Panasonic cameras.

![how to color-correct an s-log footage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/record-s-log-footage.gif)

Let's get to the steps!

##### Step1 Adjust the color settings

Start by adding your video to the timeline on [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and then double-click the video track. Then, click on the **Color** tab before tapping **Advanced**.

![adjust the color settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/color-correction-basics-1.jpg)

##### Step2 Read and study the histogram

Now you'll see the Advanced Color Correction pop-up window. Here, you'll see a histogram with the brightest point on the right and the darkest point on the left. From our example, you can see that the video has more dark pixels than bright ones. Horizontally, the histogram shows you how many pixels are in a certain range of brightness.

![read and study the histogram](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/color-correction-basics-2.jpg)

##### Step3 Adjust the image colors

Once you've understood the histogram, look for pure black and white parts on the video clip. For example, in this video, you can see that the roofs are pure black and the boat at the bottom-right corner is pure white.

![adjust the image colors](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/pure-blacks-and-whites.gif)

After finding the white and black parts in the video, go to the **Light** section, then adjust the **Highlights** to see if you can get a pure white on the boat. If the boat or any other image of your choice doesn't look pure white, increase the **Whites** slide to make it whiter.

![go to the light section](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/color-correction-basics-3.jpg)

Now adjust the **Shadows** settings to reduce the effect and make the roofs look closer to pure black. If you want the roofs to look darker, drag the **Blacks** slider to the left.

**Pro tip**: Ensure that the darkest and brightest points don't cross the broken lines on the edge, or the video will start losing details.

##### Step4 Adjust the color saturation

Does your video still look a little flat? Probably yes! In that case, click the **Color** section and adjust the **Saturation** slider to the right to make the video less flat. Saturation simply means how colorful a video clip is to the viewer. Apart from the color saturation, you can also adjust the **Vibrance** to make your video objects look more colorful.

![adjust the color saturation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/color-correction-basics-4.jpg)

##### Step5 Preview and compare the video

Now it's time to check and compare the results. To make it easier, click the **Eye** icon at the top-right corner to switch between the original S-Log video and the color-corrected clip. You can also tap the **AB** icon and choose **Split View-Left/Right** to view the clips in the side-by-side mode.

##### Step3 Adjust the image colors

Once you've understood the histogram, look for pure black and white parts on the video clip. For example, in this video, you can see that the roofs are pure black and the boat at the bottom-right corner is pure white.

![adjust the image colors](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/pure-blacks-and-whites.gif)

After finding the white and black parts in the video, go to the **Light** section, then adjust the **Highlights** to see if you can get a pure white on the boat. If the boat or any other image of your choice doesn't look pure white, increase the **Whites** slide to make it whiter.

![go to the light section](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/color-correction-basics-3.jpg)

Now adjust the **Shadows** settings to reduce the effect and make the roofs look closer to pure black. If you want the roofs to look darker, drag the **Blacks** slider to the left.

**Pro tip**: Ensure that the darkest and brightest points don't cross the broken lines on the edge, or the video will start losing details.

##### Step4 Adjust the color saturation

Does your video still look a little flat? Probably yes! In that case, click the **Color** section and adjust the **Saturation** slider to the right to make the video less flat. Saturation simply means how colorful a video clip is to the viewer. Apart from the color saturation, you can also adjust the **Vibrance** to make your video objects look more colorful.

![adjust the color saturation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/color-correction-basics-4.jpg)

##### Step5 Preview and compare the video

Now it's time to check and compare the results. To make it easier, click the **Eye** icon at the top-right corner to switch between the original S-Log video and the color-corrected clip. You can also tap the **AB** icon and choose **Split View-Left/Right** to view the clips in the side-by-side mode.
