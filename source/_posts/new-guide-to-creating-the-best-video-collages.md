**Method 3\. Use Speed Ramping In Filmora for Better Video Results**

Speed ramping is evident as the action switches between slow, regular speed, and fast motion in innumerable action films and sports videos.

It can vary the pace of the audio or video clips. Use the Speed Ramping feature in Filmora.

Double-click the media you want to speed up - choose **Speed > Speed Ramping**. Alternatively, right-click on the media and choose **Speed Ramping.** Another option is clicking the **Speed icon > Speed Ramping** in the toolbar.

The Speed Ramping tab will let you customize the speed line. Also, it provides you with 6 different templates you can use to enhance action footage. The templates are Bullet Time, Montage, Jumper, Hero Moment, Flash in, and Flash out. In case none of the templates appeal to you, you can create your own preset and save it.

The best thing about this feature is Filmora allows you to maintain the original audio pitch. Thus, it would not sound strange after speed-ramping the media.
