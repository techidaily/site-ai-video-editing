### Ultimate Guide to Customize Video Speed in Filmora

**Method 1\. Click the "Fast" or "Slow" Options to Change the Speed Automatically**

Upon clicking your video clip, a tab will display several options to modify the speed of your video. You can choose from slow to fast options. Click each option to choose from the specific speed you want

![click the fast or slow option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/click-fast-or-slow-option.jpg)

**Method 2\. Change the Speed Uniformly with "Uniform Speed"**

If you wish to change the uniform speed of your video clip, double-clip the video to access the Speed Panel. Adjust the speed slider based on your speed uniform preference.

![select uniform speed on the speed icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/uniform-speed-1.jpg)

**Method 3\. Use Speed Ramping In Filmora for Better Video Results**

Speed ramping is evident as the action switches between slow, regular speed, and fast motion in innumerable action films and sports videos. When you progressively increase the pace of a video clip, this is called speed ramping. You have the option of changing pace swiftly or consistently in Filmora. It can vary the pace of the audio or video clips. Use the Speed Ramping feature in Filmora.

Double-click the media you want to speed up - choose **Speed > Speed Ramping**. Alternatively, right-click on the media and choose **Speed Ramping.** Another option is clicking the **Speed icon > Speed Ramping** in the toolbar.

The Speed Ramping tab will let you customize the speed line. Also, it provides you with 6 different templates you can use to enhance action footage. The templates are Bullet Time, Montage, Jumper, Hero Moment, Flash in, and Flash out. In case none of the templates appeal to you, you can create your own preset and save it.

The best thing about this feature is Filmora allows you to maintain the original audio pitch. Thus, it would not sound strange after speed-ramping the media.

![choose the speed ramping panel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/speed-ramping-1.png)

Here's how you can use the customization mode on the Speed Ramping panel.

1. Click **Customize.**
2. Place the playhead on the part of the video clip which you want to speed up or slow down.
3. Click **Add** to add a speed keyframe in that spot. Filmora will mark Speed Ramping on the media.
4. Drag the white dot in the adjustment panel to change the video speed. Drag it upwards to accelerate the video speed or downwards to decelerate it.

### Splice Video Editor FAQs

##### 1\. Why can't I upload projects when using Splice?

Relinking your Splice folder could help if you experience problems downloading or uploading projects. The cache folder in your Splice app can also be cleared to resolve most download problems. Splice may require more space than is available before exporting the movie, relying on your export preferences. Any stored files that are kept may also use space. For instance, the app may require up to 2 GB of storage space if your finished film is 1 GB.

If you're experiencing trouble downloading samples from the website, check that your Splice account is logged in on both the website and the desktop client. If you're not logged onto the same profile on both the website and the app, samples/packs you've purchased online won't appear.

##### 2\. How to remove watermarks on my video saved from Splice?

* **Android**

You can choose between utilizing the Splice app and learning how to speed up video on the splice app or an online watermark removal tool to remove a watermark from Splice. Launch the application and choose the video you wish to modify. To erase any watermarks from your movie, click the three dots in the right corner of your screen and select **"Watermarks."** Following that, you must submit your video to the software and adhere to the watermark removal instructions. Following that, you must submit your video to the software and adhere to the watermark removal instructions.

* **iPhone**

You must confirm that Splice is already loaded on your iPhone and is the most recent version. Open the program after installation, browse the project with the watermark and learn how to speed up video on iPhone with Splice. After selecting the watermark with a tap, click **"Edit"** from the menu in the screen's top right-hand corner. You'll now see a new tab labeled **"Effects"** immediately below the **"Audio"** tab; tap on it, and scroll down until you find the "Watermark" slider. To remove the watermark, slide it the entire way to the left. Your project is now free of the watermark.

## Bottom Line

Most people need help to produce high-quality videos on their devices. Most often, they'll need to transfer them to their computers for extensive editing and polishing. That's no longer the case, particularly with the emergence of mobile editing programs like the Splice app. You can quickly and effortlessly produce high-quality video material with a few clicks.
