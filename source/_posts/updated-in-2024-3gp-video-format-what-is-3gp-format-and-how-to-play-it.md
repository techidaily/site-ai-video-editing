## Part 1\. Types of Video Effects on Adobe Premiere Pro

A video editing program called Adobe Premiere Pro can be used to create everything from TV programs and movies to advertisements and family videos. These effects include Transitions, VFX, Audio, Videos as well as Advanced level effects like Green Screen. In addition, to know how to add shake effect in premiere pro, we’ve explained in the upcoming steps.

For editors who don't want to utilize the other motion graphic packages, Premiere provides a ton of built-in effects. Here are a few effects that you may not be aware are available to you. Any filmmaker or content producer must understand how to apply effects since they are necessary for a top-notch video. We've compiled easy steps on applying effects in Premiere Pro to be of assistance.

## Part 2\. How to Add Effects in Premier Pro

### Add Transition Effects

There are several transition effects in Adobe Premiere Pro, and there are countless ways to customize them to fit your film. It is quite easy to locate transitions and add them. The Effects panel, which is accessible from the very top options bar, contains all the transition options. A panel will show up on the right when you choose this. To include a transition, adhere to these procedures.

* Navigate to the Video Transitions area of the Effects panel.

![transition effects in pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/transition-effects-in-pr.jpg)

* Select the desired transition type from any of the available ones When you wish to employ a transition, press and hold it before dragging it to the start or finish of the clip. Alternately, insert it in between two clips to serve as a transition between the start and finish of each.

![drag and apply transitions pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/drag-and-apply-transitions-pr.jpg)

* In Premiere, there are several possible transitions, and some can be more suitable for your project than others.

### Add Visual Effects

The Essential Graphics panel was added by Adobe to Premiere Pro. Users now have a much different workflow than they had with the few prior title panels. Now that everything is in one panel, you can easily create, animate, and use VFX. Some of the VFX shots were just building miniature towns and adding pieces, while others involved the standard green screen removal and backdrop replacement.

* Simply importing and uploading your video and audio files into Premiere Pro is the first step. The procedure of clicking through is fairly simple. Choose "New Project." Press the Media Browser panel button and find the Ultra Key tool by opening the Effects panel.

![press meida browser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/press-meida-browser.jpg)

* The film clip with the green screen should have the Ultra Key added. Utilizing the matte creation and matte cleaning tools, remove the green screen using the ultra key effect. When softening, be cautious to eliminate any sharp edges. All of this can be adjusted under the Effects Control panel.

![ultra key effect pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/ultra-key-effect-pr.jpg)

* Put your backdrop material behind your green screen clip after you have a clear key. You should now be able to view your backdrop behind the keyed layer.

![view backdrop pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/view-backdrop-pr.jpg)

### Add Text Effects

There are many justifications for include text in your video. It has the ability to reach a bigger audience and is a fantastic example of cross-media integration. We must be able to write text since it is such a crucial component of video production. Learning how to add text in Adobe Premiere is quite simple; here's an example:

* Select the type tool from the tool window. To add text, click the backdrop and then type. The segment includes a music titled visuals.

![click the backdrop and type](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/click-the-backdrop-and-type.jpg)

* choosing the Type Tool (T) Drag a text box onto your movie using the Graphic Type Tool, then type in it. You may need to go to Windows > Tools and click and hold on Type Tool if it isn't already selected.

![choose type tool pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/choose-type-tool-pr.jpg)

* Head over to the Effect controls panel. under the Text Tab. The text's font and color can be changed. Decide on a place. Use the Effect Controls panel if you want to add some simple motion to your text. Motion may be added here. You can make rolling credits at the conclusion of your movie or add a rotating effect to your titles using the Properties window as shown below.

![effects control panel pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/effects-control-panel-pr.jpg)

* To Fine-Tune the Text Effects, go to Window > Effect Controls You can see all of the effects I changed in the Essential Graphics panel using this panel. A graphic layer will instantly reflect and be highlighted in the Effect Controls panel when clicked on in the Essential Graphics panel, and vice versa.

### Add Audio Effects

It's simple to work with audio with Premiere Pro. By selecting Clip > Audio Options > Audio Gain (or by hitting "G" on your keyboard), you may fast change audio levels. By adding keyframes to the audio clips in your sequence, you can also get greater audio control.

* First, equalize the audio. You have thus eliminated your stutters and the buzz from the audio track of your speaker. You may use the Parametric Equalizer effect under Effects > Audio Effects to give your voices a last boost of clarity and flow.

![audio effects panel pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/audio-effects-panel-pr.jpg)

* Click on your clip and choose Effect Controls > Custom Setup > Edit to make more customizations.

![new sequence standard](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/new-sequence-standard.jpg)

* Make use of the vocal enhancer. In the dropdown menu of your parametric equalizer, choose vocal enhancement. Next, adjust your frequencies upward and downward until everything sounds good.

![vocal enhancer pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/vocal-enhancer-pr.jpg)

* In Adobe Premiere Pro, a crossfade is used as the audio transition by default. Use them to join audio files together, provide a smooth transition from opening to closing credits, or add and remove sounds as required. Select Audio Transitions > Crossfade from the Effects menu.

![crossfade audio transitions pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/crossfade-audio-transitions-pr.jpg)

* For fine-tuning your audio, go to Preferences > Timeline > Audio Transition Default to finish. To polish your audio, use duration.

They eliminate the need for constant manual adjustment by enabling the user to rapidly and simply apply effects, transitions, and other intricate settings. You may utilize effect presets to give your video clips effects. This is a fantastic way to give your project some flare and originality!
