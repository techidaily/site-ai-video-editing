## Twitch Green Screen Guide

Green screens are a fun way for creators to bring their personality to their stream, allowing them to dynamically alter their stream background and make their content appear even more engaging and polished. With Twitch green screen background, you can easily configure Chroma key settings and detect your green screen with a single click.

The twitch green screen attaches directly to the back of your chair. You don't have to worry about stands, or spacing behind your chair. Just attach it and go. This portable green screen can fit on the back of your chair a feature that makes it easy to assemble and use for start-up twitchers.

## How to set up a Green Screen with Twitch Studio

****Set Up Your Camera**

First things first, make sure that your camera is being detected on Twitch Studio. If you do not already have a layer with your webcam on your scene, click Edit Scene and add a webcam layer by clicking the + icon on the left next to Layers.

Once your webcam layer has been created, make sure that the desired device is selected, plugged in, and that you have not turned off every webcam (Camera icon on the bottom left of Twitch Studio).

****Set Up Your Green Screen**

Once your green screen is set up in your background, select your webcam layers to display your webcam settings.

We recommend using the Auto-Detect Color feature as it will automatically detect the best color code for you and will be a great base to work from. If you prefer, you can manually pick the color code by either providing the color code in the Color to Remove field or clicking on the colored square to display a color spectrum that you can select from.

The Chroma Key section is located at the bottom of the webcam settings, and you will be able to toggle the chroma key on and off by clicking the eye icon.

To adjust the chroma key settings, you can click on Edit Chroma Key. You will be able to change the color code and change similarity, edge transparency and color correction for the perfect fit.

## Conclusion

You probably already have an idea of how to use a green screen, at least in principle. You film something or someone in front of a colored background — the green screen — then you replace everything that’s in the color of the screen with other footage, images, charts, presentations, or whatever visuals you want. However, Chroma keying a live stream works almost the same way. The main difference is that you have to replace the green screen as you’re filming, rather than during editing.

![slow mo feature](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-convert-slow-motion-video-to-normal-1.jpg)

But do you ever feel like converting the slow-motion video in your iOS device to a normal video? Perhaps you thought the slow-mo video would be more attractive, but it's not, or maybe you want to determine how to remove slow-motion from a video iPhone.

No matter the reason, there are numerous ways to remove slow motion from iPhone video. In this article, you'll learn the various methods to convert slow-motion video into a regular video on your iPhone or iPad. Also, learn the steps involved in achieving it.

So, let's start.

## How To Convert Slow Motion Video to Normal on iPhone and iPad

Due to the slow-motion and Time-lapse modes that are built into the iPhone, people may quickly record slo-mo and time-lapse clips using their iOS smartphone cameras.

Access the iPhone camera, select Slo-mo, press the Record icon once to begin filming, and then press it once more to stop. This will create a slo-mo video.

Do you ever wish to get your video's slow motion removed? How to convert slow-motion video to normal on an iPhone? Well, here's your answer.

### Method 1\. Using the Photos App

The Photos app is an in-built app for iPhone and iPad that features editing capabilities like rotation, resizing, and auto-enhancement, in addition to helping you manage videos and images.

![using the photos app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-convert-slow-motion-video-to-normal-2.jpg)

You may quickly and effortlessly turn a slow-mo video into a regular-speed one with the Photos app's tucked-away slow-motion converter feature. Additionally, there won't be any quality loss in your video.

And here are the steps on how to remove slow-mo from iPhone video using the Photos app on an iPad or iPhone to turn it to normal speed.

Step1: Take your iPad or iPhone, navigate to the Photos app, open it, and then go to the bottom to hit the Albums tab.

![select the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-convert-slow-motion-video-to-normal-3.jpg)

#### Editing Tip

* The Photos app on iPhone doesn't allow you to convert any video shot at 24fps or 30fps to slow motion.
* You cannot reduce or decrease the overall size of the video after conversion.

#### Pros & Cons

 Pros

* It is a built-in app on every iOS device.
* Saves the hassle of downloading any third-party app.

## Part 1: Backup Your Original Video

Making several backups is perhaps the most critical thing you can do for your project. Whether your computer dies suddenly or your editing application crashes, you'll have a point to fall back on if you have a backup. Making this a habit will save you a lot of time and work in the long term. How many copies of your data should you make? You should create at least three project duplicates in the best-case scenario. Also, make sure they're preserved in various formats and places—one on an SD card, another on a hard drive, or a USB drive.

## Part 1: Backup Your Original Video

Making several backups is perhaps the most critical thing you can do for your project. Whether your computer dies suddenly or your editing application crashes, you'll have a point to fall back on if you have a backup. Making this a habit will save you a lot of time and work in the long term. How many copies of your data should you make? You should create at least three project duplicates in the best-case scenario. Also, make sure they're preserved in various formats and places—one on an SD card, another on a hard drive, or a USB drive.
