## How To Add Subtitle Files In VLC Media Player?

You can download subtitles for the language you want from a subtitle site and enjoy them while watching the movie or video clip in VLC Media Player. However, this method won't add the SRT file permanently to your videos.

Here's how you can add subtitles in the VLC media player on your video clip:

Step1 Visit the [subtitles website](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/download-movie-subtitles-for-free/) of your choice and download the file for the video you are watching.

Step2 Save the SRT file along with your video in the same folder.

Step3 Right-click the video, click **"Open With,"** and choose VLC media player. Alternatively, launch the player, click **"Media,"** and select **"Open file..."** to import the video.

Step4 VLC Media Player will automatically detect and add the subtitles file. If not, click the **"Subtitles"** option in the toolbar, select **"Sub Track,"** and choose the relevant file within the listing.

Step5 The VLC player will now display the subtitles along with your video. However, if it is still unable to find the subtitles file, click **"Subtitles" > "Add Subtitles"** and manually add the file you've downloaded.

## How To Create Subtitles In VLC Media Player?

It is possible to create subtitles in the VLC media player if you're unable to find an appropriate SRT file online or want to add some extra details by editing the existing one. For this method to work, you will first need to format your file in the SRT format.

Furthermore, you have to rank the text in order with a number and add timestamps in minutes, seconds, and milliseconds to determine the duration. To avoid plain text, you can also add effects to the subtitles by using HTML.

Step1 Launch a [**text editor**](https://sonix.ai/)on your PC, import your video to the editor, and save it in .srt format.

## 01 **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**

The first of the video makers that we’re going to be introducing is called Filmora. This is a professional editor that’s equipped with just about everything you need for creating high-quality video content. That includes the things that you will need in order to create a **music photo collage**

For your reference, that means that you can use it to create a video showing off a picture collage with music. Usually by making use of the templates provided by the software and uploading your own images (although, in the newest version of Filmora, Filmora V11, there is a ‘Stock Media’ option that includes an endless supply of photographs, videos, music, etc. for adding to your content.)

## 02 Canva

Canva is really more of a photo editor than anything else. But it has a timeline function that you can use for more advanced things. Which, in this case, would be creating a **picture collage with music**

Note, just like with Filmora, Canva is not an entirely FREE program. But it is free to try. And, just like Filmora, it comes with a stock media library that you can use as a resource for your projects (i.e., images, clip arts, etc.) Canva also comes with a Pro version that you can unlock if you want some of its more advanced features (highly recommended if you’re looking to create content for work or entrepreneurial reasons and not just for posting on social media. Especially since it will allow you to collaborate with others.)

![Canva - Make Photo Collage with Music (FREE)](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/8-free-photo-collage-with-music-video-maker2.png)

## 03 Express It

You can say that "Express It" is Adobe’s version of Canva. It is available as an online tool and as a **photo collage with music** **app** that you can use for your smartphone or tablet.

Much like with Canva, this program has a built-in stock media library that you can use for your projects. It’s also primarily FREE to use, although you’ll need to pay in order to unlock some of its more advanced resources. It comes with the usual layouts for creating quick templates, but it’s most prized for its ‘free-style’ mode, which will allow you to create a collage that looks exactly how you want it to look.

![Express It — Make a Photo Collage with Music App](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/8-free-photo-collage-with-music-video-maker3.png)

## 04 Smilebox

Smilebox is an automatic video collage maker that is capable of turning photographs into a video collage without much input from you It’s the tool to use if all you’re looking for is a quick solution. By that, we of course mean the solution of the ‘upload-and-then-download’ variety

It is also an online tool, so Sign-Up is required. But once you’re signed up, the only thing you really have to do is provide the images that you want to use for your **music photo collage**

![Smilebox - Create Pic Collage with Music](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/8-free-photo-collage-with-music-video-maker4.png)

## 05 Fotojet

Next is ‘Fotojet’, which is an online collage maker that is incredibly popular for those that are looking for an easy solution. It works pretty much how you expect a collage maker to work. You choose from a list of ‘collage layouts’, choose the images that you want to place in the layout that you’ve chosen, pick out your music, maybe decorate the pic collage a bit (for example, you can add text, clipart stickers, etc.) and then you’re done

Much like some of the programs on this list, Fotojet isn’t an entirely free **music photo collage** tool. However, a FREE trial is available if you want to try it out for a quick project or two.

![Fotojet - Music Photo Collage Tool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/8-free-photo-collage-with-music-video-maker5.png)

## 06 Vimeo

Video is a professional online photo editing tool that’s incredibly popular with entrepreneurs. It actually works very similarly with all the other tools that we’ve introduced so far. That means that it comes with templates that you can use in order to create projects, it also comes with a ‘resources’ library that you can take advantage of in order to fill up said projects

As for creating a **photo collage with music** by using this tool. You will need to sign up to start creating, but it’s FREE to try — with some elements locked under the premium version.

![Vimeo — Create Picture Collage with Music](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/8-free-photo-collage-with-music-video-maker6.png)

## 07 Kapwing

KapWing is exactly what it looks like, it’s an online photo editor The best part about it is that it comes with quick collage layouts that you can use and the usual resources library. The layouts in question are customizable, allowing you to control what your **music photo collages** look like in the end. You also have the choice of creating said collage with photos, videos, GIFs, and music

![KapWing — Music Photo Collage Creator](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/8-free-photo-collage-with-music-video-maker7.png)
