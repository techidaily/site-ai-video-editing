## How Do You Find a High-Quality Video Marketing Company?

It is difficult to spot a high-quality agency because most promise a lot but deliver very little. With so many video marketing companies ready to scam you, the question boils down to how to find a high-quality agency that can provide the expected results. Here are some crucial steps to judge if a marketing video agency is worth your time and money.

##### Step 1 Be Clear About Your Objective

Before you start finding video content marketing companies, you should be clear about the goals you want to achieve through video marketing. For some brands, the goal could be increasing brand awareness and visibility by driving website traffic. For others, it could be generating leads and boosting sales. Once you are clear about your goals and expectations, you can start finding agencies that specialize in fulfilling your objectives.

##### Step 2 Assess Overall Quality

On your journey of finding video marketing companies, you will come across many agencies that will look very promising, apparently. But you cannot take their promises for granted. Instead, evaluate their capabilities by reviewing their portfolio consisting of their past projects. You can assess their quality by judging their creativity, work style, production value, and marketing techniques from their past works. Once you are convinced of their skills and capabilities, you can shortlist them.

![assess overall quality](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/03/image_2.jpg)

##### Step 3 Give Priority to Experience

Selecting a marketing video agency without past experience with companies in your industry will be a blunder. This is because their past experience will help them understand your objectives and targeted audiences better. They are likely to be aware of the things that work and do not work with the audiences in your industry. Besides, they will be capable of finding opportunities and identifying challenges faster during the marketing process. Therefore, agencies with experience in your industry should get priority on your list.

![give priority to experience](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/03/image_3.jpg)

##### Step 4 Check Customer Testimonials

Checking out the reviews of past clients and customers is an essential part of selection. Customer testimonials can reveal insights for you to judge the strengths and weaknesses of the agency. You can form an opinion on their professionalism, communication style, operational techniques, and customer satisfaction. You should check the reviews and feedback on their websites and ask for references from their past customers.

![check customer testimonials](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/03/image_4.jpg)

##### Step 5 Watch out for Creativity

Creativity differentiates between excellence and average in the video marketing world. Every company invests in video marketing, but only a few are successful in their efforts. The key to their success lies in their creative thinking and innovative approach. Creativity makes video content attention-grabbing, long-lasting, and highly sharable.

Similarly, innovative marketing techniques will give you a significant edge over your competitors. You can judge a video marketing agency's creativity if they pitch unique ideas, creative storytelling, and innovative marketing approaches. Watch out for the reviews to determine if the company has a proven record of creativity in their field.

![watch out for creativity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/03/image_5.jpg)

##### Step 6 Take Optimization Seriously

Creative video content is useless if it cannot reach the most targeted audiences. The reach in the digital world depends on optimization. That is why when you choose a **marketing video agency** near you, ensure they understand optimization principles. Proper search engine optimization helps a video rank higher in search results and get more organic audiences.

Optimization techniques vary for search engines, video streaming websites, and social media platforms. A video marketing agency should have expertise in optimization for organic reach and generating leads.

![take optimization seriously](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/03/image_6.jpeg)

##### Step 7 Dive Into the Process

You should choose a video agency that is more open about its operation and process of execution. They must explain the entire process, from concept development to final delivery. Similarly, they should be open to suggestions, flexible in approaches, and adaptable during challenges.

Understanding the execution process will help you determine instinctively if the agency is worth your investment. There should be clarity in the thought process and executive plan with deadline and budget for your peace of mind and satisfaction.

![dive into the process](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/03/image_7.jpeg)

##### Step 8 Focus on Communication

Communication is a highly underrated skill in the professional world, especially when outsourcing your work to an agency. Without proper communication, there cannot be a proper collaboration with the **video marketing company**. If you cannot share your feedback or get involved in the required process, your goals and objectives will stay unachieved.

Therefore, while discussing the execution plan, you should emphasize communication. For example, you can check how often you will get updates and how responsive and proactive the agency will be with suggestions and feedback. Communication enhances transparency in execution and boosts customer satisfaction.

##### Step 9 Request a Proposal

You must have shortlisted a few high-quality video marketing companies following the steps mentioned so far. It is time to request a proposal or quotation from the interested agencies. You should reiterate your goals, objectives, expectations, and requirements so the agencies can provide tailored proposals accordingly.

You can also clarify any doubts and assess their professionalism and communication well. The proposals can reveal the level of service you will get. The more detailed the proposal, the deeper you can evaluate the service and make the final selection accordingly.

![request a proposal](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/03/image_9.jpg)

##### Step 10 Evaluate Return on Investment

Last but not least, you should compare the prices to evaluate which proposals offer more value for your money. You should also calculate your return on investment so that your investment brings in the expected results without damaging you monetarily. You will also get to know the hidden charges and deliveries, and you should consider an agency that mentions them upfront for transparency. Finally, trust your assessment and instinct and select the best promotional video production company to take your business to the next level.

## Best Audio Plug-Ins For Video Editors

When it comes to improving the sound of the audio in your video editing projects, you have a variety of options to choose from when approaching the editing. Most plugins that we will cover today will be helpful for many different effects instead of only one particular one.

Let's get started!

## 1\. Synchro Arts Revoice Pro

Let's talk about Revoice Pro 4\. This is an awesome plugin for when you are finishing complex editing projects when you work with dialogues and need to synchronize other lines to fit the shot. Revoice Pro 4 combines timing and pitch alignment technology, together with as a pair of cutting-edge tuning tools and a natural-sounding vocal doubler for people working on the narrator voice.

![synchro arts revoice pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/synchro-arts-revoice-pro.jpg)

For the video editors working in audio post-production, the stand out new feature added to Revoice Pro is Smart Align combined with a fast workflow, meaning that you don't need to leave Pro Tools to synchronize ADR to the location audio. Although Version 4.3 presented an ARA version of the Revoice Pro link plug-in for Logic Pro users, so providing immediate transfers back and forth between Logic Pro or higher Synchro Arts haven't counted out Pro Tools users by preparing a new set of AudioSuite plugins.

The APT procedures, used to align the pitch and timing of multiple vocal tracks, now includes SmartAlign. When this is turned on, it can align audio with significant gaps in the guide or even dub the audio. This feature enables you to align much longer performances, which in the past had to be divided into smaller sections.

 As Revoice Pro has improved over the years, the latest version is giving you the ultimate workflow it should always have had in the past. Synchro Arts have been able to create the perfect workflow with an AudioSuite plugin, that runs Revoice Pro in the background without having to have to switch back between Revoice Pro and Pro Tools. Select your audio and the desiredRevoice Pro preset, process the audio in Revoice Pro and place it directly into the timeline without having to leave Pro Tools.

Smart Align and the Quick APT AudioSuite plugin made this fairly easy, yet powerful, workflow. Synchro Arts has also been able to fix the tasks of how to handle gaps. Before V4.3, you had to make sure there weren't any unexpected empty spots, or it was not able to work out what to do. Using Smart Align, it handles the gaps without any problems.

Whether you need to tighten any kind of pitch or timings on a vocal recording, Revoice Pro is the one for you. Revoice Pro is great for working with vocal recordings, but it's perfectly suitable for instruments like guitars and strings too.

Synchro Arts Revoice Pro is available for $599.

## 2\. Red Giant Magic Bullet Colorista

This is a very interesting plugin. Colorista tries to cancel out the need for a separate color-specific program by increasing more color correction options. This plugin allows you to have more color control with tools for tints, temperatures, vignetting, RGB curving, and so forth. Colorista contains a three-way color function and support for LOG clips and LUT filters. Colorista is not a stand-alone program. It's designed to integrate into existing software and offer better functionality. Plugins let you design something that wasn't there originally. You don't have to load a certain project to activate them.

![red giant magic bullet colorista](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/red-giant-magic-bullet-colorista.jpg)

For years, Red Giant has been one of the biggest developers of plugins designed for video editing software. Among the other ones is the Magic bullet suite, which contains quite some plugins to solve video noise problems and do some color grading. We believe the versatility of Red Giant allow content creators and movie producers to let their ideas come to life, create dynamic art and create better content overall.

Even though Red Giant's Magic Bullet Suite is a plugin suite created for Adobe After Effects and Premiere Pro, it also works with other video editing software such as VEGAS Pro. The suite focuses on color correction and color grading improvements. VEGAS Pro is my software of choice, but one aspect of Premiere that I've always thought inadequate were the color correction tools. Looks is completely customizable, and a "preset" can be built up from zero. The Colorista suite comes with a lot of other plugins that have crucial roles in the color grading aspect of video editing. Denoiser II is ideal for clearing up scratchy footage.

Red Giant Magic Bullet Colorista is available for $199.

## 3\. Boris FX Continuum 2022

The thriving film industry's filmmakers choose Boris FX Continuum. This package contains super strong, timesaving plugins for a smoother workflow with seventeen effects and quick fix plug-in options. Continuum Includes over 200 effects and more than 3500 presets. Each pair will be suitable for each project. Continuum 2022 is the latest biggest release of the post-production plugin collection.

## To Get Cinematographs of a Music Video, You Need to Understand the Basics of Camera Movement. As Well Framing and Lighting of the Setup Are Illustrated in This Article

To visually represent the story in the music video, cinematography shots are helpful. It'll obviously and pleasing and eye-catchy effect in your video. These major requirements for making that cinematography can be covered as the following:

1. Light a subject
2. Create atmosphere
3. Light a set
4. Camera techniques
5. Aspect ratio
6. Framing
7. Camera movement

Before, we go deeper to the details on how to make a cinematography for music, let us know first about the cinematography for music video. Everything is represented in this article, from the camera movement to the setting of the lights in the studio. You will also learn about aspect ratio and framing while making shots from the DSLR.

## What Is Cinematography?

Cinematography covers all aspects of how a movie or music video is made, including choosing the lighting for the scene. The type of camera equipment to use, how to frame your photographs, and how to decide on camera movement are also included in this. Let's move toward the next lines to get the cool cinematography on display.

## Light a subject

Although you may assume that cinematography is just concerned with the usage of the camera, lighting plays an equally important role. While planning your photographs, you should think about how the scene is lit and how your subject is illuminated.

![lighting a subject](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/lighting-a-subject.jpg)

The cinematographer should consider the hard and soft lights for perfect illustrations during shooting. These are depicted with the following requirements!

### Hard light and soft light

The cinematographers mainly focus on the hard and soft lights during filmmaking. The **hard lights** give a softer look to the subject. They are pointing to the light sources which are closer to the subject in the video. It makes the photographs and shots harsher and more dramatic.

![hard light on the subject](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/hard-light-on-the-subject.jpg)

The **soft light** is trying to wrap around the subject. It gives diffused shadows and soft edges to the character of the music video.

![soft light on the subject](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/soft-light-on-the-subject.jpg)

![note](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** To get better results of the soft look, you need to add diffusion to lower the intensity.

## Create Atmosphere

You need a haze machine to create the atmosphere and give the environment true vibes. The haze machine gives a foggy appearance in every shoot and scene.

![haze machine](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/haze-machine.jpg)

**Filmora Video Editor** Easily create video with plenty of video effects and filters.

## Light a Set

To give proper lights in the set is illustrated with the help of an example as shown below!

### Examples

In this music video of the 3lau's, the main prop used is a bus, which is presented in the middle of the set and lit very well. The bus is rounded by many tungsten lights, which give a resemblance to those street lights. They are set up automatically in such a way that this stimulates the real movement of the bus on the road.

![lighting a set](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/lighting-a-set.gif)

The three projectors are set to give the street footage at the back scene to add more realism.

The three lights are set in the queue by the production team to get the memory of the protagonist. In the setup, soft lights are also added on top of all the upper windows of the bus to give blue interior light to the bus.

## Camera Techniques

The cameras used during filming play a major role in giving the cinematographic shots. All the techniques shown below are applied to the DSLRs and even the smartphones you use for filming.

### Prime lenses

The foremost and most helpful lenses in filming are called prime lenses, which have fixed focal lengths. There is no Johns to zoom out and zoom-in in prime lenses.

For filming, we need to choose the right level of zoom, which the DP does by picking the right lens for the footage.

![prime lens of the camera](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/prime-lens-of-the-camera.jpg)

In the close-up scenes, there is a requirement for a wider field of view which also depends on the aspect ratio of shooting.

## Aspect Ratio

In filmy view, the most appropriate aspect ratio is 2.35, which is also a cinematic ratio. There is also another ratio of 16:9, which is a wider ratio. While 2.35 gives a more narrow perspective as compared to the prior one.

![note](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** The narrow ratio is helpful in showing the relationships between the subjects.

![aspect ratio of the filming](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/aspect-ratio-of-the-filming.jpg)

Whenever we use a microscope, we are dealing with the aspect ratio and narrowing down to the required point where we want to look, and this is all about framing, which is discussed as shown below!

## Framing

Framing is a way used to illustrate the concepts such as the rule of thirds and leading lines. To give customized headroom to the subject, the framing is used from the top of the head and the top of the frame.

## Camera Movement

The camera movement actually shows the real story presented in the music video. The camera movements used for filming are mainly the pedestal, truck, pan, tilt, and roll.

![camera movements](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/camera-movements.jpg)

Whenever the protagonist looks out the bus's window, the camera operator will use the "Dolly" and "Trucking" movements.

### Trucking Movement

The trucking movement of the camera is done in left-to-right motion in the filming. This is used for emotional purposes and whenever the subject is in a pull-out shot.

### Dolly Movement

The dolly movement of the camera is done by moving towards or away from the subject. This often gives a sense of importance to the character.

## Final Words

The above article gives the exact preferences of the "Tokyo" song by which you learned a lot of techniques for your future use. By following the above rules and tips, you'll obviously come up with a viral music video.
