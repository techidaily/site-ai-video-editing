### How To Hide Your Telegram Profile Pictures

##### iPhone

Step1 On your iPhone, launch the **Telegram app** and go to the **"Settings"** tab at the bottom right of the screen.

Step2 Select **"Privacy and Security"** and tap the **"Profile Photo"** option.

Step3 If you want to keep your profile picture private, choose the **"My Contacts"** option. This way, only people in your contact book will be able to see it.

Step5 Telegram offers two great options for managing who can see your profile picture: **"Always Allow"** and **"Never Allow."**

Simply tap the **"Always Allow"** option and search for contacts using their usernames to add them to your list. Tap the **"Check"** icon to apply your changes.
