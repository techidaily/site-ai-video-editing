## Are You Aware that AV1 Has the Potential to Change the Way We Watch Videos Online? Read on to Learn More About AV1 and How It Could Impact Your Life

Have you heard about the **AV1 format video**? This format is a new compression standard that promises to improve video quality while reducing file size. If you frequently stream video, the **AV1 files** could make an impact on your life, and we are just beginning to see its potential. Let's take a further look at what AV1 is and what you need to know about this new video codec.

![av1 logo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-format-video-1.jpg)

## Part 1: Where does it come from?

AV1 (AOMedia Video 1) is a new video compression format that is being developed by the Alliance for Open Media (AOMedia). AOMedia is a consortium of major tech companies including Google, Microsoft, Netflix, and Amazon. The AV1 codec is an improvement on VP9 in several ways, most notably in its ability to compress video more efficiently.

Although the AV1 codec is still in the early stages of development, it is already being adopted by some major tech companies. Netflix has announced that it will start using AV1 for its streaming service, and Google has said that AV1 will be the default codec for YouTube.

### How can streaming platforms and users benefit from a new codec?

![watching netflix on tv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-format-video-2.jpg)

**The importance of codecs**

A codec is a device that encodes and decodes digital audio signals. Without a codec, your audio would sound garbled and distorted. There are two metrics to take into account to judge the performance of video codecs: quality and bitrate.

### The benefits of the new codec

Two of the most popular video formats, provide high-quality video at a relatively low bit rate.

The new AV1 codec offers several benefits for streaming platforms and their users. Take a look at a few of them:

1. **Lower bitrate**
1. **Reduced costs for encoding**

For streaming platforms, AV1 could lead to reducing costs for encoding as well as increasing quality and compatibility. For users, AV1 could improve streaming quality, especially on mobile devices.

1. **Smaller size with better quality**

**AV1 files** will take up less space on your hard drive or be smaller in file size when streamed online. Since AV1 can compress video files to a much smaller size without sacrificing quality, users will be able to save data when streaming video on their devices!

1. **More efficient**

AV1 will use less processing power to decode a video compared to other video codecs. As a result, the streaming platforms can save on bandwidth costs, which can be passed on to users in the form of lower subscription prices eventually.

1. **Royalty-free**

The ultimate goal of AOMedia is to develop an open and royalty-free video codec that can be used by anyone. So, you will have better video quality, lower bandwidth costs, and faster loading times.

AV1 is just one of the many new technologies that are revolutionizing online media delivery. With its superior quality and efficiency, AV1 is poised to become the standard codec for online video in the years to come where everyone can access more affordable and high-quality videos.

## Part 2: What are the Trends of Codec War AV1?

As we have already discussed, AV1 is a newer codec that promises better compression. This video format has already been widely used and gaining traction in the streaming industry. It is being used more for live broadcasts and other time-sensitive applications.

#### Who will prevail?

![video editing program on a computer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-format-video-3.jpg)

Since both codecs have their pros and cons, it's unclear which one will ultimately prevail. However, as the world moves towards more open standards for video codecs, there is growing concern that AV1 codec will be used to monopolize the market. While AV1 is free to use, it is encumbered by patents held by members of the Alliance for Open Media (AOMedia), which includes companies like Google, Microsoft, and Apple.

### How would AV1 monopolize the market?

![a pile of us dollars](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-format-video-4.jpg)

The EU Commissions' questionnaire, as reported by [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-eu-antitrust-regulators-probing-tech-group-aoms-video-licensing-policy-2022-07-07/), unveiled that the alliance and its members had been requiring companies to cross-license their patents for no charge to receive the AV1 format. These companies had no affiliation with AOM when AV1 was originally devised. This was a non-negotiable requisite for companies who owned patents that were necessary to contribute to the AV1 standard's technical specifications.

As a result, this action is concerned to hinder innovation and thus prevents the new entities feasible to flourish. Therefore, there is a growing movement to antitrust AV1 which has been investigated by the European Commission.

### What happened after the AV1 Antitrust Investigation

![google logo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-format-video-5.jpg)

The European Commission is looking into whether this licensing scheme violates antitrust law and whether the companies involved are colluding to keep AV1 closed off to competitors. The investigation is in its early stages, and no formal charges have been filed against Google at this time.

However, if the Commission finds that Google has indeed abused its market position, it could order Google to make changes to AV1 or face steep fines. Although the fines have yet to be determined, each company involved could ultimately pay up to 10% of their global turnover.

Nonetheless, this issue has shed light on the competitive landscape of the codec market. Well, although the outcome of the antitrust investigation is still uncertain, it is clear that it has the potential to shake up the codec market.

## Part 3: What Should You Expect in the Future?

### H.266 codec

![h.266 vvc logo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/av1-format-video-6.jpg)

H.266 is the next-generation video codec that is being developed to improve upon the current standard and the latest advances in video technology. We can expect H.266 to continue to evolve and be improved upon as time goes on. Some of their transcendence that you can look forward to:

* **Improve compression efficiency**

H.266/VVC is designed to improve compression efficiency by 20-50% over previous versions. You can have a video of the same file size and bit rate but make it look significantly better.

* **Inter-Layer Prediction (ILP) usage**

The H.266 codec uses a new type of inter-frame prediction called Inter-Layer Prediction (ILP). ILP allows the codec to exploit the correlations between different layers of a video signal. Therefore, it gives better results on image quality and file size when you encode a video with the H.266 codec.

* **Higher-quality video**

We can expect higher-quality video content to become more widespread. This new codec will also enable new types of content, such as virtual reality and 360-degree video, to be streamed and enjoyed by a wider audience.

### AV2 codec

The AV2 codec is an improvement on the current AV1\. The AV2 codec is said to be more efficient and have better quality than the AV1 codec. It is still in development and is not yet available for use.

Since this codec is expected to provide better quality video at lower bit rates than other codecs, it would be ideal for use in video applications such as streaming and video conferencing. So, what can we expect from the AV2 codec in the future? Here are a few things to look out for:

* Improved quality at lower bitrates
* Wider adoption in streaming and conferencing applications
* Continued development and improvement

## FAQs: To cater to people also ask

### 1\. How do I open an AV1 file?

AV1 is a relatively new file format. If you have an AV1 file that you need to open, you can use one of the following methods:

* Use a media player that supports AV1, such as VLC Media Player or MPV
* Use conversion software to convert the AV1 file into a more widely-supported file format

### 2\. Can MP4 contain AV1?

Yes. While AV1 is a relatively new codec, it is already supported by many popular media players and devices. MP4 is a container format, which means it can hold multiple types of data. The data can be encoded using any codec, including AV1\. Therefore, you can encode your content in AV1 and store it in an MP4 container for playback on the devices.

Here, we will guide you on creating freeze frame sequences in your videos using Filmora. It is critical here to know what exactly the freeze frame sequence is. So let's jump right into it!

## Part 1\. What Is A Freeze Frame?

A freeze frame is a specific single frame of the video clip shown repeatedly in the video. It gives the illusion of a static picture. It is used to draw the viewers' attention to the minute details of a specific moment, to set up a powerful narrative, or to introduce your main characters.

![freeze frame effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-1.jpg)

Content creators can also use the freeze-frame effect on fast-moving objects to draw the viewers' attention. Have a few examples of the most popular freeze frames used in the movies.

### Examples of freeze frames in popular movies

Alfred Hitchcock used the first-ever freeze-frame in his film Champagne (1928). There is a long list of many famous tv shows and movies in which the freeze frame effect has been used since then. But to count a few, three examples are given here.

**1\. Pulp Fiction (1994)**

In the beginning scene of Pulp Fiction, where robbery is about to occur, a freeze-frame effect is used to engage the audience. Later in the movie, it was relieved what would happen next. It was a dramatic pause to draw attention. It is a strong example of the freeze-frame effect.

![pulp fiction's freeze frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-2.png)

**2\. The Breakfast Club (1985)**

The ending of Breakfast Club is an iconic example of the freeze-frame effect. With a powerful narration, the freeze frame conveys the movie's central idea to the audience.

![the breakfast club's freeze frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-3.png)

**3\. Suicide Squad (2016)**

In the trailer of Suicide Squad, freeze frames were used by the director to introduce the characters. This trailer used stylish animations to give relevant information about the film's main characters.

![suicide squad's freeze frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-4.png)

Having discussed the famous examples, let's learn about the power of freeze frames.

### The power of freeze frame

The old freeze frames give a retro vibe. However, with the advancement in editing technology, this special effect has proved that there is no end. Furthermore, it has shown that you can do many things with pauses.

Especially when you are a content creator, this effect empowers you by advertising your skills impressively. It also conveys your message convincingly.

Being a content creator, you always want to reach the maximum audience. This special effect will serve this too. It will ultimately get you more viewership, more likes, and more subscriptions. But how to create a freeze frame?

## Decode Video from HDR to SDR with a Video Converter

If you have ever worked with converting videos, then you are probably familiar with Handbrake. Handbrake is a household name for video converting, especially when it comes to 4KHDR to SDR video conversions. It has a free open source feature that allows you to convert to SDR videos with an MP4 or MKV format.

**Steps of Decoding HDR Video to SDR with Handbrake**

Before converting your HDR video to SDR, make sure you have downloaded Handbrake on your computer.

* **Open** the Handbrake app.
* To import your video to Handbrake, click on **File,** then **Source Selection.** You can also drag and drop the video to scan it. Next, wait for Handbrake to scan the title. Once the video scan is complete, all the information will be displayed in the source section.

![import a file into handbrake](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/convert-hdr-to-sdr-videos-3.jpg)

* Once the file is imported, you can now select the output format from the right panel under **General**. The default format already specified in Handbrake is Fast 1080p30; you can change that if you are looking for a different form.

![analysis of the upload hdr video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/convert-hdr-to-sdr-videos-5.jpg)

* You can also change the format depending on the device type in Handbrake.
* Lastly, go to **Presets**, click **Production**, and select **Production Standard** to convert 4K HDR video to 4K SDR. You can also do that by going to General Profile under the Legacy column.

![change the format from hdr to standard](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/convert-hdr-to-sdr-videos-9.jpg)

![start encoding the video into sdr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/convert-hdr-to-sdr-videos-4.jpg)

With a few simple clicks, your HDR file can easily be converted to SDR using Handbrake.

## Transcode Video from HDR to SDR by Image Editing \[Samsung only\]

If you own the latest Samsung S22 phone, you are probably aware of its feature that allows you to record in an HDR10 view. But, what do you do if you want to send the video to someone whose phone is incompatible with HDR? The video will appear too bright and washed out.

By converting the video to SDR, you can send them the video without burning their retinas. This method to convert HDR videos to SDR is especially for Samsung Galaxy phones. The gallery app initially used to have a built-in option to do that, but it's not there anymore. While the original option is removed, you can still use the method below to convert an HDR video to SDR with just a few taps.

* To convert HDR10+ video to SDR on a Samsung Galaxy phone, you can directly proceed with it on your phone.
* Head to and open Gallery, choose your HDR10+ video and tap three dots in the bottom right corner.
* From the pop-up menu, select **Open in Video Player.**
* Once the video opens in the video player, click on another three dots in the top right corner.
* From there, tap on the **Editor**
* In the editor, tap again on three dots on the bottom right and now select Size and Format.
* From this menu, you can change the resolution of the video as well as its format. From the format drop-down, you can select SDR to convert your video to SDR.
* Make sure you do not tap on **Save;** instead, click on the three dots again and tap on Save as Copy. This will leave your original HDR video untouched and save a copy for the SDR video.

## Convert HDR 4K Video to SDR with YouTube \[Untested\]

HDR videos on Youtube show higher color dynamics and contrast ratios than an SDR video. Viewers with HDR-compatible devices will see ‘HDR’ after every video quality option in the video settings (1080p HDR).

However, the videos uploaded as HDR on youtube can be viewed on HDR unsupported devices too. This happens because youtube automatically converts all HDR videos to SDR to be viewed on non-HDR devices. Here is a brief introduction to the steps of converting HDR to SDR on Youtube:

* Record the metadata by exporting it from an HDR-supported application like [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). The metadata should be in a codec or container to be played by Youtube correctly.
* Grade your HDR properly as Rec. 2020 with PQ or HLG. Ensure the videos are graded correctly using an HDR transfer function to retain the quality. If you are unsure about the videos graded as HDR, you should not use this method because it can distort the video.
* rectly using an HDR transfer function to retain the quality. If you are not sure about the videos graded as HDR, you should not use this method because it can distort the video.

![color grading with wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/convert-hdr-to-sdr-videos-7.jpg)

* Once done, upload it on Youtube. If it detects HDR metadata during the upload, Youtube automatically produces an SDR conversion for non-HDR compatible devices.

![uploading the hdr video on youtube](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/convert-hdr-to-sdr-videos-8.jpg)

* Downloading the video from HDR unsupported devices will save an SDR video.

This method seems easy but has greater risks involved such as distortion of video if improper HDR grading is done.

## Get Real-time Video HDR to SDR Conversion by Video Content Providers

With gaming becoming almost a sport, online streaming has grown immensely popular. These streaming services allow you to stream in 4K HDR format. However, a significant downside of this is that many devices are still incompatible with HDR video.

We have listed multiple methods to convert your HDR video clips to SDR, but what about a live stream? We highly recommend checking out the Intel official blog post for converting your HDR videos to SDR in real-time. The blog post describes how you can convert your live stream to SDR with different methods. You can give it a read if you are interested in that.

## Hot FAQs on How to Convert HDR to SDR

### 1\. Is SDR better than HDR?

SDR is Standard Dynamic Range, while HDR stands for High Dynamic Range. HDR is the latest technology concerning quality, clear and detailed images. HDR is perfect for videos that require high contrast, shadows, and mixed light.

HDR is definitely better than SDR because the “High” definition takes everything to the next level. However, SDR is frequently used as most devices are not compatible with HDR.

### 2\. Why is HDR smaller than SDR?

Undoubtedly, HDR provides better image quality, colors, and clarity than SDR, but why is the file size smaller then? The answer is quite simple. HDR10 files are equipped with HVAC. HVAC is a very efficient file compressor that compresses the file while keeping its quality intact. SDR files are not compressed with SDR; hence the file size is much bigger.

### 3\. Why does HDR look washed out?

An HDR video might look too bright or washed out if your device is incompatible with HDR color space. Unlike the iPhone 12 or Samsung Galaxy S22, phones have a built-in HDR recording feature. However, older versions may not be able to enjoy the clarity and colors offered by an HDR recording. Hence when an HDR video is sent to someone with an older phone, it looks as if the video is washed out.

## Final Words

While HDR might be a superior color space, SDR is frequently used for video clips so maximum people can enjoy the video despite what their devices are compatible with. You can easily convert an HDR video to SDR using [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or any other methods listed above.

An important point to note is that HDR videos converted to SDR might look a little off sometimes with darker shadows and sharpness. It might be a better idea to record in SDR rather than convert it to SDR later. However, converting is still a popular way to go with an HDR video; you will also have a beautiful high-quality video and an SDR copy.
