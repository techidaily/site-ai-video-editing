## Level Up Videos By Applying Keyframe Like A Pro

Everyone is fascinated by a video portraying creativity and effort in each frame. Your films can easily have this captivity through the keyframe feature. It provides you the accessibility to make even a simple, plain shot pace up, slow down, or pan across the screen.

Wondershare Filmora offers you a simple yet great experience of Keyframing. It has been the editors' favorite feature for years. Under its Grow and Win Program, Filmora presents the Keyframe creativity contest. It is the ultimate solution for bringing captivity and precision to your shots.

## Part 1\. What is the Keyframe Feature?

A keyframe, also spelled "key frame," defines any smooth transition's beginning and conclusion. In the case of animation or film, or video, that something may be a drawing or a specific frame of a shot.

The keyframe feature creates room for boundless creativity. The Keyframe feature could imitate any illusive or fascinating impact, from object enlargement to magical power effects. A key frame is a frame that serves as a marker for the start or stop of a parameter change.

You could use a keyframe to mark the spot where the audio will have faded up or down to a specific volume.

## Part 2\. Where to Use The Keyframe Feature?

Editors and creators use keyframing for all kinds of stuff. These uses include:

### Animated Logo Intros

You can use the keyframe feature to create indigenous intros with animated logos. It helps the editors go for vlogging or tutorial videos.

![animated logo intro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-keyframe-video-1.gif)

### Special Transparency Effects

Keyframing is famous for creating blended visuals through experimentation with the transparency of the clip.

![varying transparency clips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-keyframe-video-2.gif)

### Custom Picture-in-Picture Paths

We use the picture-in-picture effect in many editing formats, from tutorial videos to gaming streams and vlogs. Keyframing allows editors to execute the movement of the PIP as they wish. For instance, this video call was shot from a video.

![picture-in-picture effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-keyframe-video-3.png)

The picture will move across the screen between the 30-second and 1-minute marks if you indicate that it will be in the upper left corner of the screen at the 30-second timestamp of your video and the bottom right corner at the 1-minute timestamp.

## Part 3\. What Would You Need to Make a Keyframe Video

Let us share the procedure for making a video using the keyframe feature.

### 1\. A Video Clip or Photos

For experimenting and creating with the keyframe feature, first, you would need high-quality video clips or images.

The high-resolution requirement is a prerequisite for the complete experience of all parameters of the keyframe feature. For example, the zooming and varying opacity effects you add might look bland and dull if the clip or image appears pixelated upon zooming and scaling.

### 2\. Motion Elements

Keyframing allows for a vast area of creativity with motion elements that you can download online. The keyframe feature adds charm to these elements by playing with their orientation and scale.

## **Alternative Way to Edit FlV Video on Windows**

### **1\.** **VSDC**

VSDC is a free video editor along with a lot of advanced features. Cut, combine, trim, crop, and other editing capabilities are available to help you polish your FLV films.

Although it may not look logical, learning the editing capabilities hidden within modular boxes is simple. One noteworthy aspect of VSDC is its ability to produce good visual effects using many trendy video effects, transitions, and filters.

It not only creates excellent FLV videos, but it also supports a wide range of media conversion, allowing you to convert FLV files to various formats and export them without a watermark.

Therefore, follow the below mentioned steps to edit FLV video using VSDC:

Step 1: Install the software on the Windows. Open the application and import the video.

![edit flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-5.jpg)

Step 2: Use cutting and splitting tools to edit the video.

The first icon is a picture of a pair of scissors, which is a cutting tool. It's very useful when you need to cut the beginning or end of a film. Place the cursor exactly where you want to cut, then select "Trim start" or "Trim finish" from the dropdown cutting menu (the small triangle next to the scissors icon).

 ![edit flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-6.jpg)

Cropping is also simple. If you have too much additional space around the scene object recorded, just choose the file you want to trim and select the cropping icon from the "Cutting and Splitting" option. A new window will appear, allowing you to select the region of the scene that should stay.

![edit flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-7.jpg)

Step 3: Apply effects and transitions.

To use one, first select the video file you wish to edit, then go to the Video effects tab and select the effect you want to use. On the timeline, a new tab will appear, containing all of the effects done to the selected object. You can alter the effect's duration and position in time by dragging it with the mouse there. The properties pane on the right-hand side can be used to change other parameters.

Transitions follow the same rule. Place your cursor where you want the transition to begin, then choose a transition from the Video effects dropdown menu and manually adjust the duration.

![edit flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-8.jpg)

Step 4: Save changes and export video.

Make sure your movie appears exactly how you want it to before exporting it. If the video appears choppy, use the red preview button and lower the preview quality. When the PC's resources are insufficient to process the video in real time, lagging can occur. Keep in mind that it has no bearing on the outcome. When you're finished, navigate to the Export project tab and select an export format.

![edit flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-9.jpg)

### **2\.** **Adobe Premiere Pro:**

Professional video editors use Premiere Pro to make everything from YouTube videos to Hollywood films like Mank, a 2021 Oscar candidate. It's also widely utilized in the workflows of designers, animators, and VFX artists, and we can see why after lengthy testing.

We found the software's UI to be simple to use, and it increased our productivity by separating things into various workspaces, such as editing, effects, and audio. When we tested it on both Mac and PC, we discovered that each workspace helps handle a specific activity while minimizing distraction.

Edit the FLV video with Adobe Premiere Pro using the following steps:

Step 1: Import the video and create initial sequence.

![edit flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-10.jpg)

Step 2: In the Timeline, trim and rearrange clips, add audio, and transitions.

![edit flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-11.jpg)

Step 3: Add title and graphics.

In Premiere Pro, you may make onscreen titles, as well as stylize and animate your images.

Step 4: Export your video.

## **Alternative Way to Edit FlV Video on Mac**

### **1\.** **Blender:**

Under the GNU General Public License, Blender is a free, open-source 3D content production program that runs on all major operating systems. Blender is one of the greatest video editors for both Windows and Mac, with advanced features such as modifier-based modeling tools, powerful character animation capabilities, a node-based material, etc.

Because it is developed for professionals, it is tough to use as a beginner. However, it is unrestricted in its use and distribution. In addition, color options are changeable and versatile in the UI.

 In contrast, this free video editor is perfect for semi-pros or those who want to enhance their video editing skills. However, you'll need a lot of time and effort to learn it.

Step 1: Open the application.

![edit flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-14.jpg)

Step 2: Then, go into File->New->Video Editing to open the video editor.

### **2\.** **Final Cut Pro:**

When it comes to video editing software, Apple's Final Cut Pro is one of the industry standards. As a result, it's widely utilized in the television and film industries - at least among Mac users. However, one of the truly convincing reasons to choose it over Premiere Pro is because it is subscription-free: you only pay once.

The software's Magnetic Timeline, grouping tools, a vast selection of effects, solid organizational capabilities, and simple ways to add and edit audio make it a favorite among professional video editors. 360° video, HDR, and powerful color correcting tools are among the other capabilities. It's a strong software with a lot of features.

Follow the steps to edit FLV video using Final Cut Pro:

Step 1: Create Project.

To make a movie in Final Cut Pro, you must first establish a project, which keeps track of your editing selections and the media you utilize.

Both formats employ video and audio codecs and have equal performance levels. In their unprocessed state, MP4 files are more adaptable. You can, however, use an FLV file at the same time if you have the correct player.

 1. **How do I choose a video editor?**

When comparing video editing software, there are six crucial elements to consider.

* Budget and cost
* Ease of use/learning curve
* Multi-GPGPU acceleration and video format support
* Tools for advanced editing
* Music, special effects, and other goodies
* Customer service is second to none.

## **Alternative Way to Edit FlV Video on Windows**

### **1\.** **VSDC**

VSDC is a free video editor along with a lot of advanced features. Cut, combine, trim, crop, and other editing capabilities are available to help you polish your FLV films.

Although it may not look logical, learning the editing capabilities hidden within modular boxes is simple. One noteworthy aspect of VSDC is its ability to produce good visual effects using many trendy video effects, transitions, and filters.

Furthermore, strong chroma keys, color correction, object modification, and other editing tools can be utilized to edit FLV videos. It not only creates excellent FLV videos, but it also supports a wide range of media conversion, allowing you to convert FLV files to various formats and export them without a watermark.

Therefore, follow the below mentioned steps to edit FLV video using VSDC:

Step 1: Install the software on the Windows. Open the application and import the video.

![edit flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-5.jpg)

Step 2: Use cutting and splitting tools to edit the video.

The first icon is a picture of a pair of scissors, which is a cutting tool. It's very useful when you need to cut the beginning or end of a film. Place the cursor exactly where you want to cut, then select "Trim start" or "Trim finish" from the dropdown cutting menu (the small triangle next to the scissors icon).

 ![edit flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-6.jpg)

Cropping is also simple. If you have too much additional space around the scene object recorded, just choose the file you want to trim and select the cropping icon from the "Cutting and Splitting" option. A new window will appear, allowing you to select the region of the scene that should stay.

![edit flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-7.jpg)

Step 3: Apply effects and transitions.

To use one, first select the video file you wish to edit, then go to the Video effects tab and select the effect you want to use. On the timeline, a new tab will appear, containing all of the effects done to the selected object. You can alter the effect's duration and position in time by dragging it with the mouse there. The properties pane on the right-hand side can be used to change other parameters.

Transitions follow the same rule. Place your cursor where you want the transition to begin, then choose a transition from the Video effects dropdown menu and manually adjust the duration.

![edit flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-8.jpg)

Step 4: Save changes and export video.

Make sure your movie appears exactly how you want it to before exporting it. If the video appears choppy, use the red preview button and lower the preview quality. When the PC's resources are insufficient to process the video in real time, lagging can occur. Keep in mind that it has no bearing on the outcome. When you're finished, navigate to the Export project tab and select an export format.

![edit flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-9.jpg)

### **2\.** **Adobe Premiere Pro:**

Professional video editors use Premiere Pro to make everything from YouTube videos to Hollywood films like Mank, a 2021 Oscar candidate. It's also widely utilized in the workflows of designers, animators, and VFX artists, and we can see why after lengthy testing.

We found the software's UI to be simple to use, and it increased our productivity by separating things into various workspaces, such as editing, effects, and audio. When we tested it on both Mac and PC, we discovered that each workspace helps handle a specific activity while minimizing distraction.

Edit the FLV video with Adobe Premiere Pro using the following steps:

Step 1: Import the video and create initial sequence.

![edit flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/edit-flv-10.jpg)

In Premiere Pro, you may make onscreen titles, as well as stylize and animate your images.

## **Alternative Way to Edit FlV Video on Mac**

### **1\.** **Blender:**

Under the GNU General Public License, Blender is a free, open-source 3D content production program that runs on all major operating systems. Blender is one of the greatest video editors for both Windows and Mac, with advanced features such as modifier-based modeling tools, powerful character animation capabilities, a node-based material, etc.

Because it is developed for professionals, it is tough to use as a beginner. However, it is unrestricted in its use and distribution. In addition, color options are changeable and versatile in the UI.

 In contrast, this free video editor is perfect for semi-pros or those who want to enhance their video editing skills. However, you'll need a lot of time and effort to learn it.

Step 1: Open the application.

When it comes to video editing software, Apple's Final Cut Pro is one of the industry standards. As a result, it's widely utilized in the television and film industries - at least among Mac users. However, one of the truly convincing reasons to choose it over Premiere Pro is because it is subscription-free: you only pay once.

The software's Magnetic Timeline, grouping tools, a vast selection of effects, solid organizational capabilities, and simple ways to add and edit audio make it a favorite among professional video editors. 360° video, HDR, and powerful color correcting tools are among the other capabilities. It's a strong software with a lot of features.

Follow the steps to edit FLV video using Final Cut Pro:

Step 1: Create Project.

To make a movie in Final Cut Pro, you must first establish a project, which keeps track of your editing selections and the media you utilize.
