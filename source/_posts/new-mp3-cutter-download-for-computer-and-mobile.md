## Best Audio Waveform Generator

For more than a century, sound waves and broadcasts have played an important role in shaping media as we know it. Here's how to implement them into your social media strategy. They have become popular in short video animations used to promote audio on social media, commonly referred to as audiograms.

Before learning everything there is to know about audiograms and how to make them, let's gain a better understanding of the significance of these patterns.

## Part 1\. What is an audio waveform?

A sound wave is the vibration of air molecules, which is how sound travels. The waveform describes the wave using a graph of how the air molecule is displaced over time.

Amplitude is the strength of a wave's action; the higher the amplitude, the more the air molecules are displaced. This also translates into loudness for the human ear; increasing the amplitude of the wave will increase how loud it appears to us. Sine, triangle, square, and sawtooth waveforms are the most typical periodic waveforms.

## Part 2\. What is audio wave animation?

A waveform animation video is a short video clip that can be uploaded to social media that combines an audio file with a static background image and a straightforward waveform animation. Audio animations, an example of audio visualization, make for fantastic video content, which is increasingly valuable on ever-noisy social media platforms.

## Part 3\. Why do we use audio visualization?

We all know that there is a special way of feeling called synesthesia, which is both a psychological and a linguistic phenomenon. Similar to how you automatically link this rain scene with the sound of heavy rain when you see it. People's newly awakened senses are more about the synthesis of sensory experience with actual life experience than they are entirely about actual information. Therefore, for clean audio, enhancing it with complementary visual animation effects will improve the user's visual experience and, to some extent, offer additional information and impact to your audio.

![use audio visualization](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/audio-waveform-animation-1.jpg)

## Part 4\. Best Audio Waveform Generator

Audio visualization can be presented in a variety of ways. The simplest kind of processing involves taking low-dimensional information like frequency, loudness, and rhythm and converting them into images in the form of colors, forms, strokes, etc. However, modern artificial intelligence technology can now extract high-dimensional visual attributes including style, tone, and emotion. But, for most non-technical players, such processes are obviously out of their league, therefore your best choice is to use a basic audio waveform generator. Following, we'll suggest 10 desktop or online generators so you may quickly finish the audio visualization project and create your audio-related videos.

1. [**Videobolt Music Visualizer**](https://videobolt.net/music-visualizer)

The collection of music visualization templates that this website offers is really impressive as you can choose from a wide variety of templates during the video creation process. However, you must purchase one of the available subscription plans to customize the template you've selected and export it without a watermark. After selecting a music visualization template, just click the Edit button below it and start working on your project. You can either upload a song from your computer or use SoundCloud to import the song you want to visualize into your project. You can improve the quality of your video by adding a cover or using a variation of the template you originally selected. The only downside is that you won't be able to edit the videos produced by Videobolt Music Visualizer during the free trial period.

**Price:** Free trial available, subscription plans start from $7.99 per month

Pros

* The quality and ease to create awesome-looking intros have been an invaluable tool in my work. Simple to use with excellent assistance available.
* This tool has helped me make an awesome-looking music video and an intro as well.
* Particularly the quality of the final product and the ability to change the templates to compliment the client's brand guidelines.

Cons

* The overall experience is poor, and their support is terrible.
* As someone with not that much money to spend, it is a bit costly.
* Sometimes it's hard to find exactly what you need.
