## Step-by-Step Guide to Speed Up and Slow Down a Video

Speeding and slowing down the speed of a video is a marvel in the video editing world. In the older days, this feat was accomplished only by the big-budget filming industry.

This article will dive into how you can access the modern-day features available in video editing software. From these features, you can alter the speed of your video easily. However, before we get into the step-by-step guide, let's understand what fast and slow-mo videos are.

## Part 1\. What Are Fast and Slow Motion Videos?

As the name suggests, fast-motion videos are the ones that have been sped up from their average speed.

![difference between normal and fast speed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-1.gif)

Similarly, slow-motion videos are the ones that have been slowed down from their average speed. The slow-motion effect, also known as the slow-mo effect, is widespread in modern cinema.

![difference between normal speed and slow speed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-2.gif)

Now that we know what Fast and slow-motion videos are. Let's understand their applications. Or how you can use them in your videos. Scroll below to learn more!

## Part 2\. Why Should You Change the Speed of Your Videos?

The answer to this question would be that it's a personal creative decision that will allow you to make your videos more engaging.

### Fast Motion Videos

Fast-motion videos are used in many areas of filming. For example, you can speed up your videos to create a funny video or shorten its length.

The fast-motion effect has many applications, such as cooking tutorial videos. For example, the step-by-step process of a cooking tutorial can be too long to fit into a single video. Or it could also help you in cases where you want to keep the length of the video short.

The fast motion of the steps will allow the viewer to quickly grasp the whole process without watching the entire video.

### Slow Motion Videos

You can also slow down your videos to give the viewers a more detailed perspective of a scene. Or you can also create a slow-mo video that offers a general surreal vibe.

A famous example is in action films. The producers of the first **Matrix** film used the Slow-mo effect in the famous bullet dodging scene.

![famous bullet dodging scene in the matrix](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-3.png)

You may wonder how the film producers made the slow-mo effect. The technology at that time was less developed than the recent day. So, even you can create a slow-mo effect.

Before we get into the editing process, let's first understand what you will need to change the speed of your videos!

## Part 3\. What Will You Need to Change the Speed of Your Videos?

You will need the following essentials to change the speed of a video:

### 1\. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

To begin, you will need a good video editor. Wondershare Filmora is the best video editing software available. It has a very engaging system UI that allows inexperienced users to learn how to use it quickly. It also has a diverse collection of stock media. And not only that! It allows you to access reliable features to change the speed of a video.

You can change the speed of the video on Filmora by the speed adjustment panel or by the duration panel present above the timeline. It will adjust in just seconds with a few clicks. This feature makes Filmora more prior with editing tools.

![wondershare filmora home interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-4.png)

### 2\. Video Clips

Well, it is evident that to change the speed of your videos, you will need video clips. But there are a few things you can keep in mind before adjusting the speed of a video.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Slowing down a video requires a shot at a higher frame rate. The greater the frame rate, the better will be the slow-mo quality. On the other hand, speeding up videos does not have a strict frame rate requirement.

## Part 4\. How Can You Change the Speed of Your Videos?

Here you will learn two ways in which you can change the speed of your videos. The two methods to change the speed of your video are mentioned:

* The speed adjustment panel.
* Duration panel settings.

Let's get started with the editing process. The first method we will look into is the Speed Adjustment panel.

### 1\. Change Speed With the Speed Adjustment Panel

The Speed Adjustment panel is the speed adjuster in the Wondershare Filmora software. This feature will give you a drag bar to adjust the speed of your video.

You can move the bar to the right to increase the speed of your video. Similarly, you can move it to the left to decrease the rate.

But before we use this feature, we will need to download the Filmora video editing software. So please scroll below to learn how to download it!

##### Step1 Download Filmora

First and foremost, you must have access to Filmora. For this, download Wondershare Filmora. Then, activate this app or software on your PC.

##### Step2 Import The Video Files

The next step after downloading Filmora is to import your video clips. To accomplish this, follow the steps outlined below:

* Locate and select the **Import** icon on the top left side of the Filmora Home Interface.
* It takes you to your computer's library.
* Select the videos to be edited and then click **OK**.

![wondershare filmora importing video clips from pc directory](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-5.png)

You can also import the files by another method. After you have opened Filmora, you can restore the Filmora Window size and import by dragging and dropping the clips:

* **Drag** the cursor to select the video clips you want.
* Then, drop them in the Filmora import window.

![import video clips by drag and drop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-6.png)

Filmora supports various formats for your video clips. They include the **Mp4**,   **AVI**, **MOV**, **GIFs,** and more.

After you have imported your video clips, add them to the timeline as shown below!

##### Step3 Add The Video Clips to The Timeline

After you've imported clips in the Import window, drag them onto the timeline. Follow the steps outlined below to accomplish this:

* **Drag** the clips into the import window and select them.
* Then, **insert** them into the timeline.

![wondershare filmora adding clips to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-7.png)

Now that we have our video clips in the timeline, we can start adjusting the speed.

##### Step4 Open the Speed Adjustment Panel

The speed adjustment panel, or the Uniform Speed, is the feature of Filmora that allows you to change the speed of your video. For example, to open the Unifrom Speed panel, do as follows:

* **Double-click** on the video clip.
* In the **pop-up** column, scroll down till you see the **Unifrom Speed** option and click on it.
* The speed controls will be shown in the import window.

![wondershare filmora unifrom speed tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-8.png)

In the speed control panel, you can see the speed adjuster slider. A number will usually mark this at the end. This number tells you the current speed your video is calibrated in and how fast or slow the motion effects will be.

**1.00** is always the average speed. **0.5** being half and **2.00** being double the average speed. To control the speed through the slider, you will need to do the following:

* **To increase the speed:** Type in the number you want your rate to be. Or, drag the slider to the right as you wish.
* **To decrease the speed:** Type in a number less than the standard 1.00, or you can drag the slider to the left as you wish.

The number of your speed can be an inconvenience if you have no prior experience. Instead, render the video and play it from the beginning with the changes that you made. It gives you a better idea of the speed of your video.

![wondershare filmoa opening the speed adjustment panel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-9.png)

##### Step5 Detach The Audio

The corresponding audio also gets affected when you slow down or speed up a video. In this scenario, you can also choose to detach the audio beforehand. It allows you to maintain the original playback speed. To detach the audio, follow the steps as mentioned:

* **Right-click** on the video clip.
* In the pop-up column, scroll down to the **Detach Audio** option and click on it.

![wondershare filmora detaching audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-10.png)

It will create an audio file in a separate audio tab in the timeline. You can adjust this audio according to your liking. You can edit the detached audio by:

* **Double-click** on the audio file.
* A settings menu will open in the import window.
* Adjust the **Fade** options for your Audio.
* Drag the **Fade out** slider to the right to Fade out your Audio.
* To Fade in your Audio, drag the **Fade in** slider to the right.

![wondershare filmora adjusting detached audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-11.png)

You can also remove the background noise and the pitch of the audio if you want. You can also replace the video's original audio with a new one. Click on the audio file and press **Del** on the keyboard to delete it. To add new audio, do as mentioned ahead:

* Click on The **Audio** icon above the import window.
* Browse The Audio that matches the vibe of your video.
* Drag and drop it below your video clip.

![wondershare filmora adding custom audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-12.png)

Doing so would have created alternate audio for your video. Play the video from the start and confirm your changes.

##### Step6 Save Your Project

Saving a project on Filmora is straightforward. First, you need a few steps to proceed with it. Then, when you are done making changes to the video, simply follow as guided ahead, and you'll be good to go.

These were the methods by which you can change the speed of your video using the Speed Adjustment panel. Now let's move on to the following method to adjust the speed via the Duration panel.

### 2\. Change Speed via the Duration Panel

The duration panel is one the most valuable features of Wondershare Filmora as it allows you to change the video speed by duration adjustment.

This feature is typically helpful when you have a space between video clips and want to fill it. By measuring the time between the two clips, you can adjust the duration of your video.

It will ultimately hasten the speed of your video. The hastening in rate will depend upon the gap. The smaller the gap, the faster the video will be. Similarly, the greater the gap is, the longer the video will be.

Apart from the Speed Adjustment Panel, the Duration Panel has the advantage of editing the speed of your video by simply typing in the text.

##### Step1 Import Video Clips to Timeline

After downloading Filmora, the next step is importing your video clips. To do so, follow the steps outlined below:

* Locate and click the **Import** icon in the upper left corner of the Filmora Home Interface.
* Choose the videos to be edited, then click **OK**.

Now that you have imported files into Filmora, you can add them to the Timeline. Notice the steps mentioned ahead:

* Drag the clips into the import window and select them.
* Then, insert them into the timeline.

You can begin the editing process now that the clips are in the timeline.

##### Step2 Open The Duration Panel

The Duration Panel comes attached to the **Unifrom Speed Panel**. To access the Duration Panel, follow the steps ahead:

* **Right-click** on the video clip.
* In the pop column, scroll below to **Unifrom Speed**.

It will open the uniform speed panel in the import window. Below the speed of the controls, you can notice The Duration Panel.

##### Step3 Change The Speed of The Video

In The Duration Panel, you can see the average speed of your video clip. Now, if you want to **reduce** the speed of your video, you have to **increase** the duration of your video. Similarly, if you're going to **increase** the speed of your video, you would have to **decrease** the duration.

##### Slow Down The Video

To slow down the video clip, follow the steps mentioned below:

* In The Duration Panel, **Increase** the time of the video.
* Type in a number bigger than the normal value

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** If the average speed of the video is **00:01:00:00,** increasing the value of the duration to **00:02:00:00** will reduce the speed of your video by half.

![wondershare filmora adjusting slowing down the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-videos-speed-17.png)

##### Speed Up The Video

To increase the speed of your video, follow as guided ahead:

* In The Duration Panel, **decrease** the time of the video.
* Type in a number smaller than the normal value

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

## Best Tips for Better Event Videography

There is no doubt that if you have an upcoming corporate event, you will want to record it using professional

corporate event video production. This is something that can't be stressed enough. Providing video footage of events is an excellent method to raise people's awareness of your brand, as well as interest in and enthusiasm for the work that your firm does.

Let's start!

![event videography](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/event-videography.jpg)

## 1\. A quality corporate event video represents your business

People who are watching your corporate event video aren't just learning about who your company is and what your company does. They're also learning about your commitment to quality. If your event video looks like it was shot off the cuff by an employee on someone's phone, people may assume you take that kind of approach to your business and service to your customers.

You don't, but it's an easy assumption to make. A professionally shot, high-quality video signals to viewers that your company appreciates quality and seeks it out in everything they do. It also shows your attention to detail and what they can expect when they choose your business to handle their own occasions or services.

## 2\. A professional videographer is capable of editing

Videoing your corporate event is about more than just filming, it's knowing how to cut the event together, how to mix the shots and the sound, and add music and any subtle effects or graphics that will make the video really shine. There is a lot that goes into post-production that an amateur simply cannot replicate.

Editing your video without the benefit of a dedicated studio with years of experience just won't have the same

effect when it comes to amplifying the energy and mission of your event. It also will not show the level of detail that your video could contain if a professional corporate event video production company did it.

## 3\. A professional video is completed on schedule

It can take longer than you anticipate if you opt to handle your corporate or conference videos yourself or

delegate the task to one of your workers. Without a lot of post-production knowledge, it could take a lot of trial and error to put your material together in a way that produces the desired outcome.

If you're trying to summarize an event and demonstrate to stakeholders or customers how effective it was, you might not have time for that. Even though unforeseen issues might always arise, if you and a competent

videographer agree on a finish date, they will be able to deliver. This is crucial if you want to utilize your video

to promote a recent event or for marketing purposes.

## 4\. A skilled videographer avoids interference

A skilled videographer is trained to film an event without getting in the way, so things can keep going as usual.

If you're not used to doing professional videography, you might not realize you're bothering your guests and

messing up the event while you're trying to film it. This can turn people off and hurt your finished product, as

well as the success of your event. If your occasion is streamed online, you don't want the videographer to get in the way or become visible in the frame your live show.

## 5\. A video that is done well tells a story

Companies with experience creating videos do more than just capture actions digitally, they also find the story

in the event they are recording and use their videography skills to tell that story. This storyline is defined in

what they choose to shoot, when they shoot it and how they edit it all together. It's that storyline that is going

to capture the attention from the audience and give your video the desired impact.

It's also going to stir up emotions and passion in your audience, creating momentum in your company and with your customers that will last until your next event. Remember that any video you share with your customers or employees is a video marketing exercise that helps you build brand awareness. Let your corporate event video reflect positively on your business.

## 6\. A videographer has a shot list

It is not enough to simply create a list; you must also put it to good use. The idea that you should plan your shot and then execute your plan is a fundamental element of production. Create a strategy and put it into action since your videographer will be knowing his job to adhere to this concept regardless of whether or not they are aware of it.

Also, get things you may or may not need for editing. It is usually excellent practice to use some B roll audio

and video, in addition to establishing shots, no matter what kind of event you are filming, be it a wedding or a business function. If you anticipate that it will be overly crowded during the event, take your creative shoton a pleasant day that occurs before the main event.

## Conclusion

We sincerely hope that some of these pointers will be of assistance to you as you navigate the area of special

events videos. Whether you are able to employ all of them or not will depend on your client, the event, and

your own workflow; nonetheless, the takeaway from this anecdote is that you should be prepared for the

worst-case scenario and find that you are better equipped to offer the best possible results. There won't be

many situations that you won't be able to manage with grace and professionally if you have the ability to

remain calm, cool, and professional.
