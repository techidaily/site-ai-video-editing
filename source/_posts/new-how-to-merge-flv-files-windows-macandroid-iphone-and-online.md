**Frame blending** is a video editing technique used to create smooth transitions between two video frames. This process is often used to create special effects or transition between two different video clips. Frame blending can be done manually or with the help of software.

When **frame blending** is done manually, the editor will take two consecutive frames and blend them. This is done by using a process called cross-fading. Cross-fading is when the first frame gradually fades out while the second frame gradually fades in. The result is a seamless transition between the two frames.

Frame blending can also be done with the help of software. Many software programs offer frame blending capabilities Like Adobe Premiere Pro and more. These software programs typically have a user interface that allows the user to select the two frames that they want to blend. The software will then perform the cross-fading process automatically.

The video is made up of distinct layers blended together to create a unique and appealing look. There is a craft of making a running frame out of more than one video or picture. Even though the technique is considerably older, and individuals undertake it with much work, it has recently become simpler. We now have the easier method of combining two or more clips in a single frame, which we term Blend Modes.

#### How to composite with blending modes?

* Choose the videos and effects that you wish to overlay.
* Double-click the overlay clip on the timeline to view and adjust the video options for the split-screen effect.
* Go to the Compositing section and choose Blending Mode from the drop-down menu to apply an effect. Select Screen from the drop-down menu if you'd like to overlay an effect over a video.

Frame blending is a simple and effective way to create smooth transitions between two video frames. This technique can create a variety of different effects, such as dissolves, fades, and more. Frame blending is a built-in feature in Filmora and can be accessed by loading the video you want to edit and then making the changes you want. Once you're happy with the results, export the video, and it will be saved in the format of your choice.
