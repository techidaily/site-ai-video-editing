YouTube continues to grow in popularity. On this platform, users of YouTube can view and upload videos as well as debate them live. Live chat on YouTube is described in this article.

Let's start off!

![youtube live chat comment](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/youtube-live-chat-comment.jpg)

## 1\. What is YouTube live chat?

Every day, more than 30 million individuals use YouTube to upload and watch entertaining videos. Many individuals are interested in having a conversation with the video's producer or later on discussing these films with others. You can now have live video chats on YouTube using the Google+ Hangouts On Air service because Google's YouTube has opened up its live streaming service to all users in good standing.

The live chat box appears to the right of the video player as soon as the live stream starts. Both the video and the live chat's material will be archived once the live stream stops. People can rewatch the video with live chat if necessary.

On YouTube, there are two different live chat views:

* Best chat: The messages that may hurt you are filtered out in this display.
* Live chat: No messages are filtered in this display.

Additionally, the live chat will not be available if the channel or live stream is intended for children.

## 2\. How to comment on YouTube live chat?

YouTube users would like to comment on the live chat when the stream starts. Here are the steps for posting a comment in the YouTube Live Chat

Step1Create a YouTube account and sign in using your username and email. You cannot post any messages at tall if you are not signed into your YouTube account.

Step2Join the live stream. Click the live stream that you want to watch after selecting it.

Step3Click where it says, "Live Chat" and start typing anything you want to publish in the chat box. Next, select the

send button.

Additionally, a number of YouTube viewers frequently lament their inability to comment on livestreams or the fact that their messages keep disappearing. Because certain comments are flagged as spam and filtered, this is the cause. There is no other option but to post constructive criticism. If the streamer is one you enjoy or if you don't want to miss the author's next live stream. Then choose "HIDE Chat" if you don't want to see any comments at all. The procedures below can be used if you simply want to have a private conversation or reply to someone.

## Conclusion

You now know what YouTube live chat is and how to participate in it thanks to this post. I hope it will be beneficial to you.

## In This Guidepost, You’ll Learn What an HDRI Photo Is and How to Use the Best Free HDRI Program to Edit Photos. You’ll Also Know the Difference Between HDR and HDRI

Photography is like art itself. Photographers must carefully select the setting and use the right camera to capture images with lossless quality. However, you'll realize that some photos appear darker or brighter than in actual life.

In that case, use **free HDRI** software to change that straightway. But HDRI being a relatively new technique, beginners might struggle to edit the photos, let alone find the perfect HDRI software.

So, in this simple guidepost, we'll learn how to create an HDRI 3D picture using **HDRI for Blender**. But first, let's understand what an HDRI file is and the difference between HDRI and HDR.

## Part 1: What is HDRI?

HDRI (High Dynamic Range Image) is simply an image created using multiple image overlays of the same background but with varying exposures. The exposures can range from the brightest highlights to the darkest shadows. So, in short, HDRI expands an image's dynamic range to brighten or darken it and make it look more natural.

Having said that, HDRI is a raster image created using color pixels. HDRI photos are generally significant in size, so they won't quickly lose quality like other raster photos such as PNG and JPG. Many formats can store HDRI images, although the most common are OpenEXR (.exr) and Radiance RGBE (.hdr).

 Pros

* You can easily create one using HDRI for Blender, Photoshop, EasyHDRI, etc.
* HDRI photos are compatible with many image editing programs.
* Produces crisp images with excellent detail and lighting control.

 Cons

* 32-bit HDRI files have significant sizes.
* HDRI can quickly be poorly done without prior experience.

## Part 2: What's the difference between HDR and HDRI

According to Wikipedia, HDR and HDRI are the same things. But is it true? For starters, HDRI is basically a photo with High Dynamic Range qualities. So, yes, HDR and HDRI can mean the same thing in digital image editing.

However, some photo editors argue that there is a difference between these two regarding basic workflow. First, HDR technology increases brightness to show more image details. On the other hand, HDRI performs unique optimization of content and lighting to deliver crisp images. In other words, HDRI brightens the dark shadows without necessarily overexposing the bright image areas.

Some photographers can also consider HDR as images with pixel values higher than 1 or 255\. That means that the pixels can be much higher than pure white. But technically speaking, HDR and HDRI can be used interchangeably.

## Part 3: When to use HDRI

Now that you have all the information about HDRI, let's learn about some industries where HDRI is applicable.

### 1\. HDRI for 3D visualization and 3D animation

**HDRI 3D** is commonplace these days. 3D animation creators can use programs like **HDRI Blender** to add HDR environments and make the content look detailed and more realistic in high lighting reflections. To put it simply, HDRI makes 3D scenes look lighter, less cartoonish, and more professional. This technology can also be used in interior visualizations in animations.

### 2\. HDRI for architect rendering

Creating HDRI environments is a common practice in 3D architectural designs. For example, designers can create panoramic house designs with varying light tones and interior moods. HDRI helps them give a natural 3D lighting effect on scenes and objects.

### 3\. HDRI monitors and TVs

You've probably heard of **HDRI 4K** when shopping for a smart TV or computer monitor. These TVs offer a lot more than just a wide color gamut, high brightness, and advanced contrast ratio. In addition, HDR TVs and monitors can recognize HDR signals, allowing viewers to watch the content with all studio quality. In short, viewers can see more color details in shadowy and lighter scenes, making them perfect for avid gamers.

## Part 4: How do you open an HDRI?

Because HDRIs use low dynamic range rendering, a standard display panel won't open HDR images. So, to open an HDRI file on a non-HDR display, you'll need to convert it to a different low dynamic range format using tone mapping technology. For example, you convert HDRI to JPEG or PNG and enjoy regular bitmaps while maintaining the HDRI properties. You can also open and edit HDRI using desktop programs like EasyHDR, Photoshop, and Blender.

## Part 5: How to set up an HDR environment background?

Before wrapping up this blog post, let's discuss how to use [HDRI for Blender](https://www.blender.org/) to apply HDR effects to an image's background. Blender is a 100% free program for creating jaw-dropping 3D rendering and animations on Mac and Windows computers. With Blender, you'll get an advanced modeling toolset like retopology, curves, sculpting, and more. But in this post, we'll learn how to create an HDR environment or add lighting to your image project. Let's get started!

Step1Install and run Blender and then tap the World Properties tab. Then, click the Color icon and add Environment Texture.

![free hdri for blender open world properties](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/free-hdri-blender-1.jpg)

Step2Next, split the window into two and launch the Shader Editor tool. Then, open the Object drop-down menu at the top-left corner and choose World. You'll see the Environment Texture hooked into the background.

![free hdri for blender open shader editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/free-hdri-blender-2.jpg)

Step3On the Environment Texture, tap Open Image before opening the 3.2 folder inside the Blender Foundation folder. Then, click Data files > Studiolights > Word. Now open a .exr file. For example, open the Interior.exr image.

![free hdri for blender open exr file](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/free-hdri-blender-3.jpg)

Step4Click the Viewport Shading icon and tap the drop-down button to choose Interior. You'll see all the lighting reflections inside the room and customize it as you wish. That's it!

![free hdri for blender open viewport shading](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/free-hdri-blender-4.jpg)

## Conclusion

Using the environment maps is the simplest and most effective way to lighten up your 3D scenes in Blender. This program lets you achieve realistic 3D scenes, mimicking natural world lighting. But note that Blender can be a little confusing for beginners. So, play around with this HDRI tool, and you'll be a pro in no time.
