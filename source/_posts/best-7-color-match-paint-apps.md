The app will get you the closest cousin, and more so you can preview recommended accent color and design from the comfort of your home.

Alternatively, you can take a picture with your phone in natural light without using a caller app and take the photo to your favorite paint store.

All you need is to head to your favorite paint store and gather up a selection of paint chips close to the hue you are trying to match. After that, bring the trip home and hang them on the surface which color you want to duplicate, then observe multiple lights using lamp light and daylight, whichever chip matches most closely.
