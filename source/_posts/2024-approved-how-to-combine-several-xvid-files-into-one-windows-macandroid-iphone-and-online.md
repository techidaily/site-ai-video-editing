![evaluate your work and adjust](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2024/02/silence-detection-filmora-step5.JPG)

You can make sure the video segments move without a hitch. Thus, listen to the modified audio track again. You can adjust the clips in the timeline to customize the edit directly if necessary.

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-3.jpg)

1. **Resize the video by changing the aspect ratio**

Aspect ratio defines the shape of your video like if you want the video to be horizontal, vertical, square, or custom. Generally, the term ‘**resizing video**’ refers to changing the aspect ratio of the video. For that, go to the **_File_** and then to the **_Project Settings_**_._ Then on the Aspect Ratio box, select the one that you prefer or you can try custom scaling. You can choose your preferred resolution of the project too while you’re at it.

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-4.jpg)

1. **Resize the video by cropping**

When you change the aspect ratio of the project, some parts of your flv video might not fit or it might be shrunk small to fit. So you need to resize the flv video by cropping so that you can crop and focus on the part of the video you like. To crop the video, select the flv video clip in the timeline and click on the crop icon in the timeline toolbar. Now choose the ratio you want to crop and select the part you’d like to keep. Then click OK and your flv video will be resized.

Click on the **_Settings_** button near the resolution and you’ll be shown some detailed preferences for exporting. Every setting here like frame rate, resolution, bitrate, etc. can affect the size of the output video.

1. **Resize the video by changing the aspect ratio**

Aspect ratio defines the shape of your video like if you want the video to be horizontal, vertical, square, or custom. Generally, the term ‘**resizing video**’ refers to changing the aspect ratio of the video. For that, go to the **_File_** and then to the **_Project Settings_**_._ Then on the Aspect Ratio box, select the one that you prefer or you can try custom scaling. You can choose your preferred resolution of the project too while you’re at it.

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-4.jpg)

1. **Resize the video by cropping**

When you change the aspect ratio of the project, some parts of your flv video might not fit or it might be shrunk small to fit. So you need to resize the flv video by cropping so that you can crop and focus on the part of the video you like. To crop the video, select the flv video clip in the timeline and click on the crop icon in the timeline toolbar. Now choose the ratio you want to crop and select the part you’d like to keep. Then click OK and your flv video will be resized.

## **2 Ways to Resize FLV Videos on Android**

Wouldn’t it be great if you could resize FLV videos on your android device rather than having to open your computer for every small task? Previously, this was a major issue due to a lack of good video editors for android with flv support but that’s no longer the case. Below are two ways to resize FLV videos on android:

1. **Inshot**

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-31.jpg)

InShot is a powerful all-in-one video editor for android which acts both as a basic video editor as well as an advanced video editor with its simple design yet powerful features. There aren’t many video editors in Android that supports Flv or some older codecs, but InShot is one of the very few editors that support these video formats. It is a paid app but also has a limited free version to try.

**Steps to resize FLV videos on Android with InShot:**

* Open the Inshot app on your android device and click on **Video**.

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-32.jpg)

* Now select the FLV video file and click on the tick icon near the bottom right.

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-33.jpg)

* Then tap on the **Crop** option from the tools at the bottom.

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-34.jpg)

* Now select the aspect ratio you like and crop accordingly.

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-35.jpg)

* To save the video, tap on the **Save** button at the top right. Then choose the resolution and finally save the video to your device.

1. **AndroVid – Video Editor, Video Maker**

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-37.jpg)

AndroVid is an easy-to-use, full-featured video editor especially developed to edit videos for social media like YouTube, TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, etc. It is not a very popular application with just over 300k+ downloads in Google Play Store, but after testing it out, we thought it deserves to be in this article. It is available for free to download from Google Play Store.

**Steps to resize FLV videos on Android with AndroVid Video Editor:**

* Open AndroVid Video Editor on an android phone and go inside the **Videos**

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-38.jpg)

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-39.jpg)

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-40.jpg)

* Then select the preferred Aspect ratio from the top right, reposition the video area and tap on the tick icon to save the video.

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-41.jpg)

* If you need to change the resolution too, click on the three dots at the top right after the video is saved successfully. Then choose the preferred resolution, quality, and format and click on the tick icon to export.

## **FAQs about Resizing FLV Video**

Here are some of the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) related to resizing FLV videos that you might be interested in:

1. **How do I make FLV files smaller?**

You can make FLV files smaller with the help of any video editor that supports Flv video format by cutting and cropping out unnecessary parts, decreasing the resolution, and bitrate, and converting flv into another lighter file format.

1. **Which video editors support FLV file format?**

There are few video editors like Filmora, Movavi, VSDC, etc. that support the FLV file format. But when it comes to editing FLV videos, Filmora Video Editor is the best choice.

1. **How do I view an FLV file?**

FLV is one of the oldest video formats due to which most new and modern video players don’t recognize it or can’t play it. However, there are few programs like VLC media players which can help you view an FLV file. Or you can also convert the FLV file into other supported video formats with the help of a video converter.

1. **Can I convert a horizontal FLV video into a vertical one?**

Yes, and that’s a piece of cake when you use Filmora Video Editor or other similar video editors. You just need to change the aspect ratio of the video or the project from horizontal (generally 16:9) to vertical (generally 9:16).

1. **Can I resize FLV video files on my mobile?**

Though video editors on mobile are not as powerful as those on PC, there are some that are still capable enough to let you easily resize FLV video files on mobile devices. Some examples are InShot, Splice, Powerdirector, etc.
