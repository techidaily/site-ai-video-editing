If you want to grab your audience's attention and keep them engaged with your videos, then Instagram Reels should be your destination.

![instagram reels](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/how-to-speed-up-video-on-instagram-reels-01.jpg)

There are two scenarios regarding how to increase the speed of the video in Reels. You can speed up the video when recording directly on the Instagram app, or use a third-party editing tool if it is a pre-recorded video. We will illustrate below how to speed up video on Instagram Reels for both scenarios.

## Part I. Basic Understanding of Instagram Reels

1. **What are Instagram Reels?**

Instagram Reels are short-duration, vertically-oriented videos that are displayed in the dedicated reels tab on the Instagram app. You can compare Instagram Reels with TikTok videos. The maximum duration of Instagram Reels can be of 90 seconds.

Instagram displays the popular Reels on Explore tab so that the Instagram Reels creators get more exposure. Since short-duration videos and apps are in trend, Instagram Reels has become the most popular section on the Instagram app.

Reels can be entertaining videos with popular songs in the background. They can be funny videos as well as gripping slow-motion videos. Brands promote their products and services through Reels. You can add stunning AR effects and change the speed of the video while recording Reels through the Instagram app.

1. **Why Should You Make Instagram Reels?**

Instagram Reels have been a game-changer in the social media world. From regular video creators and social media influencers to brands and businesses, Instagram Reels has become everyone's real deal. Here are the reasons why you should make Instagram Reels:

**Reach** \- The primary reason for making Instagram Reels is to reach out to the target audiences and get more followers. If your videos become popular, your Instagram Reels can get featured in the Explore tab. Once it does happen, there will be an exponential rise in views and followers. Besides, Instagram Reels have better reach to your followers than regular Instagram posts.

**Engagement** \- The world has moved on from photos to videos. People love to check out short videos rather than still images. So naturally, when you start making Instagram reels, your followers' engagement will increase dramatically. With more engagement, your Reels will get more exposure as people will love to share them with their friends. Of course, the content has to be top-notch so that people start to pay attention to your Reels.

We have handpicked the best applications to change Instagram Reels video speed for computers, smartphones as well as online users.
