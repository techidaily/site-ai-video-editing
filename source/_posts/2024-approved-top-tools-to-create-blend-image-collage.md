## Step by Step to Cut a Video in QuickTime

Filming a video is fun and editing is more interesting and entertaining. Today, everyone is making videos and there are tons of videos on the internet. Editing videos is required to make the video stand out and retain the audience. Video trimming helps you cut out the unwanted part of the video and leave the desired portion of the viewers.

**Cutting a video means your video starts quickly and you don’t lose your audience’s attention**.

The first ten seconds of the video are very important when deciding whether to stay or move on to the next video.

## **How to cut a video in QuickTime**

Quicktime is an authentic application developed by Apple in 1991\. It allows the users to edit, record, play, and share videos and pictures. If some editing software confuses you, **QuickTime** is just for you.

You need to download the application and here are all the features you can enjoy. It is compatible with all versions of windows whereas, if you are a Mac user it is already installed in your system.

Cutting a video is one of the basic but useful functions of QuickTime. It requires a few simple steps and some features related to cutting, splitting, and trimming a video.

Let’s start…

### **1\.** **Cutting/splitting a video**

Cutting a video means splitting some parts of the video to edit and rearrange the clips to make a new video. Mostly, it is used where you want to edit all clips of the video differently. It is also needed as it allows you to focus on your message and delete the portion not required and make the video large. You can remove the extra fat from the video to give clarity, direction, and hope. You can convey your message in a clear and concise way.

These steps should be followed to cut/split the video in minutes.

* In the **QuickTime player**, open the desired video.
* Select **show clips** from the **view** on the menu bar.
* Move the red marker from right to left to select the desired portion.
* Hit **split clip** from the **edit**

![cut-video-quicktime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/cut-video-quicktime-1.png)

* A yellow rectangular bar appears over the edges of your video.
* You can cut the desired portion and make editing as you like.
* Repeat the sequence until you are done.
* Press the **done**

![cut-video-quicktime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/cut-video-quicktime-2.png)

Cutting the video by splitting is used when you have a long video and you can easily edit them by splitting them into two parts.

### **2\.** **Trimming a video**

If you are cutting some parts at the beginning and the end of the video, it is called trimming a video. You can say it as removing unnecessary preparation scenes. Normally, professionals start their cameras before the film scene to ensure not to miss any part of the video. Here’s, how to trim video in the QuickTime player.

Let’s dive in…

* Launch **QuickTime**
* Select your **video** from the system.
* Select **edit** from the top menu.
* Select the **trim** or **command T**, or you can select the **hold** option from the drop-down list.

![cut-video-quicktime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/cut-video-quicktime-3.png)

* A **yellow trimming bar** will appear over the edges of your video.
* Remove the unwanted area by moving from the right or left **trim edges** also called **handles**.

![cut-video-quicktime](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/cut-video-quicktime-4.png)

Everything inside the **yellow bars** will remain. You can preview your video anytime during the editing process.

* Hit the **trim** from the bottom right corner.
* Select save from the file on the top menu bar.

Trimming is critical because it is the time to convince the viewers to stick around and stay with your video.

For more advanced editing without losing the quality of the video, I recommend you to use **Wonder Share Filmora 11**. It’s an amazing app and very easy to use even for a layman.

## **An** **easier way to cut a video with Filmora**

Wonder Share Filmora is one of the best video editing tools for beginners. It simplifies the editing process using smart and congenital features that can automate repetitive tasks. It has a lot of exciting features and has collaborated with others to make the work easier.

**_Point to be noted:_**

**The cut is removing some unwanted parts of the video.**

**The Split is dividing the clips into two parts.**

**The trim is deleting the starting or endpoints of the video.**

### **1\.** **Cut video using Filmora video cutter**

Cutting a video is necessary even if you shot a very good video because it contains some irrelevant and unwanted clips. Removing the unnecessary part of the video will make the video short, concise, and to the point. Moreover, it helps in grabbing the attention of your valuable viewers.

If your video has multiple scenes to cut, **the scene detection** function would be helpful.

* Install Filmora video cutter
* Select the New project.
* Select the video in the media library.
* Right-click and select **scene detection** to enter the scene detection window.

## [Tutorial] How To Add Motion Blur in Blender?

Motion blur effect, as a terminology, holds great significance in multiple industrial uses. From filmmaking to basic photography, the motion blur effect is consumed as a reality-setting standard, which defines its significance. Many platforms are providing this effect to enhance the creativity of their users. Blender is also known among these software providing such services while designing animations.

We will target a comprehensive guide on **adding motion blur in Blender** using the right way. Therefore, if you seek the appropriate way of adding motion blur in Blender, the following description is for you.

## Part 1: What is Blender?

As we start our discussion, we will review [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) as a free and open-source software. Following this, we will continue realizing the benefits of adding motion blur through Blender:

### Introduction to Blender

For those unaware of Blender, it is an open-source, free creativity software. You can find it as the perfect designing platform for your 3D content. This software has made itself accessible to the market with ease. This has made it quite famous among professionals, and is recommended for its high-quality, feature-rich design. From modeling to sculpting, Blender provides some great options to work with.

If you are up for editing some videos through Blender, it offers a great course of features, including motion blur. This **Blender motion blur tutorial** intends to bring you a similar insight into this great software. This will help you know the procedure of executing such facets to perfection.

![blender interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-blender-1.jpg)

### Benefits of Using Motion Blur Effect

There are many benefits of using the motion blur effect in creative work. The following points are the highlights and benefits of adding the motion blur effect:

**· Perfect For Idolizing Speed**

The use of the motion blur effect is the best way to show the speed of the object. Using such effects gives the viewer an experience of the swiftness that is contained in the object.

**· Resolves Flickering**

Rather than trying out fast motion, you can add such effects to your 3D content to enhance the motion blur. This also helps get over problems, including strobing and flickering clips.

**· Attenuates Real-Effect**

One great thing about our human eye is its ability to bring motion blur in fast-moving objects. Since this is a real-life experience, the motion blur effect highlights this particular effect and brings the edited content closer to reality.

## Part 2: How Do You Motion Blur An Object in Blender?

As stated before, Blender can be a great option for adding motion blur to objects. Many properties are involved in setting up the motion blur effect on an object. It includes defining the position, shutter, separation, and several other parameters. In this part, we will be looking for a guide on **how to add motion blur in Blender**:

Step1 With the video opened on Blender, proceed to the "Render Properties." Look to enable "Motion Blur" from the available options. Click on the arrowhead adjacent to it to access its advanced blur options.

![enable the motion blur option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-blender-2.jpg)

Step2 Start by setting its "Position" in the start, center, or end, according to the requirements. For those who are not sure of it, they can use "Center on Frame." If the objects rapidly move in the video, reduce the "Shutter" value or vice versa.

![adjust the shutter value](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-blender-3.jpg)

Step3 Following this, define the "Background Separation" according to how you require the foreground and background. Next, you will have to increase or decrease the "Max Blur" pixels to define the blur intensity in the video.

![set background separation and max blur](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-blender-4.jpg)

Step4 For objects with complex topology, you might have to increase the “Steps,” hence the “Shutter” time. For simple objects, the value remains unity. To apply the motion blur effect, use the F12 key for rendering the video.

![set the value for steps](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/motion-blur-in-blender-5.jpg)
