![combine-video-instagram-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/combine-video-instagram-10.jpg)

Apple's iMovie app is available for free on iPhones, iPad, and Mac. Here's how to combine two or more videos for an Instagram post:

1) Get iMovie and open it on your iPhone.

2) Select Movie from the Create Project menu.

3) Choose your movies. To see only the clips, go to the top left and tap Media, then Video. Choose a video and press the check button.

4) Tap Create Movie after selecting two or more video clips.

5) Swipe horizontally to the point where one video clip ends and another begins if desired. You can edit or remove the transition effect between videos by tapping the two triangle icon.

6) Optional: You can also experiment with other iMovie features such as adding music, text, and video speed changes. You can tap a video clip, tap the tiny plus icon, and zoom in and out with two fingers.

8) When you're done, tap Done in the top left corner.

9) From the bottom, tap the share button and select Save Video.

10) Your iPhone's Photos app now contains the merged clip. Open Instagram and make an individual post with the final combined Video.

Here are a few simple methods for combining two or more videos into one and posting them on Instagram (IG).

Using the Instagram official app

There is no simple way to combine many videos into one on Instagram. You can, however, utilize the Story technique.

1) Create an Instagram Story with two or more videos. You can add stickers, text, and other elements if you like.

2) Tap the three dots icon on your Instagram Tale > Save > Save story. Your current Instagram Stories films and photos will be saved to the Photos app as a single video file.

3) Upload the resulting Video to Instagram!

## Way 2\. Use Twitch To Save Your Streams

Twitch is the most popular and best live streaming platform that allows gamers to broadcast their gameplay to a live audience and also gives them the ability to save their past broadcasts, or **"streams."**

This feature can be useful to save your live stream for later viewing or share your stream with someone who missed it.

### Features

Twitch offers a variety of features that make it a unique and powerful game streaming platform. Some of the most notable ones are:
