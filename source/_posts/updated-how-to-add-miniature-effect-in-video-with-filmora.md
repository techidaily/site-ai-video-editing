## How to Add Miniature Effect in Video with Filmora

Want to add selective blur to make everything look smaller? Don't have any idea how to focus on specific mini-things? Then don't worry! In this article, you'll get a step-by-step process to add miniature effects to your video. At the end of the process, you'll have cinematic shots. Then start with us now! Scroll more to get pro tips!

## What Is a Miniature Effect?

![after adding a miniature effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-1.jpg)

But first, let's learn the logic of making the miniature effect. As many video editing pros present on Tiktok, the miniature effect is a fun way to brighten up your photography or video shots. For example, when taking a video or a time-lapse of a landscape, we always have a bigger depth of field, so most objects in the frame are in focus.

However, when we film a miniature model, the depth of field is shallow. So, we only see some objects in focus, and the rest is blurry. This visual trick makes our brain believe that the big landscape we're seeing is actually a tiny model.

![a miniature effect for landscape](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-2.jpg)

To create a miniature look, we can use specific effects to fake a shallow depth of field, and then the landscape view will look like a tiny model. While some keys to notice before making the miniature effect are:

* It utilizes **selective blur** to make things appear like **small**
* The miniature effect works best for footage filmed from **a high angle**.
* The tiny effect is usually used in **drone footage, time lapses**, or **landscape photography**.

Are you all set to add miniature effects to your video and make film-like shots? Then scroll more and get the step-by-step process.

![search for the blur effect on effect panel in wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-5.gif)

To add a blur effect from the panel, follow the below-mentioned steps:

##### Step4 Add the blur effect to the video

* **First, drag** and **Drop** the effect toward the timeline.

![add effect on the video in wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-6.gif)

##### Step5 Add the effect multiple times

Want to get an ideal blur level? If you need more blur level in your video and make it more cinematic, then follow the below steps:

* Then, if you still want more blurriness, add **Blur 2** effect multiple times on the video.
* Finally, add effect by just the **Drag and Drop**

![add the same video for 2nd time on the timeline in wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-8.gif)

##### Step7 Add masks on the Video

Now, it's time to select a specific video portion and add a mask. Due to this, we will have a selective blur portion. For this, follow the below guidelines:

* **Double-click** on the video present in 2nd track.
* The settings tab will be open in the top left section.
* Then find the **Mask** section and click on it.
* After this, **click** on the **Double-line**.

For example, when we add a mask in the below time-lapse video, follow the above mask adjustments. Unfortunately, we can't get good results. Therefore, we will apply another way to add a mask by changing shape and position. Follow the instructions for modifications:

![blur the object near to camera and focus on the distant object](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-11.gif)

* Make a building or any object **Blurry** near the camera because it is not present within the depth of field.
* While the **object is far** from the camera, it is focused because it is in the depth of the field.
* Then adjust the mask, as per your choice.

Want to change the shape of the mask? Then follow the below steps:

![changing the mask of video on wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-12.gif)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** make sure you are masking the same extent and excluding the object you want to be out of focus.

Now, it's time to mask the whole object, which is far, but we want to make it in focus! For this, follow these steps:

* Add the same stock video clip a **third time** on the third video track of the timeline.
* Then add a mask in a **Rectangle** shape on the building.
* Don't **blur** the edge of this mask.

![mask the object far from the camera for the main focus](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-13.gif)

## How to Make Video Slow Motion? [Complete Guide]

Slow-motion videos are in trend now, especially when shooting for [Instagram Reels](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), TikTok videos, or [YouTube Shorts](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). While many users record the entire video in slow motion, there are others who need only a particular section of a clip to play at a reduced speed. Nevertheless, slowing down footage is no longer rocket science, thanks to the advancements in technology, and the availability and ease of access to relevant apps.

That said, here you will learn what is needed to record a video in slow motion, and how to get the job done in a simple way. In addition, you will also learn how to reduce the playback speed of an already existing video if it was recorded at a normal pace.

03 [When to Use Slow Motion?](#part3)

## Part 1: How to Make Slow Motion Videos via Recording?

The fact is, the playback speed of a video is inversely proportional to the [frames per second](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) (FPS) it has been recorded in. Usually, to have a video play at normal speed, it is recorded at 24 FPS or 30 FPS. On the other hand, if you increase the frame rate (FPS) to 120 or 240, the playback speed slows down. You can easily check this if you have access to a DSLR camera or an iPhone. These devices allow you to adjust the FPS so the videos can be recorded in slow motion.

For your convenience and learning, the step-by-step procedure on how to record a video in slow motion using an iPhone is explained below:

**Step 1: Get to the SLO-MO Mode**

Launch the **Camera** app on your iPhone (iPhone 13 Pro Max is used here for illustrations), and swipe the screen to the left to get to the **SLO-MO** mode.

![iphone slow motion capture mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-slow-motion-capture-mode.jpg)

**Step 2: Adjust Recording Preferences**

Tap the number at the top-right corner to switch between **120** FPS and **240** FPS as needed. Tap **1x** from the lower-middle section of the screen, and use the rotator to adjust your preferred zoom level.

Speed Ramping enables you to add the slow-motion effect at different parts of a video and even freeze the screen for the duration that you specify. The processes to get these done are given below in detail:

**Step 1: Add Source Video to Timeline and Get to the Speed Ramping Window**

Use the process given in the previous method to import a source video to Wondershare Filmora 11 and add it to the Timeline. Then use the process given in the second step of the previous method to get to the **Speed Ramping** window.

**Step 2: Add Slow Motion Effect to Different Parts of the Clip**

Go to the **Speed Ramping** tab if it is not already selected, click **Custom** from the available options, and drag the adjustment points below the center line to reduce the playback speed for that particular section of the clip. Optionally, you can click any of the available presets to automatically add the slow-motion effect to the video.

Note: You can also drag the adjustment points above the line to increase the playback speed.

To add an adjustment point on the frame where it is not already present, place the playhead (skimmer) at the correct position, and click **Add Adjust Point** from the left of the **Speed Ramping** window itself. Once added, you can drag it downward to reduce the playback speed of that part of the clip.

![use filmora speed ramping slow down video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-filmora-speed-ramping-slow-down-video.jpg)

**Step 3: Freeze the Video**

Place the skimmer on the frame where you want to freeze the video for a while, and click **Add Freeze Frame** from the left of the Speed Ramping window. When the time box appears, in the Freeze Time field, enter the duration in seconds you want to freeze the screen for, and click **OK**.

![add freeze frame speed ramping filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-freeze-frame-speed-ramping-filmora.jpg)

After adding a freeze point, optionally, you can drag and reposition it in the **Speed Ramping** timeline as needed. Finally, click **OK** from the bottom-right area to save the changes.

## Part 3: When to Use Slow Motion?

There could be many instances when you want to add a slow-motion effect to your videos. Some of the most common ones include:

* **Add Focus**

If there is a particular scene in a clip that you want the audience to focus on, it would be a good idea to add the slow-motion effect right before that action appears on the screen, and bring the speed back to normal when the section is over.

* **Skill or Style Demonstration**

When a clip is playing at a normal speed, many times, the audience isn’t able to see the skills that you want to display. This is where you may want to add the slow-motion effect so that every detail can be noticed clearly and in detail.

* **Replays**

Mostly used for tournaments and matches where the actual action is to replayed so the audience, umpires, and other viewers can see the movements in detail before making the right decision.

* **Observation**

Some natural phenomena such as a deer running in the woods, a balloon full of water bursting, etc. occur quite quickly. If you want to witness such things clearly and in detail, it would be good to record them, and then reduce the playback speed for better viewing.

* **Add Suspense**

When you add the slow-motion effect to a scene, the impulse of the audience is automatically increased, and they take that particular section more seriously and with a thrill.

**Conclusion**

The slow-motion effect is inversely proportional to the framerate, i.e., frames per second or FPS. Almost all DSLR cameras that are available nowadays allow you to switch between different FPS values (typically 120 and 240) before recording. Also, if you have access to an iPhone, its Camera app has a built-in SLO-MO mode that can capture the footage in slow motion.

In addition, if you already have a video that has been recorded at a normal speed, you can use an efficient post-production software like Wondershare Filmora 11, and exploit its Speed Ramping feature to add the slow-motion effect at different scenes of a clip.

## Part 1: How to Make Slow Motion Videos via Recording?

The fact is, the playback speed of a video is inversely proportional to the [frames per second](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) (FPS) it has been recorded in. Usually, to have a video play at normal speed, it is recorded at 24 FPS or 30 FPS. On the other hand, if you increase the frame rate (FPS) to 120 or 240, the playback speed slows down. You can easily check this if you have access to a DSLR camera or an iPhone. These devices allow you to adjust the FPS so the videos can be recorded in slow motion.

For your convenience and learning, the step-by-step procedure on how to record a video in slow motion using an iPhone is explained below:

**Step 1: Get to the SLO-MO Mode**

Launch the **Camera** app on your iPhone (iPhone 13 Pro Max is used here for illustrations), and swipe the screen to the left to get to the **SLO-MO** mode.

![iphone slow motion capture mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-slow-motion-capture-mode.jpg)

**Step 2: Adjust Recording Preferences**

Tap the number at the top-right corner to switch between **120** FPS and **240** FPS as needed. Tap **1x** from the lower-middle section of the screen, and use the rotator to adjust your preferred zoom level.

Speed Ramping enables you to add the slow-motion effect at different parts of a video and even freeze the screen for the duration that you specify. The processes to get these done are given below in detail:

**Step 1: Add Source Video to Timeline and Get to the Speed Ramping Window**

Use the process given in the previous method to import a source video to Wondershare Filmora 11 and add it to the Timeline. Then use the process given in the second step of the previous method to get to the **Speed Ramping** window.

**Step 2: Add Slow Motion Effect to Different Parts of the Clip**

Go to the **Speed Ramping** tab if it is not already selected, click **Custom** from the available options, and drag the adjustment points below the center line to reduce the playback speed for that particular section of the clip. Optionally, you can click any of the available presets to automatically add the slow-motion effect to the video.

Note: You can also drag the adjustment points above the line to increase the playback speed.

To add an adjustment point on the frame where it is not already present, place the playhead (skimmer) at the correct position, and click **Add Adjust Point** from the left of the **Speed Ramping** window itself. Once added, you can drag it downward to reduce the playback speed of that part of the clip.

![use filmora speed ramping slow down video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-filmora-speed-ramping-slow-down-video.jpg)

**Step 3: Freeze the Video**

Place the skimmer on the frame where you want to freeze the video for a while, and click **Add Freeze Frame** from the left of the Speed Ramping window. When the time box appears, in the Freeze Time field, enter the duration in seconds you want to freeze the screen for, and click **OK**.

![add freeze frame speed ramping filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-freeze-frame-speed-ramping-filmora.jpg)

After adding a freeze point, optionally, you can drag and reposition it in the **Speed Ramping** timeline as needed. Finally, click **OK** from the bottom-right area to save the changes.

## Part 3: When to Use Slow Motion?

There could be many instances when you want to add a slow-motion effect to your videos. Some of the most common ones include:

* **Add Focus**

If there is a particular scene in a clip that you want the audience to focus on, it would be a good idea to add the slow-motion effect right before that action appears on the screen, and bring the speed back to normal when the section is over.

* **Skill or Style Demonstration**

When a clip is playing at a normal speed, many times, the audience isn’t able to see the skills that you want to display. This is where you may want to add the slow-motion effect so that every detail can be noticed clearly and in detail.

* **Replays**

Mostly used for tournaments and matches where the actual action is to replayed so the audience, umpires, and other viewers can see the movements in detail before making the right decision.

* **Observation**

Some natural phenomena such as a deer running in the woods, a balloon full of water bursting, etc. occur quite quickly. If you want to witness such things clearly and in detail, it would be good to record them, and then reduce the playback speed for better viewing.

* **Add Suspense**

When you add the slow-motion effect to a scene, the impulse of the audience is automatically increased, and they take that particular section more seriously and with a thrill.

**Conclusion**

The slow-motion effect is inversely proportional to the framerate, i.e., frames per second or FPS. Almost all DSLR cameras that are available nowadays allow you to switch between different FPS values (typically 120 and 240) before recording. Also, if you have access to an iPhone, its Camera app has a built-in SLO-MO mode that can capture the footage in slow motion.

In addition, if you already have a video that has been recorded at a normal speed, you can use an efficient post-production software like Wondershare Filmora 11, and exploit its Speed Ramping feature to add the slow-motion effect at different scenes of a clip.
