![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-2.jpg)

1. **Edit and perform desired modifications (Optional)**

If you are just looking to resize the FLV video file, then you can skip this step and move to step no. 4\. Otherwise, you can do various editings on the video like cropping, muting, trimming, animating, etc. before resizing the video. Filmora provides a wide range of features for editing and adding effects to the video.

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-3.jpg)

1. **Resize the video by changing the aspect ratio**

Aspect ratio defines the shape of your video like if you want the video to be horizontal, vertical, square, or custom. Generally, the term ‘**resizing video**’ refers to changing the aspect ratio of the video. For that, go to the **_File_** and then to the **_Project Settings_**_._ Then on the Aspect Ratio box, select the one that you prefer or you can try custom scaling. You can choose your preferred resolution of the project too while you’re at it.

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-4.jpg)

1. **Resize the video by cropping**

When you change the aspect ratio of the project, some parts of your flv video might not fit or it might be shrunk small to fit. So you need to resize the flv video by cropping so that you can crop and focus on the part of the video you like. To crop the video, select the flv video clip in the timeline and click on the crop icon in the timeline toolbar. Now choose the ratio you want to crop and select the part you’d like to keep. Then click OK and your flv video will be resized.

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-5.jpg)

1. **Adjust the file size of the video through export settings**

After you’ve cropped and resized the Flv video, you need to export it by clicking the **_Export_** button on the top center part. There are different settings available for exporting the video. Click on the **_Settings_** button near the resolution and you’ll be shown some detailed preferences for exporting. Every setting here like frame rate, resolution, bitrate, etc. can affect the size of the output video.

## **2 Ways to Resize FLV Videos on Android**

Wouldn’t it be great if you could resize FLV videos on your android device rather than having to open your computer for every small task? Previously, this was a major issue due to a lack of good video editors for android with flv support but that’s no longer the case. Below are two ways to resize FLV videos on android:

1. **Inshot**

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-31.jpg)

InShot is a powerful all-in-one video editor for android which acts both as a basic video editor as well as an advanced video editor with its simple design yet powerful features. There aren’t many video editors in Android that supports Flv or some older codecs, but InShot is one of the very few editors that support these video formats. It is a paid app but also has a limited free version to try.

**Steps to resize FLV videos on Android with InShot:**

* Open the Inshot app on your android device and click on **Video**.

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-32.jpg)

* Now select the FLV video file and click on the tick icon near the bottom right.

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-33.jpg)

* Then tap on the **Crop** option from the tools at the bottom.

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-34.jpg)

* Now select the aspect ratio you like and crop accordingly.

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-35.jpg)

* To save the video, tap on the **Save** button at the top right. Then choose the resolution and finally save the video to your device.

AndroVid is an easy-to-use, full-featured video editor especially developed to edit videos for social media like YouTube, TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, etc. It is not a very popular application with just over 300k+ downloads in Google Play Store, but after testing it out, we thought it deserves to be in this article. It is available for free to download from Google Play Store.

**Steps to resize FLV videos on Android with AndroVid Video Editor:**

![resize flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/resize-flv-41.jpg)
