Now it's time to select the audio mode.

##### Step6Select the audio mode

The audio mixer of Filmora provides you with two audio mode options. These are;

● **Stereo Mode**

In the Stereo mode, you can pan from left to right and control your audio just like the knob of the audio channel.

● **Surround Mode**

You can pan from left to right and front to back in this mode by rotating the video or music icons. This provides you with complete control over the audio positions. But remember that this mode works best if your video is played with the surround sound system.

**Step 3: Export as GIF**

Click on the Export button to open up the Export dialog box. From here, you can choose how you want your file exported from a number of options including GIF under the Formats tab. Under the Video tab, select the video quality settings that best suit your requirements. You can also set the frame rate and resolution for your GIF image file at this point. Once you are done, click on Save to specify a location for your file as well as a name for it.

![export mov to gif in wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mov-to-gif-converters-11.jpg)
