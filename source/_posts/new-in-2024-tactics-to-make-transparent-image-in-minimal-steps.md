Adjust the starting point for this layer to frame five from the beginning, and move the file to that starting point. In the end, cut the title length at the same position as layer one was, at 3.15 seconds.

Follow the process explained in the previous section for the first letter, i.e., moving the playhead at specific frames and changing the Y-axis and Rotation value multiple times.

After editing the second letter in the title, repeat the process of holding and dragging the default title to Track 3 in the timeline and adjusting starting position at the 10th frame. Again, follow the process of animating the letter like for Letter 1 and Letter 2\. Continue doing this process for multiple more letters in your title text.

Tap on the Play button under the Preview screen to see how the letters have the falling text effect.

## Add Screenshot

Next, you have to click on the hide button for Tracks 2 and up. Tap on the Snapshot icon in the editing timeline of the first letter. Then, when it appears in the library window, click on it and move it beside the Track 1 Title file that you were editing. Move the play head to the 1-second position of this file in the timeline.

Hide Track 1 again and click the Unhide button on Track 2\. Repeat the snapshot function and add it to Layer 2\. Adjust the end as per Track 1\. After this, follow these steps for the subsequent letters as well.

## Adjust Keyframing

Follow the animation process for all of the title clips and screenshots you did before. Move the play head to the point where the Tracks end and the Screenshots on the timeline start. Choose the first letter and click on the Keyframe icon in the editing window under Animation. Then, make adjustments to the values of Position, Rotation, etc.

Continue this keyframing step for all of the letters in sequence. After you are done here, click on the Render Preview icon on the right-hand side of the toolbar above the editing timeline. See how the falling text effects line up.

![click on the render preview icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-falling-text-effect-in-filmora-9.gif)
