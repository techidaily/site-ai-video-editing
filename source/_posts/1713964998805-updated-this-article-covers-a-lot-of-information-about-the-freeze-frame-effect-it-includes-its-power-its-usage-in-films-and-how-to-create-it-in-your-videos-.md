_Are you considering getting your video editing skills to a new high level? Are you worried about spicing your videos with stylish shots and bringing attention to particular aspects of your video?_

Freeze frame sequence is one the most stunning effects that can help you greatly. The freeze frame sequence has been used in many classic and present-day movies. And it will never go out of fashion.

Here, we will guide you on creating freeze frame sequences in your videos using Filmora. It is critical here to know what exactly the freeze frame sequence is. So let's jump right into it!

## Part 1\. What Is A Freeze Frame?

A freeze frame is a specific single frame of the video clip shown repeatedly in the video. It gives the illusion of a static picture. It is used to draw the viewers' attention to the minute details of a specific moment, to set up a powerful narrative, or to introduce your main characters.

![freeze frame effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-1.jpg)

Content creators can also use the freeze-frame effect on fast-moving objects to draw the viewers' attention. Have a few examples of the most popular freeze frames used in the movies.

### Examples of freeze frames in popular movies

Alfred Hitchcock used the first-ever freeze-frame in his film Champagne (1928). There is a long list of many famous tv shows and movies in which the freeze frame effect has been used since then. But to count a few, three examples are given here.

**1\. Pulp Fiction (1994)**

In the beginning scene of Pulp Fiction, where robbery is about to occur, a freeze-frame effect is used to engage the audience. Later in the movie, it was relieved what would happen next. It was a dramatic pause to draw attention. It is a strong example of the freeze-frame effect.

![pulp fiction's freeze frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-2.png)

**2\. The Breakfast Club (1985)**

The ending of Breakfast Club is an iconic example of the freeze-frame effect. With a powerful narration, the freeze frame conveys the movie's central idea to the audience.

![the breakfast club's freeze frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-3.png)

**3\. Suicide Squad (2016)**

In the trailer of Suicide Squad, freeze frames were used by the director to introduce the characters. This trailer used stylish animations to give relevant information about the film's main characters.

![suicide squad's freeze frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-4.png)

Having discussed the famous examples, let's learn about the power of freeze frames.

### The power of freeze frame

The old freeze frames give a retro vibe. However, with the advancement in editing technology, this special effect has proved that there is no end. Furthermore, it has shown that you can do many things with pauses.

Especially when you are a content creator, this effect empowers you by advertising your skills impressively. It also conveys your message convincingly.

Being a content creator, you always want to reach the maximum audience. This special effect will serve this too. It will ultimately get you more viewership, more likes, and more subscriptions. But how to create a freeze frame?

## Part 2\. How To Create Freeze Frame Sequence? \[Step-Wise Guide\]

Let's see how to add a freeze frame sequence in your video step-wise and get started.

##### Step1 Download Wondershare Filmora

Wondershare Filmora is an all-in-one video editing platform. It is enhanced with multiple practical media resources. You can head to [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) official site to download or upgrade your Filmora.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

##### Step2 Import your clips and add them to the timeline

Open Filmora and create a new project. Import your clip into the media library. Add your clips to the first video layer on the timeline.

![import your video clip and add it to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-6.png)

##### Step3 Apply color correction to the footage

Before we start our edit, let's color correct our footage, so the corrected color is already applied when we take the screenshots.

![apply color correction to your clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-7.jpg)

##### Step4 Find your first action frame

Next, scrub through the clip to find your first action frame. **For example,** in this video, this is our first action frame.

![select the first action frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-8.png)

##### Step5 Take a screenshot of the action frame

Let's head to the camera icon under the preview screen and click the icon. It will take a screenshot of the current frame that the playhead is on the timeline.

![take a screenshot of the action frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-9.gif)

Make sure to keep the playhead the same after you've taken the snapshot. You can find your screenshot in the media tab.

##### Step6 Add the screenshot to timeline

Let's drag your screenshot onto video layer 2 and align it on the right side of the playhead. Then extend the screenshot so it lasts as long as your central clip.

![extend the screenshot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-10.png)

##### Step7 Apply masks to the screenshot

Now, double-click on the screenshot. It will open the "Video" menu, then go into the "Mask" menu. Choose a mask shape and edit it so that it only covers where your subject is in the screenshot. **For example,** we choose the **"**Circle" mask shape in this video.

![choose your mask shape](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-11.png)

If you need help seeing what you're masking, hide the main video layer and edit your mask like this.

![hide the main video layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-12.gif)

Move the playhead forward and clean up your "mask." Next, Increase the blur to soften the edges. But not too much because it may become visible on your subject.

![editing of the mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-13.png)

##### Step8 Hide the first screenshot

Let's layer a couple more action frames! First, hide the first screenshot so it doesn't appear in your new screenshot.

![hide the first screenshot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-14.png)

##### Step9 Select your second action frame

Then, pick a new frame.

![select a new frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-15.png)

* Click the camera icon.
* Drag the screenshot at the new playhead spot.
* Extend the clip.

![repeat the steps](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-16.png)

* Double-click to mask this frame.
* And play it back to make sure it looks good.
* It would help if you did this a couple more times until you have several frames.

Please have a look at the final product and how it looks!

![sreeze frame sequence](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-17.png)

And that's how you create a freeze-frame video effect in Filmora.

## Part 3\. Tips To Use Freeze Frame Sequence

You've known how to make the freeze frame sequence. However, don't miss essential tips to improve your video at the next stage.

### Tip 1: Making a steady shot is important

First, ensure **a steady shot with no camera shake** while filming. You can use a tripod or a stable surface to keep your camera still.

![keep your camera still](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-18.png)

**Why is it necessary to make a steady shot?**

* It helps you to make smooth, fluid shots.
* It is much more professional.
* It will take your editing skills to a new level.
* It grabs the attention of the viewers.
* It makes your editing easier.

### Tip 2: No crossing over

Make sure **your subject only crosses the same spot once**. Otherwise, you would need help editing the video.

![crossing over should be avoided](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-19.gif)

## The Most Complete Guide to Make Fortnite Montage

If you're skilled at playing Fortnite, you'll probably want to share your gameplay clips as montages with other players. The popularity of Fortnite montage videos is rapidly growing because millions of people play the game. Tons of people also like watching their peers play this online video game in the form of gaming montages. We'll explain how to make a montage Fortnite that will get views when you upload it on social media platforms.

## What Is Fortnite?

Fortnite is a popular online game developed by the American game studio Epic Games. The video game was released in 2017, and it's available in three-game mode versions with the same game engine and gameplay. These are:

* Fortnite: Save the World: Set on contemporary Earth, Save the World is a co-op hybrid third-person shooter (TPS), tower defense (TD), and survival game. The game allows a maximum of four players to fight off creatures that look like zombies and defend objects with traps or fortifications they have built.
* Fortnite Battle Royale: This is a free-to-play (F2P) battle royale video game that allows up to one hundred players to fight against each other until only one person remains.
* Fortnite Creative: Released in 2018, Fortnite Creative allows players to create battle arenas and worlds. They can then share these predetermined structures with up to 16 other players for a range of multiplayer game modes that have customizable rules.

Since its release, Fortnite has become a worldwide phenomenon, with more than 350 million people playing the game across the globe. In the first year of Fortnite's release, players downloaded its mobile version 78 million times.

The game became such a global hit because it's free to play. It's also available on most gaming platforms and features an engaging theme. Additionally, because Battle Royale allows up to 100 gamers to fight it out until they find the last man standing, this means the replayability of this online video game is infinite. What's more? Each game is unique.

Fortnite has also become popular because users can purchase DLC (downloadable content) to enhance their gaming experience.

## Things to Prepare before making a Fortnite Montage video

You have to prepare several things if you want to make an epic Fortnite montage video that will keep your audience watching. These include:

### 1\. Fortnite Gaming Clips

Epic Games developed a system that allows you to save your best gameplay performances. You can then export the Fortnite replays that you have saved.

To save the beautiful moments of the game, you have to know where to find the Replays videos; this is how to find them:

1. Head over to Career and select the Replays option. You'll see all the replay clips, including their date, finish, and length.

Get Fortnite Video Clip

1. Select the clips and watch them so that you can choose the ones you want to use in your Fortnite montage video.

### 2\. Pick the Right Background Music

To make your Fortnite montage video engaging, you'll need to choose background music that fits your montage videos. Music is one of the key elements in creating an exhilarating viewing experience for your audience.

Make sure you pick royalty-free music that fits the genre of your Fortnite montage video. Choose a song that expresses the themes and personality of the game.

You cannot use your favorite song from the radio, as your copyright law prohibits people from using the work of others without permission or paying a royalty.

If you are caught using copyrighted music, you might have to pay the music owner monetary damages. You can also go to jail because of copyright infringement.

There are loads of platforms that offer non-copyrighted music that you can use in your montage Fortnite. These include YouTube, Twitch, and Pixabay.

## In This Article, We Will Be Discussing How to Crop a Video on Android, but Since Most Android Devices Don’t Have This Option, You Will Need to Do It Externally, by Downloading and Using Different Apps

Nowadays, we can use our mobile phones to create almost anything – they have become an indivisible part of our lives. Most of the people check their mobile phones every 2 minutes – did they receive a new message?

What about different kinds of notifications – reactions on social network, or the ones which inform us about breaking news, or, to-do lists? People are well-connected to Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and sometimes, we just want to update our accounts with just photos or new videos we took on the go. Sometimes, we have a perfect footage we took with our Android, but we have no idea, or just no time to edit our stunning video clips on the computer.

Yes, changing or adjusting a video shouldn’t be that hard – you shouldn’t be obligated to turn to Adobe Premiere Pro or other “heavy” software in order to have a video to your whole liking. Therefore, we have mobile applications just for editing our videos, in a simple, and fast way (thank you, mobile developers!).

In this article, we will be discussing how to crop a video on Android, but since most android devices don’t have this option, you will need to do it externally, by downloading and using different apps. So, more concretely, we will touch upon how to crop our video clips using following apps: Google Photos, Clideo, and Filmora.

## Using Google Photos

In case you have Android, the Google Photos app will be there – it’s free and in most cases, already installed and ready to serve you. If you can’t find Google Photos, just find it and download it from the Google Play Store.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-1.jpeg)

First off, you just open the application and allow it to access photos and media on your device. Tap the video you would like to crop. Then, click on Edit: it will launch the in-app video editor.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-2.jpeg)

At the bottom, you will see the Crop option and hit on it, which will result in appearing a cropping box around your video clip.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-3.jpeg)

Once you see little icons at the bottom, you need to choose the first one – it’s the Ratio button, through which you can choose the aspect you would like to apply. Your choice is between these several aspect ratios: Free, Original, Square, 5:4, 16:9, 4:3, and 3:2.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-4.jpeg)

Choosing Free ratio option gives you the freedom to adjust the cropping sliders manually, in order to resize the video to any aspect ratio; it is even possible to rotate the clip, pinch, and zoom in/out.

After you are done with adjusting your video, you need to click on the Save Copy button, which will save a new edited version of your footage. And, meanwhile, don’t worry! – this will not be overwritten on the original one, which will still stand intact.

## Using Clideo

Clideo is an interesting one… it doesn’t require you to download anything, because there is a way to crop your video online, through the web browser on Android.

First off, you need to click on [Clideo’s Android crop video tool](https://clideo.com/crop-video) from the browser on the smartphone. You will see a Choose File button and hit on it – this will take you to your gallery and let you find the clip you are about to crop.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-5.jpeg)

You can also upload your file from Cloud Storage. You need to click on the down-arrow on the right-hand side of the button and you’ll find the option to add a clip from your Dropbox or Google Drive account.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-6.jpeg)

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-7.jpeg)

After your file is uploaded, Clideo will take you to the editing page, where you can select the area you would like to be in the edited version, and crop the video. Here, you will be able to choose the aspect ratio, exact size of the video and the format.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-8.jpeg)

Once you have finished with the cropping and settings, you need to click on Export which will process your edited video clip.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-9.jpeg)

Once it is done, you proceed on the page which lets you do 3 things: Remove watermark (for it, though, you will have to sign in), Edit again, or/and Download!

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-10.jpeg)

## Using Filmora

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-14.jpeg)

So, you choose Trim, then find Crop and hit that, and then you are free to choose any aspect ratio: 1:1; 4:5; 16:9; 9:16; and 5:4\. You can crop the video manually, too, and you are able to adjust where your new “screen” might be wanted most.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-15.jpeg)

## 4 Solutions to Resize a WebM File

People resize videos for many reasons, the most common one being to reduce file size. Others might be to meet a specification, or for compatibility. When you resize a video file, you reduce its file size considerably- making it load faster on devices, reduce processing time, and save a lot of space. Most people prefer watching videos that are smaller in size compared to larger ones, that’s why some social media sites like Instagram, Tiktok, etc have preferred video resolutions, so if you are a user on these sites you might want to resize your video to fit.

The biggest concern most people have about resizing videos is whether it will retain its quality, another concern is that you don’t want to crop out your video while resizing. If the format of the video is mp4, wmv, avi, etc which usually have very large size, resizing it might be a bit of a problem because the video quality will reduce a lot, but if it’s a WebM video file, you can still achieve a good video quality even after multiple compression or changing its resolution, that’s because its codecs- VP8 and VP9 were designed specifically for that, and it’s supported by all browsers.

In the course of this article, we’re assuming you already have a WebM video and you want to resize it, and still maintain its quality so you can upload on your favourite websites without any hassles. We have handpicked some proven methods to help you with that, let’s see them:

## Method 1: Resize WebM file with Wondershare Filmora

For video resizing, Filmora offers you a couple of options: First you have an option of changing the resolution just before you export your video; you also have the option of cropping your videos to your preferred size and cutting out redundant parts of your videos to save space; but the third option is what we’ll show you in this guide, because we imagine you already have your video exported and you just want to resize. You can easily do that by changing the aspect ratio and we’ll show you in a few steps:

For macOS 10.14 or later

**Step 1**: Go to the official Wondershare Filmora website and download the software.

**Step 2**: Install Wondershare Filmora on your PC and double click to launch.

![resize-webm](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/resize-webm-1.png)

Select your preferred aspect ratio from the list of options- 16:9 (widescreen), 4:3 (standard), 1:1 (Instagram), 9:16 (portrait). For example, if you import a 16:9 video file into Filmora, and set it to 1:1 aspect ratio then, the final output file will be 1:1, which is the perfect aspect ratio for Instagram posts.

You’ll see below that I selected 1:1 for instagram. After you are done selecting your preferred aspect ratio, hit ‘New Project’.

## Method 2: How to resize WebM file with VLC

VLC is a free and open source multimedia player. It is arguably the best media player out there and that’s for a reason- it can play almost everything without the need for any external codecs.

The playback feature is amazing but that’s not the only thing it can do. VLC outshines most other media players because of some extra features it possesses. It resizes and converts media files, downloads and adds subtitles, records screen, as well as is customizable in settings and expandable via plugins.

What we want to use in this guide is its media resizing feature, so let’s show you how you can use it in these steps:

**Step 1**: Download VLC Media player from the official VLC page and install it on your windows or Mac PC.

**Step 2**: Launch VLC after installing by double-clicking on the software.

**Step 3**: Click "Media" in the toolbar.

**Step 4**: Select "Convert / Save". You can also tap shortcut keys Ctrl + R to quickly open a new window.

**Step 5**: Click "Add". You can load one or more video files. Here, I'll choose a colour grading video on my desktop. You can see it has the extension ‘.webm’. After loading the video file you want to resize, click "Convert / Save" again.

**Step 6**: Choose your desired output profile type. With VLC, you can resize video to MP4, WebM, TS, and other formats.

**Step 8**: Click the settings icon to access the settings window and select the video codec where you can adjust parameters like frame rate, bitrate, resolution, etc to change video file size. I changed the frame rate of my video to 30fps which is ideal for high quality videos. Also click the resolution tab and set your desired resolution then click save.
