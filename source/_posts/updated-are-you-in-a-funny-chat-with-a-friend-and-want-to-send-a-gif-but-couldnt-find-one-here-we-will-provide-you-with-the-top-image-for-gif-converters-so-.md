## Boost the Pace of Your Instagram Reels Videos with These Simple Tricks

Undoubtedly, every social media video creator loves to make use of Instagram Reels for their widespread popularity. If you want to grab your audience's attention and keep them engaged with your videos, then Instagram Reels should be your destination. On this platform, you can only make short videos maxing out the 90-second time limit. But what if your video content is lengthy? Don't fret. One simple trick is to speed up the pace of your videos.

![instagram reels](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/how-to-speed-up-video-on-instagram-reels-01.jpg)

There are two scenarios regarding how to increase the speed of the video in Reels. You can speed up the video when recording directly on the Instagram app, or use a third-party editing tool if it is a pre-recorded video. We will illustrate below how to speed up video on Instagram Reels for both scenarios.

## Part I. Basic Understanding of Instagram Reels

1. **What are Instagram Reels?**

Instagram Reels are short-duration, vertically-oriented videos that are displayed in the dedicated reels tab on the Instagram app. You can compare Instagram Reels with TikTok videos. The maximum duration of Instagram Reels can be of 90 seconds.

Instagram displays the popular Reels on Explore tab so that the Instagram Reels creators get more exposure. Since short-duration videos and apps are in trend, Instagram Reels has become the most popular section on the Instagram app.

Reels can be entertaining videos with popular songs in the background. They can be funny videos as well as gripping slow-motion videos. Brands promote their products and services through Reels. You can add stunning AR effects and change the speed of the video while recording Reels through the Instagram app.

1. **Why Should You Make Instagram Reels?**

Instagram Reels have been a game-changer in the social media world. From regular video creators and social media influencers to brands and businesses, Instagram Reels has become everyone's real deal. Here are the reasons why you should make Instagram Reels:

**Reach** \- The primary reason for making Instagram Reels is to reach out to the target audiences and get more followers. If your videos become popular, your Instagram Reels can get featured in the Explore tab. Once it does happen, there will be an exponential rise in views and followers. Besides, Instagram Reels have better reach to your followers than regular Instagram posts.

**Engagement** \- The world has moved on from photos to videos. People love to check out short videos rather than still images. So naturally, when you start making Instagram reels, your followers' engagement will increase dramatically. With more engagement, your Reels will get more exposure as people will love to share them with their friends. Of course, the content has to be top-notch so that people start to pay attention to your Reels.

![social media engagement](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/how-to-speed-up-video-on-instagram-reels-02.jpg)

**Showcase Personality** \- Instagram Reels are the best way to showcase your personality on social media. Personality is the magical key that attracts followers on social media platforms. You can create different genres of videos and showcase your talent and personality to get noticed.

**Brand Promotion** \- Brands and businesses use Instagram Reels to promote their products and services. They come up with creative Reels that audiences cannot ignore. Even social media influencers promote brands through Instagram Reels these days. It is a great way to make the target audiences aware of the products and services and build a strong brand image.

## Part II. Speed Up Video on Instagram Reels

However, if you are already recorded a video for Instagram Reels, you can jump to the next part to find out the best way to speed up existing videos for Reels. Here, you will illustrate how to speed up video on Instagram Reels directly on the Instagram app without needing any third-party app.

## Part III. Speed Up Existing Videos for Reels

When you have already recorded the video for Reels, you need to use a third-party tool to change the video speed. Depending on the device you are going to use to edit the speed of your video, you have to select an appropriate video editing application. We have handpicked the best applications to change Instagram Reels video speed for computers, smartphones as well as online users.

1. **Speed Up Video for Instagram Reels on PC**

A professional video creator always prefers a computer to edit videos minutely. This is because a computer's dedicated video editor has far more editing options than a video editor app or even an online video editor.

[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)is the best video editor to alter video speed precisely as you need.

Most importantly, Filmora is super easy to use despite being a professional video editing software.

**A Step-by-step Guide to speed up a video on Filmora**

Instead of choosing from the speed presets, using the Uniform Speed option is always handy to speed up your video. This is because speed presets are limited and may not be suitable for your video. That is why Uniform Speed is effective, as you can set any desired speed up to 100X.
