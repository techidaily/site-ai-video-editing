Step 3

Double-click on the Default Title once more and simply change the text color to anything other than black this time. Then, click **OK** and take another snapshot. After this, delete the Default Title from the Timeline.

Step 4

Next, go to **Sample Color** and drag the White color to the Timeline. Increase the White Color clip’s duration to 10 seconds by dragging the tail of the clip to the right.

![sample color filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/white.png)

Step 5

For the next step, you need to download a simple [Vignette png image](https://www.pngfind.com/mpng/ihbooTJ%5Feffect-gfx-png-black-vignette-png-transparent-png/). Then, import the Vignette image into Filmora. Go to **My Media** and click on **Import Media.** Import it and drag the image to the Timeline. Then, move that clip to Track 3.

![vignette png](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vignette.png)

Step 6

Drop the **Black** snapshot you took earlier to Track 2\. Double-click on it, go to **Animation**, and apply these settings. After this, move the Playhead to the end of the clip and change the **X-axis** value to “**\-800**”.

![snapshot settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/black.png)

Step 7

Go to **Effects** and drag the **Square Blur** effect to Track 4 on the Timeline. Increase its duration to match the other clips. Then, click on the effect and change its **Size** bar value to 4\. Click **OK.**

![add effect filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/effect.png)

Step 8

Place the Playhead at the beginning of the clip. Go to **My Media** and drag the Black snapshot to Track 5\. Double-click on it → go to **Animation** and change the settings to look like this. Then, move the Playhead to 9 seconds. Here, change the **X-axis** to “**150”** and the **Scale** to **75%.**

![edit snapshot in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/black-snapshot.png)

Step 9

Now, place the Playhead at the starting point and drag the colored snapshot in Track 6\. Double-click on it and change the **Scale** to **50%**. Then, move the Playhead to 9 seconds again and change the **Scale** to **75%.** Click **OK.**

Step 10

Go to **Sample Color** and drag “Gradient 4” to Track 7 on the Timeline. Double-click on it → go to the **Video** tab → change the Blending Mode to **Overlay** → decrease the Opacity to **25%.** Click **OK.**

![gradient sample color](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/gradient.png)

Step 11

Drag a Default Title to Track 8 and double-click on it to open its Advanced settings. From here, delete the yellow text clip located under the video. Then, insert a Line shape.

![insert line shape](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/line.png)

Step 12

Increase the Line’s length to be almost as long as the screen. Then adjust its position until half of the Line is visible on the screen. Like this.

![edit shape in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/edit-line.png)

Step 13

Copy this Default Title and paste it into Track 9\. Open its Advanced settings and change the Line color to something different than the previous one. Then, move it to the other side of the screen, slightly above the previous line. Click **OK.**

![add line shapes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/lines.png)

Step 14

Now, select the Default Title on Track 9, double-click it, and go to the **Animation** tab. Move the Playhead at the starting point of the Timeline and add a keyframe. Then, move the Playhead to the end of the clip. Drag the **X-axis** position to the right until the Line shape moves all the way to the right side of the screen.

Do the same for the Default Title on Track 8\. But this time, drag the **X-axis** position toward the other side. When you’re done, press **OK.**

![animate shapes filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/line-move.png)

## Master Premiere Pro: Custom Sequence Presets

You've probably heard of Adobe Premiere Pro – it's a top-tier video editing software that's widely recognized in the market. But have you delved into the nitty-gritty of sequence presets? A custom sequence preset is your best friend for maintaining consistency across projects.

It allows users to save specific settings for sequence attributes like frame rate, resolution, and audio settings. Instead of reconfiguring these settings for each new project, a custom sequence preset lets you jump right into editing. Now, how do you create one? Keep reading!

## Part 1: How to Create a Custom Sequence in Premiere Pro

Creating a custom sequence is like tailoring a shirt to fit you perfectly. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you do just that:

### Step 1: Displays the New Sequence Window

Begin by launching Adobe Premiere Pro. Once opened, navigate to the top menu and select **_File_ \> _New_ \> _Sequence_**. This will open up the New Sequence window, where all the magic happens!

### Step 2: Change the Editing Mode to Custom in the Settings Panel

You'll see several tabs in the New Sequence window, but we will focus on the **"Settings"** tab for our purposes. Click on it.

Here, you'll find the **'Editing Mode'** dropdown menu. By default, it's set to a specific format like **'DSLR'** or **'AVCHD**.' Change this to 'Custom.' This will unlock a plethora of options for you to play with.

**Deep Dive into Settings:**

1. **Frame Size:** Define your video’s width and height. Remember, 1920x1080 is Full HD, and 3840x2160 is 4K. Choose based on your project needs.
2. **Frame Rate:** 24fps is the cinematic standard, but if you're creating content for TV or web, 30fps or 60fps might be more suitable.
3. **Pixel Aspect Ratio:** Stick with **'Square Pixels'** unless you have a specific reason to do otherwise.
4. **Fields:** Choose 'No Fields' for progressive footage. If you're unsure, this is a safe bet.
5. **Audio Settings:** Here, you can configure the sample rate, among other things. 48000Hz is standard for video.

### Step 3: Give the New Preset a Name and Save It

Once you've customized the settings to your satisfaction, it's time to save this configuration for future use. At the bottom of the New Sequence window, you’ll see a **'Save Preset'** button. Click on it.

A pop-up window will show up, requesting you to provide a name for your new preset. Choose something descriptive so you can easily recognize it later. Once named, click **'OK'**.

Your custom sequence preset is now saved and will appear under the **'Custom'** folder in the **'Sequence Presets'** tab.

## Part 2: Why Custom Sequence Presets are Essential for Efficient Editing

As you delve deeper into video editing, you'll begin to appreciate the little things that shave off minutes from your workflow, allowing you to dedicate more time to the creative process. This is precisely where the utility of custom sequence presets in Premiere Pro comes into play. But why are these presets so crucial?

* **Consistency Across Projects:** If you’re managing multiple projects or a series of videos, having a standard format ensures that all your content has a uniform look and feel. Consistency is a hallmark of professional-grade content. It's not just about the visuals – maintaining a uniform audio quality and format is equally significant. With a preset, you no longer need to remember the minutiae of each setting, ensuring consistency effortlessly.
* **Speed Up Your Workflow:** Every minute you spend adjusting the sequence settings is a minute less you have for cutting, color correcting, audio mixing, or adding those special effects that make your videos pop. Over time, those minutes can add up to hours. By using a custom sequence preset, you can jump straight into the creative part of editing without the preliminary setup.
* **Avoid Common Mistakes:** Have you ever rendered an entire project only to find that the frame rate was off or the audio was set to the wrong sample rate? These kinds of errors can occur when setting up a new sequence from scratch each time. By relying on a preset, you mitigate the risks of such oversights.
* **Personalized Templates for Different Platforms:** Different platforms may have varying preferred settings. For instance, the ideal video format for YouTube might differ from that of Instagram or TikTok. Instead of Googling these settings each time, you can have a custom sequence preset ready for each platform, ensuring your content is optimized wherever it's destined.
* **Ease of Collaboration:** If you're working as part of a team, having standard sequence presets ensures everyone is on the same page. This is particularly handy when multiple editors are working on different segments of the same project. With custom presets, you're not just aligning sequences but also visions.

Incorporating this practice into your editing routine might initially seem trivial, but its benefits compound with time.
