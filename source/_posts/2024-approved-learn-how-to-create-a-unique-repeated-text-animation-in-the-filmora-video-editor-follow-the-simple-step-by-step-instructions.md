## How to Make a DIY Vlog or Video

Personally, this is a fun way vlog the DIY vlog because you can make anything that is on your own knowledge, share to the public what they don‚Äôt know yet. You See and hear DIY everywhere, and you probably already know what it stands for ‚ÄúDo it Yourself‚Äù it‚Äôs a pretty straightforward video concept. DIY is about so many things, basically DIY means that you‚Äôre choosing to do that task or create those products yourself with no direct help from the experts. DIY is really about you seeking out the knowledge and developing the skills you need to do something that you would normally pay someone else to do for you. Personally, when I think about DIY video, my mind goes to home improvements, things like painting, crafting or how to videos.

* Plan your Video
* Write a script
* Make your Video short but full of information
* Edit and Personalize your video with Filmora

### Informative Content

A DIY video should be purely educational. Your audience will forgive your poor production values if they‚Äôre learning great information. Be sure your DIY video is full of meaty content that‚Äôs meaningful to the viewer. Think of advice, tips or recommendations, this type of video has an instructive and educational content that is both shareable and easy to retain. Information video are good for educating you audience about certain topics related to your video content.

![informative content](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/informative-content.jpg)

### Plan your video

Ask yourself first of what you are trying to accomplish by producing the video. Remember that video is a tool and that it can hurt your channel if you don‚Äôt take it seriously and come properly prepared. Get organized and take down note if you have to.

Understand your target audience you need to know who you‚Äôll be speaking to through your video content. Make sure that you really understand what you are doing, by this kind of video content is in need your expertise. You have to share to your audience what your knowledge and experience about your video topic. This is the time where its ok to make or create a script and to map out a storyboard to guide you.

![plan your video 01](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/plan-your-video-01.jpg)

![plan your video 02](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/plan-your-video-02.jpg)

### Write a script

Making a script in your video is one way guide for you not to rattle or messed up everything, for me DIY vlog is different from product reviews or unboxing vlog. You can either write a word-by-word script for the video or just the general topics you aim to cover in the video. Either way, the point is to have a reference note so you don‚Äôt accidentally forget to cover an essential topic when you begin filming the video. DIY vlogs need to plan and make scripting because this is a more on tutorial video and you don‚Äôt like to missed one instruction on your video that is why making a script is a must unless you already doing it over and over again. You don‚Äôt have to be perfect and you don‚Äôt have to memorize any script. You just have to be relatable and authentic, yet professional.

### Make You Video Short but full of information

Make your video short but demand more attentions to your viewers because modern viewers have short attention spans specially when they‚Äôre on social media and there is always another video to see. Just make sure to grab your viewers attention by creating a catching footage.

As long as you know well your topic then that‚Äôs good enough because it take some guts to get in front of the camera and be confident.

### Editing and Personalize your DIY Video

The last step is the process of editing and personalize your video content. There are a number of great video editing apps and programs out there, and with a quick internet search, you should be able to find one that meet your needs, skills level and budget. Editing is what really takes a video to the next level, use a powerful video editing software.
