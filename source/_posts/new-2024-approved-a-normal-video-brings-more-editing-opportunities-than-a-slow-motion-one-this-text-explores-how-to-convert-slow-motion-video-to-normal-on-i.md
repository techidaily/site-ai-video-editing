![select the material](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-02.png)

Step3 Drag and drop **Clip 1** onto the timeline and move the playhead to the last frame of the clip.

![drag-drop clip 1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-03.png)

Alt text: Paper rip effect.

Step4 Now right-click on **Clip 1** to open the menu and select **Add Freeze Frame**.

![selecting add freeze frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-04.png)

**Note:** If you have the latest version, Filmora will automatically set the OUT POINT on the timeline.

Step9 Then click **Export** and choose **Create Video**. Let's name it **freeze frame 1** and click on Export.

![selecting create a video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-010.png)
