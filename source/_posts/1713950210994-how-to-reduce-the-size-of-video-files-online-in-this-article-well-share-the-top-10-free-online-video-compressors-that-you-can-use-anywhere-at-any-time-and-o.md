This is an artificial experience, and it adds to the real environment. AR gained popularity in the fields of entertainment and video games.

You might think that AR (Augmented Reality) is the same as VR (Virtual Reality). They are not the same. When someone looks through a VR, everything, including the object's environment, is virtual or an illusion. When AR is used, the object is virtual, but the environment is real.

Anyone can get a free trial of the software for their Macs, but, to purchase directly from the Mac App Store it costs $299.99\.

But, one should not be alarmed when it comes to experience and knowledge in editing – even though Final Cut Pro seems so advanced with its powerful tools and the possibilities it contains, it is designed for easy use and can be used by amateurs as well as professionals.

The interface, which, when it comes to editing, is one of the most important aspects (if not the main one!), seems quite standard - an ordinary window configuration, sidebar with libraries, events, projects, collections… If you want to know more about the basics of Final Cut Pro, it would be helpful to watch a [beginner tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygBlgaT78mM), with the length of only 20 minutes, an introduction of the whole program.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-2.jpeg)

Anyway, the main topic of this article is about cropping – how to crop a video in Final Cut Pro?

Even though cropping is especially used when it comes to the images, it is extremely helpful in certain situations about the video clips, as well. So, let’s dive into each step of cropping in Final Cut Pro!

## Steps to crop a video in Final Cut Pro

After getting Final Cut Pro ready to work in and opening it, you need to start as always, as in any other software: Of course, choose Import Media.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-3.jpeg)

The software will ask your permission to access files in your computer, so, in order to import some, guess you have to click on OK.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-4.jpeg)

Then, it will let you choose your file – but not by opening the new window (as in most cases), rather, you can choose file within the software.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-5.jpeg)

Once you have your file(s) chosen, you need to find Import Selected button on the down and right.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-6.jpeg)

This will lead you towards the editor again, but if you try to drag and drop your file into the sequence, the program will not follow this simple order…

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-7.jpeg)

This is because what the window below reads and looks like – it offers you create a New Project first. So, you need to hit it.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-8.jpeg)

This will create the sequence where you can add the video you have already selected and imported from your media.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-9.jpeg)

Now, it’s time to find where the cropping option is. It’s quite simple – look at the icon below and a little left of the screen where your video clip shows, click on it and you will see three options: Transform, Crop, and Distort. Needless to say, you will choose crop in this case, even if other options sound quite interesting, too!

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-10.jpeg)

Choosing Crop also gives you three options: Trim, Crop, and Ken Burns. Stick with the Crop again!

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-11.jpeg)

You will notice the kind of rulers on the angles of the video clip – they are there so you can crop your footage manually, by holding and moving them with your cursor to your liking.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-12.jpeg)

Of course, if you direct your cursor in the middle of the cropped video, you can move the whole cropping window around it, so you can find the area where you intend to crop better.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-13.jpeg)

And when the selected area is ready, you need to click on Done button on the right top side of the screen. If you are not satisfied with the result, you can take the step back, by clicking on Reset button right next to Done and modify the area again.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-14.jpeg)

On the right side of the screen, you notice a window where Crop is also written. Alongside it, if you hover over the option with your mouse, you will see the word: Show. Clicking on it will let you crop the video from each side from there, too.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-15.jpeg)

There, you can “play around” with Left, Right, Top, and Bottom sides.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-16.jpeg)

In the process, if you are unsure or you want to compare the original video to the cropped version of it, keep in mind that you can uncheck the Crop button.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-17.jpeg)

Finally, when you feel the result is what you have imagined, you can proceed to saving your work. For it to be done, you need to now find an Export button top right of the whole editor, and then, choose Export File (or else, if that’s what you are willing to do).

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-18.jpeg)

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-19.jpeg)

The next step would be Export Settings. You will see a new window which has three sections: Info, Settings, and Roles. The most important one here would be considered Settings, where you choose your preferred Format, Video Codec, Resolution, Color Space, Audio Format, and Action.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-20.jpeg)

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-21.jpeg)

 When you click on Next, you then choose the Name of your project and the location where you want to save it exactly.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-22.jpeg)

Then you click on Save, and in a short amount of time, you have your new cropped video where you chose to save it! So, that’s it with cropping in the Final Cut Pro!

Choosing Crop also gives you three options: Trim, Crop, and Ken Burns. Stick with the Crop again!

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-11.jpeg)

There, you can “play around” with Left, Right, Top, and Bottom sides.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-16.jpeg)

In the process, if you are unsure or you want to compare the original video to the cropped version of it, keep in mind that you can uncheck the Crop button.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-17.jpeg)

Finally, when you feel the result is what you have imagined, you can proceed to saving your work. For it to be done, you need to now find an Export button top right of the whole editor, and then, choose Export File (or else, if that’s what you are willing to do).

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-18.jpeg)

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-19.jpeg)

The next step would be Export Settings. You will see a new window which has three sections: Info, Settings, and Roles. The most important one here would be considered Settings, where you choose your preferred Format, Video Codec, Resolution, Color Space, Audio Format, and Action.
