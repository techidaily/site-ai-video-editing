### 2\. Pick the Right Background Music

To make your Fortnite montage video engaging, you'll need to choose background music that fits your montage videos. Music is one of the key elements in creating an exhilarating viewing experience for your audience.

Make sure you pick royalty-free music that fits the genre of your Fortnite montage video. Choose a song that expresses the themes and personality of the game.

You cannot use your favorite song from the radio, as your copyright law prohibits people from using the work of others without permission or paying a royalty.

If you are caught using copyrighted music, you might have to pay the music owner monetary damages. You can also go to jail because of copyright infringement.

There are loads of platforms that offer non-copyrighted music that you can use in your montage Fortnite. These include YouTube, Twitch, and Pixabay.

### 3\. Choose the Correct Video Editing Software

Now that you have downloaded all the Fortnite video clips and saved them on your computer, you need to choose the correct video editing software. Here are three of the most reliable programs that you can use to make a montage Fortnite video.
