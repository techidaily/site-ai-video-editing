## Step-by-Step on how to rotate videos in Blender

The first way to rotate a video in Blender is by using the Strip option.

Step 1: To do this, open the video that you want to rotate in Blender.

![rotate-video-blender](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-blender-1.png)

Step 2: Then, click on the "Strip" menu and select "Transform."

![rotate-video-blender](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-blender-2.png)

Step 3: In the Transform Properties window, you will see a list of different tools for the video. Scroll down until you see the "Rotation" property. This is where you can manually rotate the video.

![rotate-video-blender](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-blender-3.png)

Step 4: Click on Enter to save the rotation of the video.

The second way to rotate a video in Blender is by using the Transform Properties window. To do this...

Step 1: Open the video that you want to rotate in Blender.

![rotate-video-blender](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-blender-4.png)

Step 2: Next, go to ‘Transform’ in the Active Tool portion of the screen.

Step 4: Click on ‘Enter’ to apply it to the video.

In this tutorial, we have shown you two different ways to rotate a video in Blender. The first way is by using the Transform Properties window, and the second way is by using the 3D Viewport.

Which method you use is up to you. However, we recommend using the 3D Viewport method, as it is more accurate.

Rotating a video in Blender can be used for other purposes than just rotating it.

Here are some other things that you can do with a rotated video:

\- Scale the video up or down

\- Flip the video horizontally or vertically

\- Change the position of the video in the 3D Viewport

There are two main ways to rotate video in Filmora: through the use of keyframes or by using the Transform Tool.

### Step-by-step on how to rotate videos in Filmora

To rotate a video clip using keyframes...

Step 1: Import the video clip you want to rotate to your project.

![rotate-video-blender](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-blender-7.png)

Step 2: In the timeline, place the playhead at the beginning of the clip.

![rotate-video-blender](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-blender-8.png)

Step 3: With the playhead still at the beginning of the clip, drag the rotation handle in the preview window to rotate the video.

![rotate-video-blender](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-blender-9.png)

Step 4: Move the playhead to the end of the clip and drag the rotation handle again to rotate it further.

![rotate-video-blender](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-blender-10.png)

To rotate a video clip using the Transform Tool...

## How to Add Video Effects with Movavi Slideshow Maker

Many video editors won't be late in their artwork. They tend to use different effects to light up their crafts. For them, editing videos with effects applications gives more life to the story. In this composition, you will learn more about Effects, and if you are just about to do your video editing right now, these details are definitely for you.

## What are Video Effects?

According to the dictionary, an effect is brought about by a cause or an agency.

In video editing, there are a few video effects you must know to apply them to your video project. Video effects can alter the speed and produce distortions, reflections, aesthetic filters, stylistic color grading, animation transitions, and more. They can also contain 3D features like CGI. When used well, these effects improve the narrative, the atmosphere, and the images' overall impact.

Let's dissect a few of the major effects, which will be most helpful to you.

**Pans and Tilts**

Your first thought upon hearing these two words may be tripod motions. Pans and tilts are a quick way to add additional movement and sensation to your video, making it more dynamic.

**Change the Speed/Duration**

One feature that virtually every NLE or Non-Linear Editing software gives us is the option to modify the playback speed of your video while reducing or increasing the actual duration and tempo of your segments. Slowing down your footage to match the frame rate at which the video was initially captured is one of the critical explanations for doing this.

To incorporate some frantic or chaotic moments into your production, you can use this to generate slow-motion shots and fast-forward effects. This effect can also quickly pan through footage for humorous effect. Find the "Speed/Duration" option under Effects controls to accomplish this.

**Light Leaks and Flares**

Nothing gives your video a more ethereal vibe than gentle, warm light emerging from the scene. A direct source visible in the photo may be the source of this light, or it may enter the frame from the edge. You've probably seen these flares and leaks countless times in movies, whether they were added in post-production or resulted from the cinematographer's lens choice. You can select where the light comes from if it doesn't distract from the task. Remember that these spills and flares must contribute to the narrative while remaining barely perceptible to the viewer.

**Retro/VHS Effects**

While light leaks and lens flares give your movie or film a timeless feel, nothing gives it a dated or, one would say, "scrappy" vibe. The grunge appearance of the '90s is in right now, and one of the most popular effects is the VHS look.

There are several ways to get this effect. Applying a preset, essentially a LUT (look-up table or filter), to your color grade will make the image appear fuzzier, desaturated, and blurrier (using the different alpha and gamma channels). This will cause "chroma errors," which result from poor recordings and a lack of a flying erase head (a function that enables you to record over previously filmed video; imagine formatting your SD card while the video is still present on the card and you are simply recording over it), giving your images an outline of distorted blues and reds.

**Color Grading and Color Correction**

Besides actual editing, color grading and correction are arguably the most significant post-production steps. With the help of these tools, you may alter skin tones, highlight, and shadow levels, add vignettes, experiment with contrast, and much more. We'll briefly go through one aspect of color grading—the ability to adjust particular colors in your image—even though this subject needs its ebook.

**Adding Overlays**

Although we've talked about adding overlays, such as VHS effects or light leaks, you may use many other editing overlays to add particular components to your shot, including weather particles!

**Using Titles and Motion Graphics**

Motion graphics and clean titles are essential for any video that wishes to appear professional. These could be subtitles, and the animation logo reveals post-credits, lower thirds, or even major titles. There are various free typefaces available that you may use to make your project stand out, regardless of the program you're working in.

Once you've selected the appropriate font, color, and weight, it's time to move on to motion graphics. These are crucial because they may transform a clear, ageless title or text into a lively, entertaining illustration of the product or concept your movie is attempting to market.

The abundance of tutorials nowadays makes learning the fundamentals of motion graphics a piece of cake. As I previously stated, you can access all the various effects and movements you might need, regardless of the editing program, you use.

These various methods and approaches need the practice to perfect, just like any other component of filmmaking. As you add these video editing effects to your editing toolkit, there will undoubtedly be a lot of trial and error. Still, eventually, they will become second nature to your workflow.

**Importance of Applying Effects to your Video**

Almost from the first motion film, cinematic storytelling and video effects have gone hand in hand. They can improve a scene, create something that doesn't exist, hide an error, and do much more. In essence, they assist a filmmaker in telling a tale in the manner they desire.

## Applying Effects using Movavi Slideshow Maker

Making picture collages is less appealing than slide show presentations. This method is ideal for presenting a gallery of images or creating a polished photo-video presentation for your brand and goods. You'll need a creative slideshow program with loads of capabilities to create a polished slideshow that will enhance your production. The Movavi Slideshow Maker now comes into play.

In this composition, I will show you how to apply "Effects" on your video using Movavi Slideshow Maker video editing software. A professional slideshow program called Movavi slideshow creator is made for usage by both professional and amateur picture editors. It is a Mac and Windows PC freemium program with many options to give your slideshow presentation a polished and distinctive appearance.

**Features of Movavi Slideshow Maker**

* It offers an easy-to-use UI
* Includes a complete toolbox for altering photos
* Advanced features for improving slideshows
* Internal media tools
* Native recording capability

_Take note that this software is not just for editing pictures but also for videos._

Step1 Click the **Import** tab.

![click import movavi slideshow maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/click-import-movavi-slideshow-maker.jpg)

Step2 Click “**Add Files**” and locate your desired video to edit.

![add files movavi slideshow maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/add-files-movavi-slideshow-maker.jpg)

Step3 Drag the imported video that you want to edit onto the video track.

![drag video to track movavi slideshow](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/drag-video-to-track-movavi-slideshow.jpg)

## Applying Filter effects

A video filter is software that modifies a multimedia stream somehow. A filter graph is a series of filters that each accept input from an upstream filter, process the information, and then output the edited video to their downstream counterparts.

Step1 Click the **Filter** tab.

![click filter movavi slideshow maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/click-filter-movavi-slideshow-maker.jpg)

Step2 Choose your desired Filter effects depending on your preferred category.

![apply filter movavi slideshow maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/apply-filter-movavi-slideshow-maker.jpg)

Step3 You can see the preview of a Filter effect by clicking it before applying it to your desired video to be edited.

![preview filter effect movavi slideshow maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/preview-filter-effect-movavi-slideshow-maker.jpg)

Step4 If you finally chose a Filter effect, drag it onto the imported video.

Step5 And now you will see the changes. The “star” symbol on the imported video means you have already applied a Filter effect on it.

![star symbol movavi slideshow maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/star-symbol-movavi-slideshow-maker.jpg)

**Raw Footage vs With Applied Filter Effect**

_Raw Footage_

![raw footage movavi slideshow](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/raw-footage-movavi-slideshow.jpg)

_Brush – Sketch Filter effect_

![brush sketch filter effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/brush-sketch-filter-effect.jpg)

## Adding Transition Effect

Transitions guide your audience.

From the opening to the very end, they structure the movie. There are numerous typical forms, including the wipe, dissolve, split-cut, and many others. Film editors use transitions to transfer a scene from one video clip to another practice. Transitions don't need to be visible.

Step1 Click the **Transition** tab.

![click transition movavi slideshow maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/click-transition-movavi-slideshow-maker.jpg)

Step2 Choose your desired Transition effect depending on your preferred category.

**_Note:_** Transition effects can also be applied even if you have only one video. You can put transitions effects either at the start of the video, which could make your video introduction more appealing. Also, you can set the Transition effect at the end of the video, which could give you a pleasant closing.

Point your cursor either on the left side of the symbol; the cursor will become a horizontal double-arrow to change the span of your Transition effect on the left video or on the right end side of the symbol to change the span of the Transition effect on the right video._

## Applying Titling Motion Effect

Most video editing applications come with built-in titling choices, and many of them vary from basic letters to a collection of motion graphics that have already been pre-programmed. Enter your text into a template to insert them.

The majority of video projects have crucial titles. You can use them to build a mood, label key elements of the film, and convey information.

Step1 Click the **Title** tab.

![select title movavi slideshow maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/select-title-movavi-slideshow-maker.jpg)

Step2 Choose your desired Titling motion effect depending on your preferred category. You can also see the preview of a title effect by clicking it before applying it to your selected video to be edited.

![select title motion movavi slideshow](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/select-title-motion-movavi-slideshow.jpg)

Step3 To apply the Title Motion effect, drag the effect onto the title track, just above the video track.

![drag title motion track movavi slideshow](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/drag-title-motion-track-movavi-slideshow.jpg)

Step4 You can place your Title Motion effect on your desired time where you want it to appear.

In the recent few years, Augmented Reality (AR) has evolved from a sci-fi concept to one of the most prominent technologies in the world. Due to its vast applications, AR has already seeped into many industries and the education world is one of them. **Augmented Reality in classrooms** can do wonders for the kids and enhance the overall learning experience. Not to mention, by combining AR with other intuitive technologies like Virtual Reality (VR) and Mixed Reality (MR), teachers can uplift the entire learning experience for students and make boring topics slightly more intriguing.

The truth is that conventional teaching methods are now becoming obsolete and many educational institutes and universities are incorporating AR to make teaching more fun. Keeping that in mind, we are going to share a detailed insight into how AR integration can help the entire edtech world. We’ll also share some of the real-world examples of **Augmented Reality (AR) in teaching** so that you can understand its benefits in the education sector.

#### In this article

01 [What Is AR in Teaching?](#Part 1)

02 [5 Benefits of Augmented Reality in Education](#Part 2)

03 [10 Creative AR Teaching Examples](#Part 3)

## Part 1 What Is AR in Teaching?

For readers who are not familiar with Augmented Reality, here’s what you need to know. Augmented Reality is an immersive technology that combines various virtual elements with the real world. Unlike Virtual Reality (VR), AR doesn’t completely take users away from the real world. Instead, it overlays a few virtual elements onto the physical world to make things more immersive. Let’s understand this with the help of an example.

![ar in teaching](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/10-innovative-ar-teaching-examples-to-tell-you-what-is-ar-in-teaching-1.jpg)

If you download IKEA’s phone app, it has a feature that allows you to virtually place different pieces of furniture in your home/office. So, before buying something from the IKEA store, you can evaluate if it would look good at your place or not. Like IKEA, there are several other examples of Augmented Reality that prove its benefits in today’s tech-savvy society. So, let’s explore some of the advantages of incorporating **Augmented Reality in classrooms** and the education sector.

## Part 2  Benefits of Augmented Reality in Education

### 01No Special Equipment Required

One of the biggest advantages of Augmented Reality over other immersive technologies is that it doesn’t require any special equipment. Users can access an AR-based application directly on their smartphones and get access to the entire course material right away. Moreover, teachers can also access AR-based platforms on their laptops and make teaching more interactive for everyone.

### 02Better Student Engagement

Speaking of interaction, AR has the potential to make learning more engaging for the students. Even the most boring topics can be brought to life by bringing technology like AR into the picture. One of the ways to do this is to gamify the technology and turn conventional training into something more intuitive. This way all the students will sit through the entire lesson and stay engaged till the end.

### 03Practical Learning

Another major advantage of **Augmented Reality in teaching** is its ability to boast practical learning. For example, different training institutes can help trainees get familiar with the inner elements of a machine without having to go near the physical machine itself. This also reduces security threats in the workplace and protects training institutes from compromising million-dollar equipment.

### 04Combined Learning

Our education sector is at a stage where it’s not possible to directly transition from textbooks to complete tech-based learning. However, we can still benefit by combining technologies like AR with conventional teaching methods to achieve an all-around success. With **Augmented Reality in schools,** students will have the liberty to learn the practical implementation of all the theoretical knowledge they’ve acquired during the lectures.

### 05Affordable

Finally, the biggest reason why universities, colleges, and training institutes must consider integrating AR into the entire curriculum is its affordability. Since colleges don’t actually need any expensive equipment to access an AR-based tech platform, they won’t have to spend thousands of dollars in the beginning. And, due to its affordable nature, it’s also easier to make AR readily available to all the students.

## Part 3 10 Creative AR Teaching Examples

Now, even though it may seem a bit hard to digest, **AR classrooms** have already become a reality. The technology has managed to garner immense popularity in the education sector and many institutes are relishing its benefits while making learning more fun and interactive for the students. So, as promised in the beginning of the article, here are some of the real-world examples of **Augmented Reality in classrooms**.

### 01Exploring the Universe With Skyview

In fact, they can even use the app to identify the location of planets and nearby satellites. Sounds fun, right?

## Part 1 What Is AR in Teaching?

For readers who are not familiar with Augmented Reality, here’s what you need to know. Augmented Reality is an immersive technology that combines various virtual elements with the real world. Unlike Virtual Reality (VR), AR doesn’t completely take users away from the real world. Instead, it overlays a few virtual elements onto the physical world to make things more immersive. Let’s understand this with the help of an example.

![ar in teaching](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/10-innovative-ar-teaching-examples-to-tell-you-what-is-ar-in-teaching-1.jpg)

If you download IKEA’s phone app, it has a feature that allows you to virtually place different pieces of furniture in your home/office. So, before buying something from the IKEA store, you can evaluate if it would look good at your place or not. Like IKEA, there are several other examples of Augmented Reality that prove its benefits in today’s tech-savvy society. So, let’s explore some of the advantages of incorporating **Augmented Reality in classrooms** and the education sector.

## Part 2  Benefits of Augmented Reality in Education

### 01No Special Equipment Required

One of the biggest advantages of Augmented Reality over other immersive technologies is that it doesn’t require any special equipment. Users can access an AR-based application directly on their smartphones and get access to the entire course material right away. Moreover, teachers can also access AR-based platforms on their laptops and make teaching more interactive for everyone.

### 02Better Student Engagement

Speaking of interaction, AR has the potential to make learning more engaging for the students. Even the most boring topics can be brought to life by bringing technology like AR into the picture. One of the ways to do this is to gamify the technology and turn conventional training into something more intuitive. This way all the students will sit through the entire lesson and stay engaged till the end.

### 03Practical Learning

Another major advantage of **Augmented Reality in teaching** is its ability to boast practical learning. For example, different training institutes can help trainees get familiar with the inner elements of a machine without having to go near the physical machine itself. This also reduces security threats in the workplace and protects training institutes from compromising million-dollar equipment.

### 04Combined Learning

Our education sector is at a stage where it’s not possible to directly transition from textbooks to complete tech-based learning. However, we can still benefit by combining technologies like AR with conventional teaching methods to achieve an all-around success. With **Augmented Reality in schools,** students will have the liberty to learn the practical implementation of all the theoretical knowledge they’ve acquired during the lectures.

### 05Affordable

Finally, the biggest reason why universities, colleges, and training institutes must consider integrating AR into the entire curriculum is its affordability. Since colleges don’t actually need any expensive equipment to access an AR-based tech platform, they won’t have to spend thousands of dollars in the beginning. And, due to its affordable nature, it’s also easier to make AR readily available to all the students.

## Part 3 10 Creative AR Teaching Examples

Now, even though it may seem a bit hard to digest, **AR classrooms** have already become a reality. The technology has managed to garner immense popularity in the education sector and many institutes are relishing its benefits while making learning more fun and interactive for the students. So, as promised in the beginning of the article, here are some of the real-world examples of **Augmented Reality in classrooms**.

### 01Exploring the Universe With Skyview

Skyview is a smartphone application that lets users get familiar with the cosmos. To be more precise, students can use the app to know details about different stars they see during the night from their rooftop. To do this, all they have to do is point the camera towards the night sky and the app automatically overlays information regarding the most popular stars on the screen. In fact, they can even use the app to identify the location of planets and nearby satellites. Sounds fun, right?

Skyview is a smartphone application that lets users get familiar with the cosmos. To be more precise, students can use the app to know details about different stars they see during the night from their rooftop. To do this, all they have to do is point the camera towards the night sky and the app automatically overlays information regarding the most popular stars on the screen. In fact, they can even use the app to identify the location of planets and nearby satellites. Sounds fun, right?

### 03Distance Learning With Mondly

Mondly is a language learning platform that’s designed to help students learn different languages in an interactive manner. With the platform, users get a dedicated virtual assistant that helps them work on their skills more effectively. The app replicates real-life settings in many ways and users can get a strong grasp on the desired language.

### 04Froggipedia

This is where things get interesting. Froggipedia is a great example of **Augmented Reality in teaching**. It’s basically a smartphone app that lets users explore the internal organs of a frog in a virtual environment. It means students would no longer have to get involved in the mess that dissecting an actual frog creates in the classroom and still get familiar with each organ easily.

### 05Effective Marketing

Another example of **Augmented Reality in the teaching** world has nothing to do with learning, but the marketing aspect of the industry. With AR-based platforms, universities and colleges can market their brands among the target consumers and get a higher number of applications in return. They can launch digital publications and AR-powered videos to maximize engagement and achieve the desired results through their marketing campaigns.

### 06Virtual Classrooms

The COVID-19 pandemic has propelled the growth of virtual classrooms as many schools still haven’t resumed physical classes to restrict the virus's spread. In VR classrooms, mixed reality - a combination of VR and AR - can help students stay engaged, even if they are sitting apart from each other. Virtual Classrooms will eliminate boredom from remote learning and keep the engagement level high for students.

### 07Secure Training

As we mentioned earlier, AR integration makes training more effective and risk-free. For example, with Microsoft Holo-lens, medical students understand the inner anatomy of the human body and understand complex procedures without having to risk a patient’s life. Once they are confident and know about each organ, they can move towards the next procedure and gain expertise in the particular domain more effectively.

### 08Google Expeditions

For a student, exploring the world is a great way to familiarize himself with different cultures. But, it’s not always possible for young kids to go on trips alone. Well, not anymore! Thanks to virtual tour platforms like Google Expeditions, teachers can take their students on virtual trips to different corners of the world, be it Mount Everest Base Camp or the Eiffel Tower in Paris.

### 09Augmented Reality in Museums

The younger generation craves interactivity. They don’t have the time to read brochures in a Museum. That’s the reason why many Museums have started to launch AR-powered tech to keep the visitors engaged and let them learn various historical facts more precisely. For instance, in a nature-themed museum, visitors can experience digital animals and their position in history.

### 10Virtual Speech

Not particularly an Augmented Reality (AR) example, Virtual Speech is a combination of AR and VR that lets users virtually practice their public speaking skills without going on a real stage. This is a great tool to fight stage fear and speak with confidence in front of an actual crowd.
