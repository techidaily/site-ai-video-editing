#### Step 2: Import Video to Filmora

On the main interface, press “Ctrl + I” from your keyboard. By doing so, you can import the video clip from your PC. Once done, drag and drop the imported video to the timeline.

#### Step 3: Choose Optical Flow

Now, select the video you have dragged to the timeline. Go to the right panel and choose the “Speed” tab. Look through the “Uniform Speed” tab and look for the “AI Frame Interpolation” option. By expanding this option, choose “Optical Flow.”

#### Step 4: Render and Export the Video

Now, head to the toolbar of the timeline. From there, tap on “Render Preview,” through which you can see the final results. Once done, you can export the video to the desired platform.

With the new upgrade, you can add an accurate **slow-mo effect** from Filmora. It uses AI technology to achieve the best results. Hence, this editing tool is a game-changer in the video production industry.

### Exceptional Features of Filmora

* [**AI Music Generator**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**:** This tool allows you to create custom music sounds. To do so, select your music style and genre from the given options. Afterward, you can edit the music by adjusting its volume and other parameters.

* [**Screen Recorder**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**:** Do you want to capture the on-screen activities of your PC? The screen recorder of this software can capture any area of the screen. It also allows webcam and microphone recording. Afterward, you can edit the screen recording with its basic tools.

* [**Silence Detection**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**:** To add more clarity to your videos, try the Silence Detection feature. This option removes the silent parts from your video. The process is automatic and does not need your manual efforts. Thus, with a single tap, you can eradicate unwanted parts from the video.

* [**Speech-to-Text**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**:** The STT feature transcribes the video in the selected language. You can add subtitles to the videos in up to 26 languages. This feature increases your editing efficiency and offers great accuracy.

## Conclusion

A **slow-motion effect** can highlight an action in a video clip. It can engage the viewers by generating a cinematic impact. The After Effects is a common program to add a slow-mo effect in videos. However, to create a more captivating slow-motion effect, we suggest Filmora. Its latest version has introduced many premium features for video editing. With AI algorithms, you can add a smooth, slow-motion effect to your videos. The process is automatic, which saves you from manual work.
