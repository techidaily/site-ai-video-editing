In the âFormatâ option you can choose the file extension, the format, or the codec. Exporting your video based on format is good if you prefer to save your video on your computer since maybe you may upload your video on YouTube, Instagram or other social media platforms.

![export videos in high res quality](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/export-video-in-filmora-7.jpg)

You can choose "Apple Prores" if you want the least amount of compression possible and don't care about the file size. For example, if you want to export a video from Filmora and then import it into another video editor without losing too much quality, you should definitely choose "Apple Prores."

![choose apple prores](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/export-video-in-filmora-8.jpg)

Before exporting, there is the option to upload to the cloud. If you do not know what it is, Wondershare has its own Drive, which allows you to save and remotely view your video files.

In the meantime, if you have a decent PC, you can enable "Hardware acceleration for video encoding." This option will utilize as much computer power as you have to export the video and make the process significantly faster. Once everything is finished, click "Export."

![click export](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/export-video-in-filmora-9.jpg)

When you click Export, you can see the progress with thumbnails and everything. Lastly, your video has been exported successfully when the exporting process reaches 100%.

## Summary

Indeed, there are many options to export your video using Filmora. If you wish to export your video directly to YouTube, simply select the YouTube option in the Export box. Meanwhile, if you want to export your video on your computer and upload it to various social media platforms, it's much better to export it with a format option.

## Level Up Videos By Applying Keyframe with Filmora

Everyone is fascinated by a video portraying creativity and effort in each frame. Your films can easily have this captivity through the keyframe feature. It provides you the accessibility to make even a simple, plain shot pace up, slow down, or pan across the screen.

Wondershare Filmora offers you a simple yet great experience of Keyframing. It has been the editors' favorite feature for years. Under its Grow and Win Program, Filmora presents the Keyframe creativity contest. It is the ultimate solution for bringing captivity and precision to your shots.

## Part 1\. What is the Keyframe Feature?

A keyframe, also spelled "key frame," defines any smooth transition's beginning and conclusion. In the case of animation or film, or video, that something may be a drawing or a specific frame of a shot.

The keyframe feature creates room for boundless creativity. The Keyframe feature could imitate any illusive or fascinating impact, from object enlargement to magical power effects. A key frame is a frame that serves as a marker for the start or stop of a parameter change.

You could use a keyframe to mark the spot where the audio will have faded up or down to a specific volume.

## Part 2\. Where to Use The Keyframe Feature?

Editors and creators use keyframing for all kinds of stuff. These uses include:

### Animated Logo Intros

You can use the keyframe feature to create indigenous intros with animated logos. It helps the editors go for vlogging or tutorial videos.

### Special Transparency Effects

Keyframing is famous for creating blended visuals through experimentation with the transparency of the clip.

![varying transparency clips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-keyframe-video-2.gif)

### Custom Picture-in-Picture Paths

We use the picture-in-picture effect in many editing formats, from tutorial videos to gaming streams and vlogs. Keyframing allows editors to execute the movement of the PIP as they wish. For instance, this video call was shot from a video.

![picture-in-picture effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-keyframe-video-3.png)

The picture will move across the screen between the 30-second and 1-minute marks if you indicate that it will be in the upper left corner of the screen at the 30-second timestamp of your video and the bottom right corner at the 1-minute timestamp.

## Part 3\. What Would You Need to Make a Keyframe Video

Let us share the procedure for making a video using the keyframe feature.

### 1\. A Video Clip or Photos

For experimenting and creating with the keyframe feature, first, you would need high-quality video clips or images.

### 2\. Motion Elements

Keyframing allows for a vast area of creativity with motion elements that you can download online. The keyframe feature adds charm to these elements by playing with their orientation and scale.

### 3\. An Advanced Editing Software
