After a successful video shoot, video editing tends to wrap up the video production process. However, a video cannot be enlivened by using simple video editing tools, i.e., cut, crop, and trim, but rather tools such as cinematic color grading. Usually, directors want their video to evoke their intended ambiance and appear more realistic – This can only be achieved through cinematic color grading.

[Color grading](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is the alteration and enhancement of color in a video, motion picture, or still image. Color grading is an essential tool for videographers since it enables them to enhance the mood or tone. Stick to this article and learn about the eight tips to apply cinematic color grading to your video.

01 [Don't Make These Mistakes!](#part1)

02 [8 Tips to Apply Cinematic Color Grading to Your Video](#part2)

## Don't Make These Mistakes

Even though to err is human, there are some mistakes that colorists and video editors need to avoid at all costs. It is not only because they will make them look amateurish but also undermines the message and impact of the video.

Some people assume color grading is as simple as adding filters to their Instagram photos which they are absolutely wrong. Color grading is a long and frustrating process, and it only requires "persons with a thick skin."

Some mistakes are not only committed by amateurs alone but also professional colorists who are in a rush to complete their projects on due time. Usually, these mistakes degrade the quality output. Some of the mistakes that one needs not make include:

#### 1\. Using a Poorly Calibrated Monitor

Almost every videographer and colorist's goal is to design footages that distinctively display their primary colors and decipher the intended message. And this can only be achieved using a properly calibrated monitor.

Before working on a project, you ought to crosscheck your monitor calibration. Most people assume that the calibration is accurate since they possess a new, out-of-the-box monitor. It is utterly wrong since retailer shops usually adjust the monitor settings to overblown saturation and contrast to attract customers.

Furthermore, if you opt to edit your videos without adjusting your monitor calibration, you will have a poor footage.

#### 2\. Poor Prepping of the Video Footage

One major mistake that videographers often make is not prepping their video correctly. A poorly prepped footage is one that has a bad color space conversion. Usually, the outcome result of poorly prepped footage is an imbalanced image.

Prepping footage is not as easy as an apple pie. Besides, most videographers tend to follow a shortcut by starting messing with the gains and individual nodes, forgetting that a shortcut is often a wrong cut.

The best way of prepping a video is to start by making separate nodes and labeling them differently.

#### 3\. Imbalancing the Shadow

Have you ever seen video footage with partially opaque shadows? And when you look keenly, you see tinted greens and reds. Usually, this is a result of an imbalanced shadow.

This mistake is not only carried out by beginner videographers but also professionals who are always in a hurry to complete a project. When you look at your scope, you see the shadows are lifted or down in other scenarios – This is also a result of shadow imbalance.

#### 4\. Overusing LUTs

A mistake that beginner editors often make is overusing LUTs. Footages with overly used LUTs often appear to be dull. A thing that videographers need to observe when using LUTs is consistency.

When using LUTs, you need to ensure that your project has similar saturation, colors, and contrast throughout your video project. Moreover, it would be best to choose your LUTs based on the film color palette and your story.

#### 5\. Having Limited break

Having enough break enables one's eyes to recalibrate. As a colorist, your eyes are often considered the main asset. Sitting for long periods in your workstation and staring for long hours at your monitor may cause one to add more saturation and contrast, thus making the video dull. Therefore the best remedy is to take a break from your monitor.

Besides, coming from a break enables one to have another different perspective about the color grading of the project.

## 8 Tips to Apply Cinematic Color Grading to Your Video

When it comes to creating cinematic looks in video footage, the camera type is usually non-essential. What matters is that you capture quality videos with the right angles then leave the rest to color grading.

For a video clip to look more cinematic, a couple of elements are put together. Here, we will look at those elements and create stunning videos.

#### 1\. Use Lumetri Color to adjust brightness, contrast, and saturation

The Lumeri color is an essential color grading functionality in most premiere software, including Wondershare Filmora, Adobe After Effects, and Davinci Resolve 17\. With this functionality tool, you can carry out a wide range of customizable settings such as hue, saturation, contrasts, brightness, and tone.

The lumetri panel contains a histogram, vectorscope, parade scope, and waveform monitor. In your lumetri panel, you can measure the brightness and tonal values using a histogram, the light intensity with a waveform monitor, saturation and hue using vectorscope, and color channel using parade scope.

Adjusting the brightness, contrast, hue, saturation, and tone to moderate levels will give your video clip that cinematic look.

#### 2\. Use Cosmo functionality to adjust skin tones

Due to the light effect, shots taken during the day will have inconsistent color matches, especially skin tone. In the post-production process, one needs to make uniformity in skin tone and the clip. To rectify this, you need to involve a professional color grading functionality, Cosmo.

With cosmo, you can adjust the skin color, squeeze the skin, and soften the skin. Generally, Cosmo makes people in video clips look their best.

![apply cinemtatic color grading to your video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cinematic-grading-2.jpg)

#### 3\. Use Highlights and Shadows adjustment

A clip will look more cinematic when the shadows and highlights are brought out as separate entities. The shadows become more vivid when adjusted to either teal, purple or blue. You can go a mile and adjust the highlights to become crystal clear by making the footage become yellow, red, or orange.

When carrying out color grading, you need to know the various video demands, such as the horror clips demand more of the dark shadow.

![apply cinemtatic color grading to video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cinematic-grading-3.jpg)

#### 4\. Use Vectorscope to get the accurate adjustment

Naked eyes cannot effectively see all the errors in a video project, which is the essence of having a vectorscope. A vectorscope provides all the quantitative information about a video image – This lessens work for video editors.

Vectorscope provides extensive details, such as how intense a given color is – This will help you make necessary adjustments to your footage.

![apply cinemtatic color grading to video - use vectorscope](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cinematic-grading-4.jpg)

#### 5\. Use the black and white functionality to change the opacity

Even though you can change your footage to black and white using the hue and saturation functionality, the black and white tool gives you more control.

This functionality feature can make your footage blend with the soft light part. Besides, it is best to first lower the contrast of your image or video to black and white to be able to highlight the unclear parts.

![apply cinemtatic color grading to video - change opacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cinematic-grading-5.jpg)

#### 6\. Use levels to unveil the whites, blacks, and mids of an image

Levels is a functionality feature that displays the blacks, whites, and mids of footage. With this functionality, you can make the highlight parts lighter and the shadows appear darker, which is essential in making cinematic videos.

In the levels histogram, the left slider defines the darkest part, the right defines the brightest part, and the top defines distributions.

In software such as Adobe After Effects, you can set this functionality to automatic or customize it based on your preference.

![apply cinemtatic color grading to video - use levels](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cinematic-grading-6.jpg)

#### 7\. Use Vibrance to control other levels of saturation

The saturation of video footage or a clip can be regulated using vibrance functionality. With vibrance, you can alter the saturation levels of your clip while simultaneously minimizing clippings for the colors to approach complete saturation.

When you want to use this functionality in After Effects, you drag and drop it right on top of your footage – The exact part you want to apply it.

![apply cinemtatic color grading to video - use vibrance](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cinematic-grading-7.jpg)

#### 8\. Use a Vignette to fade edges

To increase the point of focus, you need to fade your edges. In color grading, you can only fade your edges with a vignette.

This functionality allows you to center images or certain video parts and make the edges unclear. Your emphasis will be more on the central region.

![apply cinemtatic color grading to video - use a vignette](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cinematic-grading-8.jpg)

## Bottom line

● Color grading is not a piece of cake. Besides, you should not use it as an excuse for making simple mistakes such as the ones highlighted above. You need to pay close attention when color grading your films, and you will have your video project mapping out its intended meaning.

● Moreover, you need not be a pro to carry out cinematic color grading. You need to follow the above eight tips altogether to apply color grading to your video. You will create stunning video files that leave your viewers' eyes gorged out.

Before working on a project, you ought to crosscheck your monitor calibration. Most people assume that the calibration is accurate since they possess a new, out-of-the-box monitor. It is utterly wrong since retailer shops usually adjust the monitor settings to overblown saturation and contrast to attract customers.

Furthermore, if you opt to edit your videos without adjusting your monitor calibration, you will have a poor footage.

#### 2\. Poor Prepping of the Video Footage

One major mistake that videographers often make is not prepping their video correctly. A poorly prepped footage is one that has a bad color space conversion. Usually, the outcome result of poorly prepped footage is an imbalanced image.

Prepping footage is not as easy as an apple pie. Besides, most videographers tend to follow a shortcut by starting messing with the gains and individual nodes, forgetting that a shortcut is often a wrong cut.

The best way of prepping a video is to start by making separate nodes and labeling them differently.

#### 3\. Imbalancing the Shadow

Have you ever seen video footage with partially opaque shadows? And when you look keenly, you see tinted greens and reds. Usually, this is a result of an imbalanced shadow.

This mistake is not only carried out by beginner videographers but also professionals who are always in a hurry to complete a project. When you look at your scope, you see the shadows are lifted or down in other scenarios – This is also a result of shadow imbalance.

#### 4\. Overusing LUTs

A mistake that beginner editors often make is overusing LUTs. Footages with overly used LUTs often appear to be dull. A thing that videographers need to observe when using LUTs is consistency.

When using LUTs, you need to ensure that your project has similar saturation, colors, and contrast throughout your video project. Moreover, it would be best to choose your LUTs based on the film color palette and your story.

#### 5\. Having Limited break

Having enough break enables one's eyes to recalibrate. As a colorist, your eyes are often considered the main asset. Sitting for long periods in your workstation and staring for long hours at your monitor may cause one to add more saturation and contrast, thus making the video dull. Therefore the best remedy is to take a break from your monitor.

Besides, coming from a break enables one to have another different perspective about the color grading of the project.

## 8 Tips to Apply Cinematic Color Grading to Your Video

When it comes to creating cinematic looks in video footage, the camera type is usually non-essential. What matters is that you capture quality videos with the right angles then leave the rest to color grading.

For a video clip to look more cinematic, a couple of elements are put together. Here, we will look at those elements and create stunning videos.

#### 1\. Use Lumetri Color to adjust brightness, contrast, and saturation

The Lumeri color is an essential color grading functionality in most premiere software, including Wondershare Filmora, Adobe After Effects, and Davinci Resolve 17\. With this functionality tool, you can carry out a wide range of customizable settings such as hue, saturation, contrasts, brightness, and tone.

The lumetri panel contains a histogram, vectorscope, parade scope, and waveform monitor. In your lumetri panel, you can measure the brightness and tonal values using a histogram, the light intensity with a waveform monitor, saturation and hue using vectorscope, and color channel using parade scope.

Adjusting the brightness, contrast, hue, saturation, and tone to moderate levels will give your video clip that cinematic look.

![apply cinemtatic color grading](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cinematic-grading-1.jpg)

#### 2\. Use Cosmo functionality to adjust skin tones

Due to the light effect, shots taken during the day will have inconsistent color matches, especially skin tone. In the post-production process, one needs to make uniformity in skin tone and the clip. To rectify this, you need to involve a professional color grading functionality, Cosmo.

With cosmo, you can adjust the skin color, squeeze the skin, and soften the skin. Generally, Cosmo makes people in video clips look their best.

![apply cinemtatic color grading to your video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cinematic-grading-2.jpg)

#### 3\. Use Highlights and Shadows adjustment

A clip will look more cinematic when the shadows and highlights are brought out as separate entities. The shadows become more vivid when adjusted to either teal, purple or blue. You can go a mile and adjust the highlights to become crystal clear by making the footage become yellow, red, or orange.

When carrying out color grading, you need to know the various video demands, such as the horror clips demand more of the dark shadow.

![apply cinemtatic color grading to video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cinematic-grading-3.jpg)

#### 4\. Use Vectorscope to get the accurate adjustment

Naked eyes cannot effectively see all the errors in a video project, which is the essence of having a vectorscope. A vectorscope provides all the quantitative information about a video image – This lessens work for video editors.

Vectorscope provides extensive details, such as how intense a given color is – This will help you make necessary adjustments to your footage.

![apply cinemtatic color grading to video - use vectorscope](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cinematic-grading-4.jpg)

#### 5\. Use the black and white functionality to change the opacity

Even though you can change your footage to black and white using the hue and saturation functionality, the black and white tool gives you more control.

This functionality feature can make your footage blend with the soft light part. Besides, it is best to first lower the contrast of your image or video to black and white to be able to highlight the unclear parts.

![apply cinemtatic color grading to video - change opacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cinematic-grading-5.jpg)

#### 6\. Use levels to unveil the whites, blacks, and mids of an image

Levels is a functionality feature that displays the blacks, whites, and mids of footage. With this functionality, you can make the highlight parts lighter and the shadows appear darker, which is essential in making cinematic videos.

In the levels histogram, the left slider defines the darkest part, the right defines the brightest part, and the top defines distributions.

In software such as Adobe After Effects, you can set this functionality to automatic or customize it based on your preference.

![apply cinemtatic color grading to video - use levels](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cinematic-grading-6.jpg)

#### 7\. Use Vibrance to control other levels of saturation

The saturation of video footage or a clip can be regulated using vibrance functionality. With vibrance, you can alter the saturation levels of your clip while simultaneously minimizing clippings for the colors to approach complete saturation.

When you want to use this functionality in After Effects, you drag and drop it right on top of your footage – The exact part you want to apply it.

![apply cinemtatic color grading to video - use vibrance](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cinematic-grading-7.jpg)

#### 8\. Use a Vignette to fade edges

To increase the point of focus, you need to fade your edges. In color grading, you can only fade your edges with a vignette.

This functionality allows you to center images or certain video parts and make the edges unclear. Your emphasis will be more on the central region.

![apply cinemtatic color grading to video - use a vignette](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/cinematic-grading-8.jpg)

## Bottom line

● Color grading is not a piece of cake. Besides, you should not use it as an excuse for making simple mistakes such as the ones highlighted above. You need to pay close attention when color grading your films, and you will have your video project mapping out its intended meaning.

● Moreover, you need not be a pro to carry out cinematic color grading. You need to follow the above eight tips altogether to apply color grading to your video. You will create stunning video files that leave your viewers' eyes gorged out.

## Part 1: What Makes a Perfect Slow-Motion Video?

An ideal **FCP slow-motion** video requires careful attention to technical details and aesthetics. Below are some essential things to think about bringing perfection in slow-motion videos:

* **Resolution**: A slow-motion video with visual appeal and a high resolution is crucial. This is especially vital if you intend to crop or zoom in on the video while editing.
* **Storytelling:** Make sure the slow-motion clip supports the idea you're attempting to portray. Your scenes will have more impact if you tell them with a thoughtful narrative.
* **Editing:** Try different speeds when editing your clip to achieve the best impact. Consider including sound effects or music to accompany the slow-motion images.
* **Timing:** Select the appropriate times to record in slow motion. You shouldn't slow down your entire video. Instead, you can apply the effect to draw attention to acts or feelings.
* **Frame Rate:** Slow-motion videos are usually shot at a greater frame rate. Frame rates of 60, 120, 240, or even higher are common as they make the video look smoother.
* **Shutter Speed:** For precise and sharp results, use a fast shutter speed camera. This lessens the likelihood of motion blur in every slow-motion frame.

### Step By Step Guide to Make Slow Motion Videos in Filmora

Unlike **Final Cut Pro's slow motion**, Wondershare Filmora is more straightforward to operate. Follow the step-by-step guide below to apply slow-motion effects to your video.

#### Method 1: Uniform Speed

If you want to adjust the speed and retain its high quality, use the uniform speed option. You can access this option by following the stepwise method below. Using the advanced features, you don’t need any other tool to ensure the video’s original worth:

##### Step 1Import Your Project and Start a New Project

After launching Filmora, head to its “New Project” option from the home screen. You will enter the main editing screen this way. Import your project in the media panel and then drag it to the timeline.

![creating a new video project](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/final-cut-pro-slow-motion-8.jpg)

##### Step 2Explore Uniform Speed and Adjust the Speed

Go to your video in the timeline and right-click on it. Now, explore the “Uniform Speed” option and tap on it to get an editing panel at the right. From that panel, move the “Speed” slider to the right and get a slow-motion video preview. You can see the "Duration" of the video after slowing it down and adjusting it accordingly.

![decrease uniform speed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/final-cut-pro-slow-motion-9.jpg)

##### Step 3Use Advanced Features to Ensure Quality of Videos

Move down and toggle the “Reverse Speed” option if required. You can enable the “Maintain Pitch” and “Ripple Edit” options to enhance the video automatically. Lastly, extend the “AI Frame Interpolation” menu using its downward symbol and choose “Optical Flow.” It will ensure that the video will remain slow with high quality.

![set ai frame interpolation to optical flow](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/final-cut-pro-slow-motion-10.jpg)

#### Method 2: Speed Ramping

This method aims to bring smooth transitions in slow-motion videos. Instead of an abrupt change, a gradual increase in speed can impose a professional look. So, there are the steps to access this feature and get a preview of smooth playback.

##### Step 1Discover the Speed Ramping Feature

Access the Speed Ramping option next to the “Uniform Speed” in the right-side editing panel. Alternatively, you can right-click on the video and look for the “Speed Ramping” option from the list.

![navigate to speed ramping](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/final-cut-pro-slow-motion-11.jpg)

##### Step 2Pick a Template for Speed Ramping or Customize It

From the speed ramping section, you can choose any template from 6 options. Also, users can pick the “Customize” option to adjust the speed ramping as desired.

![customise speed to apply slow mo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/final-cut-pro-slow-motion-12.jpg)

## Top 6 Drones for Videography

Drones are all the rage these days and for good reason. They're a lot of fun to fly, and they can be a great addition to your toolkit for capturing aerial footage. But with so many different drones on the market, it can be tough to know which one is right for you.

![best drone for videography](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/best-drone-for-videography.jpg)

That's why we've put together this guide to the best drones on the market for every budget. Whether you're looking for an entry-level drone that won't break the bank or a top-of-the-line model that will let you capture stunning 4K footage, we've got you covered. So read on to find the perfect drone for you!

## Buyers Guide: The Best 6 Drones on the Market for Every Budget

**#1\. DJI Air 2S:** Among the best options for most people.

![dji air 2s](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/dji-air-2s.jpg)

The DJI's new Air 2S is our top pick. It finds the ideal compromise in terms of size, weight, picture quality, intelligent features, and price. The camera on the Air 2S isn't as nice as the Mavic 2 Pro's, which has a variable aperture for more flexible shooting in sunny conditions and includes neutral density filters to help make up for it.

1.3 pounds might not seem like much, but the Air 2S is a force to be reckoned with- it's durable enough to fly in light winds and can stay up for 30 minutes! Plus, the new collision-avoidance system will keep you safe even when there are trees around, and the 1 inch 20 mp sensor captures amazing 5K video or still photos.

**#2\. Skydio 2+ Drone:** If you want your flights to be handled automatically.

![skydio 2 drone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/skydio-2-drone.jpg)

The Skydio 2+ has the best collision-avoidance system, far outperforming any other drone on the market. If you want a drone that can follow your mountain bike off-road or quickly maneuver through obstacles without your help, this is it. Its 27-minute flight time and 6-mile range make it restrictions for some people, but plenty for most. The 1/2.3-inch sensor on this camera is good enough for 4K footage at 60 frames per second, but it's not as great as the 1-inch sensor in the Air 2S and Evo Lite+. D-log support is also absent, so video professionals might want to keep that in mind.

However, if you can live without D-log and don't mind the slower sensor, this drone is capable of flying in places where other drones can't. For certain applications, a smaller sensor may be preferable to having a great one.

**#3\. DJI Mini 3 Pro:** The Best Ultralight Drone for Most People

![dji mini 3 pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/dji-mini-3-pro.jpg)

The DJI Mavic Mini 3 Pro is the third version of the name, and it has been greatly improved from its original state. It features a 4K/60p footage with 1/1.3" sensor as well capture 12.1 megapixel RAW photographs. The Mini 3 Pro also has a 48-megapixel mode that improves image quality, but loses some camera functions. A faster F/1.7 lens is now on the front of the drone, and it also incorporates three-direction obstacle avoidance and a gimbal that allows for vertical shooting--all while weighing in at less than 250 grams. This number is important because, in many areas, a drone under 250 grams does not need to be registered (however, you should always check your local laws).

I was ecstatic about the performance of the Mini 3 Pro. It can fly in an impressive 45 minutes when using its extended battery--which is a dramatic improvement from the 32 minutes I got with the standard battery. Not to mention, it's delightful to fly because it maneuvers so effortlessly in even high winds. The only issue I have with it is that its price has risen since DJI released Mini 2; however, they still sell both models.

**#4\. DJI Mini 2:** Most Affordable Drone

![dji mini 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/dji-mini-2.jpg)

The Mavic Air 2S has advanced collision-avoidance tech, but at a high cost. Even the new Mini 3 Pro sells for $750\. If budget is more important to you than features, DJI's Mini 2 would be your best bet. It flies compared to its larger siblings, though wind gusts that wouldn't bother bigger drones like the Mavic 2 Pro will ground the Mini. The lack of collision-avoidance sensors makes it better suited for experienced pilots.

Even with those minor drawbacks, the Mini 2 is still a great beginner drone. It's enjoyable to fly, captures 4K video footage, and can be stored in smaller spaces than many smartphones. And that last part is essential because the best drones are ones that you'll actually bring with you instead of leaving at home. The Mini 2 only weighs 249 grams so it's easy to transport, and you don't even need to register it with the Federal Aviation Administration

**#5\. DJI Mavic 3:** The Most Luxurious Drone

![dji mavic 3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/dji-mavic-3.jpg)

The DJI Mavic 3 Pro is a cut above the rest. It's the finest drone on the market right now. The new 20-megapixel Four Thirds sensor produces outstanding image and video quality, and 45 miles per hour mobility allows you to follow and track objects without missing a beat.

If you're willing to spend the money, this drone is definitely worth it. It has a 45-minute flying time and can avoid obstacles in all directions. The Cine model also supports Pro Res video and comes with 1TB of storage space- perfect for filmmakers or anyone who wants to capture high-quality footage.

**#6\. Autel Evo Lite+:** Great for Long Flights

![autel evo lite](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/autel-evo-lite.jpg)

The Evo Lite+ is your best bet if you want to stay airborne as long as possible. Its massive battery provides a 40-minute flight duration, and the additional weight makes it more stable in the wind (though not by much). The Evo Lite+ features a fantastic camera with variable aperture controls, a 1-inch sensor, and night mode for better low-light photos.

The control does resemble an Xbox controller, which is nice, but it lacks the storage capacity for detachable joysticks that you get with DJI drones. It's still perfectly functional, and Autel's software will be familiar to anyone who has used a DJI drone.

## Some Final Suggestions

Drones can be used for a variety of purposes, from shooting landscapes and cityscapes to capturing footage of sporting events or outdoor activities. They can also be used for wedding videos, real estate videos, and other types of commercial work. And if you're just looking for some fun footage to add to your home movies, drones are the perfect way to do it.

Of course, not all drones are created equal. If you're looking for a drone that can shoot high-quality video on a budget, there are a few things you need to keep in mind.

* First, make sure the drone has a high-resolution camera.
* Second, make sure the drone has a long battery life so that you can get plenty of shots without having to recharge.
* Third, make sure the drone is lightweight and easy to control so that you can get the perfect shot every time.

So, what's the best drone for you? It depends on your budget and your needs. If you want a high-quality camera that can shoot in low light, the DJI Mavic 3 Pro is a perfect choice. If you're looking for a long-flight drone, the Autel Evo Lite+ is a great option. And if you're just starting out, the DJI Mini 2 is an affordable and easy-to-use drone that anyone can fly. With that said, happy flying!
