## 10 Best Sony LUT for Different Purposes

If you've ever worked in the color grading profession, you're aware of how time-consuming and labor-intensive it is to achieve a specific look on a scene. To master color grading, you must practice constantly, one of the reasons for the existence of specialists in this field. While everybody can color grade, not everyone can do it well. People in this business have devised remedies to make the editing workflow considerably more accessible and less time-consuming.

Achieving a specific ambiance in a scene demands ongoing effort and naturally takes longer. LUTs, or Lookup Tables, were created as a result. LUTs are ideal for storing a set of colors to use later or in another program. A LUT is the most effective technique to color or alters your image's colors.

## Benefits of using LUTs

There are numerous advantages to using lookup tables to edit your footage. We've already discussed that it helps to give your films a more polished and professional appearance, which is one of the primary explanations why individuals use LUTs, but there are many more.

### 1\. A beginning towards professionalism

This is a fantastic approach for beginners to have a good idea of how to build their own trademark looks in their videos. The time it takes to develop your color grading craft is unavoidable. So, as a novice, LUTs will come in useful for you to establish your approach and save your ass, big time.

You'll eventually come up with a blend of your own LUTs to use, resulting in your own LUT. Not only will LUTs aid in color grading learning, but they will also save funds and resources. You will not only devote time to learning color grading, but you will also spend a significant amount of money on color grading tools and equipment, such as software and color panels. You'll see why color grading equipment is necessary when you get to this point.

However, for the time being, employing LUTs is the most cost-effective way to obtain a cinematic look.

### 2\. It saves your time

Because LUTs are predefined colors used to establish a specific look on a picture, they save you time. Having a trustworthy LUT to use for video will save the life of freelance editors who are constantly meeting commitments and modifications. Isn't the purpose of color grading to generate a visual emotion for your movie? So, with LUTs, you can create one without going through the time-consuming process of manual color correction. Only one-color preset will be applied to all scenes in a single LUT.

However, there's a good probability that it won't look the same in all of the images. This is where you'll adjust the colors to make them more evenly match the film. It's nothing significant most of the time, just some little saturation adjustments, etc.

### 3\. Work on a budget

Time spent in a color-grade suite may be highly costly, and it can lead your films to go over budget in order to achieve a specific aesthetic. LUTs, on the other hand, are available for free online or for a fee for more complex versions. Even if you buy your LUTs, you could save thousands of dollars based on the size of your film. LUTs can also assist you in meeting tight deadlines, and setting targets too optimistically is something I'm sure we've all done at some point.

Whether it's a client or a personal project, things can often get pushed to the last minute, so having something in your arsenal that can save you time is always a good bonus. There are, however, projects where you need to appear competent without investing a lot of time on them due to budget limits; this is where a lookup table comes in handy because you can modify the complete style of your movie in a matter of seconds by pressing a few buttons. Even complicated editing can be completed quickly, giving you more time to work on other tasks that will earn you more money.

### 4\. It provides an artistic approach

LUTs are beneficial because they allow videos shot with cameras that shoot very dark, discolored images to have more vivid tones and contrast. This is excellent for grabbing viewers' attention and making videos more intriguing and engaging. LUTs add an artistic element to videos and can help you develop a visual artistic identity for your videos if you use the same colors. Another advantage of LUTs is that they enhance the color quality of videos shot on smartphones with particular color schemes. Although this varies significantly from brand to brand, you can use LUTs to make a Smartphone video more vibrant and appealing.

Finally, press the Start Now button on the installation complete prompt window. The software will then launch automatically.

## Adjust the project settings

After the software launches on your device, you should tap on the Create New Project button. Before you add the video file you will edit from your device through; you should take time to change some aspects of the project settings.

For this, click on the File tab at the top-most toolbar in the editor window. You should click on the Project Settings option from the drop-down menu, which will open the dialog box. Under the resolution option, you will see the Frame Rate element. Click on the drop-down menu and adjust the video's frame rate to 25 FPS. After you are done, tap the OK button.

![adjust the frame rate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-falling-text-effect-in-filmora-2.gif)

## Add the Title

Following this, you must click on the Titles tab at the top toolbar on the editor. Different title templates, like Custom, Openers, End Credits, etc., will appear. Choose the default title of your liking and download it.

Next, hold the title that appears in the library window and then drag it to the first layer of the editing timeline. Clip the title short by moving the play head to the 3-second and 15 frames mark and shape the title to that length. Then, delete the rest of the part.

## Edit the Title

After this, you have to double-click on the top of the default title in your Track 1 timeline. A window will appear for editing the title. Click on the Text tab in this window and tap on the Font options. You should change the font of your title to Futura Bold or any other option that you would prefer.

![change the font of the title](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-falling-text-effect-in-filmora-4.gif)

## Animate the characters

When this part is done, in the text field, add the first letter of the text you will add to your animated introduction. After inserting the first letter only, click on the Animation tab next. Following that, you have to move the playhead on your timeline to the very front. You will see the Position parameter in the Animation settings and change the number in the Y axis until it goes out of the top frame of the video.

![change the number on the y axis](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-falling-text-effect-in-filmora-5.gif)

Next, you must move the play head to the 1-second position in the timeline. Here, you must change the number Y axis to a lower position and adjust the Rotate element as per your preference. After that, move the playhead again to 15 frames from the 1-second mark. It would be best if you changed the Y-axis position digit to 0 and adjusted the Rotation value slightly.

Following that, move the playhead again by 15 frames ahead. Rotate the letter again and change the Y-axis value until the letter rests at the bottom of the screen. Again, you have to move the play head on the timeline to 10 frames ahead and adjust the Y-axis and Rotation values to a higher point. Then, continue the step like this at ten frames forward, this time making the character move to the ground again. Press the OK button to complete.

## Repeat for the next letters

After you are done with this editing process for the first letter, hold the default title in the library and drag and drop it into Track 2 on the timeline. Adjust the starting point for this layer to frame five from the beginning, and move the file to that starting point. In the end, cut the title length at the same position as layer one was, at 3.15 seconds.

Follow the process explained in the previous section for the first letter, i.e., moving the playhead at specific frames and changing the Y-axis and Rotation value multiple times.

After editing the second letter in the title, repeat the process of holding and dragging the default title to Track 3 in the timeline and adjusting starting position at the 10th frame. Again, follow the process of animating the letter like for Letter 1 and Letter 2\. Continue doing this process for multiple more letters in your title text.

![follow the process for letters 1 and 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-falling-text-effect-in-filmora-7.gif)

Tap on the Play button under the Preview screen to see how the letters have the falling text effect.

## Add Screenshot

Next, you have to click on the hide button for Tracks 2 and up. Tap on the Snapshot icon in the editing timeline of the first letter. Then, when it appears in the library window, click on it and move it beside the Track 1 Title file that you were editing. Move the play head to the 1-second position of this file in the timeline.

Hide Track 1 again and click the Unhide button on Track 2\. Repeat the snapshot function and add it to Layer 2\. Adjust the end as per Track 1\. After this, follow these steps for the subsequent letters as well.

![tap on the snapshot icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-falling-text-effect-in-filmora-8.gif)

## Adjust Keyframing

Follow the animation process for all of the title clips and screenshots you did before. Move the play head to the point where the Tracks end and the Screenshots on the timeline start. Choose the first letter and click on the Keyframe icon in the editing window under Animation. Then, make adjustments to the values of Position, Rotation, etc.

Continue this keyframing step for all of the letters in sequence. After you are done here, click on the Render Preview icon on the right-hand side of the toolbar above the editing timeline. See how the falling text effects line up.

![click on the render preview icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-falling-text-effect-in-filmora-9.gif)

After that, you can export the final file to your device or do further editing work through the Export button.

## Final Words
