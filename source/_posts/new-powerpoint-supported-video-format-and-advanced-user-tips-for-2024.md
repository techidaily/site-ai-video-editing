## How to Control the Speed of Video

Speed doesn't course at the same level for everyone. You can change momentum. You can slow it down and speed it up to convey a particular mood. In this article, you will learn how and when to control the speed of the video and its importance.

## Importance of Speeding up/Slowing Down Your video?

Speeding up or slowing it down, known as slow or fast motion, can make your video faster or slower than its actual speed, called speed ramping. Overall, adjusting the speed of video clips can enhance the video's visual effects, especially if you want to convey a particular mood to the audience. Speeding up your video may create a comical and dramatic impact, while slowing down your video can give viewers a time-lapse feel or an emotional mood.

This video speed controlling software can instantly speed up video up to 50x times. On the contrary, you can also slow down the video up to 0.1x, which means a one-minute video will run for 10 minutes.

How important is this Feature? The technique plays an essential role in adjusting the video's speed. You will appreciate this technique once you've started editing your video. At first, controlling the speed of your video without music will give you a plain or bare impression. Based on my experience, I cannot quickly identify which video part needs to control the speed. Still, once you've added music at the start, you can quickly determine when and where you should maintain the momentum based on the beat of the music.

## How to Speed up/Slow down a Video?
