When working with Blender, you get to access a variety of graphic nodes that cater to specific design purposes. Likewise, the transparent BSDF, as the name suggests, is an exclusive transparency creation graphic node that is essential to make materials transparent in Blender. Talking of the specific node function, it is there to facilitate the control of different transparency modes, in cohesion with specific user requirements.

Browse through the following section for a guided tutorial to make a material transparent using Blender:

**Step 1:**

Prepare a suitable BSDF material by selecting any image from your device and applying it to the object in the Blender’s viewport.

**Step 2:**

To start working with the Transparent BSDF node, you first need to insert the same into the node tree amongst the Principle BSDF and the Mix Shader nodes. To do this, you need to select ‘Add’ or press ‘Ctrl + A’, followed by locating the same in the ‘Shader’ submenu. Do not forget to add the ‘Mix Shader’ node, which is again, present in the ‘Shader’ submenu, to the node tree.

**Step 3:**

Plug in the Transparent BSDF output into the top Shader input of the Mix Shader, while dragging the latter into the connecting link between the Material Output and Principle BSDF nodes. This enables the Mix Shader node to pass through the two output generating nodes. The resultant ‘Transparency Effect’ can be seen on the viewpoint object within a few seconds.

**Step 4:**

Make an additional connection of two fresh nodes into the node tree as follows:

**●** Transparent BSDF output to the Mix Shader input

**●** Principal BSDF output to the Mix Shader input

**●** Mix Shader output to the Surface input

This will finally fetch a transparent material output for the selected image object.

![luts fo vn editor completed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/luts-fo-vn-editor-completed-1.jpg)

## Part 2\. How to use LUTs in VN editor?

First, we must know that it is compatible with which platforms. So, it is now available for Android, iOS, and Mac OS only. However, you can also use it on Windows with some Android or iOS emulators, but it is not a very continent way in our suggestions. Even after doing this, it does not work well on your Windows. Maybe you will face some glitches or malfunctioning problems. So it is better to use it on only those platforms for which it is primarily available. Please read the instructions below since we will go through how to use LUTs in it later on.

**On Mac:**

First of all, we will learn how you can do it on Mac:

1. Download the VN Editor for Mac and open it.
2. Add your video and then tap the filters option.

![tap the filters option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/luts-fo-vn-editor-completed-2.jpg)

1. Now choose custom filters and then select the LUTs pack.

![select the luts pack](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/luts-fo-vn-editor-completed-3.jpg)

1. Select the desired LUT and apply.

![select the desired lut and apply](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/luts-fo-vn-editor-completed-4.jpg)

**On Mobile:**

Secondly, we will discuss how we can do this on our mobiles (Android or iOS). The procedure on both devices (Android or iOS) is almost comparable. Therefore, we will discuss the steps from the perspective of both of these here:

1. First, download the VN editor from your mobile app store (Android or iOS) and the LUTs pack you want to use in your video.

![download the vn editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/luts-fo-vn-editor-completed-5.jpg)

1. After downloading them on your mobile, open the VN editor application.
2. Create a new project and add your video to it.

![create a new project](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/luts-fo-vn-editor-completed-6.jpg)

1. Then click on the **Filters** option and select add external or custom filters option next to the existing filters.
