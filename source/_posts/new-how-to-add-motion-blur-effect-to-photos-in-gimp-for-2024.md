## Twitch Green Screen Guide

Green screens are a fun way for creators to bring their personality to their stream, allowing them to dynamically alter their stream background and make their content appear even more engaging and polished. With Twitch green screen background, you can easily configure Chroma key settings and detect your green screen with a single click.

The twitch green screen attaches directly to the back of your chair. You don't have to worry about stands, or spacing behind your chair. Just attach it and go. This portable green screen can fit on the back of your chair a feature that makes it easy to assemble and use for start-up twitchers.

## How to set up a Green Screen with Twitch Studio

The Chroma Key section is located at the bottom of the webcam settings, and you will be able to toggle the chroma key on and off by clicking the eye icon.

## Conclusion

You probably already have an idea of how to use a green screen, at least in principle. You film something or someone in front of a colored background — the green screen — then you replace everything that’s in the color of the screen with other footage, images, charts, presentations, or whatever visuals you want. However, Chroma keying a live stream works almost the same way. The main difference is that you have to replace the green screen as you’re filming, rather than during editing.

You film something or someone in front of a colored background — the green screen — then you replace everything that’s in the color of the screen with other footage, images, charts, presentations, or whatever visuals you want. However, Chroma keying a live stream works almost the same way. The main difference is that you have to replace the green screen as you’re filming, rather than during editing.

**Pro tip**:

You can follow the instructions above and live stream to multiple platforms at once with Restream. Multistreaming to platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Twitch, and LinkedIn allows you to drastically increase the audience reach and grow your followers.

### XBOX

It is a video gaming brand created and owned by Microsoft. The brand consists of five video game consoles, as well as applications(games), streaming services, an online service by the name of Xbox network, and the development arm by the name of Xbox Game Studios. The brand was first introduced in the United States in November 2001, with the launch of the original Xbox console.

**Steps on Using Xbox Green Screen**

Make your Xbox console reflect your personal style by changing its look and feel. Choose a favourite colour, update your background with game art or a customised image, or select a different theme.

**Choose your color**

The color you choose will appear in tiles and accents on your Xbox. It also follows you to any console you sign in to.

1. Press the Xboxbutton  on your controller to open the guide, and then select Profile & system > Settings > General > Personalisation > My color & theme > My color.
2. Select a color, and then select OK.

****Choose your background**

Your background appears where you’d expect it to—in the background of Home. It can be a solid color or an image, such as game art, achievement art, a screenshot, or a customized image. Achievement art follows you to any Xbox, but screenshots and customized images stay on the console that they’re set to.

To choose your background, press the Xbox button  on your controller to open the guide, and then select Profile & system > Settings > General > Personalization > My background.

From here, choose from the following options:

****Achievement art**

1. Select Achievement art> Gaming.
2. Select a game from your list of games with achievements.
3. Select the achievement with the background art you want.
4. Select Set as background.

****Custom image**

Note Customized images must be smaller than 3 MB, and the best size for backgrounds is 1920 x 1080.

1. Copy a JPG or PNG file that you want to use to a USB device, and then plug it into your Xbox.
2. On your Xbox, select Customized image. A dialogue box appears that shows the contents of your console and attached USB device.
3. Select the USB device, and then choose your image.

****Screenshot**

1. Select Screenshot, then choose the one you want.
2. Select More actions> Set as background.

****Dynamic background**

3. Select Apply.

To see one of these special dynamic backgrounds in your list of options, make sure your special edition hardware is turned on and in use with your console when you set your background.

****Remove customized background**

If you want to remove your background, select Remove customized background.

****Choose your theme**

Themes can be set to dark or light and can also be scheduled. To set a theme:

1. Press the Xboxbutton  on your controller to open the guide, and then select Profile & system > Settings > General > Personalization.

## Conclusion

You probably already have an idea of how to use a green screen, at least in principle. You film something or someone in front of a colored background — the green screen — then you replace everything that’s in the color of the screen with other footage, images, charts, presentations, or whatever visuals you want. However, Chroma keying a live stream works almost the same way. The main difference is that you have to replace the green screen as you’re filming, rather than during editing.
