## Part 1: Get Zoom on TV with HDMI Cable

Although Zoom provides companies and bigger organizations with a professional solution like Zoom Rooms, if you're at home, you don't need to put anything on your TV to use Zoom. You may start using Zoom right away by simply connecting your Zoom device to your TV. Connect your TV to your laptop's HDMI port if it has one. Simple as that, however if the laptop doesn't figure it out on its own you may need to explain what is going on with the second display. Although more reliable, connecting via cable means your source device is linked to the TV and you can't go for a stroll. It also means you don't have to worry about the wireless connection fading.

Depending on how loud your speakers are set to play and where your input device's microphone is located, this may cause echoing and ever-louder feedback loops. Without further ado, let's look at some of the important strategies you may use to maximize live screen streaming on your Apple TV device.

They are affordable, and any Google browser and the Google Home app for your Android or iOS smartphone both contain the cast capability. Between a device, such as your phone or computer, and the television, Chromecast offers the perfect connection. Chromecast makes it easy to cast Zoom meetings, particularly conferences with many of participants, since it can virtually reflect everything on your phone, tablet, or computer screen to your TV. For meetings with bigger attendance, it is advantageous to be able to cast Zoom meetings to almost any device, even a smart TV, using Chromecast.
