## What is Masking?

Masks are a feature of editing software that allows you to choose a particular portion of the video or utilize video overlays to hide, duplicate, reveal, or change your footage. The mask is the portion of the video you've chosen to pick, either with a template or a custom frame. The mask then becomes isolated, and you may modify it as desired to produce your intended effect.

Masks may be used to do some fantastic things with your videos. You can clone people or objects, overlay several pictures, create glitch effects, blur faces out, etc. Masks add a lot of excitement and color to videos, making them more dynamic, enjoyable to watch, and professional. It can draw attention - and keep it!

Chroma-keying: Chroma-keying is a type of masking that makes use of color to isolate a particular area of the frame. For example, this is often used to remove a green or blue screen from the footage, but can also be used to isolate other colors.

Motion tracking: Motion tracking is a masking technique that allows you to track the movement of an object in a video clip. This is often used to add special effects, such as explosions, to a video.

#### Masking in Filmora 11

Filmora 11 has been modified to allow for the masking of keyframes. First, double-click the clip on your timeline to open a settings window in the library. Then, in the videos area, select the "Mask" option. Multiple forms may be selected here.

We picked the ‘Star' form for this project. After selecting it, you may drag the shape to your clip in the preview area.

Scrolling down in the Windows category will take you to more options where you can change the scale, position, width, height, and radius of your chosen shape. You may also lessen the strength of the form and rotate it to make it blend in better with the other elements you're trying to hide in your window.

To add the keyframe, simply hit the "Add" button after completing it. You may then modify the mask's form to match the added frame.

![top video editor with useful masking - sony vegas pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/masking-video-editing-7.jpg)

#### Masking in Sony Vegas Pro

Step 1: Drag the clip from the Explorer or Project Media windows and drop it on the timeline. Then, look for another video that is quite distinct from the first.

Step 2: Drag it to the timeline below the first video event. A new track will be created. Place the original event directly beneath the video occurrence.

The Video Preview window does not display the second video because it is covered by the first video, which resembles one photo sitting on top of another in a stack. So to view the lower clip, we'll need to add a mask.

### 6\. Magix Movie Edit Pro

Magix Movie Edit Pro is another video editor that is great for adding masks to your video. It is famous for its ease-of-learn and stable rendering. When it comes to masking, it is also quite powerful.

First, click "Create Panel" to create a video mask panel.

To make a panel, use the panel of tools on the left side of the preview window. They'll only be shown in your video when you add assets later if they're inside this panel. Keep in mind that you may modify the size and placement of your asset within the panel and the panel itself; therefore, you might need to.

To access the media selection possibilities, click on the ‘Asset' tab of the mask creation window. To discover the picture or video you want to include in your panel, go through your imported files by selecting ‘Select media.' After that, select the media to be included in your panel video mask and hit ‘Apply.'

Use the left-hand slider or the resizing box in the preview window on the right to change the size and placement of your media in your panel video mask.

To adjust the 3D position of your panel video mask, go to the ‘3D' tab of the mask creation window.

Create an image mask: You may use any picture or video, and it will be resized to fit the shape.

Create a text mask: Enter the text you'd like to appear in your photo. Then, go to the left side of the panel under Font/Paragraph on the left side for font style, size, and other options. To alter the text mask itself, go to the preview window and resize it on the left panel.

## How to Create Vintage Film Effect 1950S

So, what's the difference between a vintage film shot in the 1920s and 1950s? It's simple; in the 1950s, video-making technologies were slightly advanced, although films were more about rock and roll and poodle skirts. So, without further dilly-dallying, let's learn how to create a retro 1950-style video with this simple Filmora tutorial.

## Preparation

![1950 vintage scene](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/1950-vintage-scene.gif)

Shooting a video to teleport yourself to the 1950s doesn't need to be complicated. You simply need to look the part in the video. For example, you can wear velvet-collar jackets, stovepipe trousers, carefully combed back hair, and other trendy styles in the 50s. It's even better if you can find those vintage chairs in your grandparent's collection.

How to create a 1950s vintage film:

##### Step 1 Add your video on [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

![add your video on filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1950s-1.jpg)

First, fire up Filmora and load the video you want to send back to the 1950s. Then, drag your footage onto the editing timeline.

##### Step 2 Apply a cropping effect to the video

![apply a cropping effect to the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1950s-2.jpg)

Once the video is successfully added to Filmora, click the **Effect** tab on the top menu bar and choose the **Crop** effect under the **Utility** folder. Make sure you add the Crop effect two or three tracks above the original video track.

![click the effect tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1950s-3.jpg)

Double-click the Crop effect, then change the Left and Right values to make the video look like it was shot in the 50s. You can set the values as 10.

##### Step 3 Add a Warm Film color effect

![add a warm film color effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1950s-4.jpg)

Up to here, you'll realize that your video doesn't still look like a 1950s film per se. Double-click your video clip and choose the **3D LUT** option under the **Color** category. Then, open the drop-down menu and choose **Warm Film**. This will make your video look like it was shot using an old camera.

##### Step 4 Apply more graininess to the film

![apply more graininess to the film](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1950s-5.jpg)

Please don't stop there; we want to make the footage slightly grainy. In other words, you need to make the footage have a lot of grain and low light. To do that, tap the **Overlay** menu under the Effects tab, then click **Old Film**. After that, choose the **Random Dust, Dirty Film,** and **Subtle Grain** effects and add them to the tracks above your video clip. Remember to use as much grain as possible to give your footage that vintage look of the 1950s.

## Summary

And that's all there is today! With these steps, you can create an engaging 1950s film without breaking a sweat on Filmora. Remember to visit our other vintage tutorials to learn how to create a film recorded in the 20s, 80s, and 90s. Happy editing, everyone!
