Another thing you can do on TikTok is to duet with other TikTok users

![combile-tiktok-videos-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/combile-tiktok-videos-21.jpg)

* To do this, go to TikTok and find the video you would like to duet
* At the end of the screen, click on the ‘share’ option and choose ‘duet’ from the option available
* Tap the red icon at the middle of the screen to start recording your video; your video usually appears on the left while the other video shows up in the right corner.
* Once you’re done recording, click the checkmark icon at the top of the screen to save your recording.
* Replay the duet to ensure you like the result; you can add effects, stickers, and other editing features you want to the video before you post.

1. **Set a Timer for Recording Videos**

One of the ways you can record multiple scenes for a video is by using the recording tool; the steps below show you how to do that.

![combile-tiktok-videos-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/combile-tiktok-videos-22.jpg)

* Once you launch TikTok and click on the camera icon
* Tap the ‘clock’ icon at the side of the screen; you can choose between 3-10 seconds
* Click the red circle to start recording
* A countdown on the screen gives you time to get ready to record. Once the countdown gets to zero, TikTok starts recording your video.

1. **Use the Stitch Feature**

Stitched videos allow you to add the first maker’s details in the new video; these details connect TikTok users to the first video. It is quite easy to stitch one video to another. Simply navigate to the ‘privacy and settings’ tab, and you can enable or disable stitching for your TikTok videos; you can also turn this on and off for your videos. Follow the steps below to stitch your TikTok videos.

![combile-tiktok-videos-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/combile-tiktok-videos-23.jpg)

* Open the TikTok app and choose the video you would like to stitch
* Now choose the three-dot icon and select the ‘advanced’ option
* You can stitch up to five seconds from the video you would like to stick to add to the current video.
* You can add recordings to the stitched option and then stitch them together to post.
