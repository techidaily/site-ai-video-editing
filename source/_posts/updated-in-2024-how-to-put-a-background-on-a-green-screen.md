## Part 1\. How to put a background on a green screen to video?

The first thing you need to do is shoot your video with high-quality green screen in the background. Make sure that it is evenly spread and lit up so that there are no light and dark patches. Now that you have green screen video, you will need a professional video editor to replace the green screen with any background as per your requirements. Here are the three ways on how to add background to green screen.

### Way 1\. Use Filmora

[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is the easiest video editor to add a background to green screen video instantly. Filmora is a professional video editor with an intuitive user interface. There are loads of tools to add visual effects and perform basic to advanced editing. Filmora is available for Windows and Mac users and you have to transfer your recorded green screen video to your computer.

Step3 Double-click on the video clip that you have dropped on Timeline. Go to Video tab and turn on Chroma Key option.

![double click on the video clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/green-screen-overlay-video-chroma-key-settings.jpg)

### Way 2\. Use iMovie

iMovie is one of the most preferred video editors among Mac and iPhone users. This is because the app comes from Apple, and there are ample features to enhance your video content and quality with effects. Adding a background to a green screen video using iMovie is quite easy. But replacing a background of a video without green screen is rather tough.

Step1 Launch iMovie from Applications folder on your Mac as it comes pre-installed.

Step2 Import your green screen video as well as replacement background video or photo to Project Media folder.

Step3 Drag and drop them into Timeline and place the green screen video above the replacement background video/photo. Make sure that the duration of both videos is the same.

![drag green screen video imovie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/drag-green-screen-video-imovie.jpg)

Step4 Click on the green screen video and click on Video Overlay Settings and select Green/Blue Screen option from the drop-down menu.

![remove green screen video imovie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/remove-green-screen-video-imovie.jpg)

Step5 You can adjust Softness as well as Clean-up option so that the green screen effect is perfect.

You can replace green screen background with any desired background video or image. Here are the steps on how to add background to green screen in Premiere Pro.
