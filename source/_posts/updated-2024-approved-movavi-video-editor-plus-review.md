## **What Makes Movavi Video Editor Plus Appealing To Consumers?**

**[Movavi Video Editor Plus 2022](https://isoftfinder.com/blog/unbiased-review-for-movavi-video-editor-plus.html)** has a lot to offer in terms of features. Object Animation, Automatic Video Creation, and more built-in media are the highlights of Video Editor Plus 2022\. Let's see how they work together!

### **Interface**

The Movavi Video Editor Plus 2022 is one of Movavi's aesthetically pleasing apps. When selecting different tabs on the upper part of the interface, toolbars and tabs can be found at the top or on the left, and the tools will expand. Right on the right is a player that lets you preview samples of videos, transitions, titles, and so on. Even dozens of tracks can be added and edited at once to create your video, as you can add video, audio, and images to the timeline at the bottom.

### **Quick Video Creation**

This is one of the best features of this video editor. Adding a video, selecting a template, then adding loyalty-free audios will quickly create a video with the help of the video creation wizard.

### **Editing Tools**

You can edit your videos with all the editing tools necessary to make them more personal, such as Rotate, Crop, Trim, Split, Stabilize, Adjust colors, Combine, Stabilize, Pan and Zoom, Slow motion, Chroma key, Scene detection, Animate, Highlight & Concealed, Add logo, Overlay, etc. Applying an editing tool is as simple as selecting a video, choosing a tool, and configuring the settings.

In addition, it allows editing of video and audio properties, providing excellent detail treatment. A video can be sped up or lowered, normalized, changed opacity, reversed, faded in or out, and synchronized, equalized, noise removed, audio effects added, and the beat detected.

### **Creativity: Filters, Transitions, Titles and Stickers**

To make your video more personal, you will need to add filters, titles, transitions, and stickers. Movavi video editor offers free templates built-in and templates that can be purchased from its store. It has all the templates organized into themes, the design is very pleasing to the eye, and we are more likely to try these effects.

### **Sharing and output**

Unless you're actively streaming videos on video streaming platforms, this sharing feature may be helpful for you. Logging in allows you to upload videos directly to YouTube, YouTube Video, and Google Drive.

The export feature supports a wide range of video and audio formats that are highly frequently used. Leave them alone if you don't have a good reason to change the output settings. The program will display the current file size when you choose a different video quality, which is useful if you have limited storage space.

### **Tutorials**

It isn't easy to edit videos, unlike other tasks. An online video tutorial will be of great help if you wish to learn how to effectively use a video editor and perform specific video editing tasks.

Movi's instructions explain how to add files to the program and how to edit videos when you first run it. Additionally, it organizes all video tutorials in one place in the Notification panel for performing specific video editing tasks. You can play a tutorial by scrolling down. Every week, the tutorials are updated, greatly reducing the time it takes to get started with this tool and inspiring us to create amazing videos we would never have dreamed of.

## **Final Verdict**

There is no doubt that Movavi is a great video editor. It is often compared with the Movavi video suite, but they have their usage. It is feature-rich and comes with a variety of options. Overall, it is good, but if you are looking for something very professional and easy to use, it might not be the right option. Over the years, the Movavi downloads have increased rapidly, but if you want to create professional and eye-catching videos, then we recommend you to use the Filmora X video editor.

If you compare both these video editors, then you will find that Filmora is the more suitable option.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

From the Downloads section of your browser, double-click on it and press the Install button when it appears. Give the necessary permissions that it prompts.

![click on the download button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-1.jpg)

Then, the software will start the installation instantly, likely taking a few seconds to complete.

## 2\. Add the Default Title and Edit its Font

After Filmora launches, click on the "Create New Project" button on the homepage of the editor. Then, click on the Title tab from the top toolbar and choose the default title available here. Drag it and drop it onto the editing timeline below on Track 1.

Double-click on the title on the timeline, which will open the text editing window. Under the Text's Preset tab, you will find the parameters for changing the main fault. Adjust the font style to the Impact style (or any bold title style you prefer), and click on the text field to add your custom title.

Following that, click on the text size option and change it to 15\. Scroll down the menu to the Text Spacing section. Change the value to 20 and tap on the OK button afterward.

![change the value here to 20](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-2.jpg)

## 3\. Split the title

On the editing timeline, tap on the Track 1 clip and click on the Snapshot icon at the far right side of the toolbar just above the timeline. This will automatically save in the media library section.

Then, take hold of the playhead on the timeline at the 3rd frame mark. Then, tap on the Scissor icon on the play head, which will split the clip into two portions. Click on the part following the 3rd frame mark and delete it.

![split the clip into two portions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-3.jpg)

## 4\. Copy the clipped section multiple times

Then, double-click on the amount still available on the timeline to open the title editor section again. Make changes to the title you added here, only keeping the first letter.

Click on this clipped section on the timeline and copy it. Next, keep copying this clip multiple times continuously until the length of the collection on Track 1 to the 5-second mark.

Following that, zoom in on the timeline for a better view of these clipped parts. Choose the last clip that you copied and drag it to expand its time duration to the 6:15 mark.

![change the character](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-5.jpg)

Repeat the same for all the split parts following the first one, changing the character to any random alphabet.

However, keep the last elongated clip the same character as you originally put it.

## 6\. Export the first letter clip

Then, please tap on the Export button at the top of the screen and add a name, like the first letter of your title. Click on the Settings button on this page to adjust the resolution and quality of the clip to the highest resolution for the best results.

After exporting the first file that will ultimately become the first letter of your random letter reveal intro title, you have to make the second letter-related clip.

For this, tap on the last clip on the timeline and double-click on it. Change the text in this clip to the second letter of your title. After doing this, go back to the first clip of your collection and double-click on it after selling it. Tap on the text field and give it another random letter.

![tap on the text field](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-6.jpg)

Like with the first clip, continue doing this step for all of the next clips, except for the final clip. Then, export it in the same manner as the first clip.
