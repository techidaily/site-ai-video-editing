## How to Record Super Slow Motion Videos on Your Huawei/Samsung/iPhone?

**Super Slow Motion** has long been among the finest (and most exploited) video effects. The method was initially limited to high-end lenses, but super slo-mo has become increasingly superior as smartphone technology advances.

Super slo-mo is a terrific technique to learn how to use if you want to accentuate a dramatic moment or extend the humiliation of a friend you captured in an embarrassing scenario. This article has stepwise guides and tips for recording super slo-mo on your phone. Let's get going!

#### In this article

01 [What's the Difference Between Slow-Mo and Super Slow-Mo?](#part1)

02 [How to Record Super Slo-Mo Videos with Samsung Galaxy S20 and Later models?](#part2)

03 [How to Edit Super Slow Motion Video in Samsung Galaxy S21?](#part3)

04 [How to Record Super Slow Motion Video with Huawei Mate 20 and Later Phones?](#part4)

05 [How to Shoot Slo-Mo Videos on iPhone?](#part5)

06 [Tips for Recording Super Slow Motion Video](#part6)

## Part 1: What's the Difference Between Slow-Mo and Super Slow-Mo?

Super Slow-Mo (960fps) is a technology that allows users to shoot films at 960fps using a top-speed lens, capturing events that the naked eye cannot ordinarily notice by viewing them 32 times slower than regular videos (30fps) and four times slower than videos produced using the current Slow Motion feature (240fps).

Super Slow-mo movie may be displayed as 6-12 sec long on old smartphones, such as Galaxy S9/S9+ and Note9\. However, the newer versions, such as Galaxy S10 Series, can play super slow-mo movies up to 14.8 sec.

You'll understand the difference between the Slow-Mo and Super Slow-Mo better after reading the below information:

**Slow Motion**

 Video is produced at an 8-times slower rate than usual, equivalent to the speed of a movie, advertisement, or sporting event.

**Super Slow Motion**

Videos are played 32 times slower than usual, catching minute changes in facial gestures and fast-moving elements.

## Part 2: How to Record Super Slo-Mo Videos with Samsung Galaxy S20 and Later models?

**Models That Support Super Slow-Mo:** Galaxy S20, Galaxy S20+, Galaxy S20+ Ultra, Galaxy Z Flip, and later models.

Slow-motion video is often created by filming at a fast frame per second (fps) speed and then playing back at a far slower pace. This results in intriguing videos with slowed-down motion. The event is captured at 960 frames per second with the Super Slow-mo function, four times quicker than conventional slow motion. When it's replayed at 30 frames per second, it's 32 times slower, making mundane moments appear spectacular.

To capture super slow-motion videos with your Samsung Galaxy S20 and later models, follow the instructions below:

**Step 1:** Launch the camera on your phone by tapping the **Camera** app.

**Step 2:** Now, click on the **Super Slow-Mo** option to proceed.

**Step 3:** Press the **White Circle** in the center to start the recording and press it again to stop when you are done.

**Note:** Make sure that your phone's video resolution is already on HD because Super Slow-Mo only supports HD resolutions.

## Part 3: How to Edit Super Slow Motion Video in Samsung Galaxy S21?

Only capturing the super slow-motion videos is not enough, especially if you are a content creator. Even in the super slow-mo, there might be some unnecessary parts (since it is more detailed) that you need to cut out or the parts that need some enhancements to make the video look captivating.

However, not every phone is eligible to edit super slow-mo videos by not degrading the video resolutions. But Samsung Galaxy S21 allows you to do that by keeping the video resolution intact. You can edit the Super Slow-Mo videos with Galaxy S21 by following these instructions:

**Step 1:** Open the **Camera** app and navigate the super slow-mo video you wish to edit.

**Step 2:** Now, play it and tap the screen. You will see **three vertical dots** in the right corner. Click on them.

**Step 3:** Select the **Editor** option from the dropdown menu that appears.

**Step 4:** After that, you can adjust the length, crop the video, add effects, add stickers, add music, etc., by selecting from the bottom menu.

**Step 5:** After you're done editing, click on the **Save** option at the top to save the video to your **Gallery**.

![edit slow motion video samsung galaxy phone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-slow-motion-video-samsung-galaxy-phone.jpg)

## Part 4: How to Record Super Slow Motion Video with Huawei Mate 20 and Later Phones?

**Models That Support Super Slow-Mo:** Huawei Mate 20/20 Pro/20 X and later Mate models.

Before we demonstrate how to capture a super slow-mo with a Huawei Mate 20 and later models, we'll explain this popular capture mode.

To begin, you should be aware that a camera/camera sensor collects a specific number of frames per second. The movie becomes legible by combining these pictures; the more images there are, the more fluent the video will be. The naked eye is thought to decipher about 60 pictures every second.

The benefit of improved camera sensors is that you can capture a maximum number of photos per second (some smartphones can record up to 960 / second) and slow down the sampling rate to produce a super slow-motion effect on the Huawei Mate 20 or later models.

Now, follow the stepwise guide to record super slow-mo with Huawei Mate 40 or later models:

**Step 1:** Launch your phone's **Camera** go to **More** to select the **Slow-Mo** option.

**Step 2:** By default, you will see 4x on the slow-mo capture mode, which means the video will be recorded at 120FPS. Huawei Mate 40 allows you to capture up to 128X, i.e, 3840FPS for fast moving objects. To enable the **Super Slo-Mo** feature, select the **32X or 128X** in this mode.

**Step 3:** Click on the **Circle** in the center to start and stop the recording. The video will be saved in your **Gallery**.

## Part 5: How to Shoot Slo-Mo Videos on iPhone?

Slow-motion film on your iPhone essentially means slowing the fps so that everything appears to move slower inside the video. It is a popular effect employed by artists to produce one-of-a-kind video clips of sports footage, natural scenes, or sequences with a lot of dramatic motion.

Slow-motion films are supported by all iPhones, beginning with the 5S model, and the capability gets more robust and more stable with each successive generation. Shooting slow-motion films with your iPhone are addicting and enjoyable, and it adds drama to various settings.

Here is a step-by-step method for filming slow-mo with an iPhone, regardless of model.

**Step 1:** Launch the **Camera** app on your iPhone and go to the **Slow-Mo** effect by sliding from the options above. Change the frame rate on the upper right corner to 120, 240, 720, depending on the iPhone models you’re using.

**Step 2:** Now, start the recording by clicking the **Red Circle** in the center or either of the **Volume** button.

**Step 3:** After you're done recording, press the **Red Circle** again and head towards the **Gallery** to view the recorded video.

## Part 6: Tips for Recording Super Slow Motion Video

Although super slow-motion videos are easy to record, they can be challenging for a content creator. But don't worry, with the following tips, we have got you covered:

**Utilize A Tripod**

It's critical to keep your phone as steady as possible when filming in Super Slow-mo since shaking might conflict with your video and hinder it from recognizing motions when set to auto-record. To get the most out of Super Slow-mo, we recommend using a tripod whenever feasible.

_You can check these_ [_tripods for iPhone_](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**Transition Between Single and Multi-Takes**

To boost your chances of catching the ideal timing in Super Slow-mo, your phone allows you to record in Multi-Take mode, which can capture many bursts of Super Slow-mo in one video.

When combined with an auto record, additional Super Slow-mo videos will be captured as much as the focus box senses activity and will end only when you end filming. The manual record works similarly. However, you'll have to physically hit the trigger each time you wish to record a picture in Super Slow-mo.

As the name indicates, Single-Take will record a single Super Slow-mo clip and then cease recording a moment or two later. Because Multi-Take clips are often more extensive, this could save a large storage capacity.

**Readjust the Focus**

The focus or auto-recording is tiny by default. Fortunately, you can enlarge it to improve its odds of recognizing movement. To adjust the size of the box, hold it until only its edges are visible, then move any corner from the others to expand the box's area. Simply tap anywhere outside the borders to verify the adjustment when you're happy with the size.

**Capture in Natural Light**

Because of the large number of frames it collects, Super Slow-mo works the best in natural daylight situations. Though not visible to the human eye, indoor lighting, especially LED bulbs and tiny fluorescents, seems to flash at very high rates. Even if the environment is well-lit, Super Slow-mo detects this and shows your subject in a substantially darker tone.

**View the Video at Normal Speed**

If you wish to watch your Super Slow-mo movies at regular speed, deactivate Super Slow-mo playing by tapping on the option directly below the video. This will give you a greater understanding of your phone's incredible capacity to bring the world to a halt.

## Part 4: How to Record Super Slow Motion Video with Huawei Mate 20 and Later Phones?

**Models That Support Super Slow-Mo:** Huawei Mate 20/20 Pro/20 X and later Mate models.

Before we demonstrate how to capture a super slow-mo with a Huawei Mate 20 and later models, we'll explain this popular capture mode.

To begin, you should be aware that a camera/camera sensor collects a specific number of frames per second. The movie becomes legible by combining these pictures; the more images there are, the more fluent the video will be. The naked eye is thought to decipher about 60 pictures every second.

The benefit of improved camera sensors is that you can capture a maximum number of photos per second (some smartphones can record up to 960 / second) and slow down the sampling rate to produce a super slow-motion effect on the Huawei Mate 20 or later models.

Now, follow the stepwise guide to record super slow-mo with Huawei Mate 40 or later models:

**Step 1:** Launch your phone's **Camera** go to **More** to select the **Slow-Mo** option.

**Step 2:** By default, you will see 4x on the slow-mo capture mode, which means the video will be recorded at 120FPS. Huawei Mate 40 allows you to capture up to 128X, i.e, 3840FPS for fast moving objects. To enable the **Super Slo-Mo** feature, select the **32X or 128X** in this mode.

**Step 3:** Click on the **Circle** in the center to start and stop the recording. The video will be saved in your **Gallery**.

## Part 5: How to Shoot Slo-Mo Videos on iPhone?

Slow-motion film on your iPhone essentially means slowing the fps so that everything appears to move slower inside the video. It is a popular effect employed by artists to produce one-of-a-kind video clips of sports footage, natural scenes, or sequences with a lot of dramatic motion.

Slow-motion films are supported by all iPhones, beginning with the 5S model, and the capability gets more robust and more stable with each successive generation. Shooting slow-motion films with your iPhone are addicting and enjoyable, and it adds drama to various settings.

Here is a step-by-step method for filming slow-mo with an iPhone, regardless of model.

**Step 1:** Launch the **Camera** app on your iPhone and go to the **Slow-Mo** effect by sliding from the options above. Change the frame rate on the upper right corner to 120, 240, 720, depending on the iPhone models you’re using.

**Step 2:** Now, start the recording by clicking the **Red Circle** in the center or either of the **Volume** button.

**Step 3:** After you're done recording, press the **Red Circle** again and head towards the **Gallery** to view the recorded video.

## Part 6: Tips for Recording Super Slow Motion Video

Although super slow-motion videos are easy to record, they can be challenging for a content creator. But don't worry, with the following tips, we have got you covered:

**Utilize A Tripod**

It's critical to keep your phone as steady as possible when filming in Super Slow-mo since shaking might conflict with your video and hinder it from recognizing motions when set to auto-record. To get the most out of Super Slow-mo, we recommend using a tripod whenever feasible.

_You can check these_ [_tripods for iPhone_](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**Transition Between Single and Multi-Takes**

To boost your chances of catching the ideal timing in Super Slow-mo, your phone allows you to record in Multi-Take mode, which can capture many bursts of Super Slow-mo in one video.

When combined with an auto record, additional Super Slow-mo videos will be captured as much as the focus box senses activity and will end only when you end filming. The manual record works similarly. However, you'll have to physically hit the trigger each time you wish to record a picture in Super Slow-mo.

As the name indicates, Single-Take will record a single Super Slow-mo clip and then cease recording a moment or two later. Because Multi-Take clips are often more extensive, this could save a large storage capacity.

**Readjust the Focus**

The focus or auto-recording is tiny by default. Fortunately, you can enlarge it to improve its odds of recognizing movement. To adjust the size of the box, hold it until only its edges are visible, then move any corner from the others to expand the box's area. Simply tap anywhere outside the borders to verify the adjustment when you're happy with the size.

**Capture in Natural Light**

Because of the large number of frames it collects, Super Slow-mo works the best in natural daylight situations. Though not visible to the human eye, indoor lighting, especially LED bulbs and tiny fluorescents, seems to flash at very high rates. Even if the environment is well-lit, Super Slow-mo detects this and shows your subject in a substantially darker tone.

**View the Video at Normal Speed**

If you wish to watch your Super Slow-mo movies at regular speed, deactivate Super Slow-mo playing by tapping on the option directly below the video. This will give you a greater understanding of your phone's incredible capacity to bring the world to a halt.

**Conclusion**

**Super Slow Motion** videos are excellent for showcasing the action and conveying tales, and they are also entertaining and straightforward to create. Your only constraints are time and imagination. However, your Android or iPhone's camera has many more tricks in its sleeve: Live images, time-lapse, Panoramas, and Portrait mode let you express yourself freely!

06 [Tips for Recording Super Slow Motion Video](#part6)

## Part 1: What's the Difference Between Slow-Mo and Super Slow-Mo?

Super Slow-Mo (960fps) is a technology that allows users to shoot films at 960fps using a top-speed lens, capturing events that the naked eye cannot ordinarily notice by viewing them 32 times slower than regular videos (30fps) and four times slower than videos produced using the current Slow Motion feature (240fps).

Super Slow-mo movie may be displayed as 6-12 sec long on old smartphones, such as Galaxy S9/S9+ and Note9\. However, the newer versions, such as Galaxy S10 Series, can play super slow-mo movies up to 14.8 sec.

You'll understand the difference between the Slow-Mo and Super Slow-Mo better after reading the below information:

**Slow Motion**

 Video is produced at an 8-times slower rate than usual, equivalent to the speed of a movie, advertisement, or sporting event.

**Super Slow Motion**

Videos are played 32 times slower than usual, catching minute changes in facial gestures and fast-moving elements.

## Part 2: How to Record Super Slo-Mo Videos with Samsung Galaxy S20 and Later models?

**Models That Support Super Slow-Mo:** Galaxy S20, Galaxy S20+, Galaxy S20+ Ultra, Galaxy Z Flip, and later models.

Slow-motion video is often created by filming at a fast frame per second (fps) speed and then playing back at a far slower pace. This results in intriguing videos with slowed-down motion. The event is captured at 960 frames per second with the Super Slow-mo function, four times quicker than conventional slow motion. When it's replayed at 30 frames per second, it's 32 times slower, making mundane moments appear spectacular.

To capture super slow-motion videos with your Samsung Galaxy S20 and later models, follow the instructions below:

**Step 1:** Launch the camera on your phone by tapping the **Camera** app.

**Step 2:** Now, click on the **Super Slow-Mo** option to proceed.

**Step 3:** Press the **White Circle** in the center to start the recording and press it again to stop when you are done.

**Note:** Make sure that your phone's video resolution is already on HD because Super Slow-Mo only supports HD resolutions.

## Part 3: How to Edit Super Slow Motion Video in Samsung Galaxy S21?

Only capturing the super slow-motion videos is not enough, especially if you are a content creator. Even in the super slow-mo, there might be some unnecessary parts (since it is more detailed) that you need to cut out or the parts that need some enhancements to make the video look captivating.

However, not every phone is eligible to edit super slow-mo videos by not degrading the video resolutions. But Samsung Galaxy S21 allows you to do that by keeping the video resolution intact. You can edit the Super Slow-Mo videos with Galaxy S21 by following these instructions:

**Step 1:** Open the **Camera** app and navigate the super slow-mo video you wish to edit.

**Step 2:** Now, play it and tap the screen. You will see **three vertical dots** in the right corner. Click on them.

**Step 3:** Select the **Editor** option from the dropdown menu that appears.

**Step 4:** After that, you can adjust the length, crop the video, add effects, add stickers, add music, etc., by selecting from the bottom menu.

**Step 5:** After you're done editing, click on the **Save** option at the top to save the video to your **Gallery**.

## Part 1\. What Are The Benefits of Adding Text Behind Objects in Videos?

Your videos must maintain quality to create content worthy of a huge audience. You may have a YouTube channel or be starting down the road. Then you must give this a try because

### Show creativity

Blasting your channel with innovative and creative content is the key to building a big audience. But, of course, you can always opt for many ways to create a video showing your creativity. One of those ways is to add text behind your object.

![adding video to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-3.png)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Adding video to the timelines will allow you to create a workspace to edit your video.

Now let's move on to how we will add the text tile to our video.

##### Step3 Add the Text Tile

It is time to add the text tile you will animate behind the object. To do that, follow the steps mentioned as such.:

* Go to the **Titles** icon on the bar above the import library.
* A drop-down option will be available on the left side.
* Scroll down to the **Plain text**.
* Here, you can see many text tiles to add to your video.
* You can choose anyone you like.
* The most commonly used tile is the **Basic 6**.
* When you add the text tile to the timeline, you must ensure that the text is of equal length to the video.
* To do that, drag the right corner of the text tile and drag it to the right to match the length of the video.

![choose the text tile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-4.png)

##### Step4 Edit the Text Tile

After you have added the text tile you desire, you need to type in the text. For this article, we will keep it simple. We will be typing a simple statement such as "**Hello, World.**"

* Double-click the Text tile to open the settings menu.
* After the settings menu is opened, type in the text box on the import window.

You will notice changes on the main window that your text has changed.

![edit the text tile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-5.png)

* After the text appears, you can make the font look as desired.
* Look above the text window, and you will see the type of text font selected.
* Click on the drop-down option and choose whatever you like.

Let's move on to animate the text tile.

##### Step5 Animate the text tile

After adding text, it is time to animate it. This animation will decide how your text will appear behind the target object.

* First, you must open the text settings by **double-clicking** on the text tile in the timeline.
* In the settings opened in the import window, you will have to click on the animation tab in the upper left corner, aside from the **Preset**
* Now scroll down to where you will see the **Right Roll**
* Click on **Right Roll** and then click on the **OK** in the bottom right corner of the import window.

![animate the text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-6.png)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You may notice now that the text appears in front of our object. Don't worry now! We are getting there. With a few simple steps, we will see the results.

Now let us move on to the more significant part of the editing, masking the object. Again, look ahead to see how you can mask the object!

##### Step6 Mask the Object

To mask our object, we will need to be technical. We will begin by adding the same footage of the static object on our timeline. Follow the steps mentioned below:

* Drag and drop the static object footage above the timeline text. Make sure the text stays in the middle of the sandwich.

![add the main video above the text tile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-7.png)

* We will hide the video in the first track to simplify things. In addition, this will make our editing easier.
* We will have to look in the effects library to insert the masking effect.
* You can see the **Effects** icon on the bar at the top.
* Click on the **Effects**.
* You will see the search bar at the top of the import window.
* In the search bar, type in Image mask.
* Drag the **Image mask** effect on the video above the text tile.

Now the masking effect has been added. But we would have to adjust so that it stays upon our object.

* **Double-click** on the video and the settings option will open up.
* Go into the **Effects**

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You must select your target object's mask shape exactly as its shape.

* We have to mask out a building, so that we will need a vertical rectangle.

![change the shape of the image mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-8.png)

* After you have selected the shape of your object, we will need to convert it to the object's size so that it only masks the building.
* To do that, scroll down below the import window to the settings.
* Here you can see the X, Y, and width settings.
* First, move the width bar so that it matches the width of the building.

![change the width of the mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-9.png)

* Now drag the X bar until the mask is confined to the building. You would have created the mask only limited to the building.

![change the position of the mask by dragging x](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-10.png)

* Once you complete this step, click OK in the bottom right corner.
* Now un-hide the original video that you imported in the beginning.

Finally, play the video in the main play window from the beginning.

![final result of the static video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-11.gif)

You have successfully created a text behind the object effect. Now that you know how to add text behind static objects let us move to learn how to add text to a video that has high contrast and a clean background.

### Add text behind a high contrast and clean background

Besides the text can be added behind a static object, it can also be added to a clean background with high contrast. But how is it? Let's dive into it.

##### Step1 Import the video into the timeline

* Import the video from the location in your PC media.
* When imported, drag and drop it onto the timeline.

![add the footage to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-12.png)

##### Step2 Add the text tile

To add the text to your video, follow the steps mentioned below.

* Click on the titles icon on the bar above the import window.
* On the left drop-down option, scroll down to the titles.
* Select the Plain text option.
* You will notice that multiple options will pop up in the import window.
* Select the text title that suits you best.
* After you have selected the text style, drag and drop it down above your video in the timeline.

![add the text tile above the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-13.png)

* Our next step would be to add the text.
* **Double-click** on the text tile. Doing so will open the settings menu in the import window.
* Type in the text that you want. For reference, we will keep it simple such as, **"Hello world."**

* Select the font you desire.

![type in the text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-14.png)

Now that you have added the text, it is time to animate it.

##### Step3 Take a snapshot

After typing in the text, you will notice in the main play window that your text still appears in front of your object. Therefore, we want to take it behind the object. To do so, first, you will need to take a snapshot.

Follow the steps mentioned to take a snapshot:

* Hide the main video. You can see the Eye icon aside from your main video in the edit column on the left side of the timeline.
* Click on the Eye icon to hide the main video.
* In the **main play** window, you will notice that the screen turns black, which leaves only the text on the screen.

![taking a snapshot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-15.png)

* In the main play screen, you can notice a small **camera icon**.
* This camera icon is used to take snapshots of your screen.
* Click on the camera icon to take a snapshot of your screen.
* Your snapshot will now be saved in the main import window.

![snapshot is saved in the import library](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-16.png)

Now that we have taken a snapshot, we will need to import it into the timeline. Scroll below for more.

##### Step4 Add the snapshot

After taking it, your goal is to import it into the timeline. To perform this action, perform the following steps:

* Before adding the snapshot to the timeline, we must delete the main text tile.
* Then drag and drop the snapshot from the import library into the timeline above the video.
* Make sure that the snapshot is aligned well with the length of the video.
* If it is **longer** than the video, drag it from the right to match the length of the video.
* If its length is **smaller** than the video, drag it to the right to increase its length.

![adjust the length of the snapshot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-17.png)

After adding the snapshot, we will have to change its blending mode.

##### Step5 Change the blending of the snapshot

To create the effect of your text behind the video, you must alter the main text's blending mode. In this case, it will be the snapshot we took.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Changing the blending mode of the snapshot will allow it to blend with the transparent background and will create the effect of the text behind the object in the video.

Follow the steps mentioned below to change the blending of the snapshot:

**Note:** Adding video to the timelines will allow you to create a workspace to edit your video.

Now let's move on to how we will add the text tile to our video.

##### Step3 Add the Text Tile

It is time to add the text tile you will animate behind the object. To do that, follow the steps mentioned as such.:

* Go to the **Titles** icon on the bar above the import library.
* A drop-down option will be available on the left side.
* Scroll down to the **Plain text**.
* Here, you can see many text tiles to add to your video.
* You can choose anyone you like.
* The most commonly used tile is the **Basic 6**.
* When you add the text tile to the timeline, you must ensure that the text is of equal length to the video.
* To do that, drag the right corner of the text tile and drag it to the right to match the length of the video.

![choose the text tile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-4.png)

##### Step4 Edit the Text Tile

After you have added the text tile you desire, you need to type in the text. For this article, we will keep it simple. We will be typing a simple statement such as "**Hello, World.**"

* Double-click the Text tile to open the settings menu.
* After the settings menu is opened, type in the text box on the import window.

You will notice changes on the main window that your text has changed.

![edit the text tile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-5.png)

* After the text appears, you can make the font look as desired.
* Look above the text window, and you will see the type of text font selected.
* Click on the drop-down option and choose whatever you like.

Let's move on to animate the text tile.

##### Step5 Animate the text tile

After adding text, it is time to animate it. This animation will decide how your text will appear behind the target object.

* First, you must open the text settings by **double-clicking** on the text tile in the timeline.
* In the settings opened in the import window, you will have to click on the animation tab in the upper left corner, aside from the **Preset**
* Now scroll down to where you will see the **Right Roll**
* Click on **Right Roll** and then click on the **OK** in the bottom right corner of the import window.

![animate the text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-6.png)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You may notice now that the text appears in front of our object. Don't worry now! We are getting there. With a few simple steps, we will see the results.

Now let us move on to the more significant part of the editing, masking the object. Again, look ahead to see how you can mask the object!

##### Step6 Mask the Object

To mask our object, we will need to be technical. We will begin by adding the same footage of the static object on our timeline. Follow the steps mentioned below:

* Drag and drop the static object footage above the timeline text. Make sure the text stays in the middle of the sandwich.

![add the main video above the text tile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-7.png)

* We will hide the video in the first track to simplify things. In addition, this will make our editing easier.
* We will have to look in the effects library to insert the masking effect.
* You can see the **Effects** icon on the bar at the top.
* Click on the **Effects**.
* You will see the search bar at the top of the import window.
* In the search bar, type in Image mask.
* Drag the **Image mask** effect on the video above the text tile.

Now the masking effect has been added. But we would have to adjust so that it stays upon our object.

* **Double-click** on the video and the settings option will open up.
* Go into the **Effects**

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You must select your target object's mask shape exactly as its shape.

* We have to mask out a building, so that we will need a vertical rectangle.

![change the shape of the image mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-8.png)

* After you have selected the shape of your object, we will need to convert it to the object's size so that it only masks the building.
* To do that, scroll down below the import window to the settings.
* Here you can see the X, Y, and width settings.
* First, move the width bar so that it matches the width of the building.

![change the width of the mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-9.png)

* Now drag the X bar until the mask is confined to the building. You would have created the mask only limited to the building.

![change the position of the mask by dragging x](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-10.png)

* Once you complete this step, click OK in the bottom right corner.
* Now un-hide the original video that you imported in the beginning.

Finally, play the video in the main play window from the beginning.

![final result of the static video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-11.gif)

You have successfully created a text behind the object effect. Now that you know how to add text behind static objects let us move to learn how to add text to a video that has high contrast and a clean background.

### Add text behind a high contrast and clean background

Besides the text can be added behind a static object, it can also be added to a clean background with high contrast. But how is it? Let's dive into it.

##### Step1 Import the video into the timeline

* Import the video from the location in your PC media.
* When imported, drag and drop it onto the timeline.

![add the footage to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-12.png)

##### Step2 Add the text tile

To add the text to your video, follow the steps mentioned below.

* Click on the titles icon on the bar above the import window.
* On the left drop-down option, scroll down to the titles.
* Select the Plain text option.
* You will notice that multiple options will pop up in the import window.
* Select the text title that suits you best.
* After you have selected the text style, drag and drop it down above your video in the timeline.

![add the text tile above the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-13.png)

* Our next step would be to add the text.
* **Double-click** on the text tile. Doing so will open the settings menu in the import window.
* Type in the text that you want. For reference, we will keep it simple such as, **"Hello world."**
* You can also adjust the font of your text.
* Above the type box, a drop-down option will show you the range of fonts available.
* Select the font you desire.

![type in the text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-14.png)

Now that you have added the text, it is time to animate it.

##### Step3 Take a snapshot

After typing in the text, you will notice in the main play window that your text still appears in front of your object. Therefore, we want to take it behind the object. To do so, first, you will need to take a snapshot.

Follow the steps mentioned to take a snapshot:

* Hide the main video. You can see the Eye icon aside from your main video in the edit column on the left side of the timeline.
* Click on the Eye icon to hide the main video.
* In the **main play** window, you will notice that the screen turns black, which leaves only the text on the screen.

![taking a snapshot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-15.png)

* In the main play screen, you can notice a small **camera icon**.
* This camera icon is used to take snapshots of your screen.
* Click on the camera icon to take a snapshot of your screen.
* Your snapshot will now be saved in the main import window.

![snapshot is saved in the import library](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-16.png)

Now that we have taken a snapshot, we will need to import it into the timeline. Scroll below for more.

##### Step4 Add the snapshot

After taking it, your goal is to import it into the timeline. To perform this action, perform the following steps:

* Before adding the snapshot to the timeline, we must delete the main text tile.
* Then drag and drop the snapshot from the import library into the timeline above the video.
* Make sure that the snapshot is aligned well with the length of the video.
* If it is **longer** than the video, drag it from the right to match the length of the video.
* If its length is **smaller** than the video, drag it to the right to increase its length.

![adjust the length of the snapshot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-17.png)

After adding the snapshot, we will have to change its blending mode.

##### Step5 Change the blending of the snapshot

To create the effect of your text behind the video, you must alter the main text's blending mode. In this case, it will be the snapshot we took.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Changing the blending mode of the snapshot will allow it to blend with the transparent background and will create the effect of the text behind the object in the video.

Follow the steps mentioned below to change the blending of the snapshot:

* **Double-click** the snapshot.
* If you select the compositing tab, the blending options will pop up.
* From default, it would be set to **Normal**. Click on the **Normal**
* It will show a drop-down option.
* Scroll down below until you can see an option labeled Then click on **Overlay.**

![change the blending mode to overlay](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-18.png)

* And press **OK** in the bottom right corner to confirm your changes.

The text can be blended with the background.

* Click on the **Eye icon** to un-hide the video from the timeline.
* Now play the video from the start from the main play screen to see the final changes.
