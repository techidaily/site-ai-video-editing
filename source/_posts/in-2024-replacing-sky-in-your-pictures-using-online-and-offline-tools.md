The feature lets you add multiple clips, images, or footage to a single screen and make a collage by comparing different angled shots.
* Auto Reframe: This AI-powered feature is excellent for saving time and creating quality content. With the Auto Reframe feature, Filmora spontaneously detects the focal point of the video and makes sure that it stays in the frame. At the same time, crop the extra part from the video.
* AI Portrait: If you are not satisfied with the background of your video, try the AI Portrait feature of Wondershare Filmora. This lets you add glitch effects, noise, borders, and a lot more things. The coolest thing is it removes the background without chroma key and green screen. This feature is the newest addition to Filmora.
