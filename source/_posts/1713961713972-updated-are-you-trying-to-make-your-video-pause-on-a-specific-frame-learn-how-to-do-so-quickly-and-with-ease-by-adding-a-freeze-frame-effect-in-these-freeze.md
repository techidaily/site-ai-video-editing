The **freeze-frame video editing** effect is a technique used to stop the moving image of a video and hold it still onscreen. This effect aims to pause the world the video is living in and allow the audience to process the scene and gain more context fully. Note that the world around us keeps ongoing, and time never stops. But luckily for us, we can pause film and video with a simple but powerful video effect known as the freeze-frame.

In addition, a freeze-frame can be carried out in a video to showcase a specific frame in your clip by extending the length of Time that frame is displayed. For example, you can decide to freeze a frame to show the video frame where a goal is being scored in a sporting event or use it to showcase a captured reaction or a smile. When a freeze-frame applies to a video clip, the clip automatically splits at the freezing point, and the chosen frame is inserted as an image file (BMP) and displayed on screen for the duration you set.

With the good use of speed ramping, you can achieve a smooth transition in videos. It also helps you add seamless transitions in the videos to add a sense of consistency. One of the best things is adding slow-motion and [motion-tracking](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) effects in simple videos.

### Syncing Audios

[Syncing the audio beats with videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is crucial to enhance the user experience. Speed ramping offers capabilities through which you can easily sync the audio to the length of videos. As it never compromises the content or layout of videos, you don't have to worry about anything.

### Emphasized Storytelling

If you need to induce a sense of storytelling and optimize the video quality, consider speed ramping. You can control the overall speed of actions and dramas and convey a particular narrative to add depth to videos. It also helps to **increase the frame rate of video**.
