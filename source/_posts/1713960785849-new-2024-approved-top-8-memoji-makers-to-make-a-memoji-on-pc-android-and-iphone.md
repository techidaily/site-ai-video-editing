![filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/features/text-speech-img1.png)

Speech has a significant impact on the success rate of the entire YouTube adventure, whether storytelling or a standard sales pitch. It helps to have a decent voice and speaking abilities. However, not everyone gets both simultaneously; many individuals employ voice artists to provide voice-overs.

Some freelancers charge $5-$100 for a 5-minute voice-over. However, not everyone can afford an expensive voice artist, especially for longer films or just starting. Here are other options that I discovered as the most acceptable free text to voice generators for YouTube videos.

Let's take a deeper look at the most excellent free text to speech software for YouTube videos.

**Getting Started**

Text to speech is a speech synthesis software that speaks aloud digital and textual content. The software offers a wide range of applications and is utilized by everyone from professionals and students to toddlers and adults.

Viewers are emotionally attached to documents such as PDFs, books, novels, and e-learning courses when they hear narration with a human voice. Text-to-speech systems are ideal for multitasking by busy professionals.

It's no surprise that there are numerous text-to-speech options available. Audiobooks are also becoming more popular for the same reasons.

We'll go over the best text-to-speech tools available in this guide. We've gathered a detailed list of the most exemplary free and commercial text-to-speech applications to help you choose the best option for your needs:

### Cons

* It does not have a preview. You have to generate the voice-over to listen.
* You can't combine a single audio file out of many audio files.
* The Voiceover & Editor Page is unique in that it has two sections: one for creating the voice-over and another for obtaining audio files. Switching between them will take some time. If you're working on a large project, moving between bot sites will be a hassle.
* No project-based organization

### Cons

* There is no way to skip or jump around any text on the page.
* You will need internet access in the free software to access the voices.
* The paid version is very expensive in comparison to others.
* Long-term use is complex.

## **Pro Tip:**

If you just use text-to-speech software sometimes, it's best to utilize one of the many free options available. On the other hand, paid versions are great if you want extensive functionality and don't mind limitations on usage.

You should check for text-to-speech software with natural voices enabled in commercial applications. A top-rated system should include real-time speech capabilities and a user-friendly UI.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **What is Text to Speech Software?**

TTS (text-to-speech) is an assistive technology that reads text aloud. TTS systems provide computer-generated sound, and we may vary the reading speed by increasing the speed or slowing things down.

### Is Text-To-Speech Technology Handy?

According to studies, text-to-speech technology helps viewers concentrate on the content rather than the process of reading, resulting in a greater understanding of the topic and more engagement.

While some argue that audiobooks, or scripts read by paid voice actors, are superior to computer-generated voices, there is compelling proof that text to speech can be a handy tool for YouTube content creators.

### **Is The Voice Quality Consistent Across All Text to Speech Programs?**

Voice quality ultimately depends on the service. However, some use human voices, while premium solutions employ the voices of well-known narrators like David Attenborough and Morgan Freeman.

You can even mimic the sound of youngsters speaking. Many gadgets, particularly online web page scanners and even audiobooks emphasize the text they are scanning.

### **What Are the Benefits of Using Text to Speech Software?**

You can use this type of technology in a variety of ways. Some programs read text from a digital document or an interactive online page for users. Some programs can even convert handwritten text into speech using modern technology such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

Text-to-speech software is compatible with various devices and applies to all kinds of individual digital devices, including laptops, PCs, tablets, and smartphones.

### **What Is the Process of Converting Speech in Text to Speech Software?**

The majority of text-to-speech software works in the same way. Users can either upload or input the content to convert to audio. Then they choose from the different voices to evaluate which sound is best for the voice-over.

Many TTS solutions rely on OCR technology in some form. OCR allows us to obtain text from documents and photos by recognizing written and digital text. If you click an image of a street sign, the program will read the words printed on it.

### **Is it possible to use Text to Speech on YouTube?**

Absolutely, you can get them in YouTube videos, but to prevent advertising strikes, make sure you post videos with authentic human voices somewhere between.

### **What Text-To-Speech Software Does YouTube Content Creators Use?**

To incorporate voice-overs on their sales pitches and informative videos, most YouTubers pay for text-to-speech software like Synthesys and Speechelo.

### **Is It Possible to Monetize YouTube Videos Using Text to Speech?**

It varies on the text to speech engine you're using; some TTS engines support YouTube monetization while others don't.

![filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/features/text-speech-img1.png)

Speech has a significant impact on the success rate of the entire YouTube adventure, whether storytelling or a standard sales pitch. It helps to have a decent voice and speaking abilities. However, not everyone gets both simultaneously; many individuals employ voice artists to provide voice-overs.

Some freelancers charge $5-$100 for a 5-minute voice-over. However, not everyone can afford an expensive voice artist, especially for longer films or just starting. Here are other options that I discovered as the most acceptable free text to voice generators for YouTube videos.

Let's take a deeper look at the most excellent free text to speech software for YouTube videos.

**Getting Started**

Text to speech is a speech synthesis software that speaks aloud digital and textual content. The software offers a wide range of applications and is utilized by everyone from professionals and students to toddlers and adults.

Viewers are emotionally attached to documents such as PDFs, books, novels, and e-learning courses when they hear narration with a human voice. Text-to-speech systems are ideal for multitasking by busy professionals.

It's no surprise that there are numerous text-to-speech options available. Audiobooks are also becoming more popular for the same reasons.

We'll go over the best text-to-speech tools available in this guide. We've gathered a detailed list of the most exemplary free and commercial text-to-speech applications to help you choose the best option for your needs:

### Cons

## **Pro Tip:**

If you just use text-to-speech software sometimes, it's best to utilize one of the many free options available. On the other hand, paid versions are great if you want extensive functionality and don't mind limitations on usage.

You should check for text-to-speech software with natural voices enabled in commercial applications. A top-rated system should include real-time speech capabilities and a user-friendly UI.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **What is Text to Speech Software?**

TTS (text-to-speech) is an assistive technology that reads text aloud. TTS systems provide computer-generated sound, and we may vary the reading speed by increasing the speed or slowing things down.

### Is Text-To-Speech Technology Handy?

According to studies, text-to-speech technology helps viewers concentrate on the content rather than the process of reading, resulting in a greater understanding of the topic and more engagement.

While some argue that audiobooks, or scripts read by paid voice actors, are superior to computer-generated voices, there is compelling proof that text to speech can be a handy tool for YouTube content creators.

### **Is The Voice Quality Consistent Across All Text to Speech Programs?**

Voice quality ultimately depends on the service. However, some use human voices, while premium solutions employ the voices of well-known narrators like David Attenborough and Morgan Freeman.

You can even mimic the sound of youngsters speaking. Many gadgets, particularly online web page scanners and even audiobooks emphasize the text they are scanning.

### **What Are the Benefits of Using Text to Speech Software?**

You can use this type of technology in a variety of ways. Some programs read text from a digital document or an interactive online page for users. Some programs can even convert handwritten text into speech using modern technology such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

Text-to-speech software is compatible with various devices and applies to all kinds of individual digital devices, including laptops, PCs, tablets, and smartphones.

### **What Is the Process of Converting Speech in Text to Speech Software?**

The majority of text-to-speech software works in the same way. Users can either upload or input the content to convert to audio. Then they choose from the different voices to evaluate which sound is best for the voice-over.

Many TTS solutions rely on OCR technology in some form. OCR allows us to obtain text from documents and photos by recognizing written and digital text. If you click an image of a street sign, the program will read the words printed on it.

### **Is it possible to use Text to Speech on YouTube?**

Absolutely, you can get them in YouTube videos, but to prevent advertising strikes, make sure you post videos with authentic human voices somewhere between.

### **What Text-To-Speech Software Does YouTube Content Creators Use?**

To incorporate voice-overs on their sales pitches and informative videos, most YouTubers pay for text-to-speech software like Synthesys and Speechelo.

### **Is It Possible to Monetize YouTube Videos Using Text to Speech?**

It varies on the text to speech engine you're using; some TTS engines support YouTube monetization while others don't.

![filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/features/text-speech-img1.png)

Speech has a significant impact on the success rate of the entire YouTube adventure, whether storytelling or a standard sales pitch. It helps to have a decent voice and speaking abilities. However, not everyone gets both simultaneously; many individuals employ voice artists to provide voice-overs.

Some freelancers charge $5-$100 for a 5-minute voice-over. However, not everyone can afford an expensive voice artist, especially for longer films or just starting. Here are other options that I discovered as the most acceptable free text to voice generators for YouTube videos.

Let's take a deeper look at the most excellent free text to speech software for YouTube videos.

**Getting Started**

Text to speech is a speech synthesis software that speaks aloud digital and textual content. The software offers a wide range of applications and is utilized by everyone from professionals and students to toddlers and adults.

Viewers are emotionally attached to documents such as PDFs, books, novels, and e-learning courses when they hear narration with a human voice. Text-to-speech systems are ideal for multitasking by busy professionals.

It's no surprise that there are numerous text-to-speech options available. Audiobooks are also becoming more popular for the same reasons.

We'll go over the best text-to-speech tools available in this guide. We've gathered a detailed list of the most exemplary free and commercial text-to-speech applications to help you choose the best option for your needs:

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **What is Text to Speech Software?**

TTS (text-to-speech) is an assistive technology that reads text aloud. TTS systems provide computer-generated sound, and we may vary the reading speed by increasing the speed or slowing things down.

### Is Text-To-Speech Technology Handy?

According to studies, text-to-speech technology helps viewers concentrate on the content rather than the process of reading, resulting in a greater understanding of the topic and more engagement.

While some argue that audiobooks, or scripts read by paid voice actors, are superior to computer-generated voices, there is compelling proof that text to speech can be a handy tool for YouTube content creators.

### **Is The Voice Quality Consistent Across All Text to Speech Programs?**

Voice quality ultimately depends on the service. However, some use human voices, while premium solutions employ the voices of well-known narrators like David Attenborough and Morgan Freeman.

You can even mimic the sound of youngsters speaking. Many gadgets, particularly online web page scanners and even audiobooks emphasize the text they are scanning.

### **What Are the Benefits of Using Text to Speech Software?**

You can use this type of technology in a variety of ways. Some programs read text from a digital document or an interactive online page for users. Some programs can even convert handwritten text into speech using modern technology such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

Text-to-speech software is compatible with various devices and applies to all kinds of individual digital devices, including laptops, PCs, tablets, and smartphones.

### **What Is the Process of Converting Speech in Text to Speech Software?**

The majority of text-to-speech software works in the same way. Users can either upload or input the content to convert to audio. Then they choose from the different voices to evaluate which sound is best for the voice-over.

Many TTS solutions rely on OCR technology in some form. OCR allows us to obtain text from documents and photos by recognizing written and digital text. If you click an image of a street sign, the program will read the words printed on it.

### **Is it possible to use Text to Speech on YouTube?**

Absolutely, you can get them in YouTube videos, but to prevent advertising strikes, make sure you post videos with authentic human voices somewhere between.

### **What Text-To-Speech Software Does YouTube Content Creators Use?**

To incorporate voice-overs on their sales pitches and informative videos, most YouTubers pay for text-to-speech software like Synthesys and Speechelo.

### **Is It Possible to Monetize YouTube Videos Using Text to Speech?**

It varies on the text to speech engine you're using; some TTS engines support YouTube monetization while others don't.

![filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/features/text-speech-img1.png)

Speech has a significant impact on the success rate of the entire YouTube adventure, whether storytelling or a standard sales pitch. It helps to have a decent voice and speaking abilities. However, not everyone gets both simultaneously; many individuals employ voice artists to provide voice-overs.

Some freelancers charge $5-$100 for a 5-minute voice-over. However, not everyone can afford an expensive voice artist, especially for longer films or just starting. Here are other options that I discovered as the most acceptable free text to voice generators for YouTube videos.

Let's take a deeper look at the most excellent free text to speech software for YouTube videos.

**Getting Started**

Text to speech is a speech synthesis software that speaks aloud digital and textual content. The software offers a wide range of applications and is utilized by everyone from professionals and students to toddlers and adults.

Viewers are emotionally attached to documents such as PDFs, books, novels, and e-learning courses when they hear narration with a human voice. Text-to-speech systems are ideal for multitasking by busy professionals.

It's no surprise that there are numerous text-to-speech options available. Audiobooks are also becoming more popular for the same reasons.

We'll go over the best text-to-speech tools available in this guide. We've gathered a detailed list of the most exemplary free and commercial text-to-speech applications to help you choose the best option for your needs:

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **What is Text to Speech Software?**

TTS (text-to-speech) is an assistive technology that reads text aloud. TTS systems provide computer-generated sound, and we may vary the reading speed by increasing the speed or slowing things down.

### Is Text-To-Speech Technology Handy?

According to studies, text-to-speech technology helps viewers concentrate on the content rather than the process of reading, resulting in a greater understanding of the topic and more engagement.

While some argue that audiobooks, or scripts read by paid voice actors, are superior to computer-generated voices, there is compelling proof that text to speech can be a handy tool for YouTube content creators.

### **Is The Voice Quality Consistent Across All Text to Speech Programs?**

Voice quality ultimately depends on the service. However, some use human voices, while premium solutions employ the voices of well-known narrators like David Attenborough and Morgan Freeman.

You can even mimic the sound of youngsters speaking. Many gadgets, particularly online web page scanners and even audiobooks emphasize the text they are scanning.

### **What Are the Benefits of Using Text to Speech Software?**

You can use this type of technology in a variety of ways. Some programs read text from a digital document or an interactive online page for users. Some programs can even convert handwritten text into speech using modern technology such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

Text-to-speech software is compatible with various devices and applies to all kinds of individual digital devices, including laptops, PCs, tablets, and smartphones.

### **What Is the Process of Converting Speech in Text to Speech Software?**

The majority of text-to-speech software works in the same way. Users can either upload or input the content to convert to audio. Then they choose from the different voices to evaluate which sound is best for the voice-over.

Many TTS solutions rely on OCR technology in some form. OCR allows us to obtain text from documents and photos by recognizing written and digital text. If you click an image of a street sign, the program will read the words printed on it.

### **Is it possible to use Text to Speech on YouTube?**

Absolutely, you can get them in YouTube videos, but to prevent advertising strikes, make sure you post videos with authentic human voices somewhere between.

### **What Text-To-Speech Software Does YouTube Content Creators Use?**

To incorporate voice-overs on their sales pitches and informative videos, most YouTubers pay for text-to-speech software like Synthesys and Speechelo.

### **Is It Possible to Monetize YouTube Videos Using Text to Speech?**

It varies on the text to speech engine you're using; some TTS engines support YouTube monetization while others don't.

## How to Create Custom Lower Thirds in Filmora

As a video creator, there are times when you need to use Lower Thirds. Although many lower-third presets are available, making unique and personalized ones can ensure your video stands out.

So, to empower your inner video creator, this article will show you how to make your own Lower Thirds in Filmora.

## Part 1: What is Lower Third

A Lower Third is a mix of motion graphic design and texts that are placed in the lower area of the screen. It provides additional information, such as a person's name or other relevant information, without distracting the audience from the main content.

Lower Thirds can be used in various settings, such as news broadcasts or interviews, to help provide viewers with additional context.

## Part 2: How to Make Your Own Lower Thirds in [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

### (1) A simple line and texts

![a simple line and texts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-1.gif)

##### Step1 Create a simple line

Go to the **Media library > Sample Media folder > choose a color sample**. For this tutorial, we will select the white color. Then, drag and drop this sample color onto the upper video track.

![create a simple line](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-2.jpg)

Double-click the white sample clip to open the settings and scale it to 30%. Then, reposition the white bar to your desired place.

![double-click the white sample clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-3.gif)

##### Step2 Mask the white sample

Since we want to create a thin horizontal shape, you need to make some adjustments to the white sample by using an image mask. So, go to the **Effect window > Utility > Image Mask**. Then, drag and drop the “Image Mask” onto the white color sample.

![mask the white sample](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-4.gif)

After that, double-click the white sample on the timeline and find the Image Mask setting. Choose the shape that works best for your needs. For this tutorial, we are going to use this one. Then, adjust the X and Y-axis scale numbers until it becomes a thin white line. Click OK.

![double-click the white sample](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-5.jpg)

##### Step3 Add a text for your lower thirds

Go to **Titles > Plain Text > Basic 6** and drop it onto the second video track above the white line clip. Don't worry about the exact position yet. We can adjust it later.

![add a text for your lower thirds](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-6.jpg)

Double-click on the text clip to open the settings, then type some text there and adjust the size and font.

![double-click on the text clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-7.jpg)

##### Step4 Add animation to the text

Click **Advanced > Animation > Up Down 1** animation. Adjust the animation length by dragging the two brackets on the timeline on the right side. Click Ok.

![add animation to the text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-8.jpg)

##### Step5 Add keyframes to the white line clip when entering

Double-click on the white line clip on the timeline to show the animation keyframe setting window. Then, playback the animation of the text, find a position before the text animation starts and move the play head there. Make sure it is close enough to when the texts show up so the white line enters the keyframe right before the text enters.

![add keyframes to the white line clip when entering](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-9.gif)

Click to add a keyframe, double-check to make sure it is the final position you want, and the opacity should be 100 at this point.

After that, move the play head to the left for a few frames and click add again. To make sure the white line is out of the frame before entering, you need to change the Y-axis number. Change the opacity to 0 as the white line starts in transparent color.

![move the play head to the left](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-10.gif)

These two keyframes will create an effect of the line entering the frame while turning from transparent to white. Playback the animation and adjust the keyframes marks by dragging them to the left or right until you feel the timing looks good.

##### Step6 Add keyframes to the white line clip when exiting

Playback again to find where the texts disappear, then move the play head to a position after it. Also, make sure it's close enough to where the texts disappear so you can ensure the white line exits right after the texts disappear. Then, add the keyframe.

![add keyframes to the white line clip when exiting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-11.gif)

You don't need to change the setting this time because this keyframe is used to keep the position and opacity unchanged.

Instead, move the play head again to the right for a few frames and add another keyframe. Move the texts out of the frame by changing the y-axis number, then change the opacity to 0\. This keyframe is used to create the white line animation exiting the frame and turning back to transparent in the meantime.

![move the texts out of the frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-12.gif)

Playback the video and see how it looks.

### (2) A name card with a solid background

![a name card with a solid background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-13.gif)

Sometimes you might want to create a name card with a solid background like the sample above. To create it, we can use the same method. Here's how to do it:

##### Step1 Make the lower third background

Select the white color sample from the sample color folder and drop it onto the upper video track of the video.

![make the lower third background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-14.jpg)

Change the scale to 30%, then reposition the white sample to your desired place. Click OK.

![change the scale to 30%](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-15.gif)

##### Step2 Create an image mask for the lower third background

Drag and drop the Image Mask onto the white sample clip on the timeline.

![create an image mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-16.gif)

Double-click on the white sample clip to activate the video setting window and find the Image Mask settings. Then, choose the mask shape you need. You can also adjust its size by changing the X or Y-axis.

![double-click on the white sample clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-17.jpg)

##### Step3 Add some text

Once the background card is in place, go to Titles > Plain Text > ‘Basic 6' and drop it onto the third video track.

![go to titles](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-18.jpg)

Now, type in the texts as needed. Reposition and scale the texts to make sure they are on top of the background shape.

![type in the texts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-19.jpg)

##### Step4 Add animation to the text

Click Advanced > Animation > Push. Then, adjust the animation length accordingly. Click Ok.

![click advanced](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-20.jpg)

Double-click on the background clip to show the animation tab setting. Then, playback the text animation and find a position earlier than the start and add a keyframe.

![double-click on the background clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-21.jpg)

Similar to the tutorial before, move the play head again a few frames earlier to the left and add another keyframe. If you want to have the name card flying in from the left while expanding, you can change the X-axis and scale of the background card to 0\. Change the opacity to 0 to create a color change from transparent to white.

![move the play head again](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-22.gif)

To let the background card exit the frame, add two more keyframes to the background card. Add a keyframe with no changes to settings. Move the play head to the right for a few frames and add another keyframe.

![add two more keyframes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-23.gif)

If you want the name card to exit to the bottom, change the Y-axis number until it exits. Change the scale and opacity to 0\. Then, playback and adjust the keyframes.

Finally, you can add a Subscribe button from the new default Filmora element pack “Social Media.”
