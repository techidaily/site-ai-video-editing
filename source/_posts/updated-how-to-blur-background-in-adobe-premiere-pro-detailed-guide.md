**Note:** _While adding the subtitles, make sure the video is set at its very beginning. This will help to ensure that the subtitles are synchronized properly with the video._

## Method 3: Watch Subtitles in QuickTime Player with iPad Screen Extension

If you own an iPad, you can use it to view subtitles while playing a video in QuickTime player. In other words, you can use the iPad as an extension to the Mac. The iPad displays the subtitles while the video plays on the Mac.

While using an iPad as an extension to your Mac, there are certain things you need to keep in mind. They are as follows:

* To ensure a proper connection between the Mac and iPad, place both devices within 10 meters of each other.
* To allow synchronization between the two devices, it is important that both of them are signed into one single iCloud account.
* You also need to check the operating systems of both devices to make sure they connect with each other. To be precise, your Mac needs to run macOS Catalina or later versions, while your iPad should run iPadOS 13 or later versions.

If all three conditions specified above are met, you can proceed to connect your iPad with Mac OS and watch subtitles on the iPad.
