##### Step 3Color Correct Your Adjustment Layer

Adjust the color toning of your video by finding the "Histogram" icon in the “Preview” section. Modify the curves according to your preference while turning on this function. Continue to select the “Adjustment Layer” and lead to the “Color” tab to look for the “Curves” option.

##### Step 4Add Multiple Adjustment Layers

Additionally, you can apply different effects at different durations and drag the adjustment layer to the end of the layer. Further, split the adjustment layer using the "Playhead" slider at the desired duration to add a new effect. To make your slideshow better, you can also add transition effects by dragging and dropping them between two clips.

##### Step 5Save as a Preset

You can also save your adjustment layer as a preset. Select your adjustment layer, locate the "Save as Custom" option in the right panel, and click on it. This will save the adjustment layer as a preset. Your preset will be in the "Adjustment Layer" section of the "Media" tab.
