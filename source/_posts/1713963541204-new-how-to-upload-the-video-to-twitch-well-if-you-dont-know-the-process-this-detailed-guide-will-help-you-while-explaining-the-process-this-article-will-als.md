### 2\. Smashcast

If you are a gaming fan, you must have heard about Hitbox and Azubu. They came together to form Smashcast. This provides the users with perfect JavaScript and HTML integration. If you are a gaming partner, esports team, viewer, organizer or streamer, then this platform will be an excellent option for you. Compared to Twitch, Smashcast offers better quality esports streams.

### 3\. Facebook Gaming

Spooky graveyard with scary tombstones is another good way to go about it when you are looking for vacation countdown clock videos. The mixture of the turbulent and serene environment is enough to set the Halloween mood and even scare some folks.

What’s better than the Sadako ghost 7-day video call threat on Halloween? Well, nothing! So, why not create a prank video for your friends and family, especially those afraid of Sadako? Plus, Sadako creates a perfect backdrop for the countdown. Look at this Philippines creator who went to great lengths to scare his friends via a Sadako video call.

### 4\. [Skeleton breaking screen](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/p/Skeleton-breaking-screen.html)

The broken screen is the classic prank suitable for any event and day. But simply using apps or replacing the wallpaper on your friend's or spouse's mobile doesn’t cut in this age and day.

**Halloween Footage for Vertical Videos \[TikTok/Instagram Story\]:**

### 1\. [Woman Decorating for Halloween \[TikTok\]](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/woman-decorating-for-halloween-43000095742.html)

Another simple backdrop for the Halloween countdown timer video is the decorations process to transform your indoors or outdoors for Halloween. And while you can use your own footage of decorating the house, chances are you may have missed filming yourself while decorating the house, given not everyone films themselves decorating the house and use it for their TikTok video. Here’s a video from Spooky Bones featuring the indoor decoration process for Halloween.

![women decorating for halloween filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-11.jpg)

Another simple idea for a vertical countdown timer for Halloween is a scary face.

Tay tells a story about a real haunted house in her neighborhood while wearing scary Halloween makeup.

Of course, you can replace the story; and instead, use a clock with a girl wearing Halloween makeup.

![women wearing makeup filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-12.jpg)

After all, Halloween is all about setting the perfect theme, and featuring a non-relevant indoor or scary video outdoors spoils the theme. Take a look at how Stephanie Cunningham on TikTok showcases her outdoor table decoration setup for Halloween.

![table setting filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-13.jpg)

## Are You Looking for Different Solutions to Add VHS Effects to Your Videos? Don't Worry; This Article Will Provide Easy Solutions to Apply VHS

Good videos with great edits and effects undoubtedly create a last impression. Videos are like windows to the past, allowing us to relive precious moments and memories. Similarly, good-looking videos have this remarkable ability to last forever. Even when it comes to content creation, videos are a great engagement tool. They engage audiences like no other medium can, conveying emotions and messages.

However, **VHS effects** have added more spice to the content creation and the creative work behind it. They give a normal video a distinct character and style, further improving it. By applying **VHS filters**, you can change the mood of your videos entirely. Applying these effects to your videos sometimes becomes difficult. However, there is always a simple solution to apply VHS to your videos.

## Part 1: What is VHS Effect? An Overview

People from the 80s would remember the good old days when they used to watch movies on VHS tapes. In simple terms, the **VHS effect** is a style that tries to recreate the look of VHS recordings. It's a nostalgic-style effect that has gained popularity in recent years. You can apply different filters and techniques to your videos to achieve this effect.

These techniques aim to replicate the features of VHS tapes. The key features of the VHS filters include distortion, noise, and tracking errors. Distortion and noise create flickering lines and static. Furthermore, the tracking errors give the impression of an unstable video signal. These elements make the video appear just like the old VHS tapes from the 80s.

Additionally, color grading plays an important role in creating this effect. VHS tapes had a unique color palette with saturated and slightly shifted colors. You can replicate this effect by adjusting and applying color grading effects.
