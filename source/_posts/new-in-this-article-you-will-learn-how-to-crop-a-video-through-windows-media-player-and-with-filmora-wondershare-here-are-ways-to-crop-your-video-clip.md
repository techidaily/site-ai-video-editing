For video editing, you need to have expertise in using the software. The ideal solution is using **Filmic Tone LUTs for free download**. These LUTs can extend the quality of your videos in a hassle-free environment. This article will discuss important Filmic Pro LUTs.

## Part 1: How Can LUTs Benefit Video Editors?

Video editors are professionals that are tasked to edit and customize videos. Their main objective is to enhance video quality with necessary manual upscaling. Making things more accessible, find how LUTs can benefit these professionals:

* Increased Efficiency: With LUTs, video editors can optimize their workflows with ready-made filters. So they don’t need to spend hours on video editing. By applying filters, video colors are upgraded.
* Consistent Grading: During manual editing, multiple frames are left out during color correction. With LUTs, the colors are applied in a consistent way in all frames. This way, you will experience effective color enhancement.
* Professional Quality: The quality of applied LUTs is amazing. After all, LUTs provide dedicated filter presets to optimize color saturation and brightness. With professional color grading, experience a top-quality video.
* Creative Colors: LUTs are ideal for adding premium yet stylish color schemas into videos. The color gradients are creative as well as sleek and luxurious. You will not regret using creative color presets in LUTs.

## Part 2: Discussing Some Practical Uses of LUTs in Video Editing

LUTs, also known as look-up tables, are unique video editing tools. They use mathematical instructions to map input color values into output color values. This way, consistent color gradings are applied across video content. In video editing, LUTs can be used for a variety of practical uses:

### 1\. Special Effects

By using LUTs, you can add special effects to your videos. This includes different effects, including dreamy, moody, or surreal. The videos will look more professional and enchanting with attractive looks. So you don’t need to pursue video editing in a deep way.

### 2\. HDR Display

With LUTs, users can add a dynamic touch of HDR display to the videos. After all, they can convert SDR footage to HDR footage using special filter presets. This allows for different color contrasts within the video.

### 3\. Color Enhancement

Enhancing color schemas is easier and more convenient using LUTs. These editing tools can adjust color contrast, balance, and saturation. Hence, your video is upscaled with an improved color display for vintage or cinematic looks.

### 4\. Match Footages

Different cameras produce videos with diverse quality, which is unsatisfying. Through LUTs, you can match the color of your footage with a consistent appearance. The color schemes and tone contrasts are optimized in a collective way.

## Part 1: What is HDR photography?

First things first. Before using the HDR feature on your smartphone, let’s learn what actually is the function of HDR.

Standing for High Dynamic Range, HDR is an image capturing method where the dynamic range of an image is high. When we talk about dynamic range, it refers to the difference between the lightest and the darkest elements of a picture. Thus, in HDR images the range dynamic range of the image is greater than the actual capture and thus making the image look more real with higher contrast, colors, and saturation.

While using the HDR image capturing method, the subject is captured in multiple shots having different exposures. These multiple captured shots are then combined into a single picture thus making it look detailed and saturated.

Though HDR enhances the overall looks of an image it is not suitable only in certain situations and subjects like landscape, subjects captured in sunlight or bright background, low or dim light conditions, and more.

![hdr mode vs non hdr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/hdr-photography-how-to-use-hdr-mode-on-your-android-devices-4.jpg)

## Part 2: How to tell if I can shoot HDR images on my Android devices or not?

HDR images can be captured using DSLR cameras, but you need to have a thorough knowledge of the camera and the process of capturing the HDR images. A simpler alternative to this is using an Android device. The principle of capturing HDR images using an Android phone is simpler in comparison to a professional DSLR camera and also quick. Using an Android device, the imbalance in the exposure is corrected and the details of the image background, as well as the foreground, are enhanced.

**How-to steps to check the HDR camera Android feature**

So now that you know that HDR images can be easily captured using your Android device, the next important thing is to check if your phone supports the HDR feature or not as not all Android devices have the HDR mode.

* In the devices like HTC One X, Desire X, and others with custom Camera apps, the feature can be found under the Camera Scenes section.
* In case you cannot locate the HDR option in both the above methods then try looking for it under the Settings menu of Camera. Devices like Sony Xperia T and Xperia V have the option here.
* For the Nexus 4 device that runs on Android 4.2 OS, the option of HDR mode can be turned on by simply long-tapping the viewfinder and then tapping on the HDR icon.
* You may also find the option of HDR mode under the labels like Backlight HDR or Backlight Correction HDR. On the Samsung Galaxy devices, HDR is labeled as Rich Tone and can be located under the Smart Modes menu.

## Part 3: How to Take an HDR Shot with Your Android devices?
