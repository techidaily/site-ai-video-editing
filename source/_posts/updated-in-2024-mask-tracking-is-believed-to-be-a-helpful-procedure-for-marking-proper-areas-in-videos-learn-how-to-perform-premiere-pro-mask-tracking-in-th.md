### Step 3: Changing the Parameters

Now, right-click on your layer to click on “Brightness and Contrast.” Change it as you need. After that, move on to the “Curves” and play with the graphs of the picture. Change the “Solid Color” as well. Make the color white and change the opacity levels.

![customize the parameters](<https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/vhs-and> glitch-filter-3.jpg)

### Step 4: Adding Noise

Moving on, click on the first layer and navigate to the “Filter” bar on the top of the interface. Hit “Noise” and then “Add Noise.” Make the necessary changes as you like and press “Enter.” Scroll up to the “File” and hit “Open Recent” to launch the VHS texture photo. Drag and drop the texture to the photo layer that we are working on.

### Step 5: Inserting VHS Texture

Resize the VHS texture and then apply the transformation. By default, the blend mode is “Normal.” Change it to “Darken” from the right panel. The picture will get dark. Again, change the mode to “Screen.” Moving on, input another VHS Filter texture and drag and drop it to the layer we are working on. Resize it and apply the transformation.

![insert vhs texture](<https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/vhs-and> glitch-filter-5.jpg)

### Step 6: Altering the Blend Mode

Alter the blend mode to “Darker” and then to “Screen.” Apply another filter and then drag and drop the layer. Change the blend mode to “Screen.” Pick up the eraser from the left panel of tools and make necessary edits.

![change blend mode](<https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/vhs-and> glitch-filter-6.jpg)

### Step 7: Duplicating the Layer

Duplicate the photo layer and move it up. Again, click on “Filter” then “Noise” to add the noise as needed. Alter the blend mode to “Soft Light” and set the opacity value. After that, add any solid color and switch the blend mode back to Soft Light.

![duplicate image layer](<https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/vhs-and> glitch-filter-7.jpg)

### Step 8: Playing with the Layers

Duplicate the layer again to change the color. After that, double click the layer and deselect “R.” Move to left or right. Perform the same procedure for the rest of the layers. Use the erase tool to offer fine imprinting to the transition. Duplicate the final layer and deselect “R” and “C.” Move left and right.

![cusotmize layers](<https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/vhs-and> glitch-filter-8.jpg)

### Step 9: Final Process

Use the eraser tool one last time, and you are done with the VCR filter.

## How to Create the Night-to-Day Effect Video

Do you wish you could control when it's nighttime to daytime? It would make getting ready in the morning much faster! This tutorial will show you how to use the keyframe and mask feature in [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to make a remarkable night-to-day transition.

## How-to Guide

**_1) Preparation_**

For this effect, you will need to shoot two footage shots with the same frame. The first is for the daytime clip, and the second is for nighttime.

But before that, you need to prepare some things, such as:

1. Tripod to ensure your camera stays at the same point, so the frame doesn't change.
2. Mark the place where you want to shoot the scene. You can put a marker on the floor to ensure that you perform at the same spot in different shots.

Once done, let's start shooting to get the footage.

**_2) Steps_**

**Shooting footages**

First, get the daytime shot. For this tutorial, we will pretend that you are walking and transitioning into nighttime at the spot you have marked.

![get the daytime shot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-1.gif)

Now, let's film the nighttime clip. You will walk through the living room and do the same movement again at the same spot. You can dim the light and change the camera's white balance settings to bluer to create a night feeling.

![film the nighttime clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-2.gif)

After you have both clips that you need, let's go to Filmora and start editing.

**Night-to-day transition**

Step1 Launch Filmora and import the footage into the program. If you haven't installed it, you can download Filmora on their website here: <https://filmora.wondershare.com>

Step2 Place the nighttime video clip on the first video track of the timeline and place the daytime clip on the top.

![place the daytime clip on the top](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-3.jpg)

Step3 Find the spot where you want to create a transition between the day and nighttime. Then, you can delete the unwanted part.

![create a transition](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-4.jpg)

Step4 Since the transition for this tutorial is where the subject started waving, make sure to place the daytime clip at the same time the subject started waving in the nighttime clip. Hence, the timing in both clips syncs.

**Masking transition**

For the next step, we will make a masking transition with the Filmora mask feature.

Step1 Double-click the daytime clip on the timeline. In the Filmora setting, find the **Mask section > Circle**. You can see the mask is applied in the preview screen.

![double-click the daytime clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-5.jpg)

Step2 Scroll down the setting and click add a keyframe at the beginning of the clip.

![scroll down the setting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-6.jpg)

Step3 Change the scale of the mask to the smallest number and adjust the Width and Height down to 0\. You can set the blur strength to 15 to make the transition edge smoother.

![change the scale of the mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-7.jpg)

Step4 Move the play head to find the spot where you want the mask fully opens up, then add another keyframe. Change the scale of the mask to 2 and the Width and Height to 50\. Make sure the mask occupies the whole frame.

![add another keyframe](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-8.jpg)

Now, if you play back, you can see the nighttime becomes daytime through the mask.

![nighttime becomes daytime through the mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-9.gif)

If the movement in the two clips is a bit off, you can fix it by adding more keyframes on the mask.

**_3) Pro tips_**

You can add one more effect in Filmora to make it more magical. To do this, open the Effects window on the top left and find “Heartbeat” under the Basic section.

![add one more effect in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-10.jpg)

Drag and drop it onto the third video track and start the effect when the mask opens up. Then, trim the effect length to match the movement. Adjust the speed of this effect if needed.

![adjust the speed of this effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/night-to-day-11.jpg)

The final result will look like this:

## Summary

That is how to do this night-to-day transition night-to-day time shift effect in Filmora. By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to use the masking transition technique. You can apply and adjust it based on your needs.
