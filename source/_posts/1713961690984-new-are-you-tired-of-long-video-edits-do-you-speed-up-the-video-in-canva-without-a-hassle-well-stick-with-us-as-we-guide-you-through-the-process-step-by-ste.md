![how to speed up canva video 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-speed-up-video-in-canva-4.png)

2) Once that's done, drag and drop your clip on the timeline and adjust it according to your requirements.

![how to speed up canva video 3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-speed-up-video-in-canva-5.png)

_Hit preview once you are comfortable with video positioning_

##### Step3Download the Non-speed Up Video in Canva

After previewing the clip, you will soon realize that your video is going too slow and needs to be adjusted. Unfortunately, no feature as of right now could directly fix the issue. It needs to be revamped in a third-party program requiring video download.

1) To download the original video in Canva, move your cursor to the top and select the "**share**" button.

![change video speed in canva 1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-speed-up-video-in-canva-6.png)

2) Before you download the file, make sure that you have the MP4 format selected.

![change video speed in canva 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-speed-up-video-in-canva-7.png)

##### Step4Use Third-Party Software (Eizgif) to Change Video Speed In Canva

1) Once you've downloaded your video file onto the system, open a new browser tab and search for [Eizgif](https://ezgif.com/video-speed) (or related speed-up video in the Canva tool). Now upload the same video on the given window.

![change video speed in canva 3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-speed-up-video-in-canva-8.png)

2) After the clip has been uploaded, a new tab will open up. Here you will find an option named "**multiplier**." Changing its value from greater than **one** will make your video move fast.

![change video speed in canva image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-speed-up-video-in-canva-9.png)

3) Adjustust the desired multiplier value and select "**change video speed**."

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![change video speed in canva tool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-speed-up-video-in-canva-10.png)

_Eizgif also gives you the freedom to adjust sound, if your video has any_

##### Step5Re-upload the Speed-Up Video In Canva Editor

1) When you feel like your video has a perfect speed, save it in your system directory.

![canva video speed up](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-speed-up-video-in-canva-11.png)

2) Now re-upload your changed video speed in Canva and drag it onto the timeline through the "**Videos**" tab.

![video canva fast speed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-speed-up-video-in-canva-12.png)

To save time, it is best to prepare ahead of time all your videos materials before start editing your testimonial video. Save it in just one folder including your script guide, photos, and videos

## Select Your Preferred Project Aspect Ratio

Aspect ratio is the relationship between the width and height of your video, which determines how it will look on different screens. There are several commonly used aspect ratios such as:

* Widescreen (16:9) – Recommended for Youtube and Facebook
* Instagram (1:1) – Recommended for Instagram and Facebook
* Portrait (9:16) – Recommended for Tiktok, Stories and Reels
* Standard (4:3) – Recommended for Facebook, LinkedInn and other

![select your project aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/filmora-project-aspect-ratio.jpg)

Being aware of the right ratio for each social media platform will help you to advertise correctly. It also affects how you edit your video. For example, if you choose a different aspect ratio than what was originally recorded by Filmora's camera tools, then some of your content may be cut off or stretched out in undesirable ways when viewed on certain devices (e.g., smartphones).

## Split Testimonial Video into Small Clips

![split testimonial video into small clips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/split-testimonial-video-filmora.jpg)

When you're ready, drag your video testimonials to the Show Track then begin to use the “split” button to cut out parts of the video.

To split a video into smaller sections, start by cutting it down to the appropriate length by moving the playhead to the beginning position of the part you want to cut, clicking the Split icon (the scissors icon) on the toolbar, or clicking the Split button on the playhead.

From there, repeat this procedure until you've completed the whole narrative. You'll be left with numerous cut segments that you may either delete or rearrange. To remove a clip from your movie, choose Delete from the toolbar or right-click and select delete.

## Add Catchy Headlines and Text (Optional)

If desired, add catchy headlines/texts like "How to Eliminate Chronic Pain Forever”. You can do this by clicking Text button from toolbar located across top portion of screen (beside Transitions button).

![add catchy headlines and text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/add-logo-to-video-filmora.jpg)

Adding a phrase or a short sentence is called “headline”. It would be nice to add one of them at your video, so that viewers can get an idea about what it's about before watching it in full. The text can be customized by using different font styles like bold, italic, underline etc., as well as its size and color.

## Input Subtitle

Subtitles are used to translate the spoken word into text. If you have a video that is in a language other than English, subtitles can be added so that viewers who do not speak the language can still understand what is being said. Subtitles are also useful if you want to add subtitles for educational purposes, such as teaching students how to pronounce certain words and phrases.

## Add Background Music to Testimonial Video

You may choose from a wide range of music in the audio library. It's available both online and offline.

You can also easily add background music from your computer by going to the "Media" menu and then selecting the import option. Make sure to use a non-copyright music so that you don't run into any copyright problems when you post your video. There are several no copyright tracks on Youtube; simply search for no copyright background music or get it from other sites that provide a free-royalty background music.

## Add a Logo/Watermark

To add a logo or watermark to your video, follow these steps:

* Import your Business Logo to the Media Folder.
* Then drag it into the Show Track area.
* Resize it to the ideal dimensions, then position it in the correct location in your video. It's preferable to place it at the top or button section of the video.

You may also add your company's logo at the end of the video as a fade-out transition.

![add business logo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/add-logo-to-video-filmora.jpg)

By adding a logo or watermark to your video, you can make it harder for people to illegally distribute and share your video without permission. It helps also to promote your brand or business. When viewers see your logo or watermark throughout the video, they will be more likely to remember who made the video and where they can find more information about your company or products.

## Insert Thumbnail

A video thumbnail is an image that represents your video to viewers. It should be eye-catching, but not so much that it's distracting. The right video thumbnail can help you increase views and engagement on your content.

Place the thumbnail at the beginning of the video, and make sure it's catchy! Your viewers won't have time to look at it in detail, but they will glance at it in passing. Make sure to include relevant text and images that can hook your audience and keep them watching!

## Guide to Create a Timelapse Video in After Effects

Time-Lapse movies are great for a variety of projects; you can use them as establishing shots in sitcoms, corporate marketing videos, and they can make lovely backgrounds for animated slideshows. A time-lapse video is essentially a series of photographs taken at regular intervals to depict how the environment changes gradually over a shorter period of time. In this article, we'll demonstrate how you may quickly and easily build an After Effects time-lapse effect.

With that said, let's start!

## Step 1\. Create a new composition

Calculating your composition length to accommodate the frame rate and number of images is the first step in generating a time-lapse video.

1. Verify the number of images you have for your Sequence.
2. New Composition Creation. Selecting a frame rate: A time lapse film produced at 30 frames per second will flow smoothly, but you can select any frame rate you like.
3. To determine the duration of your composition, divide the number of photographs you have by the frame rate you've chosen. For instance, if you use 600 photos at 30 frames per second, your composition will last 20 seconds.

## Step 2\. Import your images

You are prepared to make a time-lapse sequence if all of your photographs are saved to the same folder and are in the same order. If you are working directly from your Camera, you will likely have Camera Raw files, although this procedure works with PNG and JPEG sequences.

1. Press Command/Control I on your keyboard or select File > Import. Find the folder holding your image sequence.
2. To begin, select the first picture in the sequence. If all of your images have accurate names, After Effects will be able to identify a sequence of images.
3. Make sure the Force Alphabetical Order and Camera Raw Sequence checkboxes are selected. Your Time-Lapse Sequence will display in the Project Browser Panel after you click Import.
4. Once you've watched how it plays, you can adjust the Frame Rate by right-clicking the Sequence in the Project Browser and selecting Interpret Footage > Main.
5. To update your time-lapse, modify the Frame Rate setting and click OK.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![import images into after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/import-images-into-after-effects.jpg)

## Step 3\. Create movements

1. After Effects' Time-Lapse Sequence can be used just like any other standalone clip. This implies that you may give your time-lapse clip movement by adding Keyframes and Effects.
2. Place your Playhead at the beginning of the clip after choosing the Image Sequence. Make a keyframe for the scale or position.
3. To generate a second Keyframe for the value of your choice, move to the end of the clip. Make any necessary Clip modifications.
4. Right-click on the timeline, choose New > Adjustment Layer, then add your effects to the Adjustment Layer to add effects like noise and grain.

## Step 4\. Create slow motion from a video

You can import your video after you've shot it to prepare it for editing. The same steps, including naming your photos in order, must be taken for the Time Lapse sequence. It may be advantageous to entirely rename both your Image Sequence and Performer clip.

1. Drag the finished Time Lapse sequence to your Timeline after completing it as previously explained.
2. Over the Time Lapse, add the Performer Clip to the Timeline.
3. Choose Time>Time Stretch by performing a right-click on the performer clip.
4. You can alter the Stretch Factor or Duration in the dialogue box. When you alter one parameter, the other will reflect the new Stretch Factor or Duration for you.

## Step 5\. Make an overlay

You can alter the Stretch Factor or Duration in the dialogue box. When you alter one parameter, the other will reflect the new Stretch Factor or Duration for you.

1. Find Luma Key in the Effect Control Panel and drag it to your clip.
2. Change the Key Type setting in the Effect Control Panel to Key Out Brighter.
3. The Threshold, Tolerance, and Edge settings should be adjusted until only the silhouette is visible.
4. Use the Pen or Mask Tool to create a circle around the parts you want to delete if you discover any corners of your clip that are still visible.
5. Add any Effects, such as Light Leaks, to your Adjustment Layer by choosing "Right-click > New > Adjustment layer."

![make an overlay after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/make-an-overlay-after-effects.jpg)

After Effects CC must be opened, a new project must be created, the Import File menu option must be selected, and the appropriate folder containing the altered still images must be located and selected before the time-lapse photos can be turned into a film. You need to make sure that the JPEG Series box is checked, as well as the Force Alphabetical Order box.

Once you have clicked on the first image in the sequence. The time-lapse video that you uploaded appears in the project library. After performing a right-click on the filename, select "New Comp from Selection" from the context menu.

## Step 6\. Exporting your video

After getting our sequence to perform some kind of slow, understated animation so that it appears as though the camera is moving dramatically, we will need to export a video file. Go to File > Export > Add to Render Queue, then open the Render Queue dialog box by going to Window > Render Queue. From there, you can choose the Output Module and change the settings in the options dialog box. Finally, choose the Output To option and select the location on your computer where you would like to save the video clip that we are currently rendering and exporting.

## Steps to Create Green Screen Videos in After Effects

You'll probably get the finest results in After Effects out of all the editing programs. Working with green screen footage in After Effects can be done in a variety of ways. Utilizing a built-in preset that combines three effects is advised by Adobe. Due to its ability to deliver speedy (and typically excellent) outcomes, this strategy is great for both beginners and specialists. We'll demonstrate how to do easily for you.

Let’s start off!

## 1\. Importing your footage

After you have imported your material into the After Effects project, you should next create a new composition using the footage. In the following stage, you have the option of either adding each plugin one at a time or doing it all at once. You may find them grouped together as Keylight, Key Cleaner, and Advanced Spill Suppressor in the Animation Presets box, which is located under the "Image Utilities" heading.

## 2\. Remove the green color

After Effects users can get rid of a green screen by going to the "Animation Presets" window, searching for the "Keylight" preset, dragging, and dropping it over the clip, and then shifting their focus to the "Effects Controls" window. Make sure the Screen Colour is set to the color of your screen's background (which, in this case, is green). You may do this with the color selector.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 3\. Clean up the shot

You have no doubt observed that some of the remaining parts do not have the correct keying installed in them. In order to get rid of them, you need to put the view into the Combined Matte mode and turn the Screen Gain up a notch.

Because everything that is not transparent is turned white by Combined Matte, any remaining debris can be seen very clearly after it has been applied. After you have finished cleaning the frame, you should change the view to Intermediate Result. Your footage may become contaminated with artifacts if the Final Result view is inadvertently switched on.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![clean up green screen shot ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/clean-up-green-screen-shot-ae.jpg)

You can go to the "Screen Matte" area if you feel like the frame still needs more tweaking after you've applied the previous ones. You can accomplish that with the assistance of Clip Black and Clip White. Feel free to turn the Clip Black dial all the way to the right and turn the Clip White dial to the left. You can also adjust the other settings, if necessary, but based on my observations, everything should be working properly at this point.

## The Bottom Line

After completing this lesson, you should have a better understanding of what a chroma key is, how to get rid of a green screen in After Effects, and how to adjust some settings if something goes wrong. Keep in mind that if the footage is not captured properly, you will not be able to successfully key out the green screen in the final video. Extra caution should be taken with the lights, and spills should be avoided at all costs!
