This cool effect enables you to show a dream-like scene where two mirrored footages appear within the same frame using the Masking feature. But why stop there?

## Preparing the footage

There are not many restrictions on preparing the footage for this effect. However, depending on the results you're aiming for, you might need to consider a few things.

First, a wider view and some camera panning, or tilting will deliver a better result as it provides angle variations. This will later enhance the dynamic of the scene, making it feels even more uncanny.

Then, while you're at it, you need to also figure out the purpose of the video itself. If you want to upload it to certain platforms where vertical videos are more popular, you will want to work on that as well. When you're shooting your footage, make sure that you're taking it at the correct angle that would fit the ratio you're aiming for.

Last but not least, consider the length of the footage. If you're planning to make a bumper video, you might want a quick yet comprehensive shot of the objects you want to highlight. You can always trim and adjust the timing later, but it is better to also plan it early.

However, with many people making political videos, you have to find a way to make yours stand out. This article explores the ideal ways to make a political video and how you can edit your video to be more engaging and professional-looking. So, without further ado, let’s dive in.

**What is a Political Campaign Video?**

A political campaign video is quite similar to other forms of marketing videos. As a political candidate, you are the product, and the cause you’re promoting is your unique selling proposition. A political video helps to promote your cause to the voters. When entering into politics, political campaigns are one of the things you would need to learn how to do.

According to an [eMarketer report](https://www.emarketer.com/newsroom/index.php/us-political-ad-spending-to-hit-record-high/), political ad spending has increased by 63.3%. Political ad spending on TV has increased by 82%. However, political videos go beyond TV as the best videos go viral organically on social media. There are several other video channels where you can also share your video. One thing is clear; political videos aren’t going anywhere, and if you’re exploring this path, you need to learn how to make one. Creating an effective political campaign video is essential, and the next section informs you how you can get it done.

**4 Political Campaign Video Ideas to Consider**

There are various types of political campaign video ideas. It all depends on your target audience and the cause you’re promoting. This section will provide you with four effective pollical campaign videos you can implement in your next political campaign video.

**Make an Introduction Video**

![political-video-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/political-video-2.jpg)

This is one of the best political campaign videos you can make. The proper introduction video informs your voters about who you are and what they’ll vote for when they pick you. If you’re not new to the political scene and have been in office for quite a while, you can make an introduction video that tells your story and what you accomplished.

This political video reminds your existing supporters why they voted for you and lets you get acquainted with new voters. Several people use this idea effectively, especially those in the office. There are many videos in this format where politicians share their long voting records. However, if you’re new to the scene, the introduction video is the best way to share who you are and what you bring to the table. You can also explain the policy changes you would be implementing and why it matters.

You can spice up your political introduction video with humor and cultural references to appeal to your voters and increase your connection with them.

**Make an Endorsement Video**

![political-video-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/political-video-3.jpg)

This is also quite popular and is an excellent way of gaining the support and loyalty of voters. In a political endorsement video, you can get well-known figures in society to show their support for your cause. Most people use this type of political campaign video to show their credibility and reflect to the voters that they have the support of community leaders.

However, before you make an endorsement video, you need to ensure that your target voters like the figures that are endorsing you. Choosing people they know and love like other political leaders, celebrities, and many others increases the voters’ likelihood of supporting you. A common example of an endorsement video is President Barack Obama’s support for President Joe Biden in the 2020 election.

**Hold a Question & Answer (Q&A) Section**

![political-video-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/political-video-4.jpg)

This is another idea you can implement for your political video. You can hold a Q&A session on an Instagram story or any other platform that allows you to make a live stream. Ask your voters to send in their questions, and you can answer them in the process. A Q&A video is a great way to engage with your voters and critics. Alternatively, you can make a more produced video where someone interviews you by asking questions about your policy positions, values, and more, and you can simply answer them.

**Create Community-Focused Content**

![political-video-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/political-video-5.jpg)

This is an excellent idea for political campaign videos because it allows you to connect with a community better. Videos that focus on a community are an effective method of communicating with the community. You can request community members who support your campaign to feature in your video and share their views. It makes it easier for voters to connect with you because they will relate to their stories. Even better, your viewers might recognize some of the faces you use, promoting loyalty to your cause. Your campaign video will show how it affects everyday lives by engaging a community.

Attack political videos are also quite popular and involve a candidate who speaks negatively of another candidate. However, according to research, it is best to avoid such political videos as they have minimal effect on voter turnout. Additionally, it could backfire and affect you in the long run.

**How to Make a Political Campaign Video**

Now that you have four ideas you could utilize for your next political video; you’re probably wondering how you can go about it. Follow the steps outlined in this article to make an engaging and excellent political campaign video.

**Step 1: Set Goals**

Before you begin making a political campaign video, you need to set the goals you want to achieve. What is the outcome you want from your video? Do you really want to get your name out there, and just how many people you are hoping to achieve that? Is the goal of the video to raise donations, or do you just want to remind people to vote?

Once you decide what you’re looking to get out of the video, you can now make the best decision regarding content, format, and the metrics you want to measure. You can also set SMART goals that will motivate you to achieve the goals you set for the video.

**Step 2: Decide Your Target Audience**

Now that you know the goals you want to achieve, you can then decide who you’re looking to get your video in front of. For example, if your goal is raising money, then you can create a political video that speaks to politically engaged people in your political party.

**Step 3: What is Your Main Style and Message**

With the target audience decided and the goal in mind, create a message in a style you think is compelling and engaging. An example is using the Q&A political video idea to provide more details about you and your cause that voters do not know already. When you’re looking to effectively get your name out there, you have to draw focus to your story. Start the video off strong so that people don’t get bored and exit the video.

You can ensure that your video offers different content from your popular marketing material. Let it be new but ensure you use the same brand element, so your viewers still know it is you.

**Step 4: Create Your Storyboard**

Once you create the storyboard for your video, it makes it much easier for the production process to go smoothly. Plan the script in advance and also decide the visuals you would like. Planning helps you find out the resources you will need for the video. Additionally, you can use different storyboarding tools to plan the details of your political video.

At this point, you can choose to ask for external help to ensure everything goes as planned. For example, you could work with marketing experts or a political ad agency. Such external support has the experience and support to take your political campaign video to the next level.

**Step 5: Produce Your Political Campaign Video**

Now that everything needed is in place, it’s time to shoot your video. The equipment required usually depends on the style you’re looking to achieve. If you’re shooting the phone on your own, you need good lighting and a phone to pass your message successfully.

**Step 6: Edit Video with Wondershare Filmora**

**Research and Comply with Government Regulations**

Political videos fall into a specific category, and you want to make sure that you follow the rules. There are various regulations, which usually depend on the city, state, or country. Additionally, television advertisements have special rules and social media platforms. Therefore, you should ensure that you follow the rules. For example, although Twitter doesn’t allow for paid political advertisements, Facebook does.

**Fact-Check Your Video**

You don’t want to mislead your voters; they’re using the video to decide who to vote for. Therefore, you need to ensure that the information you include in your video is accurate. Beyond political reasons, you also have an ethical responsibility to share factual material. You also want to ensure that your video doesn’t include any embarrassing information that can hurt your campaign in the long run.

**Promote on Various Platforms**

Your target audience is on different platforms, and you need to take the video to them. The legal voting age is eighteen years. Therefore, you should bear this in mind when choosing the right platform to promote your video. Consider sites with politically-engaged voters and ensure you promote your video on such platforms.

**Final Thoughts**

Video content is essential for most modern campaigns; you can easily promote it on various social media platforms. For example, you can start with an introductory political video and then host a Q&A session down the line. Ensure you edit your video after filming to ensure it looks optimized and catchy for your audience. By implementing the practices shared in this article, your video should reach your target audience seamlessly.

## How To Lighten Up A Dark Video In Adobe Premiere Pro?

The first method that we used was quite simple. All you needed to do was to increase the brightness of the video, and you were good to go. But this method is a bit different. Although it is a little more complicated than the first method, it can do wonders for you. Suppose you have a video shot in very dim light, and it has a lot of dark sections. There is a chance that Increasing the brightness won't do much. So, you can use this method to brighten your video and improve its visibility. Just follow the steps mentioned below:

### Step 1

If you haven't already opened your video in Adobe Premiere Pro, launch the program and import your footage. Then drag it onto the timeline so that it appears at the top.

### Step 2

Effects tab can be found in the left-most panel of adobe premiere pro. Click the Effects tab and search for Lightning effects in the search bar and click on it.

Use the drag-and-drop method to add the lighting effects to the clip. Once you have done that, you will feel like your video is having a distorted flash-like effect. But don't worry as we are not going for that.

### Step 4

Now go to the effects control tab present at the top of the screen, and from there, you have to click on the lighting effects.

## Enhancing Your Video In Premiere Pro

### Step 1

![enhance video in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/premiere-pro-brighten-video-9.png)

## Can I Brighten A Dark Video?

This is a common question that comes up among video editors, so I thought I'd answer it here. The quick answer is yes.

A lot of times, you'll get a video file that was shot in low light, and it will make your subject look dark and underexposed. Video brightness is an important feature that is easy to adjust. However, if your video is too dark to start off with, it may be difficult to brighten it in a way that doesn't look unnatural.

There are several ways you can brighten a dark video. For example, you can use color correction or add more light to the scene before you film. If you already have a dark video, then you'll need to adjust the contrast and brightness of your video during post-production. You can easily do this by using video editing software but keep in mind that too much brightness or too much contrast can result in poor video quality. So, you have to keep everything in balance.
