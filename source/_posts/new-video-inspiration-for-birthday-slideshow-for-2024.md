![filmora box](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/banner/filmora-latest-product-box-right-side.png)

Step 1: Open Filmora and remove all the pieces of the footage. Then arrange the rest of the footage as you see fit. Click on "Effects" on the upper left corner of your screen and then on "Filters". Click on the Old Video effect and then drop it. After you add the filter on the segment of your video, you can drag the end of it to cover the whole duration of the movies. Click twice on the filter if you want to adjust the filter settings. Enter the desired values on the "Fade" parameter, "Frequency", and "Alpha" options. Press "OK", and this step is concluded.

![old film overlay 1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vintage-videos-1.png)

Step 2: You can apply the black and white filters to any project in Filmora. It is very simple. Add one of the filters above the video you want to add the effect and drag one of the corners to adjust the duration. You can change the intensity through the alpha slider.

![old film overlay 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vintage-videos-2.png)

Step 3: In Filmora, you can add sepia tone rise or sun-kissed filters to your video. You are able to add desaturated filters while keeping colors like blue and green and with that create the old film style. If you want more brown and red tones, you can use the Sun-Kisser filter that highlights those colors. Adjust the filters with the alpha slider to change intensity.

![old film overlay 3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vintage-videos-3.png)

Step 4: Under the black and white subcategory, you can find Ash and Willow filters. What these do is desaturate the contrast or exposure values as well as preset brightness and bring an older tone to your videos.

Step 5: You can correct any kind of filter. With the Advanced Color Correction Tab, you can navigate through features like Preset and Adjustment and desaturate your video. By clicking on the "Preset tab," you can open a larger variety of presets, including the Old Film and Black & White presets.

![filmora advance color correction](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-advance-color-correction.jpg)

## Part 4: Pro Tips to Create Stunning Retro Video

You can make your video look retro with a few simple tips:

* Use several vintage apps like Retro VHS, 8mm Camcorder, and others.
* Keep low highlights and low contrasts.
* Keep low saturation and control the hue, saturation, and luminance of your video.
* Film Overlays. With this, you can bring the mood just right. If you add a soft light overall to start with, it will instantly look slightly more vintage.
* By decreasing contrast, you are darkening your videos and giving them a grainier old look.
* If you bring up the black levels, you will leave more space for other tones to shine and turn the mood around your videos.
* In contrast, if you bring down the whites in your videos, making even the brightest colors turn grey.

### Conclusion

There are various ways to turn your videos into old relics. Using Filmora, you have a powerful tool in your hands to change any desired media, and with this step-by-step guide, you will get there in no time.

## How to Do Censor Effects with Filmora

There are many aspects to consider when it comes to publishing a video. Safety and privacy aspects are some of them. If you're looking to blur out a bystander or cut out profanities from your video with Filmora, this is the right article for you.

## Part 1\. How to add a beep sound to a video with Filmora

Filmora's powerful video editing menu includes easy tweaking on audio. You can censor any part of speech you want to exclude from your video with just these simple steps.

Step1 Create a new project and import the video to Filmora.

![import the video to filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/censor-effects-with-filmora-1.jpg)

Step2 Separate the audio component from the video by right-clicking on the video and selecting the Detach Audio option. You can now edit each of them individually.

![detach the audio component](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/censor-effects-with-filmora-2.jpg)

Step3 Mark the part to place the start of the beep using the playhead and click the Split icon on the editor’s toolbar.

![split to separate the target segment](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/censor-effects-with-filmora-3.gif)

Step4 Place the playhead at the end of the censored segment and click Split. Double-click on the segment to open the audio editing menu, then you can remove that part of the audio or lower the volume.

![adjusting the split audio segment](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/censor-effects-with-filmora-4.jpg)

Step5 Click the **Audio>Audio** Effects menu on the upper left corner of the screen. After you find the Beep effect, drag the track to the audio timeline and place it in between the split section. Adjust trimming and volume until the censor is placed correctly.

## Part 2\. How to add mosaic to video with Filmora

Whether you want to hide a passerby's face or your own, or even other types of objects, Wondershare Filmora is ready to take on the task. While its nifty face-off function automatically follows the movement of a marked face, the mosaic effect is the fast and perfect solution for a static object in the video.

Step1 After importing a video to Filmora, tap on the Effects tab and find the Mosaic filter from the gallery.

![find the mosaic effect from the effects library](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/censor-effects-with-filmora-6.jpg)

Step2 Drag the Mosaic filter to the timeline just above the main video track.

![drag the mosaic effect to timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/censor-effects-with-filmora-7.jpg)

Step3 A yellow box will appear in the viewer. You can drag and adjust its size to hide the targetted object. You can also adjust the opacity and intensity of the effect using the adjustment menu, accessible when you double-click the yellow box.

![adjust the mosaic effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/censor-effects-with-filmora-8.jpg)

If the targetted object moves, you can set the automatic tracking before adding the mosaic filter by clicking on the **Motion Tracking**\>**Start Tracking** located above the timeline. Before you place the filter, preview and adjust the tracking frame to ensure tight proof censor.

![setting up motion tracking feature](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/censor-effects-with-filmora-9.jpg)

On top of completing it with audio effects, you can also add subtitles or typography easily.

With Filmora, you can always enhance your video within minutes with excellent quality.

## How to Convert MOV to GIF Using Wondershare Filmora?

**Step 1: Import the MOV file**

To get started, simply drag and drop your MOV file onto the interface of Filmora. Alternatively, click on the “Import” button in the upper left corner to browse and load the MOV file from your hard drive or external storage device. A third option is to right-click on the video in the media library and choose "Import Media Files" from the drop-down menu. This will open up a new window where you can select your desired video file.

![import media files in wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mov-to-gif-converters-9.jpg)

Now that you have successfully imported your MOV file into Filmora, let's look at how to proceed with making a GIF out of it.

**Step 2: Trim to shorten the video**

Next, you will need to trim the video. This is optional, but important if you want to make a GIF from a video. A longer video means a bigger file size and an increased loading time for your final GIF, so try to keep it as short as possible!

![trim the video in wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mov-to-gif-converters-10.jpg)

To trim your video, add another start and endpoint by clicking on the scissors icon below. You can also put them in manually by typing in the time (in seconds) into the box provided.

**Step 3: Export as GIF**

Click on the Export button to open up the Export dialog box. From here, you can choose how you want your file exported from a number of options including GIF under the Formats tab. Under the Video tab, select the video quality settings that best suit your requirements. You can also set the frame rate and resolution for your GIF image file at this point. Once you are done, click on Save to specify a location for your file as well as a name for it.

![export mov to gif in wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mov-to-gif-converters-11.jpg)

**Step 4: Save the GIF file**

Click "Convert" to start the MOV to GIF conversion.

When it's done, click "Open Folder", and you'll see the generated GIF file there, which could be shared with others via social platforms such as Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook directly or used for other purposes.
