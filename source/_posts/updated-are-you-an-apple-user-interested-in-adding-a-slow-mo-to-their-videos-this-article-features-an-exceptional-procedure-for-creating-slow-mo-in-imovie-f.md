## Part 1: An Introduction to Slow Motion Videos: A Comprehensive Review

Slow-mo videos are recorded at a frame rate higher than 24 frames per second (fps). After that, they are replayed at a slower pace. This method produces an effect that can bring out special moments. Slow-motion recordings are frequently employed in sports, action, and wildlife cinematography.

What makes it so popular is how it captures fast-moving scenes in better detail. Access to the slow-motion effect was not so common, but with apps like [**iMovie slow-mo**](https://www.apple.com/imovie/), the effect is accessible to everyone. You can use online video editors or desktop editing software to make slow-motion videos.
