## Part 2: How to Set Slow Motion Settings in iMovie Video Making?

iMovie is a wonderful choice if you want to make slow-motion videos. Also, it allows users to change the speed of video clips per their needs. With **slo-mo in iMovie**, you can even fine-tune the speed of a single clip by splitting it into intervals, each with a different speed. You can set multiple ranges to cause a clip to speed up and down.

You can freeze a single frame in your film to create the illusion that time has stopped. The app is a fantastic option for Apple users who want to quickly add slow-motion effects to their videos. iMovie is a pretty straightforward tool that gives quick results. Follow the step-by-step guide below to **slow down video in iMovie**.

##### Step 1

Launch iMovie in your system and click “New Project.” Go to the “Movies” option to import the video you want to edit. Drag the media in the project timeline to make changes to it.

From “Speed,” select the “Slow” option and choose the percentage of slow-motion effect you want to apply in your video.
