Every budding photographer knows what Photoshop is Adobe Lightroom (officially Adobe Photoshop Lightroom) is the newer and more advanced version of Photoshop. Compared with [other alternatives of Lightroom](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), Lightroom helps photographers import, modify, manipulate, find, organize, and manage their images as an image editing software. Lightroom combines photo management and photo editing in one.

One of the most amazing things about Lightroom is its autosave or nondestructive feature. Once you edit your photos, Lightroom instantly saves and stores them in your Lightroom catalog. With its inbuilt-presets, Lightroom makes working on your project so much easy and fun.

You can leverage Lightroom's unique features to perform different types of tasks. However, in this article, you'll learn color grading in Lightroom and how to make it work.

## What Is Color Grading?

Color grading is one of the essential processes for creating the perfect video and image content. Like with color correction, color grading helps enhance the appearance of your image or video and makes it appealing to viewers. However, unlike color correction, it focuses on creating stylistic or cinematic effects rather than rectifying mistakes in the image.

Color grading enhances an already edited or otherwise perfect image or video. So, in color grading, you are not trying to balance out colors or make your pictures look natural to the human eyes. Color correction does all that. Instead, with color grading, you aim to "paint over" a color-corrected content to evoke specific emotions or moods in the viewers.

Colors carry different emotions or visual tones. So, they're essential in the post-production process to manipulate viewers into specific moods that tell your story best. In other words, color grading aligns your viewer's emotions to the central theme in your story.

![color grading in lightroom](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/color-grading-lightroom-1.jpg)

For example, if your image or video's theme is passion, power, violence, or danger, red portrays them perfectly. Meanwhile, blue does it when you wish to evoke calmness and melancholy in your viewers.

Other examples include:

* pink for beauty, innocence, and femininity,
* Green for nature, darkness, and corruption
* Purple for fantasies, and the mystical
* Yellow for obsession, sickness, and naivety
* Orange for warmth, friendliness, youth, and happiness

Have you noticed that turning your pictures black and white makes them look timeless? That's color grading in action.

## Color Grading in LightRoom

Are you amazed by the thrilling power of color grading to manipulate viewers' emotions? Are you wondering how you can achieve that effect seamlessly? Then, you don't need to worry about it. With Adobe Photoshop Lightroom, you too can make magic.

Since Lightroom is an advanced photo editor, it has a lot to offer in features. Unfortunately, this may also mean that it can be complex to understand, especially if you're new to photo editing. So, first things first, you must understand the color grading panel in Lightroom to appreciate it better.

Lightroom's color grading panel is right beneath the HSL panel in the Develop Panel. It serves as a replacement for the Split Toning Panel from earlier versions, so it's pretty easy to find.

The color grading panel comprises five small icons, three color wheels, and a blending/balance slider:

### ● The Five Small Icons

Lightroom's small icons are a 3-way default layout, shadows, mid-tones, highlights, and global. With 3-way, you can manipulate the highlights, shadows, and mid-tones. Mid-tones, highlights, and shadows hide all color wheels, excluding the necessary ones that adjust them.

Meanwhile, Global combines and blends the highlights, mid-tones, and shadow adjustments no matter the luminosity. Global ensures that the color wheels work harmoniously.

When adjusting icons, it's best to use each color wheel one after another one. You'll get better and more precise outcomes that way compared to using them together.

### ● Lightroom's Color Wheels

You can view Lightroom's three-color wheels through the 3-way default layout. The color wheels help to enhance distinct image parts by providing various color hues. It also allows you to introduce saturation through an adjustable knob.

Each lightroom's color wheels feature a luminance slide beneath them that adjusts color brightness. Between the luminance slide and the wheel is a visible eye icon that you can use to turn the effects on or off.

### ● The Blending and Balance Slider

The blending and balance sliders offer you advanced control over how your colors look after introducing them. With the blending slider, you can control the color distinctiveness between highlights and shadows. In other words, this feature helps to merge colors to produce a much more balanced and beautiful result.

The balance slider adjusts altered mid-tones, highlights, and shadows to balance the effects. By default, the slider is set at 0 in the middle and allows you to move it in opposite directions for distinct effects. For example, you can use this tool to balance shadows with over-concentrated colors.

While the above features are visible to everyone in the 3-way view, there are two more hidden sliders. You may only view them when editing highlights, shadows, mid-tones, or the global color wheels. They're the hue and saturation sliders that you can only uncover by clicking on the arrow below the eye icon.

There's no idea why the hue and saturation sliders aren't visible in the 3-way view. That's especially when you discover that they do the all-important job of making minor but precise changes to final adjustments. This produces an excellent fine-tuned outcome and gives your image a professional finish.

## How To Color Grade Your Picture in LightRoom

If you wish to use the color grading Lightroom tool to enhance photos, here's a comprehensive guide for you. You'll learn the best practices to apply when using the specific Lightroom features to produce your desired effects:

#### ● Pick Your Color Scheme

What's color grading without the right colors? Choosing an appropriate color scheme is one of the essential steps in Lightroom color grading. That's because it sets the tone for the next steps. If you choose the wrong colors, you won't get the excellent result you desire no matter how hard you try.

First, take a good look at your picture and its visible colors. Then think of the colors that compliment or contrast with them. For example, you should base images with red highlights around red. You can also try colors close to red in the color wheel, like orange.

Once you've found the colors that suit your image, you're ready for the next steps in your color grading process. However, more than just adding colors, you must also pay attention to contrasting colors during processing. If you find such unwanted colors, use the HSL panel to pale them out.

#### ● Prioritize Precision

In earlier paragraphs, you learned that working with the highlights, shadows, and mid-tones individually is best. That's because individual adjustments are a painstaking process that guarantees the most accurate results. This makes a lot of difference in the final product compared to when you work with the wheel.

Working on the shadows, highlights, and mid-tones individually also connects to the hue and saturation sliders. So you remember how vital these hidden sliders are? You wouldn't be able to access them by working on the tools one after another. Take that as your reward for being detail-oriented.

#### ● Increase Saturation Values

Sometimes, the effect of one tool tells on another. For example, leaving your saturation values below may render your hue slider ineffective. To avoid that confusion, it's best to increase your saturation levels to some values higher than your preferred one.

Yes, it wouldn't look nice initially as you adjust the hue. However, it will ensure that you get the perfect color for your image. You can always go back to adjust the saturation to your choice values later on.

#### ● Use Color Wheels To Find Color, Use Shadows to Refine

When discussing how to choose your color scheme, you must have understood how vital the color wheel is in finding harmonious hues. However, picking your preferred color isn't the complete process. You must learn to fine-tune your chosen color by using the hue slider. Do this after adjusting the saturation to your preferred level as in the previous step. The result is always mind-blowing.

![how to use color grading in lightroom](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/color-grading-lightroom-3.jpg)

#### ● Learn the Short Cuts

There are some shortcuts to learn when color grading in Lightroom to enhance accuracy and convenience. For example, option (Mac)/Alt (Windows) gives you better control over your image's outcomes. Option/Alt + Up will increase saturation by one while the shift key adjusts it. You can use Command (Mac)/Ctrl (Windows) to adjust the hue. Also, the reset button on the right side of your panel takes you back to your initial image.

#### ● Extra Tips

These best practices will help you to achieve excellent results:

1. Don't color grade without understanding the psychology of colors. Know what colors convey different moods or emotions.
2. Be sure to work with high-quality pictures. Color grading isn't magic; it wouldn't correct an already lousy image.
3. Shooting your pictures in RAW gives you more color control.

## Conclusion

● Now that you've learned how to color grade using Lightroom, there's no limit to what you can achieve. You can now explore your creative side with so much fun. However, know that you will likely not get it right the first time. Perfection comes with consistent practice or trial and error.

Since Lightroom is an advanced photo editor, it has a lot to offer in features. Unfortunately, this may also mean that it can be complex to understand, especially if you're new to photo editing. So, first things first, you must understand the color grading panel in Lightroom to appreciate it better.

Lightroom's color grading panel is right beneath the HSL panel in the Develop Panel. It serves as a replacement for the Split Toning Panel from earlier versions, so it's pretty easy to find.

The color grading panel comprises five small icons, three color wheels, and a blending/balance slider:

### ● The Five Small Icons

Lightroom's small icons are a 3-way default layout, shadows, mid-tones, highlights, and global. With 3-way, you can manipulate the highlights, shadows, and mid-tones. Mid-tones, highlights, and shadows hide all color wheels, excluding the necessary ones that adjust them.

Meanwhile, Global combines and blends the highlights, mid-tones, and shadow adjustments no matter the luminosity. Global ensures that the color wheels work harmoniously.

When adjusting icons, it's best to use each color wheel one after another one. You'll get better and more precise outcomes that way compared to using them together.

### ● Lightroom's Color Wheels

You can view Lightroom's three-color wheels through the 3-way default layout. The color wheels help to enhance distinct image parts by providing various color hues. It also allows you to introduce saturation through an adjustable knob.

Each lightroom's color wheels feature a luminance slide beneath them that adjusts color brightness. Between the luminance slide and the wheel is a visible eye icon that you can use to turn the effects on or off.

### ● The Blending and Balance Slider

The blending and balance sliders offer you advanced control over how your colors look after introducing them. With the blending slider, you can control the color distinctiveness between highlights and shadows. In other words, this feature helps to merge colors to produce a much more balanced and beautiful result.

The balance slider adjusts altered mid-tones, highlights, and shadows to balance the effects. By default, the slider is set at 0 in the middle and allows you to move it in opposite directions for distinct effects. For example, you can use this tool to balance shadows with over-concentrated colors.

While the above features are visible to everyone in the 3-way view, there are two more hidden sliders. You may only view them when editing highlights, shadows, mid-tones, or the global color wheels. They're the hue and saturation sliders that you can only uncover by clicking on the arrow below the eye icon.

There's no idea why the hue and saturation sliders aren't visible in the 3-way view. That's especially when you discover that they do the all-important job of making minor but precise changes to final adjustments. This produces an excellent fine-tuned outcome and gives your image a professional finish.

## How To Color Grade Your Picture in LightRoom

If you wish to use the color grading Lightroom tool to enhance photos, here's a comprehensive guide for you. You'll learn the best practices to apply when using the specific Lightroom features to produce your desired effects:

#### ● Pick Your Color Scheme

What's color grading without the right colors? Choosing an appropriate color scheme is one of the essential steps in Lightroom color grading. That's because it sets the tone for the next steps. If you choose the wrong colors, you won't get the excellent result you desire no matter how hard you try.

First, take a good look at your picture and its visible colors. Then think of the colors that compliment or contrast with them. For example, you should base images with red highlights around red. You can also try colors close to red in the color wheel, like orange.

Once you've found the colors that suit your image, you're ready for the next steps in your color grading process. However, more than just adding colors, you must also pay attention to contrasting colors during processing. If you find such unwanted colors, use the HSL panel to pale them out.

#### ● Prioritize Precision

In earlier paragraphs, you learned that working with the highlights, shadows, and mid-tones individually is best. That's because individual adjustments are a painstaking process that guarantees the most accurate results. This makes a lot of difference in the final product compared to when you work with the wheel.

Working on the shadows, highlights, and mid-tones individually also connects to the hue and saturation sliders. So you remember how vital these hidden sliders are? You wouldn't be able to access them by working on the tools one after another. Take that as your reward for being detail-oriented.

#### ● Increase Saturation Values

Sometimes, the effect of one tool tells on another. For example, leaving your saturation values below may render your hue slider ineffective. To avoid that confusion, it's best to increase your saturation levels to some values higher than your preferred one.

Yes, it wouldn't look nice initially as you adjust the hue. However, it will ensure that you get the perfect color for your image. You can always go back to adjust the saturation to your choice values later on.

#### ● Use Color Wheels To Find Color, Use Shadows to Refine

When discussing how to choose your color scheme, you must have understood how vital the color wheel is in finding harmonious hues. However, picking your preferred color isn't the complete process. You must learn to fine-tune your chosen color by using the hue slider. Do this after adjusting the saturation to your preferred level as in the previous step. The result is always mind-blowing.

![how to use color grading in lightroom](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/color-grading-lightroom-3.jpg)

#### ● Learn the Short Cuts

There are some shortcuts to learn when color grading in Lightroom to enhance accuracy and convenience. For example, option (Mac)/Alt (Windows) gives you better control over your image's outcomes. Option/Alt + Up will increase saturation by one while the shift key adjusts it. You can use Command (Mac)/Ctrl (Windows) to adjust the hue. Also, the reset button on the right side of your panel takes you back to your initial image.

#### ● Extra Tips

These best practices will help you to achieve excellent results:

1. Don't color grade without understanding the psychology of colors. Know what colors convey different moods or emotions.
2. Be sure to work with high-quality pictures. Color grading isn't magic; it wouldn't correct an already lousy image.
3. Shooting your pictures in RAW gives you more color control.

## Conclusion

● Now that you've learned how to color grade using Lightroom, there's no limit to what you can achieve. You can now explore your creative side with so much fun. However, know that you will likely not get it right the first time. Perfection comes with consistent practice or trial and error.

## Change Video Speed with FFmpeg

Have you ever wanted to speed up or slow down a video? Maybe it was too long, or you wanted to draw out an exciting part of the video without having to watch the boring parts.

In this article, we will be showing you how to use FFmpeg to speed up and slow down your videos using CLI. You'll also find some other useful FFmpeg commands that you can use on your videos.

Finally, we will explain how to automate these commands so that you can run them on all your videos with ease.

![how to automate these commands](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-speed-ffmeg-1.jpg)

## Part 1\. [What is FFmpeg?](https://ffmpeg.org/about.html)

FFmpeg is a free and open-source cross-platform software project that can record, convert, and stream audio and video. It was developed by Fabrice Bellard in 2000\. It has since become one of the most popular tools for transcoding media content on Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, Windows NT, and more.

One of its lesser-known capabilities is to speed up or slow down videos in just about any design you can think of — with either the audio or the video synced to the other if desired.

### [Uses of FFmpeg](https://ottverse.com/what-is-ffmpeg-installation-use-cases/)

FFMPEG is a command-line tool that can manipulate and transcode video files. Its uses are as follows:

* FFmpeg can create, trim, join or separate video clips on the fly and encode them into formats including MPEG, VOB, M2TS, TS, RMVB, or AVI.
* It can be used for Video processing, Video packaging support, Video compression, Audio, and Video container support, FFplay, and FFprobe.
* It also has extensive options for altering the look of an image in just about any way imaginable. Whether you want to change the brightness, hue, saturation, or perform multiple operations like subsampling (resizing) without reducing quality—the list goes on!

You could think of it as the Swiss army knife for video manipulation tasks. The interface might seem intimidating at first, but once you get the hang of it, all commands are broken down into simple English phrases.

The most important thing to know before getting started with this is how to use FFmpeg's -i and -v flags for input and output, respectively. To apply effects like slow motion playback or fast motion playback, use these flags in tandem with one another when specifying which file should be edited.

### Benefits and Disadvantages of FFmpeg

FFmpeg has many benefits over other video editing software because it is free and open source, meaning that you have access to the code so that you can modify it if needed. Thus, it's a better option when compared to other video editing software such as Avidemux, QuickTime Pro 7, and Adobe Premiere Elements 12\. Some of these benefits include:

* Being able to edit videos on multiple platforms (Windows, Mac OS X);
* FFmpeg has features to speed up and slow down video;
* Being able to convert from one format into another seamlessly;
* An extensive amount of features are at your disposal.

Some of the drawbacks are that some settings are not configurable, like with YouTube's built-in editor. The main disadvantage, though, would be the lengthiness of the program's installation process: not only do you need to download FFmpeg itself but also three external libraries like libx264, libmp3lame, and libfaac; then you must compile all six packages before the installation completes. Luckily this process doesn't take very long.

Another possible disadvantage is the time required for downloading the various resources since they may not be readily available on standard file hosting sites such as Mediafire or Dropbox (though they can be found through third-party websites). If you're looking for something more robust than Windows Movie Maker or iMovie, we recommend checking out FFmpeg.

## Part 2\. How to Speed Up a Video in FFmpeg?

FFmpeg can be used to speed up videos. It's not the only option, but it's one of the most common ways to make your videos faster. If you want your video to be faster, then FFmpeg is the right tool for the job. Some speed-up features include: FFmpeg speed up video and audio, ffmpeg speed up video mp4, ffmpeg change video speed, and so on.

### The Ultimate Step-by-Step Guide to speed up a video in FFmpeg

The presentation timestamp (PTS) of each video frame can be modified to alter the pace of a video stream.

Step1 Open a terminal and type in FFmpeg. This will open the program.

![open the program](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-speed-ffmeg-2.png)

Step2 Drag and drop the video file onto the window.

Step3 This is accomplished with the command -filter:v "setpts=."

Step4 According to the documentation, fast motion requires: -filter:v setpts=0.5\*PTS.

![fast motion requires](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-speed-ffmeg-3.png)

Step5 Click Enter.

![click enter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-speed-ffmeg-4.png)

Step6 The result would be a sped-up version of your video.

### Major approaches to speed up a video in Filmora

As we know that Filmora has the option to change the speed of a video, so let's find out step-by-step how to do that; you can also watch this [Tutorial on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w6CEhFHnII):

### Method 1: Use the 'Fast' or 'Slow' option to change the speed

Just as simple as the heading is, this option is pretty straightforward, but you cannot decide how much speed you want to add to your video or how slow you want it to be.

### Method 2: Changing Uniform Speed in Wondershare Filmora

You need to check your video's FPS and import your clip first.

Pick your preferred video. Go to the menu and select "Download." After hitting the "Plus" button, you may maintain the video's quality by choosing "Match to Media."

![go to the menu](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/change-video-speed-2.PNG)

After the movie has loaded, you have two options: double-clicking the clip or selecting the speed option provided below the screen.

![double clicking the clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/change-video-speed-3.PNG)

A window appears when we double-click the chosen video. We shall navigate to the "SPEED" section beneath this window. Additional "Uniform Speed" and "Speed Ramping" panels may be found on this speed panel. We shall operate within the uniform speed panel to alter the video's tempo consistently. A slider is provided for us to adjust the movie's pacing.

The general speed of the film is continually increased or decreased when we choose the option for constant pace. If we choose the speed option on the screen, it gives us a built-in range of numbers that we can use to change the video's pace in addition to presets like rapid and regular slow.

![rapid and regular slow](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/change-video-speed-4.PNG)

Once we click "OK," the video's tempo adjusts automatically.

### Method 3: Adjusting the Fast/Slow motion to fit your movie using the Speed Ramping option

To set up the speed ramping feature for your video, double-clicking the video will give us access to the "SPEED RAMPING" option in the speed panel. When we select the speed ramping option, we see a range of graphs. Each graph shows a number of tempo variations that we may use in our movie.

For Instance, when we select the "MONTAGE" preset, the video's tempo changes based on how many keyframes we choose and at what rate. As previously stated, as the graph rises above one and falls below one, the movie's tempo will slow down, increasing its regular speed.

![increasing its regular speed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/change-video-speed-8.PNG)

Moving these keyframes higher will make the video go more quickly, while moving them downward will make the movie move more slowly. We may also add more keyframes by using the add button up top, as seen in the image. When satisfied with our results, we will produce the video after pressing the "OK" button.
