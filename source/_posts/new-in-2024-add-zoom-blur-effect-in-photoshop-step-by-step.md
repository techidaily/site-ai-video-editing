## Motion Tracking Using The Best Video Editors

One of the powerful editing features offered by several premium-grade video editors is motion tracking. It not only boosts the overall video quality but also helps ensuring the object is engaged throughout the video. Many users fail to apply the motion tracking effect to the videos because they don’t use a reliable tool. The primary motive of this discussion is to provide you with the best-in-class motion tracker.

Not only will we tell you the name of the software, but we will also guide you through the procedure of doing this. Moreover, many of you don't know what motion tracking is. So, this article will also provide significant information about this.

## Part 1: What Is Motion Tracking in Video Editing?

[Motion tracking](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) helps you analyze the movements of different objects in your video content. This process involves various tasks that can be very helpful in video editing. For example, tracking and identifying the position of elements over time. The main purpose of motion tracking is to add graphics. Moreover, you can also add digital effects to the tracked objects.

You will need special software or video editing tools to perform this process. Here's how you can understand the motion tracking process with ease:

### Selection of Object

The editor can select the object that he wants to track in an effective manner. This object can be a person or any moving element that needs tracking. Moreover, it can also be a moving vehicle or a logo as well. Tracking these moving elements in the frame can allow the editor to improve the areas which have high contrast or distinct features.

### Tracking Points

Selecting the object allows the software to identify specific points in the frame. These points can have distinct features or a high contrast that may affect the video quality. With the help of **video motion tracking**, the editor can note down these areas and improve them to enhance the viewer experience.

### Data Mapping

Once the software tracks the movements, it can be very useful for the editor. This is because it calculates the changes in position and rotation of each point. Moreover, it also maps the tracked data into a visual representation for the coordinating system. Using this system, the movements of the objects can be recreated in a 3D space.

### Using Effects and Refinement

After obtaining the motion tracking data, the video editor can apply different effects on the object. These effects can include adding graphics and text to the scene. Moreover, it can also help in animation or compositing visual elements. To ensure the accurate alignment of the effects, the editor may need to use extra tracking techniques or manual adjustments.

## Competition to Renderforest

Animoto and PowToon are a couple of the site's main rivals. These are excellent online video editing tools, but Renderforest stands out because it is simple to use and enables even novice users to create, share quickly, and download "broadcast grade videos."

**Renderforest vs PowToon**

One of the most popular Renderforest Video alternatives available is PowToon. It's challenging to decide which of these two platforms is superior because they are the best on the market. What you want as a business owner ultimately determines everything.

PowToon is a similar business that focuses on corporate videos but doesn't provide the extra things Renderforest delivers (logo maker, graphic design, mockups, website builder). Pro customers pay $89 per month ($20 if invoiced annually), which is significantly more expensive than the alternative. Fortunately, they offer a complimentary bundle so you can sample the goods.

PowToon offers many more customizing choices than Renderforest because it is a video-based platform, but it will cost you.

Renderforest is a more cost-effective option if you need a range of services for your small business. PowToon is a better option for more prominent firms seeking a professional video creation platform.

Currently, some internet video services might be pricey and time-consuming to use. Renderforest will be welcomed by many small businesses looking for an economical and user-friendly online video editing platform.

Renderforest combines the top tools under a single subscription bundle in terms of features. In the end, you can manage your website, branding, and marketing visual production for less than $25 per month.
