## Part 1 Tips For Creating An Impressive Slideshow Presentation

To create a unique and engaging slideshow presentation, we have shortlisted some tips that will surely work. Check them as below.

**●** **Have a theme**

First of all, have a theme for a slideshow based on which the other elements can be selected. The theme or the story you want to portray can be based on the target audience and the purpose of creating a slideshow. For instance, if you want to generate sales from your products, create a slideshow that shows the benefits of your products and compares them with others in the same category.

**●** **Keep it simple**

The real purpose of a slideshow presentation is to convey your data or message in a simple manner that can be easily related. Since the slides move one after the other in a slideshow, they should be created in a manner so that the viewer can quickly understand them.

**●** **Keep minimum text**

Though text can be included in a slideshow, keep them to a minimum. A slideshow is a creative presentation having pictures, videos, graphs, and several other elements. So, keep the text whenever necessary and don’t include too much-written content. Moreover, a viewer can relate to and recall the product, brand, or service more through a message rather than a text.

**●** **Include compelling visuals**

Include relevant visuals like videos and images into your slideshow. Make sure that the files are in high resolution and clear and support the theme or the message you are trying to convey through the presentation.

**●** **Add effects, filters, overlays, and other elements**

Instead of adding the raw image and video footage, edit and customize them to make them more interesting and engaging. There are several professional video editing tools like Wondershare Filmora and others that can help you add effects, transitions, overlays, filters, and customize files as needed. Additional elements like graphs, charts, and more can also be added to the presentation.

**●** **Use Templates**

Templates are ready-made design that helps you create a slideshow presentation quickly and easily. The templates in a variety of designs in different categories are available for you to choose the most suitable one. You can check the collection of templates from various online sites and tools.

## Part 1 Tips For Creating An Impressive Slideshow Presentation

To create a unique and engaging slideshow presentation, we have shortlisted some tips that will surely work. Check them as below.

**●** **Have a theme**

First of all, have a theme for a slideshow based on which the other elements can be selected. The theme or the story you want to portray can be based on the target audience and the purpose of creating a slideshow. For instance, if you want to generate sales from your products, create a slideshow that shows the benefits of your products and compares them with others in the same category.

**●** **Keep it simple**

The real purpose of a slideshow presentation is to convey your data or message in a simple manner that can be easily related. Since the slides move one after the other in a slideshow, they should be created in a manner so that the viewer can quickly understand them.

**●** **Keep minimum text**

Though text can be included in a slideshow, keep them to a minimum. A slideshow is a creative presentation having pictures, videos, graphs, and several other elements. So, keep the text whenever necessary and don’t include too much-written content. Moreover, a viewer can relate to and recall the product, brand, or service more through a message rather than a text.

**●** **Include compelling visuals**

Include relevant visuals like videos and images into your slideshow. Make sure that the files are in high resolution and clear and support the theme or the message you are trying to convey through the presentation.

**●** **Add effects, filters, overlays, and other elements**

Instead of adding the raw image and video footage, edit and customize them to make them more interesting and engaging. There are several professional video editing tools like Wondershare Filmora and others that can help you add effects, transitions, overlays, filters, and customize files as needed. Additional elements like graphs, charts, and more can also be added to the presentation.

**●** **Use Templates**

Templates are ready-made design that helps you create a slideshow presentation quickly and easily. The templates in a variety of designs in different categories are available for you to choose the most suitable one. You can check the collection of templates from various online sites and tools.

## Why Is It Necessary to Remove Audio from a Video?

You can make a video far more versatile and successful for many different things by removing the audio.

### Your Video Becomes Multipurpose

Taking the audio out of a video makes it more versatile. Presentations, slide decks, and instructional videos may all benefit from this. The original audio or background noise might be too distracting in such videos.

### No Language Issues

The muted or removed audio lets you reach viewers who speak a different language. By removing the original audio, the video becomes language-neutral. Thus, you save time adding subtitles or dubbing without disturbing the narration.

### Place Emphasis on the Video Itself

Cutting off the sound may make the video's visuals the main attraction. It may be beneficial when creating tutorials or instructional videos. That's because viewers may prefer to see the demos without the sound.

### Eliminating Excessive Background Noise

The video might get dull with background noises, echoes, or unwanted sounds. Deleting the audio stream helps to eliminate distractions. As a result, viewers get a cleaner viewing experience.

### Keeping Copyright Concerns at Bay

Businesses can avoid copyright infringement problems by eliminating audio from videos. Removing someone's audio work before using it in public venues is necessary. It supports copyright laws on audio material by limiting display to visual components.

As you can see, removing audio from a video has several benefits. Many options are available when you mute the audio in a video. By eliminating background noise, you're freeing your imagination.

So, how do silent videos improve your video production strategies? Let's find out!

## How Can You Improve Storytelling With Silent Videos?

There is a much unrealized narrative potential in silent videos. Most videos rely only on visual elements to convey narratives. Thus, mute clips have a unique ability to captivate audiences. It also offers many possibilities for storytelling, allowing for a more immersive experience.

### Setting a Narrative

Videos without sound force viewers to rely more on their visual perception of the tale. It can draw your viewers closer to the visuals. Moreover, it also heightens their involvement with the story as it develops.

### Improving Stories

Silence directs the viewer's attention to certain visual aspects. When you remove all sound distractions, the audience can focus on the pictures. It helps you highlight essential story aspects.

For instance, rely on more than just dialogue to convey emotion. Instead, you can take a modest close-up of the character's face.

### Build Emotions With No Audio

One effective method of building intense emotions is the complete absence of sound. Remember, silent clips can keep viewers on the top of their seats. The audience may get more invested in the story's raw essence when a scene unfolds in silence. In short, this technique aims to evoke a range of emotions in the audience.

### Add Metaphor

The lack of audio permits the use of symbolic language only via visual representations. You can use each picture to convey information. It eliminates the need for dialogue or background music.

The audience can interact with the story on a deeper level via interpretation. Here, video scenes, objects, or actions work as symbols.

### Simplify Complex Stories

Silent videos let storytellers elicit strong emotional reactions from audiences. They can co-create the story by deciphering visual cues. Besides, they can also add thoughts, emotions, and interpretations in silent videos. Without words, silent videos can help you convey stories that captivate audiences.

There is a much unrealized narrative potential in silent videos. Most videos rely only on visual elements to convey narratives. Thus, mute clips have a unique ability to captivate audiences. It also offers many possibilities for storytelling, allowing for a more immersive experience.

### Setting a Narrative

Videos without sound force viewers to rely more on their visual perception of the tale. It can draw your viewers closer to the visuals. Moreover, it also heightens their involvement with the story as it develops.

### Improving Stories

Silence directs the viewer's attention to certain visual aspects. When you remove all sound distractions, the audience can focus on the pictures. It helps you highlight essential story aspects.

For instance, rely on more than just dialogue to convey emotion. Instead, you can take a modest close-up of the character's face.

### Build Emotions With No Audio

One effective method of building intense emotions is the complete absence of sound. Remember, silent clips can keep viewers on the top of their seats. The audience may get more invested in the story's raw essence when a scene unfolds in silence. In short, this technique aims to evoke a range of emotions in the audience.

### Add Metaphor

The lack of audio permits the use of symbolic language only via visual representations. You can use each picture to convey information. It eliminates the need for dialogue or background music.

The audience can interact with the story on a deeper level via interpretation. Here, video scenes, objects, or actions work as symbols.

### Simplify Complex Stories

Silent videos let storytellers elicit strong emotional reactions from audiences. They can co-create the story by deciphering visual cues. Besides, they can also add thoughts, emotions, and interpretations in silent videos. Without words, silent videos can help you convey stories that captivate audiences.

## Detailed Guide to Resize Your Video in VLC

Videos are one of the most popular types of content on the internet. There are millions of videos uploaded to YouTube, Facebook, and other video-sharing sites each day. Sharing your videos with others is possible when you know how to resize them in VLC. VLC is a free media player that allows you to convert or compress your videos in order to make them smaller for uploading or downloading.

Videos are a great way to showcase your business, company, or product on social media sites like Facebook and Twitter. But what happens when you use the wrong size for your video? The whole thing looks distorted and low quality. It's not very appealing.

Luckily, resizing videos in VLC is simple. All you need is the right software and the right steps.

This blog post will walk you through how to resize videos using VLC. We'll cover what the default settings are for video resolutions, how to change them, and why it's important to know what size of video you're uploading before uploading it.

So without further ado, let's get started!

## Step by step to resize your video in VLC

Anyone who has a lot of videos on their computer knows how frustrating it can be to find the video you want among the hundreds of ones you have. Well, VLC makes it possible to resize your videos so they'll fit onto your desktop. Here's how:

### Resizing by converting to a smaller file size

Because some video formats, such as MKV and AVI, take up too much space, it's a good idea to convert videos to smaller formats, such as FLV, WMV, and so on. To lower the video size, you'll be pleased to learn that VLC allows you to convert video/audio files without the need to install any other software. The video conversion guide for VLC can be found below.

Step 1: Launch the VLC Media Player.

![resize-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-vlc-1.png)

Step 2: Go to the menu and pick Media > Convert/Save from the drop-down menu, then Add > Convert/Save from the drop-down menu.

![resize-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-vlc-2.png)

Step 3: Choose a profile for the video you wish to convert.

![resize-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-vlc-3.png)

Step 4: Select the Start button to start VLC video compression.

### Resizing by cutting unnecessary video segment

Step 1: Launch the VLC Media Player

![resize-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-vlc-4.png)

Step 2: Go to Menu > View Menu > Advanced Controls in VLC Media Player and select it from the menu.

![resize-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-vlc-5.png)

Step 3: Play the video you want to crop and then click the Record button on the scene you want to crop and then the same button to pause the video where you want to crop it.

![resize-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-vlc-6.png)

Step 4: In Windows 7, 8, and XP, the film will automatically save in Library > Videos, and in My Documents > My Videos in Windows 7.

VLC Media Player is unquestionably one of the greatest video players available for free. Nonetheless, it isn't the finest video reduction because it just reduces the size of videos by using certain simple parameters rather than complex ones. As a result, we offer Fimora, an all-in-one video toolbox that can convert, compress, download, record, edit, burn, and more, as a better video compressor. You can change the video resolution, bit rate, encoder, format, and other settings to compress video and audio files in a variety of formats.

Step 2: Once you've imported your video, select the video clips that you want to resize by clicking on them; then, resizing them is as simple as dragging their borders!

![resize-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-vlc-8.png)

Step 3: You can also use the size fields at the bottom of the frame to change their dimensions.

Step 4: Keep in mind that changing one dimension of a video clip will affect both its width and height proportionally. For example, if you enlarge a 16:9 widescreen clip to 720p (from 480p), it will be double its original proportions (720x480).

**Resizing by shrinking video file size.**

![resize-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-vlc-10.png)

Step 3: Select the Format tab and keep the video in its original format as a result. Then, in the "Settings" panel, click the triangle button below to downsize the video by choosing a lower video resolution, frame rate, or bit rate. When it comes to video formats, you can choose among FLV, MP4, and other similar formats, which normally result in smaller files.

Step 4: The shrunk file should be exported.

As a result, we offer Fimora, an all-in-one video toolbox that can convert, compress, download, record, edit, burn, and more, as a better video compressor. You can change the video resolution, bit rate, encoder, format, and other settings to compress video and audio files in a variety of formats.
