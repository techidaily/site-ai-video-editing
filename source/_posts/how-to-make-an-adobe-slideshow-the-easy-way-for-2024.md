## Part 1: How Do Slow\-Motion Cameras Help in Recording Perfect Slow-Mo Videos?

**Slow-motion cameras** record videos at much faster speeds than regular cameras. This feature helps create slow-motion videos by slowing down the recorded action when played at normal speed. These **slow-motion** **cameras** are popular in filmmaking, sports analysis, science, and content creation. That’s because they capture detailed moments and highlight fast-moving things.

* **Higher Frame Rate:** Regular videos usually record 24, 30, or 60 frames per second (fps). But **slow-motion cameras** can capture hundreds or thousands of frames per second. More frames mean more details and smoother slow-motion videos when played back.
* **Smooth Playback:** Slow-motion videos look smooth and purposeful when played at regular speeds. More frames are recorded initially to achieve this effect. Ultimately, it will preserve all details when the video is played in slow motion.
* **High-Resolution Sensors:** Lots of **slow-motion cameras** have high-quality sensors. These sensors ensure that even with more frames captured, the picture stays sharp and detailed in slow-motion videos. This helps capture fine details without losing clarity.
* **Creative Control:** **Slow-motion cameras** let filmmakers and videographers control how fast or slow some parts of a scene look. This helps tell stories better, focus on details, and make videos more interesting and attractive to watch.
* **Reduced Motion Blur:** More frames per second make pictures clearer and sharper. This feature works especially for fast-moving things. This is important when you need to see tiny details or when the lighting isn't great.
* **Temporal Resolution: Slow-motion cameras** can record lots of details in quick movements. They're handy in sports, science, and creative videos where catching fast and detailed actions matter a lot.

## Part 2: Finding The Top Slow-Motion Cameras to Use in 2024

## Part 1: How Do Slow\-Motion Cameras Help in Recording Perfect Slow-Mo Videos?

**Slow-motion cameras** record videos at much faster speeds than regular cameras. This feature helps create slow-motion videos by slowing down the recorded action when played at normal speed. These **slow-motion** **cameras** are popular in filmmaking, sports analysis, science, and content creation. That’s because they capture detailed moments and highlight fast-moving things.

* **Higher Frame Rate:** Regular videos usually record 24, 30, or 60 frames per second (fps). But **slow-motion cameras** can capture hundreds or thousands of frames per second. More frames mean more details and smoother slow-motion videos when played back.
* **Smooth Playback:** Slow-motion videos look smooth and purposeful when played at regular speeds. More frames are recorded initially to achieve this effect. Ultimately, it will preserve all details when the video is played in slow motion.
* **High-Resolution Sensors:** Lots of **slow-motion cameras** have high-quality sensors. These sensors ensure that even with more frames captured, the picture stays sharp and detailed in slow-motion videos. This helps capture fine details without losing clarity.
* **Creative Control:** **Slow-motion cameras** let filmmakers and videographers control how fast or slow some parts of a scene look. This helps tell stories better, focus on details, and make videos more interesting and attractive to watch.
* **Reduced Motion Blur:** More frames per second make pictures clearer and sharper. This feature works especially for fast-moving things. This is important when you need to see tiny details or when the lighting isn't great.
* **Temporal Resolution: Slow-motion cameras** can record lots of details in quick movements. They're handy in sports, science, and creative videos where catching fast and detailed actions matter a lot.

## What Is a Miniature Effect?

![after adding a miniature effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-1.jpg)

But first, let's learn the logic of making the miniature effect. As many video editing pros present on Tiktok, the miniature effect is a fun way to brighten up your photography or video shots. For example, when taking a video or a time-lapse of a landscape, we always have a bigger depth of field, so most objects in the frame are in focus.

However, when we film a miniature model, the depth of field is shallow. So, we only see some objects in focus, and the rest is blurry. This visual trick makes our brain believe that the big landscape we're seeing is actually a tiny model.

![a miniature effect for landscape](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-2.jpg)

To create a miniature look, we can use specific effects to fake a shallow depth of field, and then the landscape view will look like a tiny model. While some keys to notice before making the miniature effect are:

* It utilizes **selective blur** to make things appear like **small**
* The miniature effect works best for footage filmed from **a high angle**.
* The tiny effect is usually used in **drone footage, time lapses**, or **landscape photography**.

Are you all set to add miniature effects to your video and make film-like shots? Then scroll more and get the step-by-step process.

##### Step7 Add masks on the Video

For example, when we add a mask in the below time-lapse video, follow the above mask adjustments. Unfortunately, we can't get good results. Therefore, we will apply another way to add a mask by changing shape and position. Follow the instructions for modifications:

![blur the object near to camera and focus on the distant object](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-11.gif)

* Make a building or any object **Blurry** near the camera because it is not present within the depth of field.
* While the **object is far** from the camera, it is focused because it is in the depth of the field.
* Then adjust the mask, as per your choice.

Want to change the shape of the mask? Then follow the below steps:

**Note:** make sure you are masking the same extent and excluding the object you want to be out of focus.

Now, it's time to mask the whole object, which is far, but we want to make it in focus! For this, follow these steps:

* Add the same stock video clip a **third time** on the third video track of the timeline.
* Then add a mask in a **Rectangle** shape on the building.
* Don't **blur** the edge of this mask.
