## How To Create Subtitles In VLC Media Player?

## How To Create Subtitles In VLC Media Player?

It is possible to create subtitles in the VLC media player if you're unable to find an appropriate SRT file online or want to add some extra details by editing the existing one. For this method to work, you will first need to format your file in the SRT format.

Furthermore, you have to rank the text in order with a number and add timestamps in minutes, seconds, and milliseconds to determine the duration. To avoid plain text, you can also add effects to the subtitles by using HTML.

Step1 Launch a [**text editor**](https://sonix.ai/)on your PC, import your video to the editor, and save it in .srt format.

![sonix text editor for creating subtitles in vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/sonix-text-editor-for-creating-subtitles-in-vlc.png)

Step3 Next, add a **new line**, **timestamp**, and **subtitle** for each caption.

Step4 Repeat the process to create and add all the required subtitles.
