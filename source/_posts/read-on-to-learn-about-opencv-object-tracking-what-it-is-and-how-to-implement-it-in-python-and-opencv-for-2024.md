## Part 1\. What Is Object Tracking?

Object Tracking determines the location of an object in a video and can be used for a variety of purposes, including surveillance, security, traffic control, digital forensics, anomaly detection, gesture recognition, visual surveillance, human-computer interaction, augmented reality, and robot vision.

Even though it may seem easy for an average person, object tracking is quite complex for computers because they have to analyze a set of frames and estimate the object’s trajectory based on numbers instead of images.

Because of how complicated it is, Object Tracking is considered one of the most difficult tasks in computer vision. Even though it's a challenge, it's not impossible to accomplish.

And there are two levels of Object Tracking that you should learn about:

### 1\. SOT & MOT

1. **Single Object Tracking (SOT):** SOT is a tracking algorithm that creates advanced appearance models and/or motion models to manage difficult issues like out-of-plane rotations, illumination variations, or scale changes.
2. **Multiple Object Tracking (MOT):** MOT tracks every part of a video and is mainly concerned with mid-level tasks and serves as a foundation for high-level tasks.

### 2\. The Difference Between Tracking And Detection

After knowing what Object Tracking is, there is another concept you should also be aware of - Object Detection.

The Object Tracking and Object Detection are two important methods in computer vision. Object Tracking tracks the position of a given object in an image in real-time, while Object Detection identifies and localizes objects in an image or video. That is the difference.

## Part 2\. Types Of Object Tracking

### Image Tracking

Image tracking allows users to interact with digital content more naturally and helps users move and interact with digital objects in the same manner as they will with real-world physical objects.

Image tracking can be used in various augmented reality (AR) applications, such as AR gaming, shopping, and navigation. Moreover, you can also use it for educational purposes, such as teaching anatomy or providing instructions for a difficult task.

### Video Tracking

Video tracking is the process of tracking objects in a video sequence and can be used for various applications, such as detecting and counting objects in a scene, understanding their motions, and recognizing activities.

## Part 3\. What Are The Difficulties Of Object Tracking?

As what has been mentioned above, the use of object tracking is versatile. However, there are some challenges associated with Object Tracking, such as:

**Background Clutter:** The background can impact extracting an object's features. If the background is more densely populated, detecting or tracking the object of interest can be more difficult.

**Occlusion:** This is a phenomenon where the object being tracked is affected by the background or foreground. This causes the tracking algorithm to get confused due to multiple objects coming close together, hence, losing track of the object.

**Varying spatial scales:** Varying spatial scales refer to the target object being of a different size or shape, which can confuse the algorithm, leading to errors.

**Training and Tracking Speed:** If the object is moving too fast or is too small, it can be difficult to track. Therefore, the tracking module has to be designed to track, identify, and localize objects in a matter of seconds.

## Part 4\. Stages Of The Object Tracking Process

After the introduction of object tracking technically, let’s learn about its mechanism of it from two sides: periods of the working process and the way it tracks.

### 1\. Stages Of The Object Tracking Process

Following are the stages of the Object Tracking process:

**Target Initialization**

Target initialization is the first step in Object Tracking and involves defining the targets or objects of interest and drawing a bounding box around them in the initial frame. After that, the tracker has to detect the position of the object in the frame while drawing the bounding box.

**Appearance Modeling**

Appearance modeling is important for understanding how an object will look under different circumstances. If the object being tracked changes appearance due to different lighting, angle, or speed, the tracking algorithm may lose its information and the object itself. Therefore, it has to be conducted to let the algorithm detect the changes and distortion.

**Motion Estimation**

Motion estimation entails the capacity of the model to anticipate an object's future position with precision.

**Target Positioning**

Motion estimation is a process of approximating the most likely region where an object could be present. After the object's location is approximated, a visual model can be used to determine the target's location more accurately.

### 2\. Methods Of Object Tracking

Here’re some methods of Object Tracking:

**OpenCV-Based Object Tracking**

**OpenCV Object Tracking** method is widely used because it offers several built-in functions designed specifically for this purpose, such as GOTURN, MIL, MediandFlow, and CSRT. The tracker type you select will depend on your specific application design. Each tracker has its pros and cons, so there is not a single type of tracker ideal for all applications.

**MDNet**

Multi-Domain Convolutional Neural Network Tracker is a convolutional neural-based visual tracker and has won the VOT2015 challenge. Moreover, it is composed of domain-specific layers, branches, and multiple shared layers.

The MDNetT tracker is a deep neural network that is trained on numerous Object Tracking datasets. The tracker is designed to work in multiple domains, including video, text, and images.

**DeepSort**

DeepSort algorithm can track objects in real-time and uses YOLO v3 to compute the bounding boxes around the objects in a frame.

DeepSort uses Kalman filter from Simple Online and Realtime Tracking algorithm and an identification model, ReID to interlink bounding boxes and object tracks.

**ROLO**

ROLO is a novel Object Tracking method that uses recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to learn object-specific Spatio-temporal representations. This method works with YOLO, an object detection algorithm, and an LTSM for determining the trajectory of an object.

## Part 5\. The powerful backup: OpenCV

## How to Use OBS Chroma Key With/Without Green Screen

Whether you're someone new to the world of streaming or just seeking to enhance the aesthetic of your existing stream, a green screen is a terrific way to add some quality to your broadcasts. A green screen is a terrific tool for broadcasters and video makers who wish to cover their backdrop or change it with something else completely. Once you have one, it might be tough to understand how to set up a green screen, but once you get the directions down, you’ll be able to seem like you are wherever you desire! The procedure of setting up your chroma key settings in OBS is pretty straightforward and can be done within a few minutes.

These days most live streaming software packages support chroma keying as a feature. The first thing to do with any live broadcast is to arrange your shot. Will the camera stay stationary, or will you be moving it? Once you’ve determined the shot, you can calculate approximately how much green screen you need. It’s recommended to provide for a little additional green screen around the subject to prevent having them clipped outside of the chroma keyed region. When inserting a chroma key OBS will automatically produce certain baseline settings. In most circumstances, you’ll need to fine-adjust these parameters. In this post, we’ll teach you how to accomplish this fantastic look using OBS. You should remember, however, that you will want to set up your equipment and switch on your illumination before modifying the settings in OBS Studio. This way, you won’t have to alter them again after you go live.

## 1\. How to Add Green Screen with OBS

Learning to use chroma key in OBS allows you to remove and change backgrounds, giving your stream a Learning to utilize chroma key in OBS enables you to remove and modify backdrops, giving your broadcast a much better production quality and feel. If you are employing various backgrounds or a sequence of green things behind you. You may utilize the chroma key source more than once to remove various hues, enabling you to obtain better background removal. Not only can OBS Studio erase the backdrop of your live video streams, but you can also remove the backgrounds on pre-recorded movies and still photographs. Chroma keying has become quite popular lately. People utilize it not simply for gaming, but also in Zoom conferences, live interviews, talk shows, etc. Although it may appear hard, at first sight, setting up Chroma Key in OBS Studio is quite straightforward. Let’s look at the easy steps you need to follow to set up a green screen in OBS.

### Steps to Add Green Screen with OBS

****Step 1:** Install and open OBS. From your main screen, hit the “Plus” symbol situated beneath the sources box. Foremost things first, you need a green screen. If you already have one, skip this step and proceed.

A green screen is merely a backdrop of one single brilliant hue that may be taken off in post-processing. It offers a ‘canvas’ on which a topic may perform and will subsequently display with a translucent backdrop. Add it simply via your webcam.

## Conclusion

The usage of chroma keying has been increasingly popular in recent years, with various uses of this video effect employed for live streaming. Chroma keying is used to erase the backdrop of a video clip which is then composited over another scene or picture. The most apparent usage of this technology is for weather broadcasts when the presenter is composited over the top of a weather radar picture. In more recent times we’re seeing video game broadcasters chroma keying themselves into their live feeds. There are various sites to explore for streaming backdrops. Most come as overlay packages with distinct themes. A good location to look is Filmora. Else, if you want to add a new backdrop to your broadcast, you may simply add a new picture source to your scene in OBS. So, check out what best fits you and opt for the one.
