![default title filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/default-title.png)

Step 4

From the Advanced settings panel, delete the existing text and add a **Rectangle shape.**

![advanced title settings filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/advanced.png)

Step 5

Disable the **Text Fill** and the **Shape Border** options from the panel on the left side.

![disable options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/disable.png)

Step 6

Click the drop-down arrow on the **Shape Fill** option and change the **Type** to **Gradient Fill.** Then, adjust the two color pallets from lighter to darker to create a gradient effect. Finally, adjust the rectangle to fit the entire screen. Click **OK.**

![shape fill settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shape-fill.png)

Step 7

Go to the **Transitions** tab **→** search for “**Push**” **→** drag the Push transition to the Default Title in the Timeline. Then, move the Playhead to the 1-second marker and drag another Default Title to that point from the **Titles** tab.

![push transition](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/push.png)

Step 8

Double-click on the new Default Title **→** go to **Advanced.** Delete the default text and add a **Circle** shape this time instead of a Rectangle. Disable the **Text Fill and Shape Fill** options this time.

Step 9

Scroll down to **Shape Border** and increase the **Thickness** bar all the way up. Then, change the circle’s color to match your background as closely as possible. Click **OK.**

![shape border filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/borders.png)

Step 10

Copy the Title you just edited and paste it into the above layer. Then, double-click on the copied Title and go to its **Advanced** settings panel.

![copy title](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/copy.png)

Step 11

In the Advanced panel, copy the circle and paste it somewhere else on the screen. Change its size if you want, and change the shade of its color to match the background once more. You can add as many new copies of the Default Titles and copy as many circles as you want. Click **OK.**

![add more circles](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/copy-circle.png)

Step 12

After you’re done copying and pasting more Default Titles with more Circles inside, you can start animating them. Start with the first one. Double-click on the first Default Title with the Circle inside. Make sure you place the Playhead at the beginning of that clip. Then, go to the **Animation** tab.

![animation tab filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/animation.png)

Step 13

You need to add 3 keyframes. Add the first one right now. Just click on the “**+Add**” button. Then, move the Playhead somewhere in the middle and click “**+Add**” again. Last, move the Playhead at the end of the clip, and click “**+Add**” again to add the third keyframe.

![add keyframe filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/keyframe.png)

Step 14

Now, go back to the first keyframe to edit its settings. Click the arrows to move between keyframes. Once you’re at the first one, start decreasing the **Scale** and the **Position values** as you move the Playhead toward the second keyframe. There are no rules here. Move each value based on how it looks best to you.

For the **second keyframe**, just increase the **Scale** and adjust the **Position** value based on how it looks on the screen.

![circle position](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/position.png)

Step 15

Now, apply the same method as in **Step 14** to all the other circles in your video. Then, adjust the keyframe positions for all layers to create more unique movement throughout the video.

![keyframe positions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/adjust.png)

Step 16

Move the Playhead to 1 second and 30 frames. Then, add a new Default Title in the Timeline and go to its Advanced settings panel. From there, **Enable** the **Outline** option and **Disable** the **Fill** option. In the Outline option, change the color to White, set Opacity to 50%, and decrease Thickness to 1.

![outline settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/outline.png)

Step 17

Next, choose your favorite font and type in your text inside the textbox. Then, change the value you see highlighted in this image to “-20”. Finally, increase the text size to almost fit the entire screen. Don’t worry about the fact that you can’t see all of it on the screen.

![edit text filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/text.png)

Step 18

Go to the **Animation** tab and apply the **“Type Writer”** animation. Then, drag the yellow lines below just like you see in the image here. The arrows show you the length to which you need to drag these lines. Click **OK.**

![type writer animation filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/type-writer.png)

Step 19

Set the Playhead to 1 second and 40 frames. Now, double-click on the last Default Title we just created and go to its **Animation settings. NOTE:** Don’t open its Advanced settings this time. Next, add a keyframe. Then, move the Playhead near the end of this clip in the Timeline. Now, drag the X position to the left until you see the last letter of your text appear on the screen. Click **OK.**

![text animation settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/x-position.png)

Step 20

![add keyframe filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/keyframe.png)

Step 14

Now, go back to the first keyframe to edit its settings. Click the arrows to move between keyframes. Once you’re at the first one, start decreasing the **Scale** and the **Position values** as you move the Playhead toward the second keyframe. There are no rules here. Move each value based on how it looks best to you.

For the **second keyframe**, just increase the **Scale** and adjust the **Position** value based on how it looks on the screen.

![circle position](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/position.png)

Step 15

Now, apply the same method as in **Step 14** to all the other circles in your video. Then, adjust the keyframe positions for all layers to create more unique movement throughout the video.

![keyframe positions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/adjust.png)

Step 16

Move the Playhead to 1 second and 30 frames. Then, add a new Default Title in the Timeline and go to its Advanced settings panel. From there, **Enable** the **Outline** option and **Disable** the **Fill** option. In the Outline option, change the color to White, set Opacity to 50%, and decrease Thickness to 1.

![outline settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/outline.png)

Step 17

Next, choose your favorite font and type in your text inside the textbox. Then, change the value you see highlighted in this image to “-20”. Finally, increase the text size to almost fit the entire screen. Don’t worry about the fact that you can’t see all of it on the screen.

![edit text filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/text.png)

Step 18

Go to the **Animation** tab and apply the **“Type Writer”** animation. Then, drag the yellow lines below just like you see in the image here. The arrows show you the length to which you need to drag these lines. Click **OK.**

![type writer animation filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/type-writer.png)

Step 19

Set the Playhead to 1 second and 40 frames. Now, double-click on the last Default Title we just created and go to its **Animation settings. NOTE:** Don’t open its Advanced settings this time. Next, add a keyframe. Then, move the Playhead near the end of this clip in the Timeline. Now, drag the X position to the left until you see the last letter of your text appear on the screen. Click **OK.**

![text animation settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/x-position.png)

Step 20

Now, add another Default Title to the Timeline. Open its Advanced settings and type in your main text. Then, go to its **Animation** tab and apply the “Random 2” animation. Change its starting and end times according to your preference. Click **OK.**

![apply animation to text filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/random.png)

## 2 Effective Ways to Add Text Behind Objects

Adding text behind objects in your videos can be a great way to start your videos. For example, you can do so to create an attractive intro or startup a video. So, if you hope to make a video like a pro, let's learn how to add text behind objects in your videos by Filmora.

![add text behind objects by filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-1.png)

## Part 1\. What Are The Benefits of Adding Text Behind Objects in Videos?

Your videos must maintain quality to create content worthy of a huge audience. You may have a YouTube channel or be starting down the road. Then you must give this a try because

### Give a cool look

Adding text behind an object in a video looks cool! Now, your object could be a silhouette of a person or a huge skyscraper. You can add a text tile behind the object, creating the illusion. Due to this, the text will be flying in real-time.

### Show creativity

Blasting your channel with innovative and creative content is the key to building a big audience. But, of course, you can always opt for many ways to create a video showing your creativity. One of those ways is to add text behind your object.

You can create an attractive intro by adding text behind objects that captivate the viewer. It ensures that your subscribers stay tuned to your channel and your content.

### Build up a solid audience

Every day can be a real struggle if you are a daily content creator on YouTube. The audience demands good content. But your daily videos can get boring if you do not use new methods to edit your videos.

You can add text behind videos to spice up your intros and hook your daily audience even more. That will show the audience that you are genuinely putting in the effort.

## Part 2\. What Will You Need To Add Text Behind Videos?

Now there are a few things that you will need to add text behind videos. First, take a look at the basic priorities to perform this feature.

### 1\. A Static Object Video

Adding text behind an object can be tricky if the object isn't static. For example, the effect will be ruined if an object moves around a lot in a video.

Our goal is to create a smooth text behind the video effect. And this can only be achieved if the target object remains static in the video and does not move about its position.

* You have to start by importing your video in the import library.
* From the import library, you can click on the video and drag it down below to the timeline.

![adding video to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-3.png)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Adding video to the timelines will allow you to create a workspace to edit your video.

Now let's move on to how we will add the text tile to our video.

##### Step3 Add the Text Tile

It is time to add the text tile you will animate behind the object. To do that, follow the steps mentioned as such.:

* Go to the **Titles** icon on the bar above the import library.
* A drop-down option will be available on the left side.
* Scroll down to the **Plain text**.
* Here, you can see many text tiles to add to your video.
* You can choose anyone you like.
* The most commonly used tile is the **Basic 6**.
* When you add the text tile to the timeline, you must ensure that the text is of equal length to the video.
* To do that, drag the right corner of the text tile and drag it to the right to match the length of the video.

![choose the text tile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-4.png)

##### Step4 Edit the Text Tile

After you have added the text tile you desire, you need to type in the text. For this article, we will keep it simple. We will be typing a simple statement such as "**Hello, World.**"

* Double-click the Text tile to open the settings menu.
* After the settings menu is opened, type in the text box on the import window.

You will notice changes on the main window that your text has changed.

![edit the text tile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-5.png)

* After the text appears, you can make the font look as desired.
* Look above the text window, and you will see the type of text font selected.
* Click on the drop-down option and choose whatever you like.

Let's move on to animate the text tile.

##### Step5 Animate the text tile

After adding text, it is time to animate it. This animation will decide how your text will appear behind the target object.

* First, you must open the text settings by **double-clicking** on the text tile in the timeline.
* In the settings opened in the import window, you will have to click on the animation tab in the upper left corner, aside from the **Preset**
* Now scroll down to where you will see the **Right Roll**
* Click on **Right Roll** and then click on the **OK** in the bottom right corner of the import window.

![animate the text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-6.png)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You may notice now that the text appears in front of our object. Don't worry now! We are getting there. With a few simple steps, we will see the results.

Now let us move on to the more significant part of the editing, masking the object. Again, look ahead to see how you can mask the object!

##### Step6 Mask the Object

To mask our object, we will need to be technical. We will begin by adding the same footage of the static object on our timeline. Follow the steps mentioned below:

* Drag and drop the static object footage above the timeline text. Make sure the text stays in the middle of the sandwich.

![add the main video above the text tile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-7.png)

* We will hide the video in the first track to simplify things. In addition, this will make our editing easier.
* We will have to look in the effects library to insert the masking effect.
* You can see the **Effects** icon on the bar at the top.
* Click on the **Effects**.
* You will see the search bar at the top of the import window.
* In the search bar, type in Image mask.
* Drag the **Image mask** effect on the video above the text tile.

Now the masking effect has been added. But we would have to adjust so that it stays upon our object.

* **Double-click** on the video and the settings option will open up.
* Go into the **Effects**

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You must select your target object's mask shape exactly as its shape.

* We have to mask out a building, so that we will need a vertical rectangle.

![change the shape of the image mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-8.png)

* After you have selected the shape of your object, we will need to convert it to the object's size so that it only masks the building.
* To do that, scroll down below the import window to the settings.
* Here you can see the X, Y, and width settings.
* First, move the width bar so that it matches the width of the building.

![change the width of the mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-9.png)

* Now drag the X bar until the mask is confined to the building. You would have created the mask only limited to the building.

![change the position of the mask by dragging x](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-10.png)

* Once you complete this step, click OK in the bottom right corner.
* Now un-hide the original video that you imported in the beginning.

Finally, play the video in the main play window from the beginning.

![final result of the static video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-11.gif)

You have successfully created a text behind the object effect. Now that you know how to add text behind static objects let us move to learn how to add text to a video that has high contrast and a clean background.

### Add text behind a high contrast and clean background

Besides the text can be added behind a static object, it can also be added to a clean background with high contrast. But how is it? Let's dive into it.

##### Step1 Import the video into the timeline

* Import the video from the location in your PC media.
* When imported, drag and drop it onto the timeline.

![add the footage to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-12.png)

##### Step2 Add the text tile

To add the text to your video, follow the steps mentioned below.

* Click on the titles icon on the bar above the import window.
* On the left drop-down option, scroll down to the titles.
* Select the Plain text option.
* You will notice that multiple options will pop up in the import window.
* Select the text title that suits you best.
* After you have selected the text style, drag and drop it down above your video in the timeline.

![add the text tile above the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-13.png)

* Our next step would be to add the text.
* **Double-click** on the text tile. Doing so will open the settings menu in the import window.
* Type in the text that you want. For reference, we will keep it simple such as, **"Hello world."**
* You can also adjust the font of your text.
* Above the type box, a drop-down option will show you the range of fonts available.
* Select the font you desire.

![type in the text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-14.png)

Now that you have added the text, it is time to animate it.

##### Step3 Take a snapshot

After typing in the text, you will notice in the main play window that your text still appears in front of your object. Therefore, we want to take it behind the object. To do so, first, you will need to take a snapshot.

Follow the steps mentioned to take a snapshot:

* Hide the main video. You can see the Eye icon aside from your main video in the edit column on the left side of the timeline.
* Click on the Eye icon to hide the main video.
* In the **main play** window, you will notice that the screen turns black, which leaves only the text on the screen.

![taking a snapshot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-15.png)

* In the main play screen, you can notice a small **camera icon**.
* This camera icon is used to take snapshots of your screen.
* Click on the camera icon to take a snapshot of your screen.
* Your snapshot will now be saved in the main import window.

![snapshot is saved in the import library](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-16.png)

Now that we have taken a snapshot, we will need to import it into the timeline. Scroll below for more.

##### Step4 Add the snapshot

After taking it, your goal is to import it into the timeline. To perform this action, perform the following steps:

* Before adding the snapshot to the timeline, we must delete the main text tile.
* Then drag and drop the snapshot from the import library into the timeline above the video.
* Make sure that the snapshot is aligned well with the length of the video.
* If it is **longer** than the video, drag it from the right to match the length of the video.
* If its length is **smaller** than the video, drag it to the right to increase its length.

![adjust the length of the snapshot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-17.png)

After adding the snapshot, we will have to change its blending mode.

##### Step5 Change the blending of the snapshot

To create the effect of your text behind the video, you must alter the main text's blending mode. In this case, it will be the snapshot we took.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Changing the blending mode of the snapshot will allow it to blend with the transparent background and will create the effect of the text behind the object in the video.

Follow the steps mentioned below to change the blending of the snapshot:

* **Double-click** the snapshot.
* If you select the compositing tab, the blending options will pop up.
* From default, it would be set to **Normal**. Click on the **Normal**
* It will show a drop-down option.
* Scroll down below until you can see an option labeled Then click on **Overlay.**

![change the blending mode to overlay](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-18.png)

* And press **OK** in the bottom right corner to confirm your changes.

The text can be blended with the background.

* Click on the **Eye icon** to un-hide the video from the timeline.
* Now play the video from the start from the main play screen to see the final changes.

![final preview](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-19.gif)

## How to Create A Freeze Frame Sequence in Video

_Are you considering getting your video editing skills to a new high level? Are you worried about spicing your videos with stylish shots and bringing attention to particular aspects of your video?_

Freeze frame sequence is one the most stunning effects that can help you greatly. The freeze frame sequence has been used in many classic and present-day movies. And it will never go out of fashion.

Here, we will guide you on creating freeze frame sequences in your videos using Filmora. It is critical here to know what exactly the freeze frame sequence is. So let's jump right into it!

## Part 1\. What Is A Freeze Frame?

A freeze frame is a specific single frame of the video clip shown repeatedly in the video. It gives the illusion of a static picture. It is used to draw the viewers' attention to the minute details of a specific moment, to set up a powerful narrative, or to introduce your main characters.

![freeze frame effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-1.jpg)

Content creators can also use the freeze-frame effect on fast-moving objects to draw the viewers' attention. Have a few examples of the most popular freeze frames used in the movies.

### Examples of freeze frames in popular movies

Alfred Hitchcock used the first-ever freeze-frame in his film Champagne (1928). There is a long list of many famous tv shows and movies in which the freeze frame effect has been used since then. But to count a few, three examples are given here.

**1\. Pulp Fiction (1994)**

In the beginning scene of Pulp Fiction, where robbery is about to occur, a freeze-frame effect is used to engage the audience. Later in the movie, it was relieved what would happen next. It was a dramatic pause to draw attention. It is a strong example of the freeze-frame effect.

![pulp fiction's freeze frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-2.png)

**2\. The Breakfast Club (1985)**

The ending of Breakfast Club is an iconic example of the freeze-frame effect. With a powerful narration, the freeze frame conveys the movie's central idea to the audience.

![the breakfast club's freeze frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-3.png)

**3\. Suicide Squad (2016)**

In the trailer of Suicide Squad, freeze frames were used by the director to introduce the characters. This trailer used stylish animations to give relevant information about the film's main characters.

![suicide squad's freeze frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-4.png)

Having discussed the famous examples, let's learn about the power of freeze frames.

### The power of freeze frame

The old freeze frames give a retro vibe. However, with the advancement in editing technology, this special effect has proved that there is no end. Furthermore, it has shown that you can do many things with pauses.

Especially when you are a content creator, this effect empowers you by advertising your skills impressively. It also conveys your message convincingly.

Being a content creator, you always want to reach the maximum audience. This special effect will serve this too. It will ultimately get you more viewership, more likes, and more subscriptions. But how to create a freeze frame?

## Learn How to Easily Concatenate Videos Using FFmpeg in This Step-by-Step Guide. From Installation to Execution, We Cover It All to Streamline Your Video Editing Process

Video editing is a crucial aspect of creating content for many people. Whether you're a YouTuber, a marketer, or just someone who wants to share videos with friends and family, being able to edit and manipulate your videos is key. One of the most basic video editing tasks is concatenating videos, which combines multiple files to create one cohesive video.

FFmpeg is a powerful tool that allows you to do just that, and in this guide, we'll walk you through the process of FFmpeg concatenate videos. Whether a beginner or an experienced video editor, this guide will provide you with all the information you need to seamlessly merge your videos. From installation to execution, we'll cover it all so you can streamline your video editing process.

![concat videos with ffmpeg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ffmpeg-concat-videos.JPG)

## Overview and Installation of FFmpeg

FFmpeg is free, open-source project that allows you to record, convert, and stream digital audio and video. It is a command-line tool widely used in video editing and transcoding. FFmpeg can be used to concatenate videos and other tasks, such as adding subtitles, changing video resolution, and more. It is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux, making it a versatile and accessible tool for anyone to use.

Here's how to install FFmpeg:

Step1 **Log in** to your Ubuntu server via SSH and **update** the package index.

_$ sudo apt update_

Step2 **Install** FFmpeg and all the required dependencies

_$ sudo apt install ffmpeg_

Step3 **Verify** the version of FFmpeg that you've installed.

_$ ffmpeg -version_

## Prerequisite

Before we merge videos using FFmpeg, we must understand the various methods available to us. FFmpeg offers three ways to concatenate videos: a demuxer, a filter, or a protocol. However, each method has its own set of considerations, and the best method for you will depend on the properties of the videos you're working with.

It's crucial to ensure that all encoding-related properties align with your chosen method. This includes the timebase, height and width, codecs, and pixel format. Some methods require the videos you're merging to have the same encoding, while others allow for different encodings. It's essential to keep this in mind to ensure that the final video is seamless without any breaks. Remember that these prerequisites will help you have a smooth process.

### Concatenate Videos With Same Codecs Using FFmpeg

If the videos you want to concatenate have the same codec, you can use the FFmpeg "concat" demuxer or protocol to join them together. This simple and efficient method doesn't require re-encoding the videos, saving time and preserving the original quality. This section will review the steps to concatenate videos using the "concat" demuxer and "concat" protocols in FFmpeg.

**Merge Videos With the "Concat" Demuxer**

The concat demuxer in FFmpeg allows you to join together multiple video files with the same codecs by reading a list of file paths from a text file and demuxing them in sequence. Each video starts where the previous one finishes without needing to re-encode the videos. Here's how to do it:

Step1 **Create** a **.txt file and list** the paths of the video files you want to merge.

_Join\_video.txt_

_file /Users/Video/input1.mp4_

_file /Users/Video/input2.mp4_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You can add more than two video files.

Step2 **Run** the FFmpeg command:

_ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i join\_video.txt -c copy output\_demuxer.mp4_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note: _\-safe 0_** is added to accept any file name.

**_\-c copy_** will copy all the streams.

As this method allows you to "stream copy" the files instead of re-encoding them, the concatenation is very fast. This can be a good option if you have videos with the same codecs and want to join them quickly without losing quality.

**Join Videos With the "Concat" Protocol**

The concat protocol in FFmpeg allows you to join together multiple video files in a specific format that supports file-level concatenation, such as MPEG-2 TS. However, it cannot be used for other video formats like MP4 and WEBM.

Here's how to use the "concat protocol:

Step1 **Run** the FFmpeg command:

_ffmpeg -i "concat:input1.ts|input2.ts" -c copy output\_protocol.ts_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** The concat protocol allows you to "stream copy" the files by adding the option **_\-c copy_**.

Step2 **Input** the file name of the video using this code:

_ffmpeg -i "concat:input1.mp4|input2.mp4" -c copy output\_protocol.mp4_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** If you try to use this method on video formats that are not supported, only the first input video will be saved in the output video. And the video ends after the first video.

Although this method is limited in terms of supported video formats, it's very easy to use if you merge videos in the supported formats. It's a single command in the terminal without needing a text file. Additionally, using the -c copy option makes it efficient as it doesn’t require re-encoding, saving time.

### Concatenate MP4 Video Files of Different Codecs & Resolutions Using FFmpeg

If the videos you want to concatenate have different codecs or resolutions, you can still use FFmpeg to join them together. However, this method requires re-encoding the videos, which can take longer and may result in a loss of quality. This section will cover the steps to concatenate videos with different codecs or resolutions using FFmpeg.

Here's how to do it:

Step1 **Provide** the names of the input files to FFmpeg.

_ffmpeg -i file1.mp4 -i file2.mp4 -i file3.mp4 \\_

Step2 **Use** the **filter\_complex** filtergraph parameter to instruct FFmpeg from where to take the audio and video.

_\-filter\_complex "\[0:v\] \[0:a\] \[1:v\] \[1:a\] \[2:v\] \[2:a\]_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note: \[0:v\]\[0:a\]** means FFmpeg needs to take the video and audio from the 0th video (file1.mp4).

Step3 Tell FFmpeg to concatenate three files (n=3).

_concat=n=3:v=1:a=1 \[vv\] \[aa\]" \\_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** The **v=1:a=1** implies one stream for the audio and one stream for the video.

Step4 **Map** these audio and video outputs to the final video container. This is done as follows:

_\-map "\[vv\]" -map "\[aa\]" mergedVideo.mp4_

It is important to note that this method requires re-encoding the videos, which can take more time and may result in a loss of quality. However, it offers the flexibility of filtering the videos before concatenating them. The filter\_complex method in FFmpeg allows you to concatenate videos of different codecs and resolutions. The final step is to map the audio and video outputs to the final video container. This can be done using the -map command.

### Concatenate Videos With Multiple Audio Streams Using FFmpeg

Concatenating videos with multiple audio streams can be more complex than concatenating videos with a single audio stream. This section will cover the steps to concatenate videos with multiple audio streams using FFmpeg. We'll be using the filter\_complex method in FFmpeg, which allows you to manipulate and concatenate multiple audio and video streams in a single command. This method is more advanced but allows you to join videos with different audio streams and create a final video with multiple audio tracks.

Step1 **Specify** the input files and opening.mkv, episode.mkv, and ending.mkv:

_$ ffmpeg -i opening.mkv -i episode.mkv -i ending.mkv -filter\_complex_

Step2 **Use** the **filter\_complex** parameter in FFmpeg to specify the input streams for the video and audio.

_\[0:0\] \[0:1\] \[0:2\] \[1:0\] \[1:1\] \[1:2\] \[2:0\] \[2:1\] \[2:2\]_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note: Single video stream** (\[0:0\], \[1:0\], \[2:0\])

**Dual audio streams** (\[0:1\]\[0:2\], \[1:1\]\[1:2\], \[2:1\]\[2:2\])

Step3 **Use** the **concat** filter to specify that you want to concatenate 3 files (n=3) with 1 video stream (v=1) and 2 audio streams (a=2). Specify the output streams as \[v\], \[a1\], \[a2\]:

_concat=n=3:v=1:a=2 \[v\] \[a1\] \[a2\]_

Step4 **Use** the **\-map** option to map the output streams to the final video container:

_\-map '\[v\]' -map '\[a1\]' -map '\[a2\]' output.mkv_

## Conclusion

FFmpeg is a powerful tool that allows you to concatenate videos in various ways. Whether you're working with videos of the same codecs and resolutions or videos with multiple audio streams, FFmpeg can handle it. However, for users new to video editing or needing experience with command-line tools, using Filmora can be a more user-friendly option. It offers a simple drag-and-drop interface and a variety of features and effects to enhance the overall look of your video.

Step2 **Run** the FFmpeg command:

_ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i join\_video.txt -c copy output\_demuxer.mp4_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note: _\-safe 0_** is added to accept any file name.

**_\-c copy_** will copy all the streams.

As this method allows you to "stream copy" the files instead of re-encoding them, the concatenation is very fast. This can be a good option if you have videos with the same codecs and want to join them quickly without losing quality.

**Join Videos With the "Concat" Protocol**

The concat protocol in FFmpeg allows you to join together multiple video files in a specific format that supports file-level concatenation, such as MPEG-2 TS. However, it cannot be used for other video formats like MP4 and WEBM.

Here's how to use the "concat protocol:

Step1 **Run** the FFmpeg command:

_ffmpeg -i "concat:input1.ts|input2.ts" -c copy output\_protocol.ts_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** The concat protocol allows you to "stream copy" the files by adding the option **_\-c copy_**.

Step2 **Input** the file name of the video using this code:

_ffmpeg -i "concat:input1.mp4|input2.mp4" -c copy output\_protocol.mp4_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** If you try to use this method on video formats that are not supported, only the first input video will be saved in the output video. And the video ends after the first video.

Although this method is limited in terms of supported video formats, it's very easy to use if you merge videos in the supported formats. It's a single command in the terminal without needing a text file. Additionally, using the -c copy option makes it efficient as it doesn’t require re-encoding, saving time.

### Concatenate MP4 Video Files of Different Codecs & Resolutions Using FFmpeg

If the videos you want to concatenate have different codecs or resolutions, you can still use FFmpeg to join them together. However, this method requires re-encoding the videos, which can take longer and may result in a loss of quality. This section will cover the steps to concatenate videos with different codecs or resolutions using FFmpeg.

Here's how to do it:

Step1 **Provide** the names of the input files to FFmpeg.

_ffmpeg -i file1.mp4 -i file2.mp4 -i file3.mp4 \\_

Step2 **Use** the **filter\_complex** filtergraph parameter to instruct FFmpeg from where to take the audio and video.

_\-filter\_complex "\[0:v\] \[0:a\] \[1:v\] \[1:a\] \[2:v\] \[2:a\]_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note: \[0:v\]\[0:a\]** means FFmpeg needs to take the video and audio from the 0th video (file1.mp4).

Step3 Tell FFmpeg to concatenate three files (n=3).

_concat=n=3:v=1:a=1 \[vv\] \[aa\]" \\_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** The **v=1:a=1** implies one stream for the audio and one stream for the video.

Step4 **Map** these audio and video outputs to the final video container. This is done as follows:

_\-map "\[vv\]" -map "\[aa\]" mergedVideo.mp4_

It is important to note that this method requires re-encoding the videos, which can take more time and may result in a loss of quality. However, it offers the flexibility of filtering the videos before concatenating them. The filter\_complex method in FFmpeg allows you to concatenate videos of different codecs and resolutions. The final step is to map the audio and video outputs to the final video container. This can be done using the -map command.

### Concatenate Videos With Multiple Audio Streams Using FFmpeg

Concatenating videos with multiple audio streams can be more complex than concatenating videos with a single audio stream. This section will cover the steps to concatenate videos with multiple audio streams using FFmpeg. We'll be using the filter\_complex method in FFmpeg, which allows you to manipulate and concatenate multiple audio and video streams in a single command. This method is more advanced but allows you to join videos with different audio streams and create a final video with multiple audio tracks.

Step1 **Specify** the input files and opening.mkv, episode.mkv, and ending.mkv:

_$ ffmpeg -i opening.mkv -i episode.mkv -i ending.mkv -filter\_complex_

Step2 **Use** the **filter\_complex** parameter in FFmpeg to specify the input streams for the video and audio.

_\[0:0\] \[0:1\] \[0:2\] \[1:0\] \[1:1\] \[1:2\] \[2:0\] \[2:1\] \[2:2\]_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note: Single video stream** (\[0:0\], \[1:0\], \[2:0\])

**Dual audio streams** (\[0:1\]\[0:2\], \[1:1\]\[1:2\], \[2:1\]\[2:2\])

Step3 **Use** the **concat** filter to specify that you want to concatenate 3 files (n=3) with 1 video stream (v=1) and 2 audio streams (a=2). Specify the output streams as \[v\], \[a1\], \[a2\]:

_concat=n=3:v=1:a=2 \[v\] \[a1\] \[a2\]_

Step4 **Use** the **\-map** option to map the output streams to the final video container:

_\-map '\[v\]' -map '\[a1\]' -map '\[a2\]' output.mkv_
