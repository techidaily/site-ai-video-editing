Adding effects is an essential part of video editing to make a regular video look extraordinary. There are literally unlimited video effects available in popular video editors. You need to apply a video effect as per the trend and requirements of your video. Freeze frame effect has become extremely popular among video creators in today's world of social media. Use freeze frame effect to freeze a specific scene in your video so that you can draw the attention of your viewers to that particular moment.

For example, in a match highlight video, you freeze the frame moment before a goal to show the positioning of the players or strikers. Owing to the popularity of freeze frame effect, you will find the video effect in almost all popular video editor apps for computers and smartphones. In fact, even popular online video editors have included the effect in their video effects. We will illustrate how to add freeze frame effect to your video on any device.

## Part 1\. How to Add Freeze Frame Video Effect on PC

#### 3\. AI Image

Similar to text-to-video, Filmora can generate images from text. To do so, just describe your imagination in simple words. Then, you are asked to pick one resolution from given options. You can use the generated images in your projects directly. It allows you to generate an image from your chosen style. A few of the styles include Freestyle, Cyberpunk, and Futuristic.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

#### Method 1: Using Chroma Key

**Step 1:** Start your project in Filmora and import two files in the timeline. Bring the background clip first in the timeline, then the original file. Cut the unnecessary portion of background-clip.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![importing media files](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/replacing-sky-background-with-photoshop-9.jpg)

**Step 2:** Keep them selected and come to the "AI Tools" option in the right-side panel. Enable the "Chroma Key" toggle, and AI will automatically replace the background. You can use the “Tolerance,” “Edge Thickness,” and “Edge Feather” sliders for manual changes.

![use chroma key to remove background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/replacing-sky-background-with-photoshop-10.jpg)

#### Method 2: Through AI Portrait

**Step 1:** Import your background clip and main video in Filmora 13\. Place the background clip on track 1 and the main clip on the 2nd track in the timeline.

![adding files to filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/replacing-sky-background-with-photoshop-11.jpg)

**Step 2:** Hold both of them and head to the right-side panel. Press the “AI Tools” option and scroll to access the "AI Portrait." Enable that option, and your background will automatically change with AI. Now, you can make manual changes by moving the “Edge Thickness” and “Feather” sliders.
