If you don't want to apply online LUTs that are available, you can create your own. To do so, you have to download the LUT Generator tool and follow these simple steps to create LUTs.

##### Step1

To create a LUT of your liking, search for the LUT Generator free download on your browser and download the tool.

##### Step2

As you launch it, continue to select the "Generate a HALD" option. This option will let you generate a PNG HALD that you can use for color grading using editing software.

##### Step3

Open the generated PNG HALD into your preferred photo editing application. Apply the desired color correction on the PNG HALD. Save the modified PNG HALD without compression as PNG or at 100% quality in JPG format.

##### Step4

Click the "Convert to CUBE" button in the LUT Generator and select the modified PNG HALD you saved in the previous step.

##### Step5

In Preferences, choose the desired size of the 3D LUT as .CUBE format. You can choose between 25x25x25 or 64x64x64\. After selecting your desired size, your customized LUT will be created in .CUBE format.

## Part 3: How to Create Online LUTs Using Online LUT Creator?

There are two methods to create a LUT online and offline. Previously you've learned to generate LUTs using offline tools. However, you can also create LUTs online without installing any tool. This portion will teach you how to create online LUTs in this step-by-step guide.

##### Step1

Import your photo into Lightroom by dragging and dropping it. You can also import the file by clicking the "File" button and selecting "Import Photos and Video." For best results, ensure that the photo you will edit is still.
