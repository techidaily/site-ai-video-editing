## Part 1 What Is AI Upscaling? And Why AI Upscaling Is Significant?

The process of generating or creating additional pixels of an image or frame in a video is AI Upscaling. This has many good results on the final video output.

This is mainly done to raise the bit rate of the video and, therefore, slightly improve the visual quality of the video. This is also used to improve the picture quality of DVDs and other low-quality videos. It is done to support lower quality videos or pictures on higher resolution screens like TV. This kind of upscaling is mostly done in TVs automatically.

## Part 2 How to Easily AI Upscale Video to 1080p or 4K?

The interesting part is that this upscaling is done by the higher resolution device itself. If you display a lower resolution video on a high-resolution TV, the TV will upscale the video quality of the lower resolution video. This process mainly happens by the displaying device itself.

## Detailed Tutorial to Merge Videos in VLC Media Player

Sometimes, when working on a project, we really need to combine several videos - this way some content needs to be conveyed, there are shots that, when neatly sorted and merged together, really create visual and content value which we aspire to make; The process becomes more enjoyable if we work on the videos produced by ourselves, or if the work is to be done for our side project. People always take special care of their own work, and the same can be emphasized freely about the editing as well - about the packaging with which we have to deliver our videos to the audience. Even in the absence of an audience, maybe we want to make a kind of video collage for ourselves, our children, or in general, for the family to make delightful memories?

Of course, not everyone who has taken a camera or a mobile phone to take videos at least one time, even so, for family and friends, has the experience of editing and making various manipulations. However, the function of merging videos in various editing programs or on online platforms is so simple that it can be learned in just a few minutes, without the help of other people, and with a kind of small, though very useful result at the same time.

One of the programs where videos can be uploaded is VLC Media Player, which is a free-to-use, robust, and feature-packed software that plays a wide range of audio, image, and video files. It can play multimedia files directly from extractable devices or the PC. The program is unique, as it can stream from popular websites like Disney +, Hulu, Gaia, and Netflix. VLC Multimedia Player also accepts live video from PlayStation Live, Xbox Live, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. While most competing programs display advertisements, VLC Player does not, as it receives support from a non-profit organization.

![merge videos in vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/merge-videos-in-vlc-1.jpg)

Interestingly, we can, as though with the help of a magic wand, turn this particular video player into video editing software. When one computer program delivers too many functions, it might make us think of the situation where one person claims to serve ten professions at the same time - there is a mood that they will not be good in any of them. It's not true with VLC Player, which, from experience, seems to be both a good "player" as well as a fairly user-friendly editing software with many interesting features and functions.

Before we move on to video streaming, let's look at two features that we can use in VLC player:

In the player, right when our video clip starts to play, we may find that the footage is taken vertically instead of horizontally! This is not a nightmare just for video enthusiasts. If you don't know how to rotate the video, then you have to rotate your head 90 degrees, and at this time you can not even get pleasure from watching, not to mention that it can even cause your neck to lock up. VLC Player took care of that - in the top panel, just click on Tools, then select Effects & Filters. In the opened window, we find Video Effects, select Geometry and check the Rotate option - so, the whole 360 degrees are at our disposal!

* [Cut/trim video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtxpVJ5sX9M)

Sometimes it happens that we watch the video, we are crazy about one part of it, and the other part of it seems to spoil everything! Even if we are ready to publish the raw material on social media or just save it for ourselves, we just don't want some parts of the video to be there. So, it can be said - we are not satisfied with the full version and we wish to cut our clip and/or reduce its timeframe. VLC Player solves this problem "without any problem" - we find the View in the top panel, then we demand the cursor to aim for Advanced Controls button. As a result, a sort of video editor will appear, with its red record button on which we will click and the video will play until we reach the point where we want to split the footage. The cut video will be automatically saved in My Computer's My Video folder.

## How to Merge Multiple Videos in VLC Media Player

Here we are, now the main topic of interest of this article - how to put together several videos so that they become one? This case, unlike other possibilities we discussed above, is more complicated, so we will study this feature [step by step](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VioOE6tCg1g&t=1s).

That's it! In this article, we have tried to teach you how to use VLC Media Player as a video editor software, what features we can use and, most importantly, how to merge multiple videos in this dual program; We also learned an alternative way of how we can combine different video clips with the help of Wondershare Filmora. The choice is yours, the main thing is to know all the alternatives and find the most time and energy saving, preferable option for you personally!

Interestingly, we can, as though with the help of a magic wand, turn this particular video player into video editing software. When one computer program delivers too many functions, it might make us think of the situation where one person claims to serve ten professions at the same time - there is a mood that they will not be good in any of them. It's not true with VLC Player, which, from experience, seems to be both a good "player" as well as a fairly user-friendly editing software with many interesting features and functions.

Before we move on to video streaming, let's look at two features that we can use in VLC player:

That's it! In this article, we have tried to teach you how to use VLC Media Player as a video editor software, what features we can use and, most importantly, how to merge multiple videos in this dual program; We also learned an alternative way of how we can combine different video clips with the help of Wondershare Filmora. The choice is yours, the main thing is to know all the alternatives and find the most time and energy saving, preferable option for you personally!

Interestingly, we can, as though with the help of a magic wand, turn this particular video player into video editing software. When one computer program delivers too many functions, it might make us think of the situation where one person claims to serve ten professions at the same time - there is a mood that they will not be good in any of them. It's not true with VLC Player, which, from experience, seems to be both a good "player" as well as a fairly user-friendly editing software with many interesting features and functions.

Before we move on to video streaming, let's look at two features that we can use in VLC player:

* [Rotate a video in VLC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MxR2MnLomw)

In the player, right when our video clip starts to play, we may find that the footage is taken vertically instead of horizontally! This is not a nightmare just for video enthusiasts. If you don't know how to rotate the video, then you have to rotate your head 90 degrees, and at this time you can not even get pleasure from watching, not to mention that it can even cause your neck to lock up. VLC Player took care of that - in the top panel, just click on Tools, then select Effects & Filters. In the opened window, we find Video Effects, select Geometry and check the Rotate option - so, the whole 360 degrees are at our disposal!

* [Cut/trim video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtxpVJ5sX9M)

Sometimes it happens that we watch the video, we are crazy about one part of it, and the other part of it seems to spoil everything! Even if we are ready to publish the raw material on social media or just save it for ourselves, we just don't want some parts of the video to be there. So, it can be said - we are not satisfied with the full version and we wish to cut our clip and/or reduce its timeframe. VLC Player solves this problem "without any problem" - we find the View in the top panel, then we demand the cursor to aim for Advanced Controls button. As a result, a sort of video editor will appear, with its red record button on which we will click and the video will play until we reach the point where we want to split the footage. The cut video will be automatically saved in My Computer's My Video folder.

## How to Merge Multiple Videos in VLC Media Player

## How to Zoom Desktop Screen

A video port that enables the connection of an external display to a modern laptop is often included in these devices; however, this might require you to learn how to un-zoom desktop. You could wish to use a laptop with a big display as a business professional to present data, images, or other media to users or coworkers during a meeting. However, if sat far away from the display, some individuals could find it difficult to read text or distinguish items on the screen. To better visibility, you may adjust the screen magnification as necessary. Users of the most recent versions of Windows and its programs may zoom in on the screen to expand any areas that are difficult for them to view, hence, learning how to zoom in on desktop is a necessary choice to make. You may zoom out to return to the regular screen after you've determined what is in the particular location.

There are methods and keyboard shortcuts that enable users to zoom in on the screen to expand anything that may be tough for certain users to read in Windows or even in various programs. Here are a few ways to zoom in Desktop or out the screen, if you unintentionally zoom on a Windows desktop screen or in an app like a web browser, depending on the circumstance. Have you ever had a zoomed-in screen? Your screen's text, graphics, and icons all suddenly enlarge dramatically. You may need to zoom out at this point. Both PC and Mac users may change the magnification and resolution of a screen. If you notice bigger text or icons, you can be confused between these two. For further advice on how to zoom desktop screen, keep reading. In conclusion, there are several methods for doing this. We'll go through the top 5 techniques with you.

2. [Method 2: Touchscreen Method](#part2-2)
3. [Method 3: Use Keyboard and Mouse Commands](#part2-3)
4. [Method 4: Use the Desktop Magnifier Feature](#part2-4)
5. [Method 5: Web Browser Method](#part2-5)

## Part 1: The Need to Zoom Computer Screen

You've been looking at your screen nonstop, but you can't figure out what it says. You could find the answer you're searching for by zooming in on your computer. On your computer screen, reading small type might be too difficult at times. There are several fast and simple methods to magnify your whole screen or zoom in on a specific area, whether you're using a MacBook or a Windows 10 PC.

Many users who are utilizing the Windows desktop, reading text, or surfing the web claim that the screen suddenly becomes stuck on zoom. Having such huge icons, graphics, and text on your windows computer is annoying. You must zoom out on Windows in order to resolve this problem. Microsoft offers options for customizing desktop display settings, whether you want to keep the zoomed-in desktop or change the display settings. This might alter the settings for Windows' Magnifier magnification, desktop icon size, or screen resolution.

Additionally, depending on the programs and utilities you have open, your computer's desktop may sometimes resemble a broad landscape. Its size and expanse provide you a bird's-eye perspective of the landscape. It may become a little challenging to read what's on it, particularly if your vision isn't as good as it once was. Popular desktop operating systems like Windows 10 and macOS include features that enable you to swiftly and eagle-like zoom in on just what you need.

Similar to this, if you aren't careful and cautious while using your computer, you could accidentally activate a feature like its zoom function. If you're using a shared computer, another user may utilize the zoom feature to make it easier for them to see tiny type on the screen. In any event, learning how to zoom out once more will allow you to utilize your computer anyway you see fit. Tools that zoom in on the desktop and make icons seem bigger than normal include screen resolution, icon views, and Windows Magnifier. These tools provide the greatest personalized settings to optimize display since they are made to enhance monitor display by making images and text understandable.

## Part 2: How to Zoom in/out PC screen

Here are the top 5 methods to know how to zoom out on desktop or subsequently, how to zoom desktop screen. Use the easiest method for you from the guide below:

### Method 1: Using a Keyboard

To zoom out or in on a webpage or document, hold down the Ctrl key while pressing the - (minus) or + (plus) key. You may utilize the - and + keys on the numeric keypad as well as those adjacent to the backspace key.

Step1Using the handy keyboard keys listed below is one of the most common methods to zoom in or out just in a certain window, website, or program.

* Ctrl + (+) to zoom in.
* Ctrl + (-) will zoom out.

Step2You may keep holding down the Command key while pressing the - or + keys to zoom as much as you like. Go ahead and try it.

### Method 2: Touchscreen Method

You have access to yet another fantastic single window zooming option if you're using a laptop with a trackpad. Simply squeeze two fingers together or spread them apart on your trackpad to zoom in or out. The Touch Bar at the bottom of your screen may be made bigger and simpler to read by choosing "Enable Touch Bar Zoom." To try it out, all you have to do is touch and hold the Touch Bar.

Step1You may use a "reverse-pinch" motion on a laptop with a touch screen or trackpad to zoom in or out in a variety of programs as well as on the desktop. This is really simple and will work in most applications (including Microsoft Office apps).

![how to zoom desktop screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/touch-sceren-option.jpg)

However, this motion may not be supported by all applications. This functionality won't work if you've turned off gestures on your trackpad or touchscreen.

Step2Put two fingers together on the touchscreen or trackpad. On the trackpad, you should place two fingers closely apart (they may even be touching).

Step3Put your fingers together directly over the region you wish to zoom out on while using a touchscreen display to focus in on a certain area.

Step4On the trackpad, spread your two fingers widely apart. The chosen website or app will zoom out to show more content when your two fingers separate from one another on the trackpad or touchscreen.

### Method 3: Use Keyboard and Mouse Commands

Using the keyboard and Mouse shortcuts is the easiest method to zoom in and out desktop screen on computers. Follow the steps below to learn this technique hassle-free.

**Steps to Use Keyboard and Mouse Method:**

Step1To zoom in, scroll your mouse wheel up while holding down the Ctrl key. You may already use this to zoom in on your browser, for instance.

![how to zoom desktop screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/keyboard-and-mouse-method.jpg)

Step2Now for the Zoom out, hold the Ctrl key on the Keyboard and move the mouse wheel down to zoom out to the desired extent as shown here:

### Method 4: Use the Desktop Magnifier Feature

The magnifier tool allows you to temporarily increase the size of a specific area of the screen. It is a built-in function of the Windows family. The user may enlarge the screen with the use of the magnifying tool. This function is highly beneficial for those who have hazy vision as well as for enlarging the specific picture shown to viewers through projectors. The magnifier app's default view, Full Screen, may enlarge the whole screen. However, the user is unable to see the complete screen at once since a section of it enlarges and moves with your mouse pointer. By selecting the "Options" option, the user may modify the Magnifier app's settings and access a variety of additional capabilities. Anyway, let's get started to learn the processes.

**Steps to Use Magnifier to Zoom Desktop Screen:**

Step1Open the Windows search (a magnifier icon or a long search box on the taskbar). To launch Magnifier, enter "magnifier" into Windows search and then click the first result.

Step2The Windows 10 Magnifier window will appear. Then, at any moment, you may zoom in on your app, your web browser, or a few other applications by pressing the + button.

![how to zoom desktop screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/windows-magnifier.jpg)

Step3Press the Windows logo key and + to enlarge the view (plus). or use the Magnifier controls' + (plus) button.

Step4Press the Windows key and - to zoom out (minus). Or use the Magnifier controls' - (minus) button.

Step5Press Windows logo key + Esc to close the Magnifier. In the top-right corner of the Magnifier controls, click the X (close) button.

### Method 5: Web Browser Method

You may enhance your web browser reading experience in a number of different ways. One method is to zoom in on the online sites you wish to read and enlarge the text, photos, and icons. It's possible that you need to do this since your eyes are weary or the screen's quality isn't the best. To restore items to their original state, you may need to reset the zoom level or zoom out at some point. On Windows 10, you may zoom in for a clearer view of the screen if you can't read the text or the pictures on your computer screen.

**Steps to Use Web Browser Method to Zoom Desktop Screen:**

You may use the zoom in shortcut on any web browser to increase the browser's zoom level. In other words, you may zoom in on your web browser using the keyboard.

You can see from reading this that using your computer to zoom in and out is fairly simple. You may simply choose one approach based on your needs to assist you. The zoom settings in Windows may be the cause of the abnormally huge graphics on the desktop.

Part 1: The Need to Zoom Computer Screen

You've been looking at your screen nonstop, but you can't figure out what it says. You could find the answer you're searching for by zooming in on your computer. On your computer screen, reading small type might be too difficult at times. There are several fast and simple methods to magnify your whole screen or zoom in on a specific area, whether you're using a MacBook or a Windows 10 PC.

Many users who are utilizing the Windows desktop, reading text, or surfing the web claim that the screen suddenly becomes stuck on zoom. Having such huge icons, graphics, and text on your windows computer is annoying. You must zoom out on Windows in order to resolve this problem. Microsoft offers options for customizing desktop display settings, whether you want to keep the zoomed-in desktop or change the display settings. This might alter the settings for Windows' Magnifier magnification, desktop icon size, or screen resolution.

Additionally, depending on the programs and utilities you have open, your computer's desktop may sometimes resemble a broad landscape. Its size and expanse provide you a bird's-eye perspective of the landscape. It may become a little challenging to read what's on it, particularly if your vision isn't as good as it once was. Popular desktop operating systems like Windows 10 and macOS include features that enable you to swiftly and eagle-like zoom in on just what you need.

Similar to this, if you aren't careful and cautious while using your computer, you could accidentally activate a feature like its zoom function. If you're using a shared computer, another user may utilize the zoom feature to make it easier for them to see tiny type on the screen. In any event, learning how to zoom out once more will allow you to utilize your computer anyway you see fit. Tools that zoom in on the desktop and make icons seem bigger than normal include screen resolution, icon views, and Windows Magnifier. These tools provide the greatest personalized settings to optimize display since they are made to enhance monitor display by making images and text understandable.

## Part 2: How to Zoom in/out PC screen

Here are the top 5 methods to know how to zoom out on desktop or subsequently, how to zoom desktop screen. Use the easiest method for you from the guide below:

### Method 1: Using a Keyboard

To zoom out or in on a webpage or document, hold down the Ctrl key while pressing the - (minus) or + (plus) key. You may utilize the - and + keys on the numeric keypad as well as those adjacent to the backspace key.

Step1Using the handy keyboard keys listed below is one of the most common methods to zoom in or out just in a certain window, website, or program.

* Ctrl + (+) to zoom in.
* Ctrl + (-) will zoom out.

Step2You may keep holding down the Command key while pressing the - or + keys to zoom as much as you like. Go ahead and try it.

### Method 2: Touchscreen Method

You have access to yet another fantastic single window zooming option if you're using a laptop with a trackpad. Simply squeeze two fingers together or spread them apart on your trackpad to zoom in or out. The Touch Bar at the bottom of your screen may be made bigger and simpler to read by choosing "Enable Touch Bar Zoom." To try it out, all you have to do is touch and hold the Touch Bar.

Step1You may use a "reverse-pinch" motion on a laptop with a touch screen or trackpad to zoom in or out in a variety of programs as well as on the desktop. This is really simple and will work in most applications (including Microsoft Office apps).

![how to zoom desktop screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/touch-sceren-option.jpg)

However, this motion may not be supported by all applications. This functionality won't work if you've turned off gestures on your trackpad or touchscreen.

Step2Put two fingers together on the touchscreen or trackpad. On the trackpad, you should place two fingers closely apart (they may even be touching).

Step3Put your fingers together directly over the region you wish to zoom out on while using a touchscreen display to focus in on a certain area.

Step4On the trackpad, spread your two fingers widely apart. The chosen website or app will zoom out to show more content when your two fingers separate from one another on the trackpad or touchscreen.

### Method 3: Use Keyboard and Mouse Commands

Using the keyboard and Mouse shortcuts is the easiest method to zoom in and out desktop screen on computers. Follow the steps below to learn this technique hassle-free.

**Steps to Use Keyboard and Mouse Method:**

Step2Now for the Zoom out, hold the Ctrl key on the Keyboard and move the mouse wheel down to zoom out to the desired extent as shown here:

### Method 4: Use the Desktop Magnifier Feature

The magnifier tool allows you to temporarily increase the size of a specific area of the screen. It is a built-in function of the Windows family. The user may enlarge the screen with the use of the magnifying tool. This function is highly beneficial for those who have hazy vision as well as for enlarging the specific picture shown to viewers through projectors. The magnifier app's default view, Full Screen, may enlarge the whole screen. However, the user is unable to see the complete screen at once since a section of it enlarges and moves with your mouse pointer. By selecting the "Options" option, the user may modify the Magnifier app's settings and access a variety of additional capabilities. Anyway, let's get started to learn the processes.

**Steps to Use Magnifier to Zoom Desktop Screen:**

Step1Open the Windows search (a magnifier icon or a long search box on the taskbar). To launch Magnifier, enter "magnifier" into Windows search and then click the first result.

Step2The Windows 10 Magnifier window will appear. Then, at any moment, you may zoom in on your app, your web browser, or a few other applications by pressing the + button.

![how to zoom desktop screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/windows-magnifier.jpg)

Step3Press the Windows logo key and + to enlarge the view (plus). or use the Magnifier controls' + (plus) button.

Step4Press the Windows key and - to zoom out (minus). Or use the Magnifier controls' - (minus) button.

Step5Press Windows logo key + Esc to close the Magnifier. In the top-right corner of the Magnifier controls, click the X (close) button.

### Method 5: Web Browser Method

You may enhance your web browser reading experience in a number of different ways. One method is to zoom in on the online sites you wish to read and enlarge the text, photos, and icons. It's possible that you need to do this since your eyes are weary or the screen's quality isn't the best. To restore items to their original state, you may need to reset the zoom level or zoom out at some point. On Windows 10, you may zoom in for a clearer view of the screen if you can't read the text or the pictures on your computer screen.

**Steps to Use Web Browser Method to Zoom Desktop Screen:**

You may use the zoom in shortcut on any web browser to increase the browser's zoom level. In other words, you may zoom in on your web browser using the keyboard.

Step1Launch a web browser. To zoom in on your web browser, hold down the Ctrl key while pressing the "+" key on your keyboard.
