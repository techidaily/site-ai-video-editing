## Dubbing Videos With Voiceovers | Wondershare Filmora Tutorial

Voiceovers have been a great utility in the digital ecosystem for a while. From movies to videos, the use of voiceovers has provided content creators with new dynamics. While it has enhanced the quality of video creation, there are other technicalities that have arisen against it.

Do you know **voiceover** and voice recording are two different terms? They are often used correspondingly but have different meanings. Here are a few differences between the two in the section below:

It is a process in which you can capture audio in your device using a microphone. Voice recordings can be any type of audio content, such as conversations, interviews, and much more. There are various settings for voice recording as well. It starts from studio recordings, outside and even home set-up recordings.

**Voiceover**

On the other hand, voiceover specifically refers to a recorded narration or video commentary. This includes documentaries, advertisements, films, television shows, and more. It provides information, explains visuals, or narrates a story to your audience. Mostly voiceover is scripted and well synchronized to convey the message to its audience successfully.

**Summary**

Wrapping up, the main difference between these two terms is the intent of audio content. In general, voice recording allows you to capture audio. In contrast, voiceover refers explicitly to the recording of some specific narrations. Ultimately, we can say that voiceover is a part of voice recording that should be synchronized with the visual media to fulfill its purpose.

If you need help seeing what you're masking, hide the main video layer and edit your mask like this.

![hide the main video layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-12.gif)

Move the playhead forward and clean up your "mask." Next, Increase the blur to soften the edges. But not too much because it may become visible on your subject.

##### Step8 Hide the first screenshot

Let's layer a couple more action frames! First, hide the first screenshot so it doesn't appear in your new screenshot.

![hide the first screenshot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-14.png)

##### Step9 Select your second action frame

Then, pick a new frame.

![select a new frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-15.png)

* Click the camera icon.

##### Step2 Import your clips and add them to the timeline

Open Filmora and create a new project. Import your clip into the media library. Add your clips to the first video layer on the timeline.

![import your video clip and add it to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-6.png)

##### Step3 Apply color correction to the footage

Before we start our edit, let's color correct our footage, so the corrected color is already applied when we take the screenshots.

![apply color correction to your clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-7.jpg)

##### Step4 Find your first action frame

Next, scrub through the clip to find your first action frame. **For example,** in this video, this is our first action frame.

![select the first action frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-8.png)

##### Step5 Take a screenshot of the action frame

Let's head to the camera icon under the preview screen and click the icon. It will take a screenshot of the current frame that the playhead is on the timeline.

![take a screenshot of the action frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/freeze-frame-sequence-filmora-9.gif)

## How to use Lumetri Color in Adobe After Effects

You don't need to be a pro for you to use Lumetri Color in Adobe After Effects. The color workspace in Adobe After Effect is designed to be straightforward and user-friendly.

The Lumetri Color panel in Adobe contains the histogram, vectorscope, parade scope, and waveform monitor. The histogram, parade scope, and waveform monitor display image intensity, whereas the vectorscope display hue and color saturation.

Lumetri Color is considered an ultimate choice by most editors due to its wide range of functionalities. Some of the functionalities in the Lumetri panel include:

#### 1\. Vignettes

Vignette is an outstanding feature that effortlessly allows Lumetri users to adjust lightness and darkness using sliders.

Vignettes allow you to darken the borders and highlight certain parts. You will therefore create more emphasis on highlighted parts in your clip.

#### 2\. HSL Secondary

When you want to get exceptional footage controls, HSL Secondary (Hue, Saturation, and Luminance) is often the best functionality. HSL Secondary easily separates your footage and works on a selected piece.

With the functionality, you can easily manipulate the skin tones in your footage and refocus images.

![how to use lumetri color in after effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/lumetri-color-after-effects-1.jpg)

#### 3\. Curves

The Lumetri panel in Adobe After Effects renders its users the curves functionality. There are two curves in the Lumetri Panel, i.e., Hue Saturation curves and luminesce curves.

The Hue/Saturation curve uses the red, green, and blue (RBG) flagship, whereas the luminance curve helps manage the frame curve's tone.

To carry out color grading:

* After opening the "Lumetri Color" panel as in step 2 above, click on the eyedropper to select the curve you want to use.
* Click the color in your footage that you wish to adjust. Usually, when you use the eyedropper, three points will be added to the graph. The two bottom points restrict color selection to a minimum range, whereas the first represents your selected color.

### How to Use Lumetri Scope

Besides the Lumetric Color, Lumetric Scope is another essential tool for post-film production in Adobe After Effects. The color correcting tool, Lumetric scope guarantees its users' accurate results when used correctly.

When carrying out color corrections in films, it is advisable to use quality monitor calibrators and paint your workspace walls neutral grey. Usually, it reduces lighting distraction and the external color effect, respectively.
