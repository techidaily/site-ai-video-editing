## Part 2: How To Add VHS Effect in Premiere Pro: An Overview

Do you know how you can **add the VHS effect in Premiere Pro**? Don't worry because this guideline will provide you with the required information. These simple steps will let you add your favorite VHS look to your video using Premiere Pro.

**Step 1:** Import your video into Adobe Premiere Pro. Open the "Lumetri Color" panel by clicking "Color" in the main toolbar. Further, choose "Lumetri Scopes" to access the graph window. Then, adjust the basic settings in the "Lumetri Color" panel. Continue to decrease the value of "Whites," increase the "Contrast," and set the "Blacks" to 10 on the graph.

![set lumetri color parameters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/create-the-perfect-vhs-effect-1.jpg)

**Step 2:** Navigate to the "Creative" tab in the "Lumetri Color" panel. Increase the "Faded Film" and decrease the "Sharpness," "Saturation," and "Vibrance" to your liking. Use the color wheels in the "Color Wheels & Match" section to give the right tone. Further, proceed to increase the "Vignette" value from the same tab.

![change other lumetri parameters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/create-the-perfect-vhs-effect-2.jpg)

**Step 3:** Enable editing mode by selecting "Editing" in the main bar. Choose "Edit" from the lower section and search for the "Channel Blur" effect. Apply the effect by dragging and dropping it onto your video clip. Place the effect above previous adjustments and effects.

![add channel blur effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/create-the-perfect-vhs-effect-3.jpg)

**Step 4:** In the "Channel Blur" effect tab, enable "Repeat Edge Pixel" and increase "Red Blurriness" to 30\. Repeat the same step but this time increase "Blue Blurriness" to 30 and "Red Blurriness" to 15 and change "Blur Dimensions" to "Vertical."

![change channel blur parameters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/create-the-perfect-vhs-effect-4.jpg)

**Step 5:** Continue to add the "Unsharp Mask" and "Color Emboss" effects from the "Effect" tab. Proceed and change "Amount" and "Radius" for "Unsharp Mask" to 85 and 20, respectively. Slightly increase the "Relief" values for the "Color Emboss" effect.

![add unsharp and color emboss](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/create-the-perfect-vhs-effect-5.jpg)

Proceed to apply the "Noise" effect from the "Noise & Grain" section and further adjust the "Amount of Noise" to your preference. Induce the "Wave Warp" effect and set the parameters of "Wave Height" to 2 and "Wave Width" to 1000\. Change "Direction" to 0 and "Pinning" to "Horizontal Edges."

![add noise and wave warp](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/create-the-perfect-vhs-effect-6.jpg)

**Step 6:** You can crop your video to a 4:3 aspect ratio to give your video more authenticity. To do this, create two "Color Matte" layers using the "New Item" icon. Name and place them over the video clip. Apply the "Crop" effect to both layers. Set the "Left" option to 86 for the first layer and the "Right" option to 86 for the second layer. Set the "Edge Feather" to 30 for both layers.

![add crop effect and adjust](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/create-the-perfect-vhs-effect-7.jpg)

Make sure to save your VHS effect as a preset for future use by right-clicking and selecting "Save Preset." Finally, export your **VHS effect Premiere Pro** video to your desired format.
