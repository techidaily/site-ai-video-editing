### Shotting Equipment

To record a professional video, you need a good camera. You can use a smartphone to record this footage. There is no need to have a tripod stand or any gear to hold the camera because the camera will be in a rotating position, the same as the subject's hand.

For this, you need a filmmaker or any person living with you. Just give instructions as shown below to him to record a perfect video for yourself:

* Record the whole video in just one direction.
* Don't **shake** the camera because it gives blurry footage.
* Ensure to **focus** on the subject during recording.
* Don't **zoom** in or out while recording the video.
* Keep the subject in the **middle** of the frame during the recording process.
* The **hand rotation** timing is the same as the camera's rotation.

### Filming of the First Footage

To make the footage for the rotating video illusion, we have to record it at least twice to get crystal clear and high-resolution results. Therefore, ensure that we have camera movement in the same direction during all recording times.

**Note:** You can film the video either in the vertical format of the camera or in horizontal format. It all depends upon your script!

Follow the below-mentioned steps to record the first footage for the video:

* Hold the camera in a perfect format, whatever you choose.
* Let the subject stand or sit in the middle of the frame.
* The filmmaker can rotate the camera when the subject's hand rotates.
* Try your best to rotate the camera 180 degrees.
* Ensure that the camera lens faces the ground at the end of the rotation.

![filming scenes of first footage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/rotating-video-effect-4.png)

After filming the first footage for the video, it's time to record the second footage to transition between the two.

### Filming of the Second Footage

To create a second shot, you have to remember that the costume and location of the filming are different from the first footage. Follow the below steps to record it:

* The first step is to hold the camera in the same direction as the first footage.
* When editing, make sure the subject's position matches the first footage.
* Make sure the subject's hand movement is in the opposite direction from the first shot.

Adding an emoji in your brand promotion strategies helps to establish a great deal of emotional connection of the same with your target audience, while making them relate to the regular inclusion of these graphic elements in their social media conversations.

Working towards adding emojis in your product or company presentations or ad campaigns caters to convey the product information in a unique style of its own by adding an extra bit of liveliness to your brand.

You should however, be cautious while using emojis to promote your brand, lest these may end up crowding the presentation snippet. It is a wise decision to use a single or couple of emojis at the end of a text based content, rather than stuffing the same with a series of emojis to avoid the distraction of audience.

Another way of making an impressive use of emojis in your promotional media posts is creating engaging feature lists of your brand, or adding the same to the product headlines, while giving them an extra impact. Such graphic creativity will surely put your brand ahead of the numerous counterparts on promotional business sites.

While using emojis alone can make the task a bit difficult, an intelligent combination of the latter with cohesive text elements can effectively cater towards delivering a top rated promotional output, while adding an extra bit of meaning and depth to the same.

When promoting your product across social media platforms that have a restriction on the maximum number of characters within a single post or message, using emojis can compensate for the text you would otherwise prefer to add. The additional benefit of this inclusion lies in supplementing your text with the missing emotional connect and feel that works to build an emphasis of your brand among the viewers.
