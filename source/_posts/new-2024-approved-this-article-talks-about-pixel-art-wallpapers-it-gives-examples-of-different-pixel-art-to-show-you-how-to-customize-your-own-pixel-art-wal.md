Pixel art is digital art created through computer software. In this digital art, images are edited on a pixel level. This gives the kind of aesthetic from computer video games using 8-bit and 16-bit technology. In general, this art uses very few color palettes, with some using only two.

The history of pixel art goes back to the 1930s with the monochromatic light bulb displays in New York City.

Pixel art tries to mimic the features of old video game graphics done by computers that were only able to display a few colors at once.

Digital pixel art evolved in such a way that artists are now dedicated to that art, and so create beautiful pixel art wallpapers that we'll show you in this article.

Find the software on your computer and don’t be overwhelmed by the interface.

![crop-vidoe-in-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-vidoe-in-vlc-1.png)

Then click the **Media and** select **Open File** to choose the video that you want to crop. You should prepare the videos that you want to be cropped and rename them to avoid confusion.

![crop-vidoe-in-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-vidoe-in-vlc-2.png)

Click the **Tools** on the menu and select the **Effects and Filters.**

![crop-vidoe-in-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-vidoe-in-vlc-3.png)

After that, click on the **Video Effects** and under that select **Crop.** Doing this, will open the cropping editor.

![crop-vidoe-in-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-vidoe-in-vlc-4.png)

You need to enter specific pixels on the **left**, **right, top** and **bottom**. This will depend on your preferences. If it is your first time and you don’t know the exact pixels then just input what you think would be enough.

![crop-vidoe-in-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-vidoe-in-vlc-5.png)

After entering your preferred pixels, you can preview it. If you would like to adjust then just simply repeat entering the specific pixels.

![crop-vidoe-in-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-vidoe-in-vlc-6.png)

You decided to save the cropped video. Find the **Tools** menu and select **Preferences**.

![crop-vidoe-in-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-vidoe-in-vlc-7.png)

Find the **Show settings** and click **All.** In the **search bar** type **Croppadd** then save your previous preferred pixel settings. Lastly, click **Save**.

![crop-vidoe-in-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-vidoe-in-vlc-8.png)

In the **Media** menu select the **Convert/Save**. You can drag and drop the cropped video to the **File** box.

![crop-vidoe-in-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-vidoe-in-vlc-9.png)

You can select your file format and codecs by clicking **Convert/Save.**

![crop-vidoe-in-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-vidoe-in-vlc-10.png)

Then click **Start.**

![crop-vidoe-in-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-vidoe-in-vlc-13.png)

Congratulations on getting here! You finally cropped your video using the VLC media player.

Although there are disadvantages to using this as your cropping tool. Like for example you want the real-time preview of what you’ve changed in your video. This would be a turn off for some that want their outputs to be shown to them immediately. Aside from this, there is a chance that you will forget one step to make and thus, the whole process would need to start over from scratch. Lastly, is the freedom to batch crop multiple videos. This is especially important for those that need to have many clips in one video. A user might lose the continuity of the story within his video.

While one of its strong suits is the affordability of the software. It is completely free and has no additional charges that may surprise you in the future. Finally, your output won’t have watermarks that could destroy the aesthetics of your video.

What are your experiences with using it as a cropping tool? What would you recommend to improve it? It is up to you the user if you want to continue using this as your partner in removing the excess in your videos.
