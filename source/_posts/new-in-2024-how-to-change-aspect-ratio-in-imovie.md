 Nov 07, 2023• Proven solutions

The ratio between the height and width of the screen or an image is called the **aspect ratio**. Different video posting platforms require different aspect ratios. For example, for YouTube, the commonly used aspect ratio is 16:9, which is a standard for almost all videos. However, for TikTok, the required aspect ratio is 9:16.

The video’s original aspect ratio is based on the default settings of the recording device. Some phones and tablets provide the option of changing your video’s aspect ratio before you start recording. But it can also be changed afterward with the help of editing software.

Social media apps and websites require you post images and videos of a specific size. And if you post your content in its original dimensions it most probably be will get cropped in the wrong places and will diminish the quality of your video or image.

To post that perfect video, it is better to resize it before posting it online. Several online editing tools are available on the market that you can use to change the dimensions of your content. iMovie has to be one of the most popular editing software used worldwide. So, if you use iMovie for editing videos, and you want to know how you can change the aspect ratio of your content, read on to find it out.
