Are you thinking of merging two photos together with an identical background and no loss of quality? Or, do you have to remove the background color in a design? In such cases, PNG images work best for all.

**PNG images** are used at a broad level by web designers, graphic designers, and many other professionals around the world. It enables them to have a transparent background along with the finest image quality. It’s even possible to convert a **JPG image to PNG transparent** using any image editor. However, the process can seem a bit tedious and become complex if you are not using the right tool.

So, to help you out, we will reveal here the best way to remove the background of a photo and **convert JPG image to PNG transparent**.

#### In this article

01 [How to Remove the Background of a Photo in PowerPoint](#Part 1)

02 [How to Convert JPG to Transparent PNG](#Part 2)

## Part 1 How to Remove the Background of a Photo in PowerPoint

If there is anything that a designer hates in his precious photo, then it’s the background. It hides and distracts from the main subject at hand. You can use various photo editing tools to remove the background from PNG images or JPG. However, they may not do the job as easily as you are thinking.

Yes, we know that you may be wondering about Adobe Photoshop now. It can be used for removing the background too but are you ready to pay for it? No, right? This is when you can depend on PowerPoint to erase the background of a photo without any hassle. Make sure you have PowerPoint 2010 or a later version installed before beginning. Because the earlier Microsoft PowerPoint versions don’t have a background removal feature.

Step 1: Open the image in a new tab

Launch PowerPoint on your desktop or Mac and change the layout of the slide to "Blank". Next, insert your image, which has a solid or high-contrast background. Such pictures are easier to transform and edit.

![import picture powerpoint](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/things-you-need-to-know-about-transparent-png-remove-and-convert-1.jpg)

Step 2: Select the "Remove Background" option

Click on your image to get the "Picture Format" in the menu toolbar. On the left top side, choose the "Remove Background" option. Now, PowerPoint will try to remove the background automatically. If the final picture that you are getting is not satisfactory, move to the next step.

![click remove background powerpoint](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/things-you-need-to-know-about-transparent-png-remove-and-convert-2.jpg)

Step 3: Select the Area

From the given options in the toolbar, mark the areas that you want to keep or remove in the final result. As you can view, how some parts of the pictures have been cut. So, spread the box to cover the entire area of the image, which you want to keep. Remember, purple-highlighted areas are removed automatically.

![select area for background removal powerpoint](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/things-you-need-to-know-about-transparent-png-remove-and-convert-3.jpg)

If you want to ensure a better result, use the cursor. Start hovering over the background and the main subject to get the plus and minus sign. These signs are useful for getting a precise image at the end. The Minus sign allows you to mark the areas to be removed. The plus sign can be used to keep the marked areas in the final picture.

Step 4: Finishing Touches

Check your image carefully and see whether any area is left to be removed or not. You can zoom in to find the tiniest spot. When you are satisfied with every detail, click anywhere outside of the image to stop further edits. Congratulations! Your transparent PNG is ready to save. Go to "File">"Save As" and find the option to save your picture in PNG transparent format.

## Part 2 How to Convert JPG to Transparent PNG

Ever wondered how logos in a graphic match with the background image color? It’s possible with transparent PNG images only. The transparent PNG images format contains superior quality and no background. Hence, it is pretty helpful for the designers to add them to graphics and videos.

![kapwing interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/things-you-need-to-know-about-transparent-png-remove-and-convert-4.jpg)

If the image is already saved on your device, simply hit "Click to Upload" or, if you wish, drag and drop the JPG image to initiate the conversion. On the other hand, in case the image is not available, you can copy and paste from a URL in the "Paste an image or video URL" box.

Step 2: Pick a Tool

After the image upload finishes, the next thing is to start removing its background. Go to the right side of the "Image" tab and click on the "Erase" button. Otherwise, you can use the "Remove Background from Image" tool to start.

![pick the tool kapwing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/things-you-need-to-know-about-transparent-png-remove-and-convert-5.jpg)

You have two options to choose from – Erase and Magic Wand. The first tool gives you full control over what you want to remove or keep. Adjust the "eraser size" by sliding right on the dial. This way, you can remove the background precisely.

Apart from that, the Magic Wand tool is amazing for removing a particular area at once. You can remove the picture background in less time and effort. If you want to remove a certain area of the same color, then the Magic Wand is the best tool to use. It eliminates similar groups of pixels together. To modify the sensitivity, move the same dial to the right as you did while selecting the "Erase" tool.

For some impressive results, adjust the zoom and choose "Move" to select the pixels you want to remove.

Step 3: Make the PNG and Download

After everything has been set, it’s time to download your PNG transparent file. Click "Done" and then move back to the Kapwing Studio for additional features. You can add watermarks, text, and a lot more. Finally, hit the "Publish" button placed at the top right and "Download" to save the PNG file to your desktop.
