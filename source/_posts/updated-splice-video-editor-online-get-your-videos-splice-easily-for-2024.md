## Easy Way to Create an Alternate Reality Effect

Ditch boring one-dimensional videos and create a mesmerizing video with this alternative reality effect you can easily create using Wondershare Filmora.

This cool effect enables you to show a dream-like scene where two mirrored footages appear within the same frame using the Masking feature. But why stop there?

Keep reading to find out how you can use this style of effect to spice up your daily vlog bumper intro or even for your upcoming sci-fi content.

![a preview of the alternate reality effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/alternate-reality-effect-1.gif)

## Preparing the footage

There are not many restrictions on preparing the footage for this effect. However, depending on the results you're aiming for, you might need to consider a few things.

First, a wider view and some camera panning, or tilting will deliver a better result as it provides angle variations. This will later enhance the dynamic of the scene, making it feels even more uncanny.

Then, while you're at it, you need to also figure out the purpose of the video itself. If you want to upload it to certain platforms where vertical videos are more popular, you will want to work on that as well. When you're shooting your footage, make sure that you're taking it at the correct angle that would fit the ratio you're aiming for.

Last but not least, consider the length of the footage. If you're planning to make a bumper video, you might want a quick yet comprehensive shot of the objects you want to highlight. You can always trim and adjust the timing later, but it is better to also plan it early.

## Editing the video

If you have your footage or stock video ready, then you can start editing. Follow this simple step-by-step guide to create your own alternate reality using [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

## Easy Steps to Make Glitch Effect with Filmora

You don't need outdated VCRs or any other broken technology to produce glitch effects. Instead, you can use a video editing program for Mac and PCs, such as [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), to transform your videos into glitch-effect masterpieces. You can also use the glitch effects to provide striking shot transitions or opening titles. Keep reading this article on how to apply various glitch video effects in Filmora 11:

## Part 1: What is a Glitch Effect?

A glitch effect occurs when a section of your video temporarily changes look or "glitches" for a short while. Although transient glitches are typical, they can occasionally linger for a few seconds or more.

![what is a glitch effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/glitch_effect_2.jpg)

You can use a glitch effect to temporarily change the appearance of the image in the video to give the impression that a machine is processing it. Additionally, it gives your finished piece a fantastic, dreamlike aspect.

## Part 2: When Should you Apply a Glitch Effect?

A few years back, we had no choice but to watch glitchy movies on rusty VCR devices. Nowadays, retro video effects are very popular in TV movies and even games. You can use these effects in many ways, like making fake vintage footage or emulating a glitching computer.

Filmmakers frequently employ glitching in their videos to give the impression that a character has been affected by a technical abnormality, is having a flashback, or is being watched by someone else via a digital camera system. Something happens when the person or image flashes, often without their knowledge. In addition, you can apply the glitch effect to a composition to evoke a feeling of dramatic irony.

## Part 3: Tutorial to Chromatic Aberration Effect

Chromatic aberration refers to how old lenses tend to split colors. This effect is very common in Old media like VHS or LaserDisc.

![chromatic aberration](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/glitch_effect_3.jpg)

Step1 Click on the Effects tab.

## Part 5: Tips to Create Awesome Glitch Effects

1. One of the best ways to use the VCR Distortion effect is to cut it short and intersperse it around your video in random parts.

3. You can also use these effects as a sneaky way to hide Cuts in your video.

A vignette is a dark border that fades around the frame's edges in Filmora. You can easily add a vignette effect to your video by using these steps:

Step1 First, click the Effects Tab and type in Vignette.

Step2 Next, drag the Vignette Radius effect to a layer above your previous three layers.

Step3 Now adjust the length to match the other clips.

**VHS static effects**

A VHS effect is a grainy distortion that resembles an old analog video cassette recording. To apply the VHS static effects:

Step1 Click the Effects tab.

Step2 Search for the VHS static and drag it to a new layer above everything else.

Step3 Extend one of the effects to match the length of your previous clips.

**VCR Distortion**

VCR Distortion effect will make your video look highly glitched. To apply this effect:

Step1 Click on the Effects tab.

Step2 Search for VCR Distortion, then drag and drop this effect over your previous layer.

## Part 5: Tips to Create Awesome Glitch Effects

1. One of the best ways to use the VCR Distortion effect is to cut it short and intersperse it around your video in random parts.
2. The glitch Distortion effect is very intense, so we recommend cutting this effect very short and dropping it at random parts of your video.
3. You can also use these effects as a sneaky way to hide Cuts in your video.

## Summary

You can use glitch effects created or inspired by faulty video equipment as a powerful storytelling tool. These effects can help you change the tone of the entire video by adding a specific visual aesthetic and making the narrative simpler to convey and more approachable for the audience.

We recommend using Filmora 11 for adding built-in glitch effects. You can also use this app to create custom glitch effects within a few minutes.

## Best 8 Animated Video Makers

Animations can be a great way to get your work to stand out and the best animated video maker can help you get this effect very easily. Here, we will be helping you find the best way to create animated videos for your particular project.

It is important to point out that there are very many animation programs in the market and choosing the best one will depend on your needs, your style, the feature and tools you need, the cost of the program, and even the export options that each tool gives you.

Before we look at the best ways to create animated videos, let’s start by examining why you would need to use an animated video maker in the first place.

## When to Use an Animated Video Maker

There are several reasons why you would want to create an animated video, rather than use traditional video solutions. The following are the most important from a digital marketing standpoint;

**Improve Conversion and Sales**

Animated videos are engaging enough to improve your conversion and sales. Studies have shown that an animated video can increase both conversion and sales by up to 80%. It may therefore be a good idea to use an animated explainer video to show your potential customers how to purchase a product or service on your website.

**Increase Brand Awareness**

Because they can be very entertaining and engaging, animated videos can also be a great way to increase brand awareness. And since they can be created very easily and cheaply, they can be a good way to reach potential customers.

**Generate Online Leads**

Because of the engaging nature of animated videos, you can use them to introduce yourself to potential customers and generate online leads. They have a very high conversion rate, as we have seen before, making them one of the best ways to reach people who would otherwise have never heard of you and your brand.

**Explain Complex Processes**

It can be very difficult to try to explain very complex ideas such as the mechanical aspect of a certain tool using words. But a well-crafted animated video gives you the chance to explain complex ideas in a fun and engaging way, making it easier for your customers to understand and engage with your brand.
