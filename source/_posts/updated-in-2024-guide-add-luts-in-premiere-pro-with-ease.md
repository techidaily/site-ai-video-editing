This effect aims to pause the world the video is living in and allow the audience to process the scene and gain more context fully. Note that the world around us keeps ongoing, and time never stops. But luckily for us, we can pause film and video with a simple but powerful video effect known as the freeze-frame.

In addition, a freeze-frame can be carried out in a video to showcase a specific frame in your clip by extending the length of Time that frame is displayed. For example, you can decide to freeze a frame to show the video frame where a goal is being scored in a sporting event or use it to showcase a captured reaction or a smile. When a freeze-frame applies to a video clip, the clip automatically splits at the freezing point, and the chosen frame is inserted as an image file (BMP) and displayed on screen for the duration you set.

### 03**Premiere Pro**

Here is a step-by-step guide on how to Freeze-frame in Premiere Pro using a video frame for the duration of a clip:

Step 1: Download Premiere Pro

Download and install Adobe Premiere Pro on your PC and open it to start editing your video. Import video to Premiere Pro and drag and drop to the timeline.

Step 2: Select a clip in a Timeline panel.

To freeze a frame using other methods than the In or Out point, open the video portion in the Source Monitor, and set the Marker 0 (zero) to the frame you wish to pause in the video.

Step 3: Choose Clip > Video Options > Frame Hold.

Next is to tap Hold On and select the frame you want to hold from the menu. However, you can choose the frame based on Source Timecode, In Point, Out Point, Sequence Timecode, or Playhead position.

Step 4: Finally, specify "Hold Filters" and click OK.

Effect settings use the values at the holding frame to prevent keyframed effect settings (if any are present) from animating during the clip's duration.

![Hold filters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/freeze-frame-video-editing-skills-9.jpg)

### 04**Kapwing**

Step 1: Upload and edit your video with Kapwing.

Choose to "Get Started," upload a file from your device, or paste a video link from a third-party site like YouTube, Vimeo, or TikTok. In any case, you'll be whisked away to your very own video editing studio.

![Upload and edit](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/freeze-frame-video-editing-skills-10.jpg)

Step 2: Give your video a freeze-frame effect.

Select the "Timing" tab in the right navigation bar and click "Freeze Frame" after uploading your video to Kapwing.

In Kapwing, you may add a freeze-frame to a video.

As you can see, clicking "Freeze Frame" instantly creates an image layer for the frame your timeline slider was on. Click on the image layer and choose from the "Duration" dropdown option under the "Edit" tab in the right navigation bar to change the length of the freeze-frame. Alternatively, you may drag the image layer onto your timeline by clicking and dragging it.

That's all there is to it!

You can add video clips to Animotica by navigating to where you saved your video clip, selecting it, and opening it. You'll now return to the project window, where your video will display. You can enable a wide range of enhancing options by tapping on the video clip with your mouse.

![Select a Video to Freeze](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/freeze-frame-video-editing-skills-13.jpg)

Step 3: The Freeze Effect

To activate your options, tap on the video clip. You must now decide which segment of the video you want to freeze. To make things easy for you, press the play and pause buttons when you reach the part you want to freeze.

Take a picture of the video by dragging your pointer down to the camera icon and pressing it to take a photo while keeping the clip paused, where you want it to be frozen. When you do that, a menu of three options will appear; select Take Snapshots and Insert in Current Position. This choice will split the movie in half and insert the scene you just recorded in the middle, resulting in a freeze.

The **freeze-frame video editing** effect is a technique used to stop the moving image of a video and hold it still onscreen. This effect aims to pause the world the video is living in and allow the audience to process the scene and gain more context fully. Note that the world around us keeps ongoing, and time never stops. But luckily for us, we can pause film and video with a simple but powerful video effect known as the freeze-frame.

In addition, a freeze-frame can be carried out in a video to showcase a specific frame in your clip by extending the length of Time that frame is displayed. For example, you can decide to freeze a frame to show the video frame where a goal is being scored in a sporting event or use it to showcase a captured reaction or a smile. When a freeze-frame applies to a video clip, the clip automatically splits at the freezing point, and the chosen frame is inserted as an image file (BMP) and displayed on screen for the duration you set. This article will teach how to use the freeze-frame editing service ideally.
