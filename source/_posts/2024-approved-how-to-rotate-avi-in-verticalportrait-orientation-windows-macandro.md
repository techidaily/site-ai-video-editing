Introduced in 2003, Adobe Premiere Pro is known to be a video editing software. It has a lot of features that can be used in the process of editing. It’s capable of editing feature movies such as Hollywood and the likes.

* STEP 2 - Click on frame size and type in 3840; for the horizontal, type in 2160 and then proceed to click ok

FIXING A PORTRAIT SHOT

* Put your play-head (the thin line that moves over the clips on your timeline) on the clip on the timeline

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-12.jpg)

* Go to ‘scale’, and type in the number according to the degree you desire to effect

 your rotation. However, your video will be just perfect if you type in -90

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-13.jpg)

ALTERNATIVE WAY TO ROTATE AVI VIDEO ON ADOBE PREMIERE PRO

* STEP 1 - Go to the effects window and search for ‘flip’
* STEP 2 - Click on ‘Transform’. You can then decide to do a horizontal flip or a vertical flip
* STEP 3 - All you need to do is click and drag it on to your clip and it will flip, whether horizontal or vertical
* STEP 4 - It is easy to remedy when you click and drag the other to place on your footage, whether horizontal or vertical.

TO ROTATE YOUR CLIP

* STEP 1 - Highlight your footage on the timeline and go to your effects controls window. Underneath ‘motion’, there is the perimeter of rotation. If you click and drag the mouse on the number, it will rotate either clockwise or counter-clockwise. Also, you can type in whatever rotation amount you want

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-14.jpg)

* STEP 2 - It’s also worth mentioning that when you rotate a clip, you’re always rotating around the inker point (the little blue cross in a circle). You can click and drag this through the program monitor to any point on the clip and start rotating it around the inker point. In fact, it doesn’t have to be on the clip; you can make the inker point up further and rotate, and will still rotate around the inker point. If you don’t see this on your program monitor, that’s because you haven’t highlighted the motion.

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-15.jpg)

* STEP 3 - A good tip is using guides to help you level and horizontal or whether you are working with on-screen. To get a slant perfectly leveled, there’s an easy way to reference a straight line on your program monitor. On the bottom right of your program monitor is the button \[a plus (+) button\] editor. Click on it and a box full of tools will pop up which you can work with. Click ‘add show rulers’, ‘show guides’ and ‘safe margins’

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-16.jpg)

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-17.jpg)

* STEP 4 - In the ruler section, take your mouse, click and drag it down to the little crosses of your safe margins. The same goes for the vertical ruler; click and drag over. That will create a new guide. For your footage, what you might need to do is get your horizontal guide down to your horizon view. You can go to your rotation and rotate your footage to get straight with your guide. If you are left with black bars at the corners, take off your safe margin rulers and guides and then zoom in on your footage and take off the black bars. To do this, go back to your effect controls

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-18.jpg)

* STEP 5 - Instead of doing rotation, you scale by clicking and sliding the mouse on the number to the right

* STEP 2 - It’s also worth mentioning that when you rotate a clip, you’re always rotating around the inker point (the little blue cross in a circle). You can click and drag this through the program monitor to any point on the clip and start rotating it around the inker point. In fact, it doesn’t have to be on the clip; you can make the inker point up further and rotate, and will still rotate around the inker point. If you don’t see this on your program monitor, that’s because you haven’t highlighted the motion.

To get a slant perfectly leveled, there’s an easy way to reference a straight line on your program monitor. On the bottom right of your program monitor is the button \[a plus (+) button\] editor. Click on it and a box full of tools will pop up which you can work with. Click ‘add show rulers’, ‘show guides’ and ‘safe margins’

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-17.jpg)

* STEP 4 - In the ruler section, take your mouse, click and drag it down to the little crosses of your safe margins. The same goes for the vertical ruler; click and drag over. That will create a new guide. For your footage, what you might need to do is get your horizontal guide down to your horizon view. You can go to your rotation and rotate your footage to get straight with your guide. If you are left with black bars at the corners, take off your safe margin rulers and guides and then zoom in on your footage and take off the black bars. To do this, go back to your effect controls

Video editing is the process of cutting and rearranging multiple clips or segments of video to create a new and more improved video. This involves adding titles, animations, sound effects, music and more. Video editing has not ceased to follow the trend of technology as it keeps thriving tirelessly through the ages. With advancement springing forth from many sides, video editing followed every pace to ensure it’s not left behind. This largely involves gadgets, computers and smartphones.

Before the advent of smartphones, computers have been the only video editing tools, and that culture is preserved even till date as its use has spread round the world.

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-13.jpg)

ALTERNATIVE WAY TO ROTATE AVI VIDEO ON ADOBE PREMIERE PRO

* STEP 1 - Go to the effects window and search for ‘flip’
* STEP 2 - Click on ‘Transform’. You can then decide to do a horizontal flip or a vertical flip
* STEP 3 - All you need to do is click and drag it on to your clip and it will flip, whether horizontal or vertical
* STEP 4 - It is easy to remedy when you click and drag the other to place on your footage, whether horizontal or vertical.

TO ROTATE YOUR CLIP

* STEP 1 - Highlight your footage on the timeline and go to your effects controls window. Underneath ‘motion’, there is the perimeter of rotation. If you click and drag the mouse on the number, it will rotate either clockwise or counter-clockwise. Also, you can type in whatever rotation amount you want

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-14.jpg)

* STEP 2 - It’s also worth mentioning that when you rotate a clip, you’re always rotating around the inker point (the little blue cross in a circle). You can click and drag this through the program monitor to any point on the clip and start rotating it around the inker point. In fact, it doesn’t have to be on the clip; you can make the inker point up further and rotate, and will still rotate around the inker point. If you don’t see this on your program monitor, that’s because you haven’t highlighted the motion.

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-15.jpg)

* STEP 3 - A good tip is using guides to help you level and horizontal or whether you are working with on-screen. To get a slant perfectly leveled, there’s an easy way to reference a straight line on your program monitor. On the bottom right of your program monitor is the button \[a plus (+) button\] editor. Click on it and a box full of tools will pop up which you can work with. Click ‘add show rulers’, ‘show guides’ and ‘safe margins’

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-16.jpg)

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-17.jpg)

* STEP 4 - In the ruler section, take your mouse, click and drag it down to the little crosses of your safe margins. The same goes for the vertical ruler; click and drag over. That will create a new guide. For your footage, what you might need to do is get your horizontal guide down to your horizon view. You can go to your rotation and rotate your footage to get straight with your guide. If you are left with black bars at the corners, take off your safe margin rulers and guides and then zoom in on your footage and take off the black bars. To do this, go back to your effect controls

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-18.jpg)

* STEP 5 - Instead of doing rotation, you scale by clicking and sliding the mouse on the number to the right

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-19.jpg)

**Step 3:** Let's use the ezgif website. Upon accessing it, ensure that you settle for the APNG maker icon. It is on the top left of the website.

## How to Make Video Slow Motion?

Slow-motion videos are in trend now, especially when shooting for [Instagram Reels](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), TikTok videos, or [YouTube Shorts](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). While many users record the entire video in slow motion, there are others who need only a particular section of a clip to play at a reduced speed. Nevertheless, slowing down footage is no longer rocket science, thanks to the advancements in technology, and the availability and ease of access to relevant apps.

That said, here you will learn what is needed to record a video in slow motion, and how to get the job done in a simple way. In addition, you will also learn how to reduce the playback speed of an already existing video if it was recorded at a normal pace.

02 [How to Apply the Smooth Slow-Motion Effect in Post-Production?](#part2)

03 [When to Use Slow Motion?](#part3)

## Part 1: How to Make Slow Motion Videos via Recording?

The fact is, the playback speed of a video is inversely proportional to the [frames per second](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) (FPS) it has been recorded in. Usually, to have a video play at normal speed, it is recorded at 24 FPS or 30 FPS. On the other hand, if you increase the frame rate (FPS) to 120 or 240, the playback speed slows down. You can easily check this if you have access to a DSLR camera or an iPhone. These devices allow you to adjust the FPS so the videos can be recorded in slow motion.

For your convenience and learning, the step-by-step procedure on how to record a video in slow motion using an iPhone is explained below:

**Step 1: Get to the SLO-MO Mode**

Launch the **Camera** app on your iPhone (iPhone 13 Pro Max is used here for illustrations), and swipe the screen to the left to get to the **SLO-MO** mode.

![iphone slow motion capture mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-slow-motion-capture-mode.jpg)

**Step 2: Adjust Recording Preferences**

Tap the number at the top-right corner to switch between **120** FPS and **240** FPS as needed. Tap **1x** from the lower-middle section of the screen, and use the rotator to adjust your preferred zoom level.

![adjust slow motion zoom level iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-slow-motion-zoom-level-iphone.jpg)

**Step 3: Start and Stop Recording**

Speed Ramping enables you to add the slow-motion effect at different parts of a video and even freeze the screen for the duration that you specify. The processes to get these done are given below in detail:

**Step 1: Add Source Video to Timeline and Get to the Speed Ramping Window**

Use the process given in the previous method to import a source video to Wondershare Filmora 11 and add it to the Timeline. Then use the process given in the second step of the previous method to get to the **Speed Ramping** window.

After adding a freeze point, optionally, you can drag and reposition it in the **Speed Ramping** timeline as needed. Finally, click **OK** from the bottom-right area to save the changes.

## Part 3: When to Use Slow Motion?

There could be many instances when you want to add a slow-motion effect to your videos. Some of the most common ones include:

* **Add Focus**

If there is a particular scene in a clip that you want the audience to focus on, it would be a good idea to add the slow-motion effect right before that action appears on the screen, and bring the speed back to normal when the section is over.

* **Skill or Style Demonstration**

When a clip is playing at a normal speed, many times, the audience isn’t able to see the skills that you want to display. This is where you may want to add the slow-motion effect so that every detail can be noticed clearly and in detail.

* **Replays**

Mostly used for tournaments and matches where the actual action is to replayed so the audience, umpires, and other viewers can see the movements in detail before making the right decision.

* **Observation**

Some natural phenomena such as a deer running in the woods, a balloon full of water bursting, etc. occur quite quickly. If you want to witness such things clearly and in detail, it would be good to record them, and then reduce the playback speed for better viewing.

* **Add Suspense**

When you add the slow-motion effect to a scene, the impulse of the audience is automatically increased, and they take that particular section more seriously and with a thrill.

**Conclusion**

The slow-motion effect is inversely proportional to the framerate, i.e., frames per second or FPS. Almost all DSLR cameras that are available nowadays allow you to switch between different FPS values (typically 120 and 240) before recording. Also, if you have access to an iPhone, its Camera app has a built-in SLO-MO mode that can capture the footage in slow motion.

In addition, if you already have a video that has been recorded at a normal speed, you can use an efficient post-production software like Wondershare Filmora 11, and exploit its Speed Ramping feature to add the slow-motion effect at different scenes of a clip.

Speed Ramping enables you to add the slow-motion effect at different parts of a video and even freeze the screen for the duration that you specify. The processes to get these done are given below in detail:

**Step 1: Add Source Video to Timeline and Get to the Speed Ramping Window**

Use the process given in the previous method to import a source video to Wondershare Filmora 11 and add it to the Timeline. Then use the process given in the second step of the previous method to get to the **Speed Ramping** window.

**Step 2: Add Slow Motion Effect to Different Parts of the Clip**

Go to the **Speed Ramping** tab if it is not already selected, click **Custom** from the available options, and drag the adjustment points below the center line to reduce the playback speed for that particular section of the clip. Optionally, you can click any of the available presets to automatically add the slow-motion effect to the video.

Note: You can also drag the adjustment points above the line to increase the playback speed.

To add an adjustment point on the frame where it is not already present, place the playhead (skimmer) at the correct position, and click **Add Adjust Point** from the left of the **Speed Ramping** window itself. Once added, you can drag it downward to reduce the playback speed of that part of the clip.

![use filmora speed ramping slow down video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-filmora-speed-ramping-slow-down-video.jpg)

**Step 3: Freeze the Video**

Place the skimmer on the frame where you want to freeze the video for a while, and click **Add Freeze Frame** from the left of the Speed Ramping window. When the time box appears, in the Freeze Time field, enter the duration in seconds you want to freeze the screen for, and click **OK**.

![add freeze frame speed ramping filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-freeze-frame-speed-ramping-filmora.jpg)

After adding a freeze point, optionally, you can drag and reposition it in the **Speed Ramping** timeline as needed. Finally, click **OK** from the bottom-right area to save the changes.

## Part 3: When to Use Slow Motion?

There could be many instances when you want to add a slow-motion effect to your videos. Some of the most common ones include:

* **Add Focus**

If there is a particular scene in a clip that you want the audience to focus on, it would be a good idea to add the slow-motion effect right before that action appears on the screen, and bring the speed back to normal when the section is over.

* **Skill or Style Demonstration**

When a clip is playing at a normal speed, many times, the audience isn’t able to see the skills that you want to display. This is where you may want to add the slow-motion effect so that every detail can be noticed clearly and in detail.

* **Replays**

Mostly used for tournaments and matches where the actual action is to replayed so the audience, umpires, and other viewers can see the movements in detail before making the right decision.

* **Observation**

Some natural phenomena such as a deer running in the woods, a balloon full of water bursting, etc. occur quite quickly. If you want to witness such things clearly and in detail, it would be good to record them, and then reduce the playback speed for better viewing.

* **Add Suspense**

When you add the slow-motion effect to a scene, the impulse of the audience is automatically increased, and they take that particular section more seriously and with a thrill.

**Conclusion**

The slow-motion effect is inversely proportional to the framerate, i.e., frames per second or FPS. Almost all DSLR cameras that are available nowadays allow you to switch between different FPS values (typically 120 and 240) before recording. Also, if you have access to an iPhone, its Camera app has a built-in SLO-MO mode that can capture the footage in slow motion.

In addition, if you already have a video that has been recorded at a normal speed, you can use an efficient post-production software like Wondershare Filmora 11, and exploit its Speed Ramping feature to add the slow-motion effect at different scenes of a clip.

## Part 1: How to Make Slow Motion Videos via Recording?

The fact is, the playback speed of a video is inversely proportional to the [frames per second](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) (FPS) it has been recorded in. Usually, to have a video play at normal speed, it is recorded at 24 FPS or 30 FPS. On the other hand, if you increase the frame rate (FPS) to 120 or 240, the playback speed slows down. You can easily check this if you have access to a DSLR camera or an iPhone. These devices allow you to adjust the FPS so the videos can be recorded in slow motion.

For your convenience and learning, the step-by-step procedure on how to record a video in slow motion using an iPhone is explained below:

**Step 1: Get to the SLO-MO Mode**
