Just ask a friend or family member to use your phone's rear camera to record your eye centered on the screen. Ensure that the eye is as close as possible and you don't lose focus.

![create a close-up eye video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/close-up-eye-video.gif)

##### Step 2 Add a freeze frame to the video

Next, we want to add a freeze frame to the section where the eye opens fully. To do that, select the second video track and place the playhead where the eye is fully open. After that, right-click the video track, then choose the **Add Freeze Frame** option.

![add a freeze frame to the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/eye-zoom-2.jpg)

Now trim the first video track from where the freeze frame starts on the second video. Also, cut the second video track to leave only the freeze frame

##### Step 3 Add a masking effect to the eye

With the two video tracks ready, it's time to apply a masking effect. Tap the **Effect** tab on the top menu bar and then find the **Shape Mask** under the utility section. Now drag and drop the effect to the freeze frame.

![add a masking effect to the eye](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/eye-zoom-3.jpg)

With that done, move the playhead to the start of the freeze frame video and double-click the video clip to launch the settings window. Click the **Animation** tab before clicking **Customize** to see the keyframe settings. Tap the **Add** button to add a keyframe. Then, add a few frames using the playhead before clicking Add.

**_Preparation:_**

First, you need to create a close-up eye video. Although you can do that with your digital camera, a standard smartphone should do it just fine. Just ask a friend or family member to use your phone's rear camera to record your eye centered on the screen. Ensure that the eye is as close as possible and you don't lose focus. The camera should be around 10cm away from your face. And lest I forget, the flash should be ON.

![create a close-up eye video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/close-up-eye-video.gif)

## How to Create an Eye-zoom Transition

##### Step 1 Align the video clips on Filmora

After recording a close-up eye video, add it on Wondershare Filmora and duplicate it. Alternatively, you can add the video to the first and second tracks.
