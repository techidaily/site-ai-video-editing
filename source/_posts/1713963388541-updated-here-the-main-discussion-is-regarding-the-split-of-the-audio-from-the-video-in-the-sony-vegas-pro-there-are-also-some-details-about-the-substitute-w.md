Whether creating animations, visual effects, or enhancing your video content, masking can be a valuable tool in your arsenal.

## Overview of Masking in After Effects

Masking in After Effects hides or reveals certain layer parts, such as an image or video. This is achieved through masks, paths that determine the visibility of specific layer parts. Masks are an incredibly versatile tool in Adobe After Effects, allowing users to cut out and combine elements, create professional transitions, isolate objects in photos or videos, and build shapes, among other things.

Masks in After Effects are made up of two parts: the mask and the fill. The mask controls what is visible, while the fill determines the color or image used to fill the masked area.

By default, when a mask is created, it is set to "inverted," meaning the masked area is visible, and the rest is hidden. However, this can easily be changed by pressing "M" to access the mask settings in the timeline and selecting the invert checkmark. Alternatively, the mode can be changed to subtract.

Overall, masks are an essential tool in After Effects, and it's worth taking the time to learn as much as possible about them. The possibilities are endless, and mastering masks can greatly enhance your projects.

04 [Alternative to Canva Color Match](#Part 4)

## Part 1 What is the Canva Color Picker?

Canva is one of the simplest and easiest ways of creating great and eye-catchy graphic designs. Color combinations help us to make these designs more attractive. But earlier, there were some limitations in Canva regarding the color picker tool; designers had to use browser extensions like ColorZilla to match the color combinations perfectly. They faced many problems while selecting the perfect color of their choice while designing their pins, social media content, logos, online invitations, etc. They had to find the perfect color code of their choice from an external source and paste it into the Canva, which was simply very time-consuming.

The most-awaited color picker tool was introduced in Canva at the end of November 202This new design tool makes the design very convenient while using Canva for graphic designing. With this tool, you don’t need to spend hours searching for the right color that matches the background. Color picker helps you to find a perfect color match according to the image, logo, or anything else uploaded on Canva.

![eyedropper tool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-perfectly-use-canva-color-match-2.jpg)

But before using this new **color match tool**, you must ensure that:

**●** You are using the updated version of the Canva desktop app.

**●** You have the latest version of the browsers like Chrome, Mozilla, Internet Explorer, etc.

## Part 2 Why Use the Color Match Tool?

![custom colors](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-perfectly-use-canva-color-match-3.jpg)

This **color match tool** is the most-demanded feature that has been updated on Canva. It helps choose the perfect color match very efficiently without wasting time and effort. It works like an eyedropper tool available in graphic designing software like Photoshop. It is elementary and valuable to use, and it saves a lot of time in creating attractive and wonderful designs.

It helps determine the different colors available in a particular image uploaded on the Canva app. You can easily choose the appropriate color by placing the tool in the place that has your desired color. It is a compassionate tool, so you should be very careful while choosing the color of your choice. You can press the ‘Esc’ button to exit the command without choosing any color.

This color match tool magically helps select the desired color in seconds without using any external color picker browser extension. This tool is readily available on the color pallet in the updated version of the Canva desktop app.

## Part 3 How to Use Color Match in Canva to Match Your Brand

The **color match tool** is now inbuilt in the Canva desktop app, which is very easy and convenient. You need to download the Canva desktop app to use this feature from the official website of Canva.

![canvas desktop tool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-perfectly-use-canva-color-match-4.jpg)

The designers need to follow the simple steps given below to use the **color match tool** (eyedropper tool) in the updated version of the Canva desktop app:

**●** First of all, open the Canva desktop app.

**●** After this, open any design or image of your choice that you want to edit. This **color match tool** can work on any type of image, regardless of the shape and size.

**●** Now, select the particular part of the image whose color you want to change.

**●** After this, click on the color block available at the top corner to open the color customization options.

**●** A color pallet will open.

**●** On the top of the color pallet, you will see a ‘+’ (add new color) button, this button has a colorful square outline.

**●** After this, a color chart will appear under that button. You will see the color code written over there and an eyedropper tool will be available next to that color code (hex code).

**●** Click on this eyedropper tool and select the color of your choice either from the image or any other color available in Canva.

**●** After selecting the color tap on the particular part of the image whose color you want to change.

This is how you can change the color using the new color picker tool available in Canva and enjoy editing your images using the new Canva desktop app.

The layouts in question are customizable, allowing you to control what your **music photo collages** look like in the end. You also have the choice of creating said collage with photos, videos, GIFs, and music

## 08 VEED.IO

Similar to KapWing, VEED.IO offers a video collage maker that comes with customizable layouts that you can use to easily create a **pic collage with music**. The program is of course also free to try (though certain elements are locked in the FREE version).

![VEED.IO - Video Collage Maker with Music](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/8-free-photo-collage-with-music-video-maker8.png)

## **●** Key Takeaways from This Episode **→**

**●** Collages are a fun way to preserve memories of a fun event with friends and families Traditionally, of course, photo collages were created with printed still images.

**●** Now, however, not only can you create a moving collage (with images, videos, GIFs, etc.) but you can even add music to it

**●** These types of **music photo collage**s are really fun to share with friends and family online. And, these days, there are even digital picture frames that will allow you to display them in your home (and yes, some of these picture frames do come with speakers for playing music)

It is definitely possible Usually, people use video collage makers for this reason. But you can also create an actual photo collage with music as well (no need to use actual video clips if you don’t want to.)

In the end, it all depends on the collage maker you’re using to be completely honest. In this case, the collage maker in question would have to have video editing functionalities advanced enough to allow you to create a video consisting of a picture collage with music Learn more about the different tools that you can check out below as we break down some of the best of the best available

## 01 **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**

The first of the video makers that we’re going to be introducing is called Filmora. This is a professional editor that’s equipped with just about everything you need for creating high-quality video content. That includes the things that you will need in order to create a **music photo collage**

For your reference, that means that you can use it to create a video showing off a picture collage with music. Usually by making use of the templates provided by the software and uploading your own images (although, in the newest version of Filmora, Filmora V11, there is a ‘Stock Media’ option that includes an endless supply of photographs, videos, music, etc. for adding to your content.)

For Win 7 or later (64-bit)

For macOS 10.12 or later

## 02 Canva

Canva is really more of a photo editor than anything else. But it has a timeline function that you can use for more advanced things. Which, in this case, would be creating a **picture collage with music**

Note, just like with Filmora, Canva is not an entirely FREE program. But it is free to try. And, just like Filmora, it comes with a stock media library that you can use as a resource for your projects (i.e., images, clip arts, etc.) Canva also comes with a Pro version that you can unlock if you want some of its more advanced features (highly recommended if you’re looking to create content for work or entrepreneurial reasons and not just for posting on social media. Especially since it will allow you to collaborate with others.)

![Canva - Make Photo Collage with Music (FREE)](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/8-free-photo-collage-with-music-video-maker2.png)

## 03 Express It

You can say that "Express It" is Adobe’s version of Canva. It is available as an online tool and as a **photo collage with music** **app** that you can use for your smartphone or tablet.

Much like with Canva, this program has a built-in stock media library that you can use for your projects. It’s also primarily FREE to use, although you’ll need to pay in order to unlock some of its more advanced resources. It comes with the usual layouts for creating quick templates, but it’s most prized for its ‘free-style’ mode, which will allow you to create a collage that looks exactly how you want it to look.

![Express It — Make a Photo Collage with Music App](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/8-free-photo-collage-with-music-video-maker3.png)

## 04 Smilebox

Smilebox is an automatic video collage maker that is capable of turning photographs into a video collage without much input from you It’s the tool to use if all you’re looking for is a quick solution. By that, we of course mean the solution of the ‘upload-and-then-download’ variety

It is also an online tool, so Sign-Up is required. But once you’re signed up, the only thing you really have to do is provide the images that you want to use for your **music photo collage**

![Smilebox - Create Pic Collage with Music](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/8-free-photo-collage-with-music-video-maker4.png)

## 05 Fotojet

Next is ‘Fotojet’, which is an online collage maker that is incredibly popular for those that are looking for an easy solution. It works pretty much how you expect a collage maker to work. You choose from a list of ‘collage layouts’, choose the images that you want to place in the layout that you’ve chosen, pick out your music, maybe decorate the pic collage a bit (for example, you can add text, clipart stickers, etc.) and then you’re done

Much like some of the programs on this list, Fotojet isn’t an entirely free **music photo collage** tool. However, a FREE trial is available if you want to try it out for a quick project or two.

![Fotojet - Music Photo Collage Tool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/8-free-photo-collage-with-music-video-maker5.png)

## 06 Vimeo

Video is a professional online photo editing tool that’s incredibly popular with entrepreneurs. It actually works very similarly with all the other tools that we’ve introduced so far. That means that it comes with templates that you can use in order to create projects, it also comes with a ‘resources’ library that you can take advantage of in order to fill up said projects

As for creating a **photo collage with music** by using this tool. You will need to sign up to start creating, but it’s FREE to try — with some elements locked under the premium version.
