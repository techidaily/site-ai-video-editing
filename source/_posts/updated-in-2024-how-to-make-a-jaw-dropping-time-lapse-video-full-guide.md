## Part 1: What is Time Lapse?

### 1\. Technical basics of Time Lapse Photography and Videography

Time-lapse is a specialized type of shot that can be achieved in-camera, through editing, or a combination of both. Time-lapse is a technique where frames are shot much slower than a normal rate (e.g., 24 frames per minute instead of per second).

Professional time-lapses are a series of raw photos even though they are sometimes perceived as videos. In a nutshell, a time-lapse is a short video that processes by revealing the evolution of a series of events, invisible to the eye.

The simplest and most useful formula is time per frame (TPF), multiplied by frames per second (FPS), multiplied by 60 seconds. Using this formula will tell you how long to record to end up with your desired time lapse length or “recording time” (RT). TPF x FPS x 60 = RT

### 2\. What is a Time-lapse video used for?

The use of time-lapse photography and video is an excellent storytelling technique since compelling stories are essential to effective marketing. A time-lapse can also offer excellent insight into the advancement of developmental projects.

#### **①** Scientific research

* Time-lapses may be utilized to spread the word about scientific investigations to a wide audience. You can use time-lapse photography to gain money by selling the material of interesting scientific investigations to documentary makers or instructional websites.
* Scientists can visualize processes that would be challenging or sometimes even impossible to study in real life, thanks to time-lapse photography

#### **②** Individual enjoyment

Time-lapses are also utilized by filmmakers for scenes requiring extended durations of time with little significant activity occurring during the shot (such as night slowly turning into day).

#### **③** **Commercial use**

* Time-lapse videos are a wonderful instrument for enhancing the perception of your brand because they are. As a result, many consumers find it interesting.
* Time-lapse videos are the epitome of the old saying that "good things come in small packages" for any brand.

### 3\. How to Make a Time-lapse video?

## Part 2: Record or Shoot Your Time-Lapse Video

### 1\. Select Your Subject

The best way to create a time-lapse video is to pick your subject very carefully. Movement is the most crucial factor to consider while selecting a time-lapse subject. Any movement—whether it be caused by people, animals, vehicles, water, clouds, or anything else—can create an exciting and captivating time-lapse.

* Capturing the traffic movement
* Ice melting

### 2\. Prepare Right Equipment

Choose your equipment before heading out to capture time lapses. There are several options available for time-lapse cameras and applications, ranging from basic and affordable to sophisticated and pricy.

#### **①** **Camera**

You cannot make a time-lapse without owning a camera, whether it is a mobile phone, a compact, or a DSLR. The quality of the final result will be as good as the quality of the equipment you use.

**\- Smartphone camera apps (iPhone/Android)**

All good smartphones now possess a built-in camera with good optical quality, for example: recently Apple Company launched its new iPhone 14 with a magnificent 48-megapixel camera. By using such cameras we have been able to produce really good pictures, although not in negative conditions, such as those with low-light, etc.

For apple: use IguanaLapse or TimeLapse to create your great time-lapses

The best action cameras for creating time-lapses include GoPro Hero11 Black, Insta360 ONE RS Twin Edition, DJI Action 2, DJI Pocket 2, and GoPro Hero9 Black.

This is the best choice in terms of cost/benefit: it produces excellent results and high image quality. The best and top-rated DSLRs for creating terrific time-lapses include Nikon D850, Canon 80D, Canon EOS 90D, Sony A7 III, and others.

#### **②** Tripod/Gimbal/other stabilizers

Owning a solid and stable tripod is essential for the success of a time-lapse video. A good tripod will support the load without any problems and will keep the arsenal stable for the duration of the shooting session.

#### **③** Intervalometer/other camera shutter triggers

An intervalometer is a small device able to trigger the shutter of your camera every ‘n’ second, ‘n’ times (also infinite). It can be external, or as we saw earlier, integrated into the camera.

## Twitch Green Screen Guide

Green screens are a fun way for creators to bring their personality to their stream, allowing them to dynamically alter their stream background and make their content appear even more engaging and polished. With Twitch green screen background, you can easily configure Chroma key settings and detect your green screen with a single click.

## Conclusion

You probably already have an idea of how to use a green screen, at least in principle. You film something or someone in front of a colored background — the green screen — then you replace everything that’s in the color of the screen with other footage, images, charts, presentations, or whatever visuals you want. However, Chroma keying a live stream works almost the same way. The main difference is that you have to replace the green screen as you’re filming, rather than during editing.

## Conclusion

You probably already have an idea of how to use a green screen, at least in principle. You film something or someone in front of a colored background — the green screen — then you replace everything that’s in the color of the screen with other footage, images, charts, presentations, or whatever visuals you want. However, Chroma keying a live stream works almost the same way. The main difference is that you have to replace the green screen as you’re filming, rather than during editing.
