## Videos Look Better when Edited Professionally. If You’re Looking to Edit Recorded Video with a Pro-Level Editing Then We’ve Got You Covered. Learn About Editing Recorded Videos with the Best Toolkit Here

The most critical component of post-production for a video marketer is editing. Your video will seem unfinished and repel your viewers if you cannot effortlessly weave your images together or get your cut to reach the proper frame. Learning to edit a video may soon become a never-ending task. While each project you work on will have somewhat different editing needs, the principles of video editing remain basically the same. You don't need to spend a lot on costly equipment to have a professional appearance; if you pay attention to a few important things, you can produce excellent movies with whatever you have right now.

Content producers, entrepreneurs, and influencers can have much too much material to include into a single YouTube video. You may not be able to buy video editing software if you're on a tight budget. So, what does a video marketer do if they don't have editing software? To assist you with the process of video editing, we've put up this thorough tutorial that covers everything you'll need to know to make stunning films, even if you've never done it before. We'll also demonstrate how to utilize the super-intuitive and user-friendly editor to create a video.

## **Part 1\. Edit Recorded Video in OBS**

OBS is a video streaming and recording application. It's open source, free, and works on Macs, Windows, and Linux. It is a strong and adaptable screencast video creation tool when paired with competent audio and video editing tools. Unfortunately, OBS doesn’t support editing feature and hence, we’re enlisting the recording steps so you can edit them by using a third-party toolkit mentioned in the guide.

**Step 1\. Download and Install OBS**

Install OBS according to the instructions for your operating system by downloading it from the link below.

**Step 2\. Setup Screen Recording**

The window is divided into separate parts called "docks" when you initially launch the app. Every dock has a distinct function. Scenes, Sources, Mixer, and Controls are the areas to pay attention to. OBS employs a Scenes and Sources system, which will be discussed in more depth in a later lesson. These two tools operate in tandem to help you keep track of your video, audio, and other production materials. When you first start OBS, you'll see that a scene is already loaded, which you can locate in the bottom left corner of the interface.

![obs setup screen recording](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-setup-screen-recording.jpg)

You'll also need to add a source to this scene before you can begin recording. Click the Add button at the bottom of the Sources panel, then pick Screen Capture on Linux or Display Capture on Mac and Windows with the default Scene chosen (it will be highlighted).

**Step 3\. Customize the Recording Source**

You'll need to create a new source before you can begin recording your desktop screen. Select "Display Capture" by clicking the "+" icon on the Sources dock. You will be prompted to name the Display source in a popup window. Click "OK". At the bottom right of the screen, click the Settings icon. Take note of the Recording Path field under the Output tab. This is where your recorded video will be kept on your computer.

![obs customize the recording source](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-customize-the-recording-source.jpg)

**Step 4\. Start/Stop Recording**

You'll be able to choose the computer screen display you wish to capture in the following window. If you just have one monitor, make that the default. OBS Studios should show you the screen in the window after a valid display has been chosen. We need to change your graphics settings if OBS is unable to successfully load the screen video. Click the Start Recording button in the bottom right corner when you're ready to begin recording. When you're finished, click Stop Recording, and a movie will be saved to the folder you chose in the preferences.

![obs start stop recording](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-start-stop-recording.jpg)

## **Part 2\. Edit Recorded Video in Filmora**

Wondershare Filmora is a powerful screen recording application that includes a video editing suite, screen sketching tools, AI face recognition, built-in video effect packs, customizable branding watermark, and more.

## Part 8\. Share and promote your video podcast

Most people think the final phase of making a video podcast is uploading to a video platform, but you still have to share and promote your content on different platforms. Nevertheless, it will help get the podcast to a wide range of audiences.

Thankfully, a video podcast allows you to upload a short clip of your show to different social media platforms like Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, etc. With this, your show will become more accessible across various platforms, thus increasing your show's engagement. Honestly, it's a win-win!

## The Bottom Line

There you have it! Just like that, you're ready to be a part of the top-rated video podcasters you can ever think of. With all that's discussed in the article, we believe you can now focus on creating valuable and engaging content for your audience.

However, as you start to record video podcasts, we advise you to invest in the right marketing tools to help you gain more attraction in the industry.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

Your podcast gear setup isn't complete without video podcast software. Yes, this one is also essential, as it's required for performing podcast recording editing to spice up your videos. Wondershare Filmora is an ideal choice for anyone to edit podcast content with high quality!

## Part 3\. Build your set

Besides having a good quality camera and other podcast gear mentioned above, it's also crucial to make your set look gorgeous. It makes your video podcast look more professional. Below are ideas for some techniques you can employ.

### 1\. Depth & lighting

To make a professional-looking video podcast, you need to add as much depth as possible. So yes, there should be enough distance between you and the background (don't be too close or too far). However, if this is impossible because you have a small space, good lighting should spice things up. Godox SL -150 is one perfect choice that you can opt for.

### 2\. Make your background interesting

Your background shouldn't just be left alone. It would be best to put up some fascinating stuff that will blend with the podcast's theme and make the video look more admirable. For example, if your podcast discusses relationships, you should have a background that suits the topic.

### 3\. Declutter

It's never a good idea to leave unnecessary items in the background because that makes it look messy. Also, it may compromise everything you've done to spice it up. So, after you finish putting up an exciting background, take a few minutes to inspect the lighting, the elements, and lots more. Then, ensure it's clean and tidy.

## Part 4\. Create a collaborative doc

Creating a collaborative doc is also essential for making a podcast. You might ask: "what is a collaborative doc?" Well, it's where you jot down information on the following;

* **Niche or Topic**
* **Brand name**
* **Format for the Show and each of the Episodes**
* **Intro and Outro Music**
* **Create a Cover Art**
* **Ideas to record the first podcast**

## Part 5\. Create your show

Now that you have a perfect plan and setup, the next thing is to start the show. But first, what format have you chosen for your first show? Is it the static image recording? The remote interview recording? The in-studio recording? or interview & b-roll recording? Not sure of which format to start with? Worry less. We'll walk you through the steps of the process for each process. Just keep reading;

### Method 1: Static Image Podcast Recording

![static image podcast recording](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-video-podcast-8.jpg)

You need video editing software to create this kind of video podcast - Filmora is a perfect choice. However, keep in mind that this kind of video podcast is usually less engaging, only that you'll be able to publish it on various video platforms.

**Equipment Required:**

* Video editor - Filmora
