## How to Zoom in Discord

Discord is the most popular platform for communication among gaming communities and even YouTubers. Discord allows users to send text, voice, and video messages. Most importantly, Discord is available for computer users, smartphone users as well as online browser users. There are times when you may need to zoom in on Discord for better readability of messages. There are different ways on how to zoom in Discord.

There could also be a scenario where you have excessive zoom in effect, and you need to zoom out for better readability. Similarly, if you have pressed the wrong shortcuts accidentally and the screen on Discord has zoomed in, you have to zoom out to bring the screen to its original state. We will illustrate how to zoom out in Discord as well for computer, smartphone, and online users.

## Part 1: How to Zoom Discord on Computer

Since Discord is mostly popular among gamers, Discord desktop app is the most widely used. If you want to zoom in on Discord desktop app, you should know that the zoom option is not readily available under any menu, and there is no keyboard shortcut you can press to zoom in and zoom out instantly. Instead, here are the steps on how to zoom in on Discord.

Step1Launch Discord desktop app on your computer. Click on the Gear icon located at the bottom left corner by the side of your username.

Step2Once Settings window opens, go to App Settings section from the left side and click on Appearance option.

Step3On the right section, scroll down, and you will find three options for zooming – Chat font scaling, Space between message groups, and Zoom level.

Step4According to your requirements, you can move the slider to the right to zoom in on Discord. You can also press Ctrl and “+” keys together to zoom in. Press Ctrl and “-“ keys together to zoom out. If you want to reset the changes, press Ctrl and O keys together.

Step5Once you are satisfied with the level of zooming, press Esc key on your keyboard to save the changes.

## Part 2: How to Zoom Discord Online
