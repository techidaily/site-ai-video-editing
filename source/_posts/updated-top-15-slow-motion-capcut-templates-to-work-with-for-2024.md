Chroma keying has become quite popular lately. People utilize it not simply for gaming, but also in Zoom conferences, live interviews, talk shows, etc. Although it may appear hard, at first sight, setting up Chroma Key in OBS Studio is quite straightforward. Let’s look at the easy steps you need to follow to set up a green screen in OBS.

### Steps to Add Green Screen with OBS

****Step 1:** Install and open OBS. From your main screen, hit the “Plus” symbol situated beneath the sources box. Foremost things first, you need a green screen. If you already have one, skip this step and proceed.

A green screen is merely a backdrop of one single brilliant hue that may be taken off in post-processing. It offers a ‘canvas’ on which a topic may perform and will subsequently display with a translucent backdrop. Add it simply via your webcam.

****Step 2:** Select “Video Capture Device from the available choices and then select the Filter as shown below. Name is anything you would want to keep track of your sources. Chroma keying is a visual effects method that eliminates a color backdrop from still or moving pictures and is also included as a filter in OBS.

****Step 3**: If your camera is installed, it should auto-populate in the forms. If it doesn’t, or you have many cameras, choose the relevant camera manually. Select the color of your screen, then change the similarity and smoothness bars until you settle on the parameters you require. Adjustments will vary from person to person based on light, green screen quality, and the distance you are from the screen.

****Step 4:** Ensure that the Video Capture Device is at the top of the Window capture scene. Use the up-down arrow to move it in the Source area after highlighting it. This will place the Video Capture Device scene at the top Save your settings when you’re done. You should be ready to start streaming.

You may also download films and distribute them immediately on social media or email. It provides more than simply a live streaming green screen software tool like OBS Studio. This program is more of a professional-grade green screen recorder and video editor, for both Mac and Windows platforms. Here we propose Filmora.

## Conclusion

The usage of chroma keying has been increasingly popular in recent years, with various uses of this video effect employed for live streaming. Chroma keying is used to erase the backdrop of a video clip which is then composited over another scene or picture. The most apparent usage of this technology is for weather broadcasts when the presenter is composited over the top of a weather radar picture. In more recent times we’re seeing video game broadcasters chroma keying themselves into their live feeds. There are various sites to explore for streaming backdrops. Most come as overlay packages with distinct themes. A good location to look is Filmora. Else, if you want to add a new backdrop to your broadcast, you may simply add a new picture source to your scene in OBS. So, check out what best fits you and opt for the one.
