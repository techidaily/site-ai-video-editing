If you want people to see your videos when they search for certain phrases, those keywords should be in the title because Google and YouTube can't watch videos and grasp the content (yet).

**2\. Perfectly Match the Content**

A excellent video title explains to viewers what to anticipate from the video. It's unambiguous, straightforward, and sincere.

## Part 2\. Tips to Create Video Titles

Whether you've been video marketing for years or are just starting out, coming up with catchy video titles might be the most difficult aspect of the process.

If you want people to see your videos when they search for certain phrases, those keywords should be in the title because Google and YouTube can't watch videos and grasp the content (yet).

**2\. Perfectly Match the Content**

A excellent video title explains to viewers what to anticipate from the video. It's unambiguous, straightforward, and sincere. Additionally, if you are familiar with your target demographic, you will be able to generate a lot more hits to your videos.

Keep in mind that your goal is not to deceive viewers into viewing your video.
