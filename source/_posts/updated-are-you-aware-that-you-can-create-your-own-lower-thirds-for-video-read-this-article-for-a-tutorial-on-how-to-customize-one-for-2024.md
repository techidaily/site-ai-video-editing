## Are You Aware that You Can Create Your Own Lower Thirds for Video? Read This Article for a Tutorial on How to Customize One

As a video creator, there are times when you need to use Lower Thirds. Although many lower-third presets are available, making unique and personalized ones can ensure your video stands out.

So, to empower your inner video creator, this article will show you how to make your own Lower Thirds in Filmora.

## Part 1: What is Lower Third

A Lower Third is a mix of motion graphic design and texts that are placed in the lower area of the screen. It provides additional information, such as a person's name or other relevant information, without distracting the audience from the main content.

Lower Thirds can be used in various settings, such as news broadcasts or interviews, to help provide viewers with additional context.

## Part 2: How to Make Your Own Lower Thirds in [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

### (1) A simple line and texts

![a simple line and texts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-1.gif)

##### Step1 Create a simple line

Go to the **Media library > Sample Media folder > choose a color sample**. For this tutorial, we will select the white color. Then, drag and drop this sample color onto the upper video track.

![create a simple line](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-2.jpg)

Double-click the white sample clip to open the settings and scale it to 30%. Then, reposition the white bar to your desired place.

![double-click the white sample clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-3.gif)

##### Step2 Mask the white sample

Since we want to create a thin horizontal shape, you need to make some adjustments to the white sample by using an image mask. So, go to the **Effect window > Utility > Image Mask**. Then, drag and drop the “Image Mask” onto the white color sample.

![mask the white sample](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-4.gif)

After that, double-click the white sample on the timeline and find the Image Mask setting. Choose the shape that works best for your needs. For this tutorial, we are going to use this one. Then, adjust the X and Y-axis scale numbers until it becomes a thin white line. Click OK.

![double-click the white sample](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-5.jpg)

##### Step3 Add a text for your lower thirds

Go to **Titles > Plain Text > Basic 6** and drop it onto the second video track above the white line clip. Don't worry about the exact position yet. We can adjust it later.

![add a text for your lower thirds](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-6.jpg)

Double-click on the text clip to open the settings, then type some text there and adjust the size and font.

![double-click on the text clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-7.jpg)

##### Step4 Add animation to the text

Click **Advanced > Animation > Up Down 1** animation. Adjust the animation length by dragging the two brackets on the timeline on the right side. Click Ok.

![add animation to the text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-8.jpg)

##### Step5 Add keyframes to the white line clip when entering

Double-click on the white line clip on the timeline to show the animation keyframe setting window. Then, playback the animation of the text, find a position before the text animation starts and move the play head there. Make sure it is close enough to when the texts show up so the white line enters the keyframe right before the text enters.

![add keyframes to the white line clip when entering](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-9.gif)

Click to add a keyframe, double-check to make sure it is the final position you want, and the opacity should be 100 at this point.

After that, move the play head to the left for a few frames and click add again. To make sure the white line is out of the frame before entering, you need to change the Y-axis number. Change the opacity to 0 as the white line starts in transparent color.

![move the play head to the left](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-10.gif)

These two keyframes will create an effect of the line entering the frame while turning from transparent to white. Playback the animation and adjust the keyframes marks by dragging them to the left or right until you feel the timing looks good.

##### Step6 Add keyframes to the white line clip when exiting

Playback again to find where the texts disappear, then move the play head to a position after it. Also, make sure it's close enough to where the texts disappear so you can ensure the white line exits right after the texts disappear. Then, add the keyframe.

![add keyframes to the white line clip when exiting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-11.gif)

You don't need to change the setting this time because this keyframe is used to keep the position and opacity unchanged.

Instead, move the play head again to the right for a few frames and add another keyframe. Move the texts out of the frame by changing the y-axis number, then change the opacity to 0\. This keyframe is used to create the white line animation exiting the frame and turning back to transparent in the meantime.

![move the texts out of the frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-12.gif)

Playback the video and see how it looks.

### (2) A name card with a solid background

![a name card with a solid background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-13.gif)

Sometimes you might want to create a name card with a solid background like the sample above. To create it, we can use the same method. Here's how to do it:

##### Step1 Make the lower third background

Select the white color sample from the sample color folder and drop it onto the upper video track of the video.

![make the lower third background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-14.jpg)

Change the scale to 30%, then reposition the white sample to your desired place. Click OK.

![change the scale to 30%](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-15.gif)

##### Step2 Create an image mask for the lower third background

Drag and drop the Image Mask onto the white sample clip on the timeline.

![create an image mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-16.gif)

Double-click on the white sample clip to activate the video setting window and find the Image Mask settings. Then, choose the mask shape you need. You can also adjust its size by changing the X or Y-axis.

![double-click on the white sample clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-17.jpg)

##### Step3 Add some text

Once the background card is in place, go to Titles > Plain Text > ‘Basic 6' and drop it onto the third video track.

![go to titles](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-18.jpg)

Now, type in the texts as needed. Reposition and scale the texts to make sure they are on top of the background shape.

![type in the texts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-19.jpg)

##### Step4 Add animation to the text

Click Advanced > Animation > Push. Then, adjust the animation length accordingly. Click Ok.

![click advanced](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-20.jpg)

Double-click on the background clip to show the animation tab setting. Then, playback the text animation and find a position earlier than the start and add a keyframe.

![double-click on the background clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-21.jpg)

Similar to the tutorial before, move the play head again a few frames earlier to the left and add another keyframe. If you want to have the name card flying in from the left while expanding, you can change the X-axis and scale of the background card to 0\. Change the opacity to 0 to create a color change from transparent to white.

![move the play head again](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-22.gif)

To let the background card exit the frame, add two more keyframes to the background card. Add a keyframe with no changes to settings. Move the play head to the right for a few frames and add another keyframe.

![add two more keyframes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-23.gif)

If you want the name card to exit to the bottom, change the Y-axis number until it exits. Change the scale and opacity to 0\. Then, playback and adjust the keyframes.

Finally, you can add a Subscribe button from the new default Filmora element pack “Social Media.”

![add a subscribe button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-24.jpg)

## How to Add Miniature Effect in Video with Filmora

Want to add selective blur to make everything look smaller? Don't have any idea how to focus on specific mini-things? Then don't worry! In this article, you'll get a step-by-step process to add miniature effects to your video. At the end of the process, you'll have cinematic shots. Then start with us now! Scroll more to get pro tips!

## What Is a Miniature Effect?

![after adding a miniature effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-1.jpg)

But first, let's learn the logic of making the miniature effect. As many video editing pros present on Tiktok, the miniature effect is a fun way to brighten up your photography or video shots. For example, when taking a video or a time-lapse of a landscape, we always have a bigger depth of field, so most objects in the frame are in focus.

However, when we film a miniature model, the depth of field is shallow. So, we only see some objects in focus, and the rest is blurry. This visual trick makes our brain believe that the big landscape we're seeing is actually a tiny model.

![a miniature effect for landscape](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-2.jpg)

To create a miniature look, we can use specific effects to fake a shallow depth of field, and then the landscape view will look like a tiny model. While some keys to notice before making the miniature effect are:

* It utilizes **selective blur** to make things appear like **small**
* The miniature effect works best for footage filmed from **a high angle**.
* The tiny effect is usually used in **drone footage, time lapses**, or **landscape photography**.

Are you all set to add miniature effects to your video and make film-like shots? Then scroll more and get the step-by-step process.

## How to Make a Miniature effect?

You are excited to add a miniature effect, and enjoy the rest! Without any further delay, follow the below instructions and get results!

##### Step1 Download the Wondershare Filmora

* First of all, you have to download the [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).
* It's packed with new features and effects plugins that make editing more filmy and fun!

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** filmora has a unique **"stock media"** option that enables us to use all these elements and more to boost our videos!

##### Step2 Choose any stock footage

If you don't have good-quality footage, but want to boost your video, here is how. You can get the miniature effect without a big format view camera or specialized lens.

* Open Filmora and select any stock footage in Wondershare Filmora.

![choose stock footage from stock media in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-3.jpg)

Move to the **stock media** folder on the above bar in the Wondershare Filmora. Or you can look towards the left window, where you will see the sample **videos tab.**

* Click on the sample videos tab, and a new **window** will appear on the library screen.

Here you will see almost more than **20 videos.** So, instead of using the actual recorded footage, we'll make do with what we have by **default**. After selecting and adding the stock footage of your choice. Then you have to follow the below process:

* First, hold the Stock Footage as shown in the folder section.
* Then **Drag and Drop** it to the timeline section for further editing.

![add stock video in the timeline in wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-4.gif)

**Who will get Stock Media?**

Want to get stock media? You can only have access to the stock media library if you already buy the license of Wondershare Filmora.

* The **latest version** has an unlimited stock library.
* After purchasing any plan, you can access **Stock Media** (Unsplash, Giphy, Pixabay, Pixel).

##### Step3 Head to the effect panel

As we are working on miniature effects, what do we need first? First, we ensure that we have a **Blur** effect on the video.

![search for the blur effect on effect panel in wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-5.gif)

To add a blur effect from the panel, follow the below-mentioned steps:

* First of all, move toward the above tabs.
* Then click on the 5th section, which is **Effect**
* After selecting the effect tab, a new window will **pop up**.
* In this section, we have **500+** different effects.
* Then, **click** on the search bar.
* **Search** for the Blur effect.
* After that, click on the **Blur 2**
* Then **Download** this effect if you haven't done this already.

##### Step4 Add the blur effect to the video

After selecting and downloading the blur effect, it's time to add it to the video. Again, see how precise it turned out. To add effect, follow below steps:

* **First, drag** and **Drop** the effect toward the timeline.
* Then, make sure to release the effect on the video to give it a lens blur appearance.

![add effect on the video in wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-6.gif)

##### Step5 Add the effect multiple times

Want to get an ideal blur level? If you need more blur level in your video and make it more cinematic, then follow the below steps:

* First, ensure that the **opacity** of the blur effect is 100%.
* Then, if you still want more blurriness, add **Blur 2** effect multiple times on the video.
* Finally, add effect by just the **Drag and Drop**

![add blur effect in video multiple times](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-7.gif)

##### Step6 Drop the same video clip

* Add the same video clip 2nd time on the timeline.
* Add it by just the **Drag and Drop**
* Make sure you add it to 2nd video track in the timeline above the first one.

![add the same video for 2nd time on the timeline in wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-8.gif)

##### Step7 Add masks on the Video

Now, it's time to select a specific video portion and add a mask. Due to this, we will have a selective blur portion. For this, follow the below guidelines:

* **Double-click** on the video present in 2nd track.
* The settings tab will be open in the top left section.
* Then find the **Mask** section and click on it.
* After this, **click** on the **Double-line**.
* Set the mask on video according to your style and choice.

![add mask to the video on wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-9.gif)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** you can adjust the mask size and position by rotating and changing its shape.

Watch the rotating and adjusting actions as shown below!

![rotation of mask in wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-10.gif)

For example, when we add a mask in the below time-lapse video, follow the above mask adjustments. Unfortunately, we can't get good results. Therefore, we will apply another way to add a mask by changing shape and position. Follow the instructions for modifications:

![blur the object near to camera and focus on the distant object](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-11.gif)

* Make a building or any object **Blurry** near the camera because it is not present within the depth of field.
* While the **object is far** from the camera, it is focused because it is in the depth of the field.
* Then adjust the mask, as per your choice.

Want to change the shape of the mask? Then follow the below steps:

![changing the mask of video on wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-12.gif)

* Double-click on the video present in 2nd video track.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** make sure you are masking the same extent and excluding the object you want to be out of focus.

Now, it's time to mask the whole object, which is far, but we want to make it in focus! For this, follow these steps:

* Add the same stock video clip a **third time** on the third video track of the timeline.
* Then add a mask in a **Rectangle** shape on the building.
* Don't **blur** the edge of this mask.

![mask the object far from the camera for the main focus](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-13.gif)

##### Step8 Final Look

You are excited now to see the final look of your miniature effect! Finally, it's in front of you! Just modify it more if you want to make it more precise.

![final look of miniature effect on wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-14.gif)

##### Step2 Choose any stock footage

If you don't have good-quality footage, but want to boost your video, here is how. You can get the miniature effect without a big format view camera or specialized lens.

* Open Filmora and select any stock footage in Wondershare Filmora.

![choose stock footage from stock media in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-3.jpg)

Move to the **stock media** folder on the above bar in the Wondershare Filmora. Or you can look towards the left window, where you will see the sample **videos tab.**

* Click on the sample videos tab, and a new **window** will appear on the library screen.

Here you will see almost more than **20 videos.** So, instead of using the actual recorded footage, we'll make do with what we have by **default**. After selecting and adding the stock footage of your choice. Then you have to follow the below process:

* First, hold the Stock Footage as shown in the folder section.
* Then **Drag and Drop** it to the timeline section for further editing.

![add stock video in the timeline in wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-4.gif)

**Who will get Stock Media?**

Want to get stock media? You can only have access to the stock media library if you already buy the license of Wondershare Filmora.

* The **latest version** has an unlimited stock library.
* After purchasing any plan, you can access **Stock Media** (Unsplash, Giphy, Pixabay, Pixel).

##### Step3 Head to the effect panel

As we are working on miniature effects, what do we need first? First, we ensure that we have a **Blur** effect on the video.

![search for the blur effect on effect panel in wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-5.gif)

To add a blur effect from the panel, follow the below-mentioned steps:

* First of all, move toward the above tabs.
* Then click on the 5th section, which is **Effect**
* After selecting the effect tab, a new window will **pop up**.
* In this section, we have **500+** different effects.
* Then, **click** on the search bar.
* **Search** for the Blur effect.
* After that, click on the **Blur 2**
* Then **Download** this effect if you haven't done this already.

##### Step4 Add the blur effect to the video

After selecting and downloading the blur effect, it's time to add it to the video. Again, see how precise it turned out. To add effect, follow below steps:

* **First, drag** and **Drop** the effect toward the timeline.
* Then, make sure to release the effect on the video to give it a lens blur appearance.

![add effect on the video in wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-6.gif)

##### Step5 Add the effect multiple times

Want to get an ideal blur level? If you need more blur level in your video and make it more cinematic, then follow the below steps:

* First, ensure that the **opacity** of the blur effect is 100%.
* Then, if you still want more blurriness, add **Blur 2** effect multiple times on the video.
* Finally, add effect by just the **Drag and Drop**

![add blur effect in video multiple times](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-7.gif)

##### Step6 Drop the same video clip

* Add the same video clip 2nd time on the timeline.
* Add it by just the **Drag and Drop**
* Make sure you add it to 2nd video track in the timeline above the first one.

![add the same video for 2nd time on the timeline in wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-8.gif)

##### Step7 Add masks on the Video

Now, it's time to select a specific video portion and add a mask. Due to this, we will have a selective blur portion. For this, follow the below guidelines:

* **Double-click** on the video present in 2nd track.
* The settings tab will be open in the top left section.
* Then find the **Mask** section and click on it.
* After this, **click** on the **Double-line**.
* Set the mask on video according to your style and choice.

![add mask to the video on wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-9.gif)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** you can adjust the mask size and position by rotating and changing its shape.

Watch the rotating and adjusting actions as shown below!

![rotation of mask in wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-10.gif)

For example, when we add a mask in the below time-lapse video, follow the above mask adjustments. Unfortunately, we can't get good results. Therefore, we will apply another way to add a mask by changing shape and position. Follow the instructions for modifications:

![blur the object near to camera and focus on the distant object](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-11.gif)

* Make a building or any object **Blurry** near the camera because it is not present within the depth of field.
* While the **object is far** from the camera, it is focused because it is in the depth of the field.
* Then adjust the mask, as per your choice.

Want to change the shape of the mask? Then follow the below steps:

![changing the mask of video on wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/miniature-effect-12.gif)

* Double-click on the video present in 2nd video track.
* **Settings** will activate on the top left side.
* Then click on the **Mask** tab to open it.
* Select the **Rectangular** mask from the list and apply it.

## Change Video Speed with FFmpeg

Have you ever wanted to speed up or slow down a video? Maybe it was too long, or you wanted to draw out an exciting part of the video without having to watch the boring parts.

In this article, we will be showing you how to use FFmpeg to speed up and slow down your videos using CLI. You'll also find some other useful FFmpeg commands that you can use on your videos.

Finally, we will explain how to automate these commands so that you can run them on all your videos with ease.

![how to automate these commands](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-speed-ffmeg-1.jpg)

## Part 1\. [What is FFmpeg?](https://ffmpeg.org/about.html)

FFmpeg is a free and open-source cross-platform software project that can record, convert, and stream audio and video. It was developed by Fabrice Bellard in 2000\. It has since become one of the most popular tools for transcoding media content on Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, Windows NT, and more.

One of its lesser-known capabilities is to speed up or slow down videos in just about any design you can think of — with either the audio or the video synced to the other if desired.

### [Uses of FFmpeg](https://ottverse.com/what-is-ffmpeg-installation-use-cases/)

FFMPEG is a command-line tool that can manipulate and transcode video files. Its uses are as follows:

* FFmpeg can create, trim, join or separate video clips on the fly and encode them into formats including MPEG, VOB, M2TS, TS, RMVB, or AVI.
* It can be used for Video processing, Video packaging support, Video compression, Audio, and Video container support, FFplay, and FFprobe.
* It also has extensive options for altering the look of an image in just about any way imaginable. Whether you want to change the brightness, hue, saturation, or perform multiple operations like subsampling (resizing) without reducing quality—the list goes on!

You could think of it as the Swiss army knife for video manipulation tasks. The interface might seem intimidating at first, but once you get the hang of it, all commands are broken down into simple English phrases.

The most important thing to know before getting started with this is how to use FFmpeg's -i and -v flags for input and output, respectively. To apply effects like slow motion playback or fast motion playback, use these flags in tandem with one another when specifying which file should be edited.

### Benefits and Disadvantages of FFmpeg

FFmpeg has many benefits over other video editing software because it is free and open source, meaning that you have access to the code so that you can modify it if needed. Thus, it's a better option when compared to other video editing software such as Avidemux, QuickTime Pro 7, and Adobe Premiere Elements 12\. Some of these benefits include:

* Being able to edit videos on multiple platforms (Windows, Mac OS X);
* FFmpeg has features to speed up and slow down video;
* Being able to convert from one format into another seamlessly;
* An extensive amount of features are at your disposal.

Some of the drawbacks are that some settings are not configurable, like with YouTube's built-in editor. The main disadvantage, though, would be the lengthiness of the program's installation process: not only do you need to download FFmpeg itself but also three external libraries like libx264, libmp3lame, and libfaac; then you must compile all six packages before the installation completes. Luckily this process doesn't take very long.

Another possible disadvantage is the time required for downloading the various resources since they may not be readily available on standard file hosting sites such as Mediafire or Dropbox (though they can be found through third-party websites). If you're looking for something more robust than Windows Movie Maker or iMovie, we recommend checking out FFmpeg.

## Part 2\. How to Speed Up a Video in FFmpeg?

FFmpeg can be used to speed up videos. It's not the only option, but it's one of the most common ways to make your videos faster. If you want your video to be faster, then FFmpeg is the right tool for the job. Some speed-up features include: FFmpeg speed up video and audio, ffmpeg speed up video mp4, ffmpeg change video speed, and so on.

### The Ultimate Step-by-Step Guide to speed up a video in FFmpeg

The presentation timestamp (PTS) of each video frame can be modified to alter the pace of a video stream.

Step1 Open a terminal and type in FFmpeg. This will open the program.

![open the program](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-speed-ffmeg-2.png)

Step2 Drag and drop the video file onto the window.

Step3 This is accomplished with the command -filter:v "setpts=."

Step4 According to the documentation, fast motion requires: -filter:v setpts=0.5\*PTS.

![fast motion requires](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-speed-ffmeg-3.png)

Step5 Click Enter.

![click enter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-speed-ffmeg-4.png)

Step6 The result would be a sped-up version of your video.

### Major approaches to speed up a video in Filmora

As we know that Filmora has the option to change the speed of a video, so let's find out step-by-step how to do that; you can also watch this [Tutorial on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w6CEhFHnII):

### Method 1: Use the 'Fast' or 'Slow' option to change the speed

Just as simple as the heading is, this option is pretty straightforward, but you cannot decide how much speed you want to add to your video or how slow you want it to be.

### Method 2: Changing Uniform Speed in Wondershare Filmora

You need to check your video's FPS and import your clip first.

Pick your preferred video. Go to the menu and select "Download." After hitting the "Plus" button, you may maintain the video's quality by choosing "Match to Media."

![go to the menu](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/change-video-speed-2.PNG)

After the movie has loaded, you have two options: double-clicking the clip or selecting the speed option provided below the screen.

![double clicking the clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/change-video-speed-3.PNG)

A window appears when we double-click the chosen video. We shall navigate to the "SPEED" section beneath this window. Additional "Uniform Speed" and "Speed Ramping" panels may be found on this speed panel. We shall operate within the uniform speed panel to alter the video's tempo consistently. A slider is provided for us to adjust the movie's pacing.

The general speed of the film is continually increased or decreased when we choose the option for constant pace. If we choose the speed option on the screen, it gives us a built-in range of numbers that we can use to change the video's pace in addition to presets like rapid and regular slow.

![rapid and regular slow](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/change-video-speed-4.PNG)

Once we click "OK," the video's tempo adjusts automatically.

### Method 3: Adjusting the Fast/Slow motion to fit your movie using the Speed Ramping option

To set up the speed ramping feature for your video, double-clicking the video will give us access to the "SPEED RAMPING" option in the speed panel. When we select the speed ramping option, we see a range of graphs. Each graph shows a number of tempo variations that we may use in our movie.

For Instance, when we select the "MONTAGE" preset, the video's tempo changes based on how many keyframes we choose and at what rate. As previously stated, as the graph rises above one and falls below one, the movie's tempo will slow down, increasing its regular speed.

![increasing its regular speed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/change-video-speed-8.PNG)

Moving these keyframes higher will make the video go more quickly, while moving them downward will make the movie move more slowly. We may also add more keyframes by using the add button up top, as seen in the image. When satisfied with our results, we will produce the video after pressing the "OK" button.

Watch this video and know more about speed ramping.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the first thing you can do to speed up your video is to use FFmpeg. The FFmpeg project is a community-driven, non-profit collaborative project to develop and maintain an open-source code library for handling multimedia files, including video. It has many features including ffmpeg speed-up video, ffmpeg slow-down video, etc. FFmpeg is free software and supports many platforms, including Linux, macOS, iOS, and Android.

Step 4

Now, take a snapshot of the text. Then, double-click on the default title again and change the text to a single letter I. Once again, take a snapshot of this text and then delete the default title from the timeline.

![take snapshot in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/snapshot.png)

You should have two snapshots in **My Media** now. One of them should say “FILMORA” and one with the letter “I”.
