## **What Makes Movavi Video Editor Plus Appealing To Consumers?**

**[Movavi Video Editor Plus 2022](https://isoftfinder.com/blog/unbiased-review-for-movavi-video-editor-plus.html)** has a lot to offer in terms of features. Object Animation, Automatic Video Creation, and more built-in media are the highlights of Video Editor Plus 2022\. Let's see how they work together!

### **Interface**

The Movavi Video Editor Plus 2022 is one of Movavi's aesthetically pleasing apps. When selecting different tabs on the upper part of the interface, toolbars and tabs can be found at the top or on the left, and the tools will expand. Right on the right is a player that lets you preview samples of videos, transitions, titles, and so on. Even dozens of tracks can be added and edited at once to create your video, as you can add video, audio, and images to the timeline at the bottom.

### **Quick Video Creation**

This is one of the best features of this video editor. Adding a video, selecting a template, then adding loyalty-free audios will quickly create a video with the help of the video creation wizard.

### **Editing Tools**

You can edit your videos with all the editing tools necessary to make them more personal, such as Rotate, Crop, Trim, Split, Stabilize, Adjust colors, Combine, Stabilize, Pan and Zoom, Slow motion, Chroma key, Scene detection, Animate, Highlight & Concealed, Add logo, Overlay, etc. Applying an editing tool is as simple as selecting a video, choosing a tool, and configuring the settings.

In addition, it allows editing of video and audio properties, providing excellent detail treatment. A video can be sped up or lowered, normalized, changed opacity, reversed, faded in or out, and synchronized, equalized, noise removed, audio effects added, and the beat detected.

### **Creativity: Filters, Transitions, Titles and Stickers**

To make your video more personal, you will need to add filters, titles, transitions, and stickers. Movavi video editor offers free templates built-in and templates that can be purchased from its store. It has all the templates organized into themes, the design is very pleasing to the eye, and we are more likely to try these effects.

### **Sharing and output**

Unless you're actively streaming videos on video streaming platforms, this sharing feature may be helpful for you. Logging in allows you to upload videos directly to YouTube, YouTube Video, and Google Drive.

The export feature supports a wide range of video and audio formats that are highly frequently used. Leave them alone if you don't have a good reason to change the output settings. The program will display the current file size when you choose a different video quality, which is useful if you have limited storage space.

### **Tutorials**

It isn't easy to edit videos, unlike other tasks. An online video tutorial will be of great help if you wish to learn how to effectively use a video editor and perform specific video editing tasks.

Movi's instructions explain how to add files to the program and how to edit videos when you first run it. Additionally, it organizes all video tutorials in one place in the Notification panel for performing specific video editing tasks. You can play a tutorial by scrolling down. Every week, the tutorials are updated, greatly reducing the time it takes to get started with this tool and inspiring us to create amazing videos we would never have dreamed of.

## **Final Verdict**

There is no doubt that Movavi is a great video editor. It is often compared with the Movavi video suite, but they have their usage. It is feature-rich and comes with a variety of options. Overall, it is good, but if you are looking for something very professional and easy to use, it might not be the right option. Over the years, the Movavi downloads have increased rapidly, but if you want to create professional and eye-catching videos, then we recommend you to use the Filmora X video editor.

If you compare both these video editors, then you will find that Filmora is the more suitable option. It surpasses movavi video editor plus by every means whether you compare the features, video editing tools, or audio tools. It has a more intuitive interface, and you can try it for free for as long as you want. As soon as you are ready, you can purchase a subscription. So, what are you waiting for?
