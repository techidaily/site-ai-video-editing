## How To Fade Audio In Kinemaster

If you have been looking for video and audio editing tools then you have probably heard of Kinemaster. It is a great video editing app that allows users to edit all aspects of the video including any audio or music that may accompany the video. It has a lot of very useful features and the user interface is fairly easy to use.

One of the things that you can do with Kinemaster is to fade out audio, a useful feature that can help the ending of any video appear more authentic. In this article, we will be looking at how you can use Kinemaster to fade audio.

## Kinemaster Fade Audio Steps

The following steps show you how you can easily fade audio in Kinemaster;

Step1If you don't have Kinemaster already, start by downloading and installing the video editor on your computer.

Step2Open Kinemaster on your computer and then click on the “New Project” icon to start. Select the aspect ratio that you would like to use. If you are not sure, we recommend choosing the “16:9” aspect ratio.

Step5Select the “Audio” tab on the next screen and then turn on the switch next to “Audio Fade-in (Start of Project)” and “Audio Fade-out (End of Project).” This will add a fade-in and fade-out effect at the beginning of the audio and at the end of it.

## Kinemaster Alternative to Edit Audio

Kinemaster is a good way to edit both audio and video on your computer, but the following options are just as good;

VideoShop is a simple to use and highly effective program that you can use to create and edit videos on your computer. The interface makes it easy to import any video project that you have into the program and the wealth of very useful features can help you edit the video in various ways.

The gaming world is ever-changing, with developers looking to create innovative ways to immerse players into their digital worlds. One such technology that has begun to sweep is **AI in the game industry**.

AI is a powerful tool in many ways to improve the gaming experience. It can make **artificial intelligence in computer games** more believable and add replayability and immersion to games, and we can expect to see even more impressive applications in the future.

#### In this article

01 [What Is AI in Gaming?](#Part 1)

02 [Why Does AI in Gaming Matter?](#Part 2)

03 [How AI Will Completely Change Video Games](#Part 3)

04 [8 Games with Incredible Artificial Intelligence](#Part 4)

05 [What AI Video Games Assets Do Filmora Have?](#Part 5)

## Part 1 **What Is AI in Gaming?**

In simple terms, AI is a set of algorithms that allow a computer to learn and improve from experience. Although you can apply it in many ways, **artificial intelligence in video games** is usually helpful to create more intelligent and more believable non-player characters (NPCs).

For example, an AI system might be helpful to determine how an NPC reacts to the player's actions. If the player tries to steal from an NPC, the AI might make the NPC angry and more likely to attack the player. Alternatively, if the player is friendly to an NPC, the **AI game playing** might make the NPC more likely to help the player in future interactions.

## Part 2 **Why Does AI in Gaming Matter?**

One of the most vital aspects of **AI in video games** is that it can make games more believable and immersive for players. When games can convincingly simulate human-like behavior, it can be a much more enjoyable experience for gamers. AI can make NPCs seem more lifelike and make the game world feel more believable.

AI is also becoming increasingly important for creating procedural content. This is where the game generates content on its own, rather than relying on pre-made assets. For example, a game might use procedural generation to create random dungeons or quests that the player can explore. This can add a lot of replayability to a game, as the player never knows what they will encounter next.

## Part 3 **How AI Will Completely Change Video Games**

It is not a secret that AI is changing the world as we know it. With its ability to enable computers to learn and improve from experience, AI is paving the way for a future where machines can handle more complex tasks. And nowhere is this more apparent than in the world of video gaming.

In the past, developers brought in AI primarily for simple things like making certain NPCs (non-player characters) move and act realistically. But now, **artificial intelligence in video games** is being used for much more complex tasks like generating procedural content and creating believable human-like behavior. This results in a new generation of **AI game playing** that are more immersive and playable.

The gaming world is ever-changing, with developers looking to create innovative ways to immerse players into their digital worlds. One such technology that has begun to sweep is **AI in the game industry**.

AI is a powerful tool in many ways to improve the gaming experience. It can make **artificial intelligence in computer games** more believable and add replayability and immersion to games, and we can expect to see even more impressive applications in the future.

#### In this article

01 [What Is AI in Gaming?](#Part 1)

02 [Why Does AI in Gaming Matter?](#Part 2)

03 [How AI Will Completely Change Video Games](#Part 3)

04 [8 Games with Incredible Artificial Intelligence](#Part 4)

05 [What AI Video Games Assets Do Filmora Have?](#Part 5)

## Part 1 **What Is AI in Gaming?**

In simple terms, AI is a set of algorithms that allow a computer to learn and improve from experience. Although you can apply it in many ways, **artificial intelligence in video games** is usually helpful to create more intelligent and more believable non-player characters (NPCs).

For example, an AI system might be helpful to determine how an NPC reacts to the player's actions. If the player tries to steal from an NPC, the AI might make the NPC angry and more likely to attack the player. Alternatively, if the player is friendly to an NPC, the **AI game playing** might make the NPC more likely to help the player in future interactions.

## Part 2 **Why Does AI in Gaming Matter?**

One of the most vital aspects of **AI in video games** is that it can make games more believable and immersive for players. When games can convincingly simulate human-like behavior, it can be a much more enjoyable experience for gamers. AI can make NPCs seem more lifelike and make the game world feel more believable.

AI is also becoming increasingly important for creating procedural content. This is where the game generates content on its own, rather than relying on pre-made assets. For example, a game might use procedural generation to create random dungeons or quests that the player can explore. This can add a lot of replayability to a game, as the player never knows what they will encounter next.

## Part 3 **How AI Will Completely Change Video Games**

It is not a secret that AI is changing the world as we know it. With its ability to enable computers to learn and improve from experience, AI is paving the way for a future where machines can handle more complex tasks. And nowhere is this more apparent than in the world of video gaming.

In the past, developers brought in AI primarily for simple things like making certain NPCs (non-player characters) move and act realistically. But now, **artificial intelligence in video games** is being used for much more complex tasks like generating procedural content and creating believable human-like behavior. This results in a new generation of **AI game playing** that are more immersive and playable.

## Part 4   **Games with Incredible Artificial Intelligence**

## EasyHDR Review: Is This a Good Choice to Create HDR

Before we dive deeper into this **Easy HDRi** review, let's first discuss how this HDR software rates in some critical aspects:

### 1\. Effectiveness - 4.8/5

The HDRi process on this software is very effective, although you shouldn't have high expectations. It provides manual and automatic lens correction properties, although using the manual option might need a learning curve. Other extras include ghost removal and automatic alignment.

### 2\. Price - 4.7/5

Easy HDR is not necessarily a free program. Although there's a free demo version, it's pretty limited in features. Therefore, purchase the premium plan for $33 or $55 for personal and lifetime licenses. As a seasoned HDR editor, you should know that other HDR programs like Aurora HDR cost way more than this.

### 3\. Supported OS - 5/5

This HDR photography program is compatible with Windows and macOS systems, which is a big plus. You can install it on Windows 7 or newer and macOS 10.12 or newer. Sorry, Linux users!

### 4\. Ease of use - 4.8

Easy HDR is one of the most beginner-friendly HDR processing tools despite the advanced management tools. It features automatic lens correction, ghost removal, and HDR merging capabilities.

### 5\. Best for - Beginner HDRi editors

This program's simple approach makes it perfect for HDRi photographers without prior editing skills. Also, if you're a beginner on a tight budget, easyHDR is the best software for you.

**Our Verdict**

Up to this juncture, you might wonder if Easy HDR is worth the money or not. Well, that depends on what you want. If you have minimal HDR editing knowledge, then this is the best professional program for you.

The straightforward layout boasts automatic HDR editing tools to make your work effortless. In addition, it supports a wide array of image formats, including photos taken using your DSLR camera. And the $33/lifetime price should be manageable by many average Joes.

But on the flip side, Easy HDR lacks in-depth post-processing tools. Also, it lacks the all-important “undo” feature, which is vital in HDR image editing. Other than that, it's the perfect program to make dramatic and realistic HDR photos.

 Pros

* Simple layout.
* Make realistic HDR images with automatic tools.
* Easy HDRi Blender and Adobe Lightroom plugins.
* Standalone Easy HDR desktop program.
* Batch processing supported.
* Compatible with multiple image formats, including RAW.

 Cons

* It doesn't have advanced HDR post-processing tools.
* No HDR feature for editing.

## Part 2\. Detailed Review for Easy HDR

Before diving deeper into the detailed Easy HDR features, it's important to note that the program has a demo version. You can use this version to practice and study the vital components of easyHDR. But be guided that the demo version exports images with a watermark. In addition, users can't save HDRi in TIFF format. Let's get in!

### 1\. High-Quality Bracket Merging

A good quality HDRi software should easily merge different image exposures, making the photo look natural and spectacular. To start incorporating, drag the image brackets to easyHDR and press “Ok” on the pop-up screen. You can now try the different bracket merging effects until you find something that suits your preference.

### 2\. Editing features

EasyHDR goes a step further to provide its users with a comprehensive list of editing features. For example, the “Clone Stamp” tool can remove unwanted objects like cables without blurring the photo. You can also use the “Tone Curve” feature to adjust the brightness of shadows and highlights.

### 3\. Ghost removal

No, this is not the scary ghost that you know. Instead, these ghosting artefacts appear in misaligned photos due to moving objects like leaves, branches, cars, people, etc. With Easy HDR, you can eliminate the “ghosts” manually or automatically. Simply open the photo and turn on “Ghost Removal” to remove them automatically.

### 4\. HDR batch processing

As expected, you can find it pretty tedious to import and merge each HDR bracket individually. For this reason, easyHDR comes with a “Batch Processing” feature that allows users to combine a whole folder of brackets automatically.

### 5\. LDR enhancement

Although we've mainly focused on brackets and photos in this post, it's important to note that easyHDR also works with single images. Instead of having three separate bracketed exposures, LDR (Low Dynamic Range) enhancement allows you to generate exposures from a single JPEG or RAW photo.

## Bonus Tips: The Best Way to Edit HDR videos on your Desktop

Like HDR images, HDR videos offer more comprehensive displays in dark and bright surroundings. In short, these videos allow more colourful and detailed highlight representations. Unfortunately, not all HDR editing programs can merge bracketed exposures effortlessly to produce outstanding results. And those that do can cost you an arm and a leg.

With that in mind, we recommend [Wondershare Filmora 11](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for professional and semi-professional HDR editors. It's a simple but detailed program that allows users to edit HDR materials quickly and easily. It houses thousands of free effects you'll use with the Blending Mode to create nice HDR footage. Filmora 11 works with any video format, including RAW footage from your camcorder. And of course, there are many other editing features like color correction, color grading, image stabilization, chroma key/green screen, etc.

After creating the video, import it on Filmora 11 and delete the white color overlay and W&B Film effects. Now add the imported video on the first track, then search and apply a Square Blur effect. Also, change the Blending Mode of the footage to Overlay. Meanwhile, click the Effect tab and adjust the Size slider accordingly. For example, you can choose 10.
