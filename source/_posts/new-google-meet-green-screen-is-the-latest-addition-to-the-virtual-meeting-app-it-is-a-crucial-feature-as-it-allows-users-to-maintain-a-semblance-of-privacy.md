## Ways to Merge Videos in HandBrake? Expectation Vs. Reality

So you have captured some mind-blowing clips and want to join them together to make an excellent movie? But, sadly, you are still stuck because you are not sure what video editors would be suitable to complete this task fast.

If such miseries are haunting you, take a deep breath because many like you are searching for the right video merging tools. However, some people recommend using HandBrake for merging clips. So let’s dig some ground to know if the software can really combine clips. And if there’s a “Yes”? Then **how to merge videos in HandBrake**?

#### In this article

01 [What is HandBrake?](#part1)

02 [Using HandBrake to Merge Videos – Possible or Not?](#part2)

03 [Combining Videos with Filmora Wondershare](#part3)

## Part 1: What is HandBrake?

Before you gear up for HandBrake to merge videos, it would be wise to know a few essential details about this software.

[HandBrake](https://handbrake.fr/) is a free tool for Windows, Linux, and MAC operating systems. The basic purpose of this software is to convert videos from any format in MKV, WebM, and MP4\. It is an open-source program that allows users to convert their videos to play them on multiple devices, such as TV media players, computers, tablets, mobile phones, etc.

Moreover, this platform gives you the power to turn your low-quality videos into high-quality screen time. That is why most professional videographers use this tool to polish videos captured with old cameras.

A few more interesting features of HandBrake are:

* Combing artifacts removal due to interlacing
* Convert videos without negatively affecting the audio quality
* Volume and range adjustment
* Addition, removal, and preservation of soft subtitles

However, one vital thing to understand is that although HandBrake takes a tiny little space of your hard drive, the interface is complicated for beginners.

![merge-video-handbrake-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-1.jpeg)

## Part 2: Using HandBrake to Merge Videos – Possible or Not?

There is a great misconception about HandBrake among the newbies that HandBrake is primarily a video merger software. But, in reality, that is not true at all. Or, at least, the latest HandBrake version 1.5.1 lacks such features.

Even the official website states that [HandBrake cannot combine](https://handbrake.fr/docs/en/latest/introduction/about.html#:~:text=does%20not%20do-,HandBrake%20does%20not%3A,video%20clips%20into%20one,-Pass-through%20video) two or more clips to make them whole.

So feel yourself lucky to read this article if you haven’t downloaded HandBrake yet. Congratulations! You are saved from another heartbreak.

But wait! If the software is not meant to merge clips, it doesn’t mean that you can’t use it to prepare your videos for the real deal. HandBrake can still be a helpful tool, permitting you to convert videos in a similar format before you start merging them on any other video editor.

For example, suppose you have two video clips in different formats. In that case, you can use HandBrake to convert all of them in a similar format so that they can be easily be merged when imported on any video merger tool.

But, again, the question is, if not HandBrake, then what?

Frankly, you will find hundreds of video editing tools with a combining clips feature, but not all of them deserve your attention and time. While software like DaVinci Resolve includes characteristics to merge two or more clips in a single shot, beginners and mid-level users may still find them a bit difficult at the start.

That is why professionals and experts prefer Filmora by Wondershare to merge videos without banging their heads on the screen.

So, how to merge videos in Filmora with simple clicks? Focus on the next part of the article to learn the step-by-step method within a few minutes.

Now, without any more delay, let’s start learning how to combine videos in Filmora through the following steps.

**Step 1: Install Filmora on Your Computer**

Just visit [Filmora’s website](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to download the latest version of the software for your Windows or MAC.

Click on the blue icon with a “+” sign to import videos.

![merge-video-handbrake-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-4.jpeg)

Or, click on the “File” button on the top menu to import files and drag and drop both clips to the same timeline.

![final preview of rotating video illusion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/rotating-video-effect-1.gif)

## Part 2\. Prerequisites to Make a Rotating Video Effect

You will need a few items to create a rotating transition video. First, look at the fundamental priorities for creating this feature.

### The Subject Matters

To record a successful rotating video, you need a person or a subject to perform in front of the camera. It can be a model hired by a brand, a social influencer, or maybe it's you. Keep in mind the following things before recording:

* The person should get two different costumes.
* All the actions need to be rehearsed before shooting
* Show affinity and control of the camera.

![character of the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/rotating-video-effect-2.png)

### Shotting Equipment

To record a professional video, you need a good camera. You can use a smartphone to record this footage. There is no need to have a tripod stand or any gear to hold the camera because the camera will be in a rotating position, the same as the subject's hand.

For this, you need a filmmaker or any person living with you. Just give instructions as shown below to him to record a perfect video for yourself:

* Record the whole video in just one direction.
* Don't **shake** the camera because it gives blurry footage.
* Ensure to **focus** on the subject during recording.
* Don't **zoom** in or out while recording the video.
* Keep the subject in the **middle** of the frame during the recording process.
* The **hand rotation** timing is the same as the camera's rotation.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Ensure to record one footage multiple times so that you can choose the perfect one later for editing.

![smartphone for filming](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/rotating-video-effect-3.png)

### Filming of the First Footage

To make the footage for the rotating video illusion, we have to record it at least twice to get crystal clear and high-resolution results. Therefore, ensure that we have camera movement in the same direction during all recording times.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You can film the video either in the vertical format of the camera or in horizontal format. It all depends upon your script!

Follow the below-mentioned steps to record the first footage for the video:

* Hold the camera in a perfect format, whatever you choose.
* Let the subject stand or sit in the middle of the frame.
* The filmmaker can rotate the camera when the subject's hand rotates.
* Try your best to rotate the camera 180 degrees.
* Ensure that the camera lens faces the ground at the end of the rotation.

![filming scenes of first footage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/rotating-video-effect-4.png)

After filming the first footage for the video, it's time to record the second footage to transition between the two.

### Filming of the Second Footage

To create a second shot, you have to remember that the costume and location of the filming are different from the first footage. Follow the below steps to record it:

* The first step is to hold the camera in the same direction as the first footage.
* When editing, make sure the subject's position matches the first footage.
* Make sure the subject's hand movement is in the opposite direction from the first shot.

![filming scenes of second footage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/rotating-video-effect-5.png)

![add clips to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/rotating-video-effect-8.png)

Your images and videos have been imported into the timeline; now it's time to trim them according to requirements.

##### Step4 Trim the Clips

To insert transition effects, you must trim the clip at a specific point and speed up the clip at the required duration. For this, follow the next actions as shown below:

* Playback clips and stop the playhead where you want by pressing the **Space** button from the Keyboard.
* Then, click on the **Split** icon present on the playhead.
* It will trim the clip from that point and **separate** it from its former one.

![trim the clips at specific points](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/rotating-video-effect-9.png)

After splitting or trimming the clips, you now have to adjust the speed of the clips, as shown below!

##### Step5 Adjust Speed and Duration

There is a need to increase the speed of some scenes where the transition starts or ends. For this, follow the below actions:

* Find the section which needs to **speed** up, such as in the last half of each rotation.
* Right-click on the section of the clip in the timeline.
* Then, select the **Speed option** as shown in the icon of the timer present on the upper tab of the timeline.
* Select the **Fast** option, and if you want to lower the speed, select the **Slow** option**.**
* Choose the speed range according to your requirement.
* Select that required option and play it back to check if it is correct.

![adjustment of speed and duration](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/rotating-video-effect-10.png)

The video is all set; give it the final touches by following the last step, as shown below!

##### Step6 Playback the Video

After adding and adjusting all the features, double-check the video by playback. If you find any duration issue, review it and adjust it according to your requirement.

You can playback the video by clicking on the Play button. Perform this a few more times to ensure the speed looks okay and adjust if it is too slow or too fast.

![playback the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/rotating-video-effect-11.png)

You can also view it in full screen by selecting the last option on the tab. If there is no problem, you can export it locally or directly share it on TikTok or anywhere you want to gain views and attract an audience. You can also use it as a magic trick to inspire other people or as a transition for videos!

### Filming of the First Footage

To make the footage for the rotating video illusion, we have to record it at least twice to get crystal clear and high-resolution results. Therefore, ensure that we have camera movement in the same direction during all recording times.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You can film the video either in the vertical format of the camera or in horizontal format. It all depends upon your script!

Follow the below-mentioned steps to record the first footage for the video:

* Hold the camera in a perfect format, whatever you choose.
* Let the subject stand or sit in the middle of the frame.
* The filmmaker can rotate the camera when the subject's hand rotates.
* Try your best to rotate the camera 180 degrees.
* Ensure that the camera lens faces the ground at the end of the rotation.

![filming scenes of first footage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/rotating-video-effect-4.png)

After filming the first footage for the video, it's time to record the second footage to transition between the two.

### Filming of the Second Footage

To create a second shot, you have to remember that the costume and location of the filming are different from the first footage. Follow the below steps to record it:

* The first step is to hold the camera in the same direction as the first footage.
* When editing, make sure the subject's position matches the first footage.
* Make sure the subject's hand movement is in the opposite direction from the first shot.

![filming scenes of second footage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/rotating-video-effect-5.png)
