## A Countdown Effect Is Widely Used in Gaming and Report Videos. So How to Create Your Own Countdown Video? This Article Will Tell You some Ideas About Contdown Video Editing

Have you ever wanted to use Adobe After Effects to recreate a countdown timer for a rocket launch or simply create a suspenseful moment in a video by displaying how the time runs out? This tutorial will show you how. It is imperative that you become familiar with the process of creating a countdown in After Effects.

In this article, we will demonstrate how to use Adobe After Effects to put together a countdown video. This procedure is a straightforward one, and it will handle expressions as well as plugins. Stay here and read on to find out more about the various methods in which we might accomplish this goal!

Let's begin!

## Part 1\. Create a new composition

It's possible that you only want to show the minutes and seconds. Make a mask around the entire area you intend to use in order to quickly remove undesired information.

1\. Create a new Text Layer.

2\. Alt + Click (on a PC) or Option + Click (on a Mac) on the stopwatch in the Source Text to display text options.

3\. Place the expression “timeToCurrentFormat” within the expression box (). You must set your composition frame rate to 60 frames per second in order to make it appear to be a real digital countdown timer.

4\. Everything should be pre-composed, and the composition's tempo should be reversed to make it count down. Right-click the composition and choose Time > Time Reverse Layer to change its pace.

![create new text countdown video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/create-new-text-countdown-video.jpg)

## Part 2\. Using the timecode plugin

To make a countdown timer, you can use the Timecode plugin rather than the "timeToCurrentFormat()" statement. The timer layout will be immediately created when the plugin is added to a New Solid; use the same steps as before to convert it to a countdown timer.

Here is a quick video that demonstrates how simple it is to set up a countdown timer in this manner:

Step1 Ctrl-click (Windows) or Command-click (Mac OS) the time display to cycle through Timecode Base or Frames/Feet + Frames (depending on whether the "Use Feet + Frames" option is checked in the Project Settings). The Timeline panel's upper-left corner, as well as the bottoms of the Layer, Composition, and Footage panels, all indicate the current time. Timeline panel (See.)

Step2 A smaller text version of the option that is not selected in the project settings will be seen underneath. Do the following to limit the display to the Timecode or Frames option that was chosen in the Project Settings:

Step3 Choose After Effects > Preferences > Display (Mac OS) or Edit > Preferences > Display to access the display preferences window (Windows). Remove the check mark next to "Show Timecode and Frames in Timeline Panel" (this option is selected by default).

Step4 Change the time display units by selecting File > Project Settings and then selecting a different choice from the list in the Time Display Style section.

Timecode:

Displays the current time as timecode in the time rulers of the Timeline, Layer, and Footage panels. You have the option of utilizing the timecode from the source media (Use Media Source) or beginning at 00:00:00:00\. To use timecode rather than frames, select the Timecode option from the menu. It is important to take note that there are no options available for changing the frame rate or whether or not to delete frames, as the source timecode is recognized and used instead.

![customize timecode countdown video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/customize-timecode-countdown-video.jpg)

## Part 3\. Source timecode

Support for various file formats for the source timecode QuickTime, DV, AVI, P2, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, H.264, AVCHD, RED, XDCAM EX, XDCAM HD, and WAV image sequence importers are just some of the formats that After Effects is able to read and apply timecode for.

Project panel

The Project panel includes several columns that display the source timecode. These columns are titled as follows: Media Start, Media End, Media Duration, and Tape Name. These are the beginning, ending, and overall length of time for the source. There are columns labeled "In," "Out," and "Duration," which reflect the In and Out points that the user has set in the Footage panel for the footage item or the work area for the composition, respectively. These columns also show the duration of the clip.

Context of the Project

The source timecode feature set can be found in the dialog box that is used to configure the Project. Check out the Options for Time Display Units page for more information.

Box for Configuring Composition Settings

The source timecode feature set is located in the dialog box that is called Composition Settings.

Box for Specifying Preferences

The Import section of the Preferences dialog box is capable of handling source timecode functions.

Masks are a feature of editing software that allows you to choose a particular portion of the video or utilize video overlays to hide, duplicate, reveal, or change your footage.

**What Do You Mean Stay Active?**

Chat is an important part of Twitch, and it lets you interact with your fellow members of the community as well as streamers. By keeping your chat active, you can let others know that you are ready to interact with them. This, in turn, can help you to increase your followers.

## Part 4: What's The Alternative to Twitch for Creators?

### 1\. YouTube Gaming

Well, even though YouTube Gaming lacks in-game overlays, it offers other features. The platform offers live gaming broadcasts, channels, chat rooms and more. Here the viewers don't need to subscribe to watch the content.

### 2\. Smashcast

If you are a gaming fan, you must have heard about Hitbox and Azubu. They came together to form Smashcast. This provides the users with perfect JavaScript and HTML integration. If you are a gaming partner, esports team, viewer, organizer or streamer, then this platform will be an excellent option for you. Compared to Twitch, Smashcast offers better quality esports streams.

### 3\. Facebook Gaming

![upload video to twitch](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/upload-video-to-twitch-4.jpg)

Facebook also has introduced its own gaming and streaming platform. Facebook Gaming comes with an easy-to-navigate interface. It has a chat room and also allows you to watch videos from different social media platforms, like Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube. Besides, it offers some amazing features, such as different monetization options, interactive live-streaming, simple streaming setup, stream analytics and more.

### 4\. DLive

While YouTube and Twitch have some high bars for monetization, they don't offer sufficient profit to the creators. DLive is here to solve that issue. This platform rewards content creators as well as viewers. It charges a flat fee and takes around 20 percent of total revenue. On the other hand, viewers also get rewards for their engagement.

### 5\. Ustream

This platform offers more than just gaming video streams, such as sports news, live streams, talk shows, podcasts and more. Some reviews say Ustream provides users with a better and faster streaming service. Besides, it is available for different platforms, such as PS4, Mac, Windows, iOS, and Android.

### 6\. Vimeo

![upload video to twitch](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/upload-video-to-twitch-5.jpg)

Vimeo has all the features, such as a live chat system and other features that a streaming platform must have. You can easily access its analytic dashboard to know your audience in a better way. It also has many integrations such as Figma, Meta, WordPress, Shopify and more. So, uploading videos directly from your website to Vimeo will not be a challenging task.

## FAQs

### How Long Do My Videos Stay on Twitch?

The answer is that it depends. If you are a Twitch Prime user, Turbo user or a Twitch partner, then once you **upload video to twitch**, it will stay for 60 days. For regular broadcasters, their videos will remain active for 14 days. Just follow the above-mentioned steps to successfully upload your videos.

### Can I Upload Videos to Twitch?

You can upload your **video to twitch** if you become a Twitch affiliate or Partner. Regular streamers don't have this feature for now. Just meet the criteria required for this and apply for an affiliate. This can be a great way to promote your brand as you can leverage this amazing form of influenced marketing.

## How to Color-Correct an S-Log Footage

S-Log is a gamma curve optimized for digital cameras to maximize the image sensor's performance. Although these videos may look flat and washed out, they contain lots of color information. Even better, video creators can use color correction to edit the S-Log videos and make them look as natural as possible. That's what this article is all about.

## How to Color-Correct an S-Log Footage

This tutorial assumes that you already have an S-Log footage. If not, you can record S-Log footage using most Canon, Sony, and Panasonic cameras.

![how to color-correct an s-log footage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/record-s-log-footage.gif)

Let's get to the steps!

##### Step1 Adjust the color settings

Start by adding your video to the timeline on [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and then double-click the video track. Then, click on the **Color** tab before tapping **Advanced**.

![adjust the color settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/color-correction-basics-1.jpg)

##### Step2 Read and study the histogram

Now you'll see the Advanced Color Correction pop-up window. Here, you'll see a histogram with the brightest point on the right and the darkest point on the left. From our example, you can see that the video has more dark pixels than bright ones. Horizontally, the histogram shows you how many pixels are in a certain range of brightness.

![read and study the histogram](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/color-correction-basics-2.jpg)

##### Step3 Adjust the image colors

Once you've understood the histogram, look for pure black and white parts on the video clip. For example, in this video, you can see that the roofs are pure black and the boat at the bottom-right corner is pure white.

![adjust the image colors](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/pure-blacks-and-whites.gif)

After finding the white and black parts in the video, go to the **Light** section, then adjust the **Highlights** to see if you can get a pure white on the boat. If the boat or any other image of your choice doesn't look pure white, increase the **Whites** slide to make it whiter.

![go to the light section](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/color-correction-basics-3.jpg)

Now adjust the **Shadows** settings to reduce the effect and make the roofs look closer to pure black. If you want the roofs to look darker, drag the **Blacks** slider to the left.

**Pro tip**: Ensure that the darkest and brightest points don't cross the broken lines on the edge, or the video will start losing details.

##### Step4 Adjust the color saturation

Does your video still look a little flat? Probably yes! In that case, click the **Color** section and adjust the **Saturation** slider to the right to make the video less flat. Saturation simply means how colorful a video clip is to the viewer. Apart from the color saturation, you can also adjust the **Vibrance** to make your video objects look more colorful.

![adjust the color saturation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/color-correction-basics-4.jpg)

##### Step5 Preview and compare the video

Now it's time to check and compare the results. To make it easier, click the **Eye** icon at the top-right corner to switch between the original S-Log video and the color-corrected clip. You can also tap the **AB** icon and choose **Split View-Left/Right** to view the clips in the side-by-side mode.

![preview and compare the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/color-correction-basics-5.jpg)

## Summary

I guess that was easy, right? Up to this juncture, you should be able to perform basic color correction on your video using Wondershare Filmora. Remember, this video editor packs many other editing tools to bring out your creativity. Give it a try!
