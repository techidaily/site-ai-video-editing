## Motion Tracking Never Goes Out of Trend, so Do You Wish to Make Your Videos Trendy with This? No Issue because Here We Will Guide You on How to Do Motion Tracking

One of the powerful editing features offered by several premium-grade video editors is motion tracking. It not only boosts the overall video quality but also helps ensuring the object is engaged throughout the video. Many users fail to apply the motion tracking effect to the videos because they don’t use a reliable tool. The primary motive of this discussion is to provide you with the best-in-class motion tracker.

Not only will we tell you the name of the software, but we will also guide you through the procedure of doing this. Moreover, many of you don't know what motion tracking is. So, this article will also provide significant information about this.

## Part 1: What Is Motion Tracking in Video Editing?

[Motion tracking](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) helps you analyze the movements of different objects in your video content. This process involves various tasks that can be very helpful in video editing. For example, tracking and identifying the position of elements over time. The main purpose of motion tracking is to add graphics. Moreover, you can also add digital effects to the tracked objects.

You will need special software or video editing tools to perform this process. Here's how you can understand the motion tracking process with ease:

### Selection of Object

The editor can select the object that he wants to track in an effective manner. This object can be a person or any moving element that needs tracking. Moreover, it can also be a moving vehicle or a logo as well. Tracking these moving elements in the frame can allow the editor to improve the areas which have high contrast or distinct features.

### Tracking Points

Selecting the object allows the software to identify specific points in the frame. These points can have distinct features or a high contrast that may affect the video quality. With the help of **video motion tracking**, the editor can note down these areas and improve them to enhance the viewer experience.

### Data Mapping

Once the software tracks the movements, it can be very useful for the editor. This is because it calculates the changes in position and rotation of each point. Moreover, it also maps the tracked data into a visual representation for the coordinating system. Using this system, the movements of the objects can be recreated in a 3D space.

### Using Effects and Refinement

After obtaining the motion tracking data, the video editor can apply different effects on the object. These effects can include adding graphics and text to the scene. Moreover, it can also help in animation or compositing visual elements. To ensure the accurate alignment of the effects, the editor may need to use extra tracking techniques or manual adjustments.

## Part 1 What is Craig Bot Discord?

Craig is a "Discord voice channel recording bot" with multi-track/multi-channel recording capabilities. In short, that means each speaker gets their audio file when Craig records your Discord voice channel.

Craig Recorder keeps track of all your recordings. You may use Craig Bot to record your calls in high-quality audio and video as a server owner.

Craig will record continuously for up to six hours. You can download a copy of the audio to examine the status of a recording until you download the file. The Craig website has a complete set of **Craig bot commands**, which you may immediately access by typing: Craig, help in a Discord channel.

## Part 2 Is Craig Discord Bot Safe?

All Craig web services, like most websites, log all users' IP addresses to identify and prevent criminal activity. Craig does not keep track of anyone who does not speak in a recorded channel, use any **Craig bot commands**, or participate in an EnnuiCastr recording.

## Part 3 How Do I Enable Craig in Discord?

All Craig web services, like most websites, log all users' IP addresses to identify and prevent criminal activity. Anyone who does not talk in a recorded channel, use any **Discord Craig** commands, or engage in a recording using the Craig web app is anonymous to Craig.

## Part 4 How to Record Discord Audio Using Craig

Craig will not record without a visible label indicating that it is getting recorded. It records your conversation with others, but it also records each user as a unique audio track, making it much easier to edit or remove specific speakers if necessary.

Follow these simple steps to use a **Discord recording bot.**

**Step 1: Invite Craig**

You must first invite Craig to your server to use him. Visit Craig's website and click the "Invite Craig to Your Discord Server" option to get started.

Now, begin the joining procedure by pressing Invite Craig to your Discord Server. This action will take you to the authorization page for the Discord server. However, before using your server, you must first grant Craig permission to join it.

**Step 6: Type ": Craig:, Stop"**

If you wish to compel Craig to cease recording on all channels, type: Craig:, stop.

![type :Craig:,stop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/definite-guide-to-craig-bot-discord-7.jpg)

**Step 7: Download or Delete Link**

The Craig bot will send you a private message with links to download or delete your talks when you start recording.
