## Part 1: How Does Slowing Down Videos Help Viewers and Creators?

In this section, we'll discuss how **slowing down time-lapse video** **s** is helpful. We'll shed light on their applications for viewers and content creators. Without further delay, let's dive in to solve this mystery:

### For Creators

Since the era of [social media](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), content creation has become a new trend. Creators around the globe can interact with their followers from a single platform. It gives them a chance to share their ideas and showcase their talents. Hence, here is how slow-motion videos benefit a creator in his journey:

* **In Video Tutorials:** Do you have a channel where you post tutorials to perform a specific task? This effect can help you slow down the video for the audience to absorb your words. It helps creators to show their viewers that they genuinely care about them. A video where basics and details are discussed is considered right.
* **In Revealing Details:** We encounter situations where the camera cannot capture a moment right. This is because the normal playback speed cannot highlight video details. On the other hand, a slo-mo takes proper time to showcase details. These help handle an event planning or dress designing page.
* **In Creating Aesthetics:** Another application of slo-mos is that they help with creativity. Adding this effect at the right time and duration enhances visuals. Moreover, adding a slo-mo effect gives the video an aesthetic appeal. It can enhance the visuals of a travel, cooking, or fashion video.

### For Viewers

* **In Effective Learning:** You are not unaware of tutorial or explainer videos. Whether you are a student or a housewife, you must have used YouTube to your benefit. A slow-motion video can break down a complex concept or steps for a recipe. In addition, it can help you operate technology better, like Word, Excel, and more.
* **In Understanding Nature:** People out there prefer documentaries over dramas. They are curious about nature and the way it works. In such documentaries, slo-mos are used to present a natural phenomenon. It helps the viewers understand how a certain process occurs. Moreover, it focuses on small details in an ecosystem to explain better.
* **In Reflecting Content:** Next time you watch reels, notice that slo-mos catch your attention. Videos with the right speed manipulation appeal to the eyes, and viewers often watch them again. In addition, they help focus on the specifics of a gadget, fashion product, or more.

Step 4: Click on Enter to save the rotation of the video.

The second way to rotate a video in Blender is by using the Transform Properties window. To do this...

Step 1: Open the video that you want to rotate in Blender.

![rotate-video-blender](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-blender-4.png)

Step 2: Next, go to ‘Transform’ in the Active Tool portion of the screen.

Step 4: Click on ‘Enter’ to apply it to the video.

In this tutorial, we have shown you two different ways to rotate a video in Blender. The first way is by using the Transform Properties window, and the second way is by using the 3D Viewport.

Which method you use is up to you. However, we recommend using the 3D Viewport method, as it is more accurate.

Rotating a video in Blender can be used for other purposes than just rotating it.

Here are some other things that you can do with a rotated video:

\- Scale the video up or down

\- Flip the video horizontally or vertically

\- Change the position of the video in the 3D Viewport

## How to Put a Filter on a Video in iMovie

There are times when you record a video and find out that the light and color in the video have been up to the mark. The light could be too bright or too dark while there could be some color overlays in certain portion as well as the entire frame of the video. Thanks to the video editing apps, you can correct any lighting and coloration issues with different filters available to apply to your video.

If you are using iPhone or Mac, you can use Apple’s iMovie app easily. Therefore, you should know how to add filters on iMovie to get the desired output. iMovie app is available for both iPhone and iPad users as well as Mac users. You do not need prior experience in video editing to add filter to your videos to enhance and improve them. We will illustrate the steps on how to add filters in iMovie as well as suggest a better iMovie alternative.

## Part 1\. How to add filters on iMovie iPhone

If you have an iPhone, you are more likely to record a video with your iPhone. This is because the camera quality of iPhones is extremely good and there are various modes available for capturing different types of videos like slow-motion and time-lapse. Once you capture a video with your iPhone, you can edit the video and add filters to enhance the video quality using iMovie app available for iPhone.

You have to install iMovie app from App Store as it does not come pre-install. If you already have it installed, make sure you update it to the latest version to get all the filters. Here are the steps how to put a filter on a video in iMovie app.

Step1 Open iMovie app on your iPhone. Tap on Create Project option and tap on Movie on the next screen.

![new project imovie iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/new-project-imovie-iphone.jpg)

Step2 Select the video from your iPhone that you want to edit and add filters. After your selection, tap on Create Movie option located at the bottom.

![create movie in imovie iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/create-movie-in-imovie-iphone.jpg)

Step3 Your selected video will now be available on the Timeline where you can edit your video. Tap on Filters icon located at the bottom-right corner.

![save video imovie iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/save-video-imovie-iphone.jpg)

## Part 2\. How to add filters on Mac iMovie

If you are someone who regularly makes videos for social media account or video streaming channel, you are more likely to record your video using a video camera and transfer the recorded video to you Mac for editing purposes. iMovie comes pre-installed on Mac, and therefore, once you have transferred the video, you can get started with editing and adding filters immediately. Here are the steps on how to add filters to iMovie on your Mac.

Step1 Launch iMovie from Applications folder. Click on Create New option to start a new Project.

![create new projects imovie mac](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/create-new-projects-imovie-mac.jpg)

Step2 Drag and drop the target video from Photos app to Desktop. Thereafter, drag and drop the video file from Desktop to the Timeline of iMovie project.

Step3 Click on the video clip on the Timeline and click on Crop Filter and Audio Effects icon above the Viewer.

![crop filter imovie mac](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/crop-filter-imovie-mac.jpg)

Step4 Click on Clip Filter option and you will see different filters in a window to the left. Place the mouse pointer over the filters, and you will see the filter in the Viewer.

![apply filters imovie mac](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/apply-filters-imovie-mac.jpg)

Step5 Once you are satisfied with a filter, click on that filter to apply it to the video clip.

## Part 3\. iMovie Alternative to add filters on Computer

There are several reasons iMovie filters may not always serve your purpose. For example, there is no way on how to add face filters on iMovie. The collection of filters is rather limited. If you are not satisfied with the filters available on iMovie, there are several iMovie alternatives available. We recommend [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) due to its vast collection of filters of all categories to enhance your video to the next level. Here are steps on how to add filters to your video using Filmora on your computer.

## Conclusion

If you are an iPhone user or a Mac user, you can add filters to your video using iMovie app. You have to install iMovie app on your iPhone, but iMovie comes pre-installed on Mac. But there are limited filters available on iMovie and there is a lack of face filters which are trending in today’s viral videos. That is why we recommend [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) where there is a wide range of filters available to apply to your video conveniently as per your requirements.
