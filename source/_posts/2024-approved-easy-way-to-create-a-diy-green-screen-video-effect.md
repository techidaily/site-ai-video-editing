## Easy Way to Create a DIY Green Screen Video Effect

No matter how big the budget of a Hollywood movie is, at the end of the day, it has to rely on the humble green screens for special video effects. The stunning studios from where your favorite YouTubers and gamers stream their videos are graphical video effects created through green screens. Even the studios that you see on TV channels are a graphical creation of green screens. You must be wondering how they could achieve such awesome graphics with a simple green screen.

All you need is a good-quality green fabric, a professional video editing software, and a camera. You may not believe it, but that is all you need for creating DIY green screen video effect. You do not have to be a professional video editor to edit the green screen on your videos and add any special video effect. In this article, you will learn how to create your own DIY green backdrop.

## What Is Green Screen Technique?

A green screen is nothing but a green fabric. In a video, a green screen is placed in the background behind the subject. In the editing phase of the video, the green screen is replaced with any background image or video effect that stays intact in the video as long as possible. In short, the green screen technique involves superimposing photos and videos on the green screen in a video.

Starting from the video game industry, movie industry to video streaming and TV channels, the green screen technique is used everywhere. The stunning graphical component of these industries is totally dependent on the green screen technique. In fact, DIY green screen for zoom meetings and video conferencing is widely used. Along with that, YouTubers and Twitch streamers use DIY green screen for streaming live.

Technically speaking, instead of a green screen, you can use any other color of screen. However, green screens are widely used, and it has become a norm. The main point to remember when using a green screen is that nothing else should have green color such as the dresses the subject is wearing. Therefore, in technical terms, the green screen is referred to as Chroma Key, and you will find Chroma Key option instead of green screen in most video editors.

## Why Use Green Screen Technique?

The main reason why the green screen technique is used in movie and video making is that the video editor can replace the entire background at once instead of replacing the background frame by frame. Once you replace a green screen with an image or video effect, it stays the same throughout the video as long as required.

Therefore, the video editor can save a lot of time in editing and the editing stays uniform throughout which gives a realistic effect. If the green screen technique is not used and editing is done frame by frame of a video, there could be a manual error, inconsistent, and graphical glitches.

You can replace green screens with anything you want. It could be a still image of a beautiful studio with 3D effect like you see in case of YouTubers and gamers. It could be a moving, real-life landscape on any place in the world instead of a beautiful background picture. Similarly, it could be replaced by video effects such as explosions, stadiums full of people, battlefields, and likewise. At times, it could be live animations as you see on TV channels.

## How To Create DIY Green Screen Stand Setup and Add Green Screen Effect?

If you want to have a green screen setup for your video, you need to have the following things ready.

* A green cloth that is large enough to cover the entire background.
* A video editing software to replace green screen in your video with anything.
* External light for more video clarity and a good camera with mic.

Step 1: Setup DIY Green Backdrop

Your green fabric should be soft and bright. If you are going to be the subject of the video, make sure you are not wearing anything green. Moreover, do not keep any object within the video frame that is green in color. If there are too many green objects, you can use a blue screen.

When it comes to hanging the green cloth in the background, people find it very difficult. If your video frame is going to be a close-up to the subject, you can use a green screen panel to hang green cloth. A green screen panel generally has a collapsible structure for easy storage and transportation.

Otherwise, you need to install hooks in the wall if you are planning to replace the green screen with a studio-like scene so that the entire background of the video frame stays covered with green screen. You should opt for multiple green screens and stitch them together to cover the background completely.

Step 2: Setup Camera and Light

Whether you are shooting with a DSLR camera or smartphone camera or webcam, make sure you are shooting at least HD video quality so that the editing could be great. Lights are important when you are using green screen though they are not a necessity. The video quality and brightness get enhanced with lights. Diffused lights work the best and the background should be well-lit.

Most importantly, you have to place the lights in such a way that your body arms should not be casting any shadow on the green screen. You can either stand very close to the green screen or away from the green screen so that your shadow does not go till the green screen. Instead of starting to shoot the video from the very beginning, you should capture for a few seconds and make sure everything is perfect including the camera angle.

Step 3: Get The Best Video Editor For Green Screen Effect

There are various video editors available, but not all of them are suitable for green screen effect. We recommend Wondershare Filmora as the best video editor to apply green screen effects on your video while editing.

## How to Use Color Grading in Final Cut Pro

Have you ever questioned the purpose of those odd video scopes or how to build super grades from the start in Final Cut Pro? In contrast to editing talents, color grading is a technical and difficult ability that takes practice.

In order to help, we decided to compile a thorough beginner's article to color grading in Final Cut Pro.

With that said, let's begin!

## 1\. Discover how you color grade in Final Cut Pro

Color grading may be a tedious and time-consuming operation, therefore it's a skill set that calls for a lot of patience. Some editors won't conduct any color grading or correction beyond the bare minimum. But even mundane-looking film may look remarkable if you know how to give it a dramatic touch.

A more cinematic grade requires a number of procedures, and there is no one method that works for all situations. We'll therefore walk you through the process of creating a cinematic color grade in Final Cut Pro, but depending on your material, you might need to add or omit some phases.

##### Step1Filming

Since the raw video is essential for producing a cinematic image, an outstanding grade begins with the camera.

Use the greatest quality settings your camera offers while recording your video; the more information in your picture, the more you can manipulate it during grading.

While it may seem preferable to shoot with as much color as you can, using a duller color profile is very necessary. Your camera will have color settings, and although the washed-out, drab appearance may not inspire confidence in you, it will offer you a lot more editing possibility.

##### Step2Create a color profile

After importing your film, you may be concerned about the general dull look of your recordings. The reason for that is because you have not yet matched the color profile of your sequence to the one of your camera. To start on this process, it goes as follows.

* Drag your clip onto your timeline and make sure it is selected. Click on the Inspector icon.
* Then click on the Information tab of the clip.
* Navigate all the way down through the options to find the Color LUT option.
* Then choose the Color profile that matches your clip based on the camera it is filmed with.
* You're done!

##### Step3Checking the scopes

The Scopes in Final Cut Pro are panels that display the color information of your shots. They are quite complicated and can be difficult to comprehend if you did not use them ever before. You can activate Video Scopes by clicking View > Show in Viewer > Video Scopes from the View menu. The three components of grading are the highlights, mid-tones, and shadows. Your highlights are shown at the top and your shadows are at the bottom in all grading tools and scopes.

## 2\. Include Color Wheels

Now that your setup is complete, you can begin grading your footage. Grading is done in multiple layers stacked on top of each other. It may take multiple levels to create the desired look. Follow the instructions below to modify your settings to match your clip if you want to give your footage a cinematic look.

You may access a wider range of color manipulation tools with the built-in color wheels, exposure adjustments, including isolation of color selection, RGB modifications across tone ranges, and simple masking.

## 3\. Color board

A vertical color spectrum is shown on the Color Board, and it is intersected by a horizontal line that features four nodes. These are the ranges of the footage that are designated as the Highlights, Midtones, and Shadows, respectively.

Adjusting a node to a new color space has an immediate and noticeable impact on the corresponding section of the image. If you move above the horizontal line, it will increase, and if you go below the line, it will decrease.

You also have control over the Saturation and Exposure settings. These are wonderful to have if you want to increase the contrast in your photographs and make particular colors more vivid or muted.

## 4\. Masks

Using the Shape Masks feature, each of these individual effects can be perfect for particular regions of your footage. In addition, by utilizing a Color Mask, you can alter the appearance of a specific color. It is possible to apply multiple iterations of each color adjustment to a clip and find it listed under the Effect heading.

The order can be changed by dragging and dropping, and either method can be disabled or enabled. Utilizing keyframes allows for the effects of color grading to be specifically timed as well. Last but not least, keep in mind that the quality and color sample depth of the clips determine how much of an overall adjustment you are capable of making to a color.

## 5\. Color Curves

If you are experienced with more advanced picture editing software, such as Adobe Photoshop, you will benefit greatly from using color curves. Adjustments can be made independently to both the Luma (the brightest areas) and the primary composite colors (red, blue, and green).

## 6\. Match Colors

Match Color is an additional choice that may be made from the improvement's menu. This function will try to replicate the visual style of one video clip in another. First, choose the clip whose color you want to change, click on that clip that has the desired appearance, and last, choose Match Color.

You will still be able to utilize these settings as shortcuts even after you have gained more experience with manual grading and are comfortable making finer adjustments manually. It is important to keep in mind that while using Final Cut Pro X for color grading, effects can be layered on top of one another.

It's not likely that a single tool or adjustment will solve an issue or produce the desired result; rather, it's more likely that a number of different impacts will be required. In the same way that different visual effects in Final Cut Pro X may be toggled on and off, any layers that you add to a clip can have their visibility controlled from the Inspector window.

## Conclusion

In Final Cut Pro X, you may choose from a wide variety of grading plugins, ranging from more affordable solutions like FCPeffects to more expensive ones like Magic Bullet Looks, which are designed specifically for feature film-style grades.

Additionally, there is a variety of stand-alone applications for color grading, such as DaVinci Resolve and FilmConvert. You might be comfortable with their gear, but you should also know that their professional-grade color package includes some rather complex editing options.

Beginning to experiment with all of Final Cut Pro X's functions and determining which ones are most useful to you is the best method to gain an understanding of the program's color grading capabilities. If you don't currently have a project that requires your attention, you can download stock footage and experiment with it.

## Wedding Videography Checklist

### 1\. Get to know the couple

As a wedding videographer, it's important to get to know the couple you're working with. This will help you better capture the essence of their wedding day. Spend time talking to them, learn about their relationship, and find out what is important to them. By doing this, you'll be able to create a video that truly reflects who they are as a couple.

### 2\. Understand your videography style and skill level

Wedding videography can be done in a variety of styles, depending on your skill level and interests. Some videographers prefer to stay in the background and capture everything as it happens, while others like to get more involved, interviewing the couple and capturing special moments. It's important to understand what style you feel comfortable working in, and what the couple is looking for in a video.

If you're just starting out, it might be a good idea to stick to a more traditional style of videography. This will help you get the hang of things and build your skills before trying something more adventurous. However, if you have a lot of experience and are confident in your abilities, you may want to try something more creative. Be sure to discuss your ideas with the couple beforehand and make sure they're on board with what you want to do.

### 3\. Check with the venue to see where you can set up equipment

Check with the venue to see where you can set up equipment. Some venues may have restrictions on where you can set up your gear. If this is the case, be sure to work out a plan with the venue beforehand so that there are no surprises on the day of the wedding.

### 4\. Find out what equipment is needed

To be a successful wedding videographer, you'll need some basic equipment. This includes a good-quality video camera, tripod, microphone, and lighting. It's also a good idea to have some editing software on hand in case you need to do any post-production work. Be sure to discuss your needs with the couple ahead of time and make sure they're comfortable with what you plan on bringing along to the wedding.

### 5\. Get insurance for yourself and your gear

If you're going to be a wedding videographer, it's important to have insurance for yourself and your gear. This will help protect you in the event of an accident or damage to your equipment. There are a number of companies that offer insurance specifically for photographers and videographers, so be sure to shop around and find the best deal for you.

### 6\. Ask for a shot list from the couple in advance

This will help you know what specific shots they are hoping to get on their wedding day. Be sure to discuss the shot list with the couple and make sure you're both on the same page.

### 7\. Alert guests of their wedding video presence

Some couples may want to keep their wedding video a surprise, while others will want to let their guests know in advance that they'll be filmed. If the latter is the case, it's important to alert guests of your presence so that they're not caught off guard by the cameras. Be sure to discuss this with the couple beforehand and come up with a plan that everyone is comfortable with.

### 8\. Recruit an assistant videographer if you need one

If you're going to be filming the wedding by yourself, it's important to make sure you have all the necessary gear. However, if you're not comfortable doing this or feel like you might need some help, consider recruiting an assistant videographer. This person can help carry gear, set up equipment, and make sure everything is running smoothly on the day of the wedding.

### 9\. Have some backups on hand, just in case

Wedding videography is a big responsibility, and things can sometimes go wrong. Be sure to have some backups on hand, just in case. This includes extra batteries, memory cards, and cables. It's better to be safe than sorry, and having these backups will give you peace of mind knowing that you're prepared for anything.

### 10\. Arrive early to set up and test your equipment

This will help ensure that everything is working properly and that you're familiar with your surroundings. It's also a good idea to do a sound check to make sure the audio is coming through clearly. Be sure to allow yourself plenty of time to set up and test your equipment before the wedding begins.

### 11\. Capture both the big and small moments

While it's important to capture the big moments, such as the ceremony and speeches, don't forget about the smaller ones as well. These can often be just as special, if not more so. Be sure to keep your camera rolling throughout the entire event so that you don't miss a thing.

### 12\. Have fun

Wedding videography can be a lot of work, but it's also a lot of fun. Be sure to enjoy yourself and have a good time while you're working. This will come through in your final product and the couple will be sure to appreciate it.

This will help you know what specific shots they are hoping to get on their wedding day. Be sure to discuss the shot list with the couple and make sure you're both on the same page.

### 7\. Alert guests of their wedding video presence

Some couples may want to keep their wedding video a surprise, while others will want to let their guests know in advance that they'll be filmed. If the latter is the case, it's important to alert guests of your presence so that they're not caught off guard by the cameras. Be sure to discuss this with the couple beforehand and come up with a plan that everyone is comfortable with.

### 8\. Recruit an assistant videographer if you need one

If you're going to be filming the wedding by yourself, it's important to make sure you have all the necessary gear. However, if you're not comfortable doing this or feel like you might need some help, consider recruiting an assistant videographer. This person can help carry gear, set up equipment, and make sure everything is running smoothly on the day of the wedding.

### 9\. Have some backups on hand, just in case

Wedding videography is a big responsibility, and things can sometimes go wrong. Be sure to have some backups on hand, just in case. This includes extra batteries, memory cards, and cables. It's better to be safe than sorry, and having these backups will give you peace of mind knowing that you're prepared for anything.

### 10\. Arrive early to set up and test your equipment

This will help ensure that everything is working properly and that you're familiar with your surroundings. It's also a good idea to do a sound check to make sure the audio is coming through clearly. Be sure to allow yourself plenty of time to set up and test your equipment before the wedding begins.

### 11\. Capture both the big and small moments

While it's important to capture the big moments, such as the ceremony and speeches, don't forget about the smaller ones as well. These can often be just as special, if not more so. Be sure to keep your camera rolling throughout the entire event so that you don't miss a thing.

### 12\. Have fun

Wedding videography can be a lot of work, but it's also a lot of fun. Be sure to enjoy yourself and have a good time while you're working. This will come through in your final product and the couple will be sure to appreciate it.

## How to Create Chroma Key Written Text Effects in Filmora

Did you know it only takes a few clicks to key out the color in Filmora? It means that you can add green screen effects to many other objects. This article will show a cool chroma key effect you can try using written text.

## Part 1\. What Is Chroma Key Text Effect?

Composing of the chroma key effect is widely used in the gaming and newscasting industries. In this technique, you can make layering images and videos for the text together based on color hues.

![chroma key text effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/chroma-key-text-effect-1.png)

Video editors can eliminate the basis from a picture by automatically choosing a certain hue in post-production. An interactive animation results by adding different color schemes; it's an easy way to make 3D motion videos.

To make the effects on text, we have to film the subject writing on white paper. For this, follow the below instructions:

## Part 2\. Filming Tips for Written Texts

To write a key text before adding the chroma effect, we have to film the writing process to understand your next project better. You can create your own by following these tips. We are just concluding a single example here.

### Tip 1\. A Pen and a White Paper

We need blank white paper with no boundaries and lines for writing a text. Because the chroma effect will embellish the other lines if present on paper. Make sure to choose a prominent color for writing a text.

We are using a purple color pen here for writing an essential text to make it more prominent, as shown below:

![purple color pen on white paper](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/chroma-key-text-effect-2.png)

It all depends upon the contrast, and you can choose another color too but ensure that it's more apparent during filming.

### Tip 2\. Different Color Paper

There are many chances that you don't have only white paper in your studio, or your requirement is not going with a blank white sheet. Then you don't need to worry because you can use different color papers too.

But always try to use clearer paper and a prominent pen or highlighter. See the below example of a different color paper with a different highlighter.

![different color paper with different markers](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/chroma-key-text-effect-3.png)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Ensure that the colored pens have good contrast with colored paper. Don't use dull color pens with bright color paper.

### Tip 3\. Camera Angles

While filming a writing process for a video, you have to take care of the alignment of the camera. First, ensure the camera is at a suitable angle so it will not block the writing letters from the left side.

Sometimes, the writer's hand blocks the letters on the left side during writing. Take note of this tip during filming a professional video, as shown below.

![don't block the letters from the left side](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/chroma-key-text-effect-4.png)

After checking the alignment of the camera, it's time to look at what size we have to use for writing!

### Tip 4\. Larger Size of Letters

As we already said about the prominence of written text, we have to follow one more instruction related to the structure of the letters. Use the larger size and bold words when writing from a highlighter.

It is because the effect we insert during editing will be more standing and give a professional look to the video.

![the larger size of the written key text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/chroma-key-text-effect-5.png)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You can create more shots till you get the right angle for a final video. Just focus on the camera alignment and highlighted words, then it will be all set.

After filming all the clips, you must edit those shots on the Filmora to get the chroma effect. Scroll more to get the step-by-step process!
