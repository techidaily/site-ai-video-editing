Color grading can be a tedious process, especially if you don’t have the technical skills required to achieve the desired result. That’s where a LUT can come in handy. So, what is a LUT?

LUT stands for “look up table.” Simply put, a LUT is a color preset that you can apply to your video footage to speed up the color grading process. While LUTs are commonly used to speed up the color grading process, they can also be used for other tasks, such as color transfer between software, monitor calibration, and more.

In this article, we’ll explore a particular LUT – Leeming LUT Pro™ and how you can use it in various video editors.

## What is Leeming LUT Pro™?

Leeming LUT Pro™ is the world's first unified, corrective Look Up Table (LUT) system for supported cameras. It’s designed to maximize dynamic range, fix skin tones, remove unwanted color casts and provide an accurate Rec709 starting point for further creative color grading.

The Pro LUTs are designed for perfect Rec709 colorimetry and have a linear luma curve, with an average measured dE(2000) of less than 1\. As a result, they are visually indistinguishable from reality to the human eye.

Athena LUTs are a brighter version of Pro. They are designed around how the eye sees while retaining the same perfect colorimetry as Pro.

## Part 5: Bonus! Use Filmora – Easy to Use Video Editor for Color LUTs

Besides Final Cut Pro and PowerDirector, Filmora is another excellent video editing software that you can use to apply LUTs to your video.

Designed for beginners and intermediate users, Filmora is an intuitive yet powerful video editing software.

For instance, you can apply 3D LUTs to your video using Filmora. Unlike 1D LUTs, which can only control one value setting, 3D LUTs can allow you to control various value settings. As a result, 3D LUTs can give you more control over specific color values in your video.

Here’s how you can apply LUTs using Filmora:

### Step 1\.  Import the Footage

Launch Filmora and choose New Project. In the New Project window that opens, import the video you want to apply the LUT to by clicking on Import and selecting one of the drop-down options.

### Step 2\.  Add the Video to the Timeline

Drag and drop the video into your project’s timeline.

### Step 3\.  Open the Color Tab

Double click the video on the timeline to select it. Once it’s selected, go to the top left panel and click on the color tab.

![use lut in filmora - open color tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/leeming-lut-pro-5.jpg)

### Step 4\. Apply a LUT to the Video

Under the color tab, navigate to the 3D LUT option and select one of the available options in the 3D LUT drop-down menu to apply a LUT.

Many LUTs are named after popular TV shows and series whose visual styles they mimic, such as Batman, House of Cards, Game of Thrones, Mission Impossible, Harry Potter, Star Wars, and more.

Once you apply a LUT, you can see your changes in the Preview Window. Besides using the preset LUTs, Filmora also allows you to use custom LUTs. Instead of choosing one of the presets, click on the Load New LUT option to import your custom LUT into Filmora.

### Step 5\. Make Fine Adjustments

Once you apply a LUT, Filmora can allow you to make further modifications to the video. Click on the Advanced button at the bottom of the color tab to view advanced color correction options.

In the new window that opens, you can adjust several things, such as color, light, HSL, and more. You can also choose from a variety of other available presets.

![use lut in filmora - make adjustments](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/leeming-lut-pro-6.jpg)

### Step 6\. Save the Changes

## Conclusion

LUTs are a fast way to color grade your footage after color correction. However, to ensure your LUTs work effectively, here are some important guidelines you should observe when using LUTs:

* Ensure your footage matches from shot to shot, especially if you’re applying LUTs to multiple clips.
* Ensure your exposure is correct before using LUTs. You can use a histogram to help you set the exposure.
* Ensure you apply LUTs to a video that’s been properly color corrected.
* Make small adjustments to things, such as brightness, saturation, contrast, exposure, color temperature, and tint for best results.
* Test out various LUTs before settling for one because shooting conditions can drastically affect how different LUTs look.

Ultimately, LUTs are an excellent way to make your video more cinematic. If you don’t have advanced video editing skills or prior experience working with LUTs, don’t worry. Filmora is a user-friendly video editing software that allows you to quickly apply LUTs with no video editing experience. Just download Filmora for free to get started.

## Conclusion

LUTs are a fast way to color grade your footage after color correction. However, to ensure your LUTs work effectively, here are some important guidelines you should observe when using LUTs:

* Ensure your footage matches from shot to shot, especially if you’re applying LUTs to multiple clips.
* Ensure your exposure is correct before using LUTs. You can use a histogram to help you set the exposure.
* Ensure you apply LUTs to a video that’s been properly color corrected.
* Make small adjustments to things, such as brightness, saturation, contrast, exposure, color temperature, and tint for best results.
* Test out various LUTs before settling for one because shooting conditions can drastically affect how different LUTs look.

Ultimately, LUTs are an excellent way to make your video more cinematic. If you don’t have advanced video editing skills or prior experience working with LUTs, don’t worry. Filmora is a user-friendly video editing software that allows you to quickly apply LUTs with no video editing experience. Just download Filmora for free to get started.

Color grading can be a tedious process, especially if you don’t have the technical skills required to achieve the desired result. That’s where a LUT can come in handy. So, what is a LUT?

LUT stands for “look up table.” Simply put, a LUT is a color preset that you can apply to your video footage to speed up the color grading process. While LUTs are commonly used to speed up the color grading process, they can also be used for other tasks, such as color transfer between software, monitor calibration, and more.

In this article, we’ll explore a particular LUT – Leeming LUT Pro™ and how you can use it in various video editors.
