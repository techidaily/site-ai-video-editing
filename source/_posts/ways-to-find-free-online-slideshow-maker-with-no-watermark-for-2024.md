## **Part 1: What is a Video Background Changer?**

A video background changer is a tool that can swap the background of any video. These tools usually work in three simple steps.

* Analyze the footage,
* Separate the subject or “subjects” from the background,
* Switch backgrounds.

The process starts when a user uploads a video clip. The tool analyzes the footage and separates the subjects from the background. The user can select other available pre-made backgrounds or upload a preferred one to the platform. After this process, users can share the finished video or save it to their devices. Other kinds of background changers only merge a transparent clip with a background.
