## Part 1: How to Make a Countdown timer in After Effects

Developed by Adobe, After Effects is one of the most widely used animation software that is used for creating and editing videos using a wide range of functions supported by the application. Among other functions, After Effects facilitates adding a countdown timer to your videos and this task can be done in multiple ways.

Listed below are these different methods.

### Method 1\. Adding Countdown Timer in After Effects using Expression

![after effects text layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/complete-tutorial-on-after-effects-countdown-timer-adding-01.jpg)

Step2 Open the text options and click on Alt + Click on your PC (For the Mac -Option + Click) on the stopwatch of the Source Text.

Step3 Next, you need to insert the expression - timeToCurrentFormat() inside the expression area.

Step4 Now, set the composition frame rate to 60fps which will make it look like an actual countdown timer.

Step5 Now count it down, pre-compose everything and then reverse the speed of the composition.

Composition speed can be reversed, right-click on the same, go to Time and then choose Time Reverse Layer.

![after effects expressions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/complete-tutorial-on-after-effects-countdown-timer-adding-02.jpg)

Above are the steps for **timer expression after effects** process.

### Method 2\. Adding Countdown Timer in After Effects using the Timecode plugin

Next, follow the process as in the previous steps, and a countdown timer can be added.

Video to GIF conversion is one thing, besides that, you can also crop your videos using this tool. Wondering how to go about the process? Here’s a quick, stepwise tutorial to answer this for you. Follow the steps given below to crop your videos with a blink:

**●** **Step 1: Launch the Ezgif Crop Tool**

Open the official Ezgif website and navigate to the ‘Crop Video’ tab on the top toolbar in the welcome page. You can alternatively click on the link given below to reach the ‘Crop Video’ interface directly.

**●** **Step 2: Upload Your Video**

To upload a locally saved video, click on the ‘Choose File’ button. You will see the file name appear beside it. You can alternatively, copy-paste the URL of a desired video in the address box. Click on ‘Upload Video’ for the file to get uploaded.

**●** **Step 3: Adjust Video Borders**

To crop the video to a desired part, you need to set its borders within the required section. To do this, ‘Hold and Drag’ the mouse to highlight a desired section. Now leave the mouse to see the highlighted section within a frame.

**●** **Step 4: Final Touches**

After you have the desired section, scroll down to find some adjustment options. Here, you can resize, set aspect ratio and make frame adjustments to your cropping clip. When selecting the output video format, you can either choose to stick with the original file format or change to mp4.

Tap on ‘Crop Video’ when you are done making the changes. The conversion process may take a few seconds. You can enjoy looking at the swaying kitten in the meantime.
