**A Step-by-Step Guide to Merge FLV files on Windows/Mac using Wondershare Filmora**

**Step 1: Launch Wondershare Filmora and load FLV files…**

At the bottom of this FLV file merger, there lies a **Timeline**. Drag FLV files from the album to the Timeline and use the slider bar to help you arrange all FLV files in the Timeline without overlapping them.

**Alternative Way to Merge/Combine FLV Files on Windows**

**Joyoshare Media Cutter (Paid tool to merge FLV Files)**

Joyoshare Video Joiner for Windows is a comprehensive and user-friendly audio and video merging software that supports a wide range of file formats such as FLV, F4V, HD,4K, MP4, M4V, M4A, DV, MPEG, FLAV, WMA, and others. It is not only a superb video joiner for joining FLV files in batches without re-encoding, but it is also a video editor thanks to the built-in advanced editing tool. That means you can customize and enhance your FLV files as required before integrating them. The two combing modes (high-speed mode and encoding mode) it employs are also noteworthy. With high-speed mode, you can join an unlimited number of FLV files losslessly and swiftly. You can merge files in different formats without gaps and customize the codec, resolution, bit rate, frame rate, and other parameters of your FLV files while in encoding mode.

**A Step-by-Step Guide**

**Step 1: Add FLV files…**

First, go to the Joyoshare website and download the Joyoshare Video Joiner installation package. Install and configure it on your computer. Then, import FLV files into the video joiner. There are two options: click **"Open File"** to choose them or drag them directly into the software.

With the use of a **gear icon** beside the selected output format, users can change video settings such as resolution, bit rate, codes, and so on while in encoding mode.

![merge flv](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/merge-flv-6.jpg)

## Kinemaster Alternative to Edit Audio
