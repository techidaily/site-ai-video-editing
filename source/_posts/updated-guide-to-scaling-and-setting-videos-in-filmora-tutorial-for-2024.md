If you want to create a rounded-off edge look to the rectangle shape, tap on the small yellow icon that you will see at its edge. Move it slightly to adjust. Then, type the information into the shape text field, like "Listen on Spotify," and make font and shape size adjustments. After you have completed this step, press the OK button below.
