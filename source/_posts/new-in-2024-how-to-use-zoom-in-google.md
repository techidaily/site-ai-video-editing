## How to Use Zoom in Google

Zoom in and out is a feature in every presentation/editing tool, but we generally forget its importance until it is unavailable, and you will need alternatives. You imagine a situation where you will have to zoom in on the sheet in the presentation because your client is sitting far from the projector. After the presentation, you will have to zoom out, so the sheet becomes normal. **Zoom in google** is our daily activity on a computer.

Previously there were no such options in Google sheet to zoom or out. But, now Google has come up with this new feature. This article will explore the steps to zoom in and out of the whole page and the elements of Google Chrome. Now we will know about several ways of using the Zoom control. Let's start.

Step1Open the document.

Step2Click on the Zoom button.

Step3Select the zoom level.

This article will discuss the information on **Zoom into Google Docs.**

Several options are shared in all Google Apps. Users can share the Google files such as slideshows, spreadsheets, and documents from Google Drive or in-app. You can derive the zoom settings and many more in the app or drive.

Many productive applications we use on the PC will have a hundred percent zoom level which is the default. Depending upon the distance you sit from your monitor or the visual quality, the zoom level will be decided. If you find reading the word on the PC screen difficult, you must change the zoom level in your Google Docs.

Most applications specify a hundred percent as their default zoom level. But if you want to change the size to more minor or more extensive, you can use the zoom controller. Let's see the steps of **zoom into Google docs.**

Step1Sign in to Google Drive and open your documents where you want to zoom in or out.

Step2Click or Tap on the zoom button in the toolbar above the document and then choose the predefined zoom levels, or you can manually enter the preferred zoom level in the space.
