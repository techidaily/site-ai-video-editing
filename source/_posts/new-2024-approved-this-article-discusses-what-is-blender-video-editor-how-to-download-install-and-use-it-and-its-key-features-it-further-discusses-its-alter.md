## Detailed Steps to Add Border to Video Using Premiere Pro

The border is really important as it frames up all the video. It makes the video eye-catching and gives a vivid effect. It also fixes the automated cropping issues, especially on Instagram. Along with this, it helps the viewers to watch the video as you can add effects about fun, travel, guides and etc. accordingly. Adding a border is super easy and itâs not more than fun!

So letâs startâ¦

### **Way 1\.** **Using a Grid Effect**

* Change the **width** to **30**.

You have the option to change the color of the border.
