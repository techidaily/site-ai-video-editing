## How To Add Fade In Windows Video Editor

A recent development in the media business is the fading into and out of videos, which significantly improves and cools down a scene. It causes the movie to twist and gives it a photorealistic appearance, giving the sense of depth. Too much or too little fading might ruin the whole impact of the video that has been generated, which is why we're providing instructions on how to apply fade in Windows video editors.

People often search for How to Add Fade in after effects but in such tools, backgrounds are used to achieve fading, so what should you do if you want your movie on your Windows 10 desktop to fade to black, white, or another color? We suggest the solution in this article that would be of assistance. It is suggested that you apply the video fades using a backdrop clip which is either black or white. Video fades come in two varieties: fade in and fade out. A video or picture may gradually appear from a black, white, or colored backdrop using a technique called a "fade-in." On the other hand, a video or picture may gradually blend into a white, black, or multicolored backdrop using the fade-out technique.

## Part 1: How to Add Fade in Windows Video Editor

To begin with, you'll need top-notch editing software for your movies. We advise you to try Windows Video Editor if you use Windows. It is slick, simple, and enjoyable to use. The Microsoft Store's most downloaded video editing app is also this one. To test how it works, you may install it for free. The Windows video editor is a strong tool that makes it simple for users to utilize the fundamentals of video editing. It has the ability to move, concatenate, cut, and add the Fading effects to videos. However, it lacks the transitions needed to insert them into videos or in between them.

**Steps to Add Fade in Windows Video Editor**

Step1Open Windows Video Editor and choose the video clip you wish to apply a fade to.

Step2To display further effects, click the down arrow in the corner of the effects tray after selecting the Visual Effects tab. The effects are divided into a group named Motions and Fades. To get an explanation and a sample of what the effects do, hover your mouse cursor over the thumbnails of the effects.

The available effects include pixelate, ripple, and a simple fade in or fade out to black or white. Apply No Effect, the first thumbnail in the list of visual effects, after choosing the clip and the visual effect you wish to remove.

Step3Select the desired video portion, then click the Edit tab under Video Tools to fade the video sound. The ribbon's initial part is devoted to audio controls. One drop-down choice is for fade in, and the other is for fade out. You may choose none, slow, medium, or quick for each of them.

## Part 3: FAQs Regarding Video Fade

### 1\. What is the fade panel in Windows video editor?

In the windows video editor, there is a panel for basic video editing tools. But for fading in/out of a video or text, there is no option available. The built-in windows tool does not have any option of 'transition'. It straight forwardly moves from one video clip to the other without any sort of transition because Microsoft believe these transitions to be lame and unnecessary. Hence, they are not available. In case of Filmora, and other such tools, there is a straight up option for transitions where you can fade in and out with a lot of other cool stuff. For fading you can follow the method mentioned above in the article.

### 2\. How do I fade text in Windows video editor?

As stated earlier, there is no option for fading in windows video editor, hence, even the text cannot be faded in or out. There is a panel for basic video editing tools in the Windows video editor. However, there is no ability for a video or text to fade in and out. There is no "transition" option in the built-in Windows programme. Microsoft considers these transitions to be unnecessary, so it simply switches from one video clip to the next without making any other effects.

### 3\. How do I fade out music in Windows video editor?

There is no direct command for making the music or sound fade out but you can do it manually, that is, in the video where ever you want the music or sound to fade out is that you can trim that clip out and then divide into two more clips. You can take the first of the two clips and lower its sound and in the next clip, you can mute the clip, note: the clips must be kept small, otherwise it will sound quite weird. If the respective lengths of the clips are kept quite small, only then will the fade feel natural. Due to unavailability of a direct command, fading the music out can be a very taxing job.

### The Bottom Line

The built-in video editor for Windows does not have a direct option, therefore fading procedures cannot be utilized without downloading and installing other software, such as Filmora, which may assist with such problems. Filmora comes with built-in tools for text, video, and audio fading. In Filmora, there are at least four different ways to fade media. As a consequence, the conclusion we reach is that although the Windows video editor is strong and useful in a professional setting, it cannot be utilized to create effects that are often employed in the current world to draw in viewers.

## How To Make A Video Longer

These days when you head on to social media, you can easily find 4-5 seconds video clips on the internet. However, many social media platforms like YouTube, Instagram, and other videos sharing platforms require you to make your video longer to meet the site’s minimum length requirements. So, for example, although Instagram’s minimum length is 3 seconds, you might want to find ways to engage your audience longer.

This article will describe the best ways to make a video longer. We’ll also offer a bonus tip on how you can edit your video to make it look better and attract more audience. On that note, let’s take a look.

**6 Best Methods to Make a Video Longer**

There are many methods out there to make your video longer. This section will touch on the six best methods to make a video longer.

**Loop the Video**

![make-video-longer-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/make-video-longer-1.jpg)

One of the best ways to make your video longer for most social media platforms is to loop the video. When you replay the video several times in a single row, it helps to multiply its length. An example is taking a 2-second video and looping it 4x. This automatically makes it into an 8-second video clip. With looping, you can simply replay the action of the clip rather than altering it in any way.

Many video editing software today allows you to loop your video for free. You have to upload the video and choose how many times you would like to loop it, and the software will get to work.

**Slow Down the Video Speed**

![make-video-longer-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/make-video-longer-2.jpg)

We would all agree that slow-motion makes everything seem longer automatically. You can utilize the same technique when you want to make a video longer. When you slow down a video clip, every second lasts longer. Using the slow-motion effect on a 3-second video will make the video 6 or even 9 seconds longer.

**Add an Intro and Outro**

![make-video-longer-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/make-video-longer-3.jpg)

Intro and outro are scenes you add before and after the video; these scenes are popular in YouTube videos. More generally, an intro is like a trailer. It shows the audience what the video is about, and the outro scene is usually used to show more information about the video maker. Adding an intro and outro to your video can add 2-4 seconds to your video clips.

It’s quite easy to add an intro and outro to any video. You can create them separately and then merge them with your video. The intro must be something relevant to the video clip; an example is adding a fast photo slideshow to the beginning of your video or a black frame. Relevant intro and outro scenes will make your video longer and maybe more engaging.

**Add Images to the Video**

This is another trick that most bloggers use to make their videos longer. It is an old trick in the book and makes your video significantly longer, depending on the number of videos you’re adding. A single picture can add a second or two to your video. You can simply use a video editor to merge the video clip and pictures into one seamless file.

**Boomerang Your Video**

![make-video-longer-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/make-video-longer-4.jpg)

If you have plans to upload your media to Instagram, then a top feature you can use to make your video longer is the boomerang feature. Instagram introduced the Boomerang feature to play short video clips forward and then repeat their reverse. So by using the Boomerang feature, you don’t only add a memory effect to your video, but you also make your video longer.

Alternatively, you can manually append your video clip to a reversed version; this option allows you to make a boomerang from an existing clip. Apart from Instagram, you can utilize many other editing tools to create a boomerang from an existing video.

**Add More Content to Your Video Clip**

![make-video-longer-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/make-video-longer-5.jpg)

Another step you can take is to add more materials to your video. This doesn’t necessarily mean you have to get your camera out and start shooting more scenes to add to your video. Instead, you can simply access online media libraries and get amazing materials from there that are relevant to your video clip.

Today, most professional video editors offer you access to royalty-free photos and music material. You can simply browse through their collections and pick materials relevant to your video. For example, you could add a soundtrack and videos or GIFs that make your videos engaging. Adding extra content to your video clip can make it longer by 10 seconds.

**Bonus Tips: How to Edit Video Easily on a Computer**

Social media platforms offer you basic video editing features that you can use to optimize your video. However, these features are limited in what they can provide you with.

**Slow Down the Video Speed**

![make-video-longer-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/make-video-longer-2.jpg)

We would all agree that slow-motion makes everything seem longer automatically. You can utilize the same technique when you want to make a video longer. When you slow down a video clip, every second lasts longer. Using the slow-motion effect on a 3-second video will make the video 6 or even 9 seconds longer.

**Add an Intro and Outro**

![make-video-longer-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/make-video-longer-3.jpg)

Intro and outro are scenes you add before and after the video; these scenes are popular in YouTube videos. More generally, an intro is like a trailer. It shows the audience what the video is about, and the outro scene is usually used to show more information about the video maker. Adding an intro and outro to your video can add 2-4 seconds to your video clips.

It’s quite easy to add an intro and outro to any video. You can create them separately and then merge them with your video. The intro must be something relevant to the video clip; an example is adding a fast photo slideshow to the beginning of your video or a black frame. Relevant intro and outro scenes will make your video longer and maybe more engaging.

**Add Images to the Video**

This is another trick that most bloggers use to make their videos longer. It is an old trick in the book and makes your video significantly longer, depending on the number of videos you’re adding. A single picture can add a second or two to your video. You can simply use a video editor to merge the video clip and pictures into one seamless file.

**Boomerang Your Video**

![make-video-longer-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/make-video-longer-4.jpg)

If you have plans to upload your media to Instagram, then a top feature you can use to make your video longer is the boomerang feature. Instagram introduced the Boomerang feature to play short video clips forward and then repeat their reverse. So by using the Boomerang feature, you don’t only add a memory effect to your video, but you also make your video longer.

Alternatively, you can manually append your video clip to a reversed version; this option allows you to make a boomerang from an existing clip. Apart from Instagram, you can utilize many other editing tools to create a boomerang from an existing video.

**Add More Content to Your Video Clip**

![make-video-longer-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/make-video-longer-5.jpg)

Another step you can take is to add more materials to your video. This doesn’t necessarily mean you have to get your camera out and start shooting more scenes to add to your video. Instead, you can simply access online media libraries and get amazing materials from there that are relevant to your video clip.

Today, most professional video editors offer you access to royalty-free photos and music material. You can simply browse through their collections and pick materials relevant to your video. For example, you could add a soundtrack and videos or GIFs that make your videos engaging. Adding extra content to your video clip can make it longer by 10 seconds.
