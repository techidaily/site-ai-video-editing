Let’s assume you are taking an online class via Zoom. You find a YouTube video that you believe can help explain the topic to your students. During the lecture on Zoom, just like viewing a video on a projector or a screen, you can share your chosen YouTube video with the rest of the class easily.

You and your friends are having a group video chat on Zoom. While laughing at something your friend said, you suddenly remember seeing a reaction video meme on YouTube that would exactly fit the situation. You quickly search it up and share it with your friends, who then applaud you for your choice.

These are just some of the scenarios where you might have to share YouTube videos on Zoom. A whole set of different reasons may arise, which can cause you to share a YouTube video with your Zoom attendees. If such an instance arises, you need to learn how to do that quickly and efficiently.

Below, you can find two different methods using which you can seamlessly share a YouTube video of your choice on Zoom. The methods are accompanied by a step-by-step guide and relevant images, so you don't get lost along the way.
