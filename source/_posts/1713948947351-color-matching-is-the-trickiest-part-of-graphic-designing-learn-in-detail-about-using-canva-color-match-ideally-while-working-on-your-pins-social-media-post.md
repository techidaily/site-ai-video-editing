## Twitch Green Screen Guide

Green screens are a fun way for creators to bring their personality to their stream, allowing them to dynamically alter their stream background and make their content appear even more engaging and polished.

## Conclusion

You probably already have an idea of how to use a green screen, at least in principle. You film something or someone in front of a colored background — the green screen — then you replace everything that’s in the color of the screen with other footage, images, charts, presentations, or whatever visuals you want. However, Chroma keying a live stream works almost the same way. The main difference is that you have to replace the green screen as you’re filming, rather than during editing.

**Pro tip**:

You can follow the instructions above and live stream to multiple platforms at once with Restream. Multistreaming to platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Twitch, and LinkedIn allows you to drastically increase the audience reach and grow your followers.

## Conclusion

You probably already have an idea of how to use a green screen, at least in principle. You film something or someone in front of a colored background — the green screen — then you replace everything that’s in the color of the screen with other footage, images, charts, presentations, or whatever visuals you want. However, Chroma keying a live stream works almost the same way. The main difference is that you have to replace the green screen as you’re filming, rather than during editing.

**Pro tip**:

You can follow the instructions above and live stream to multiple platforms at once with Restream. Multistreaming to platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Twitch, and LinkedIn allows you to drastically increase the audience reach and grow your followers.

### XBOX

It is a video gaming brand created and owned by Microsoft. The brand consists of five video game consoles, as well as applications(games), streaming services, an online service by the name of Xbox network, and the development arm by the name of Xbox Game Studios. The brand was first introduced in the United States in November 2001, with the launch of the original Xbox console.

**Steps on Using Xbox Green Screen**

Make your Xbox console reflect your personal style by changing its look and feel. Choose a favourite colour, update your background with game art or a customised image, or select a different theme.

**Choose your color**

The color you choose will appear in tiles and accents on your Xbox. It also follows you to any console you sign in to.

1. Press the Xboxbutton  on your controller to open the guide, and then select Profile & system > Settings > General > Personalisation > My color & theme > My color.
2. Select a color, and then select OK.

****Choose your background**

Your background appears where you’d expect it to—in the background of Home. It can be a solid color or an image, such as game art, achievement art, a screenshot, or a customized image. Achievement art follows you to any Xbox, but screenshots and customized images stay on the console that they’re set to.

To choose your background, press the Xbox button  on your controller to open the guide, and then select Profile & system > Settings > General > Personalization > My background.

From here, choose from the following options:

****Solid color and game art**

Select a background color, and then select OK. To then add game art, choose the game most recently played and the game art will appear as the background.

****Achievement art**

1. Select Achievement art> Gaming.
2. Select a game from your list of games with achievements.
3. Select the achievement with the background art you want.
4. Select Set as background.

****Custom image**

Note Customized images must be smaller than 3 MB, and the best size for backgrounds is 1920 x 1080.

1. Copy a JPG or PNG file that you want to use to a USB device, and then plug it into your Xbox.
2. On your Xbox, select Customized image. A dialogue box appears that shows the contents of your console and attached USB device.
3. Select the USB device, and then choose your image.

****Screenshot**

1. Select Screenshot, then choose the one you want.
2. Select More actions> Set as background.

****Dynamic background**

Note Dynamic backgrounds are only available on Xbox Series X|S.

1. Select Dynamic background.
2. Select the background art you want.
3. Select Apply.

Note Some dynamic backgrounds are only available through promotions with special edition hardware (like the 20th Anniversary Special Edition controller). To see one of these special dynamic backgrounds in your list of options, make sure your special edition hardware is turned on and in use with your console when you set your background.

****Remove customized background**

If you want to remove your background, select Remove customized background.

****Choose your theme**

Themes can be set to dark or light and can also be scheduled. To set a theme:

1. Press the Xboxbutton  on your controller to open the guide, and then select Profile & system > Settings > General > Personalization.
2. Select My color & theme.
3. Under System theme, select Darkor Light. Select Scheduled to activate your theme according to specific times, or to start at sunrise and sunset.

## How to Zoom Video in VLC Media Player

Even though VLC Media Player is not the default video player in any operating system, most users install VLC Player separately on their computers. This is because VLC Media Player offers several useful and advanced features that the default media player like Windows Media Player lacks. There are situations when users need to zoom into certain parts of a video, and that is where VLC zoom in video feature comes in handy.

You may need to zoom into videos to pay attention to details and focus on parts around the subject that others are missing out. For example, you have recorded a video, and you have played it on VLC to zoom in and ensure that there is nothing distracting before you publish the video. Now, we will illustrate all the different ways on how to zoom in VLC Media Player. We will also suggest a better alternative to zoom into videos easily.

## Part 1: Zoom VLC Video Using Interactive Zoom

VLC Media Player comes with Interactive Zoom feature that lets you zoom into a section of a video irrespective of its resolution. You can use Interactive Zoom feature to zoom nearly eight times the original size of the video. While you zoom your video with Interactive Zoom option, VLC Media Player zooms the video digitally, and if the video resolution is not high, you can see some deterioration in video quality as you zoom in. Here are the steps on how to VLC zoom with Interactive Zoom.

Step1First, you have to enable Interactive Zoom feature. Launch VLC Player and go to Tools menu option.

Step2Select Effects and Filters and you will see Adjustments and Effects window open.

Step3Go to Video Effects tab and then go to Geometry tab.

Step4Turn on Interactive Zoom option. Click on Save and Close buttons.

![zoom in vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/vlc-adjustments-and-effects.jpg)

Step5Play a video and you will see a Picture in Picture window in the top-left corner where you can see live preview of the video. You will notice a rectangular box that you can drag around the PiP window to zoom that section of the video.

![zoom in vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/vlc-pic-in-pic.jpg)

Step6Wherever you place the rectangular box in PiP window, that part will be zoomed and shown outside the PiP window. You can increase or decrease the level of magnification from the vertical slider present below PiP window.

## Part 2: Zoom Video Using VLC Video Menu

Apart from Interactive Zoom, there is also an inbuilt Zoom option available under Video Menu. While Interactive Zoom is for detailed zooming, Zoom through Video menu on VLC is for instant zooming. Moreover, Zoom through Video menu is effective only when you view the video on VLC Player. If you are watching the video on full screen, the zooming effect will not be easily noticeable. Here are the steps on how to zoom in VLC player using VLC Video menu.

Step1Open VLC Media player in windowed mode and play the desired video.

Step2Go to Video menu and select Zoom option.

Step3You will come across several options such as 1:4 quarter, 1:2 half, 1:1 original, and 2:1 double. You can select from one of them as per your requirements.

![zoom in vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/choose-vlc-zoom-options.jpg)

Otherwise, you can press Shift + Z keys together to try out different zoom options.

## Part 3: Zoom VLC Video Using Magnifier

If you are using VLC Media Player on your Windows desktop computer, you can use the inbuilt Magnifier tool to zoom into a video that you are playing on VLC. You can zoom into videos to read any text in the background but this leads to low resolution and distortion. You can zoom in by 16 times which is the highest among all the three methods. Here are the steps on how to VLC zoom video using Magnifier tool.

Step1Open VLC Player and play the desired video.

Step2Go to Start menu on Windows and search for “Magnifier”.

![zoom in vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/zoom-vlc-video-magnifier.jpg)

Step3Click on Magnifier App. Once it opens, place the mouse pointer on the video and you will see its magnified version.

Step4Press Windows and “+” keys to zoom in while press Windows and “-“ keys to zoom out.

## Part 4: VLC Alternative to Zoom in Videos

If you are not satisfied with VLC Player zoom feature, you can use a video editor to zoom into your video conveniently so that you can check any focused section on your video. You can also read any text on the video comfortably. We recommend [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) as an alternative to VLC Media Player for zooming into videos. Filmora is a professional video editor and here is the list of the steps on how to zoom into videos with Filmora.

Step 1: Download and install Wondershare Filmora and it is available for Windows and Mac users.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

Step 2: Launch Wondershare and click on New Project option.

Step 3: Import your video on Filmora into Project Media folder by drag and drop option.

![zoom in vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/get-started-with-filmora-02.png)

Step 4: Drag and drop the video file into Timeline. Click on Crop icon on the top bar of Timeline.

Step 5: Go to Pan & Zoom tab and move the rectangular box and play the video to watch its magnified video. You can also export the video after cropping in your desired file format.

## Conclusion

There are several scenarios when you need to zoom into a video to focus on the details. VLC Media Player comes with instant zoom as well as detailed zoom options to satisfy your requirements. You can even use Magnifier App on Windows to zoom into videos. But for the best result, we recommend Wondershare Filmora as the best VLC Player alternative for zooming videos.
