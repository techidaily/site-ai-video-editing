## How To Mirror a Video Clip in Premiere Pro

Video editing is a crucial part of filmmaking, and it can make or break the outcome of a project. Adobe Premiere Pro is a widely used video editing software that provides a vast range of tools for professional video editing. One of the features that Premiere Pro offers is the ability to mirror video clips, which can add an interesting visual element to your footage.

In this article, we will look at how to mirror a video clip in Premiere Pro in a few simple steps. Whether you're a seasoned video editor or just starting, this guide will help you achieve the desired effect in your videos. From basic mirroring to advanced techniques, we will cover everything you need to know to create a symmetrical and visually appealing look in your projects.

![mirror videos in adobe premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-premiere-pro-mirror-video.JPG)

## What Is To "Mirror" a Video?

Mirroring a video in Adobe Premiere Pro refers to reflecting the footage along either the horizontal or vertical axis. This results in the composition being flipped and reversed, creating a reflection-like effect. Flipping a video is distinct from rotating it, as the orientation of the elements is changed, but their position remains the same.

Flipping can serve both creative and practical purposes. On the one hand, it can add a unique and visually interesting element to a project, creating a form of self-reflection or self-analysis. On the other hand, flipping can also be used to correct videos accidentally captured upside down. For example, flipping a video recorded with a selfie camera along the horizontal axis will correctly display the right side up.

It is important to note the distinction between flipping and rotating a video. A flipped video will look like a mirror image, whereas a video rotated 180 degrees will not. By understanding the differences between these techniques, you can effectively use mirroring to achieve the desired result in your projects.

## Part 3: Zoom In and Out on Discord Website

If you are using the web version of Discord, there are multiple ways to zoom in. On your native web browser, you can access the ellipses icon at the right and find the “Zoom” option. From here, you can simply click on the “+” icon to zoom in and the “-” icon to zoom out on the page you have opened at the moment.

If you prefer to change the Zoom settings using Discord’s native settings, you can easily do so in the web version using keyboard shortcuts. Here is an in-depth guide indicating **how to zoom out in Discord** for the online version.

**Step 1:** Launch the web browser on your computer and open the online version of the Discord software. You might be asked to sign in to your profile at this point.

![open discord on browser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/zoom-in-and-out-discord-10.jpg)

**Step 2:** Once you are at the homepage of your Discord profile, you can access the keyboard shortcuts to zoom in or out. To zoom in on Discord, simply hold the "CTRL" key on your keyboard and click the "+" icon key. Each click of the key will result in a 10% increase in the zoom level of the screen.

**Step 3:** If you want to zoom out on Discord’s screen, you can use your keyboard. Similar to the step mentioned above, tap the “-” key on your keyboard while holding down the “Ctrl” key to make your screen and chat appear smaller.

![decrease zoom on discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/zoom-in-and-out-discord-12.jpg)

**Step 4:** You can reset the zoom settings to default by holding down the “Ctrl” key and hitting “0” on the keyboard. This will restore the settings back to the default 100%.

## Part 4: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### Are Discord zoom and text size settings different?

Yes, there is a difference between the zoom levels and the text size settings on Discord. By changing the zoom levels of the software, you alter the zoom level of all the elements, including icons, images, windows, and more, across the Discord application. Changing the text size settings will simply alter the chat font scale in a specific chat window.

### Does changing the Discord zoom on my PC affect the settings on my mobile app?

No, all the changes made on the zoom level or text size of Discord remain limited to the version of the software you are currently using. If you change the zoom settings on your PC, the change will not be reflected on your mobile application.

## Conclusion

Digital chatting applications such as Discord have made it exceedingly easy to stay in touch with friends and family over long distances. From sending and receiving messages to voice and video calls, you can do a lot with Discord.

If you are a Discord user, knowing how to alter the zoom level on the app can prove to be incredibly beneficial. By changing the zoom settings on Discord, you can make the text, images, and other items present on the screen appear bigger or smaller. With the guide mentioned above, you now know **how to zoom in on Discord** across the mobile, desktop, and web.
