Being one of the spotlight features of Flixpress, this one really makes it stand out. With this feature, you won’t have to wonder what your video would look like as you can render a free watermarked preview. If you’re working for someone, you can send this preview to your client or boss for approval and tweak data before the final render.

Other than that, these previews can also be used as templates if you wish to duplicate the same video with variable data.

## How to Make Intro Video With Flixpress?

Creating intro videos with Flixpress is a pretty straightforward job, and the steps listed below aim to streamline the F**lixpress intro** making process for you.

##### Step1 Open the Webpage

Start off by opening the web browser on your PC or laptop and accessing the homepage of Flixpress by following the link below.

[https://flixpress.com](https://flixpress.com/)

Once you’re at the homepage, you need to register your account by clicking on the Register button.

![open the webpage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/create-intro-video-with-flixpress-1.jpg)

##### Step2 Signup

Upon clicking on the register button, you will be redirected to another page that will provide you with two options to signup on **flixpress online video maker**.

The first option allows you to sign up with your Google account, and if you opt for it, your Flixpress account will be linked to your Google account, and the credentials will be filled out automatically.

However, the second option asks for manual entry of your personal information that includes your first name, last name, email address, and password.

You can select either of them and then press the Register button below.

![signup](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/create-intro-video-with-flixpress-2.jpg)

##### Step3 Knowing the Subscription Plans

After the successful completion of the registration process, you will get to the main page of Flixpress, where all the templates will be visible to you, and the type of your plan will also be visible.

Initially, it will be a free plan, and you will be allowed to edit a 2 min video in it. However, you have the option to upgrade to a paid plan where a lot of other features will be unlocked, and you can edit more videos of greater lengths as well.

##### Step4 Sorting and Filtering the Templates

When you’re on the main page, all the templates will be visible to you, and these will include paid ones. If you've not bought a paid subscription, you will have to sort out the **flixpress free templates**, which can be done in two ways.

1. Click on the “Sort by” drop-down and choose the option that says “Free First”. This will put all the free templates at the top.
2. Click on the “Show for plan” drop-down and select the “Free” option to only view the free templates.

![sorting and filtering the templates](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/create-intro-video-with-flixpress-3.jpg)

##### Step5 Customize the Template

Once all the free templates are visible to you, you can select a template that you like. Then, you’re required to click the “Customize Now” button to customize the video.

![customize the template](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/create-intro-video-with-flixpress-4.jpg)

##### Step6 Upload Image

Now, you will be prompted to upload an image from your PC or laptop so click the “Upload Image” button and choose the image you want to upload.

Once you've uploaded the image, click on “Proceed” button and crop the image to fit the subtitles.

![upload image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/create-intro-video-with-flixpress-5.jpg)

##### Step7 Customize Text, Add Audio, Change Resolution & Create Preview

Even though the image subtitle will be made, you will still have the option to swap the image if you change your mind. Other than that, select the main title of the intro video and the color of the text as well.

Moreover, you can add audio as per your need and preference, and you can choose a resolution for the intro video too.

Once everything is done, create the preview to have a final look before rendering it.

## What are the downsides of Flixpress?

While the F**lixpress intro maker** is a great choice for making intro videos, it may miss out on a few features. Other than that, individuals who have used Flixpress complained about the bad customer service that they offered, even to those who had signed up for the membership. Now, that can be quite frustrating, right?

We found a few major missing in Flixpress.

* The number of templates is limited.
* The content is rarely updated.
* The customer service they offered is poor. People can't get help with their problems, especially when those who sign up for membership want to cancel their subscription.

What if we were to tell you that there is an even better and professional tool that Flixpress?
