## Part 1\. What Is WMV File?

WMV file format is from a sequence of video codecs, and it was developed by Microsoft. The full abbreviation of WMV is 'Windows Media Video.' WMV is a compressed file container that was made for the Windows Media Framework. It is mainly used for the video content that is to be sold either online or through HD DVDs and Blu-ray Discs.

![what is wmv format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/guide-about-wmv-format-1.jpg)

WMV format files support the encryption for the use with Digital Rights Management (DRM) systems, protecting the content from copywriting and any unlawful production. The WMV file may contain animation, high-definition videos, TV episodes, or video clips.

WMV compresses large files for better data transmission over a network while maintaining quality standards. It is specifically designed to run on all Windows devices. After standardization by the Society of Motion Pictures and Television Engineering (SMPTE), WMV is now considered to be an open standard format.

On the contrary, MP4 is supported by all the video players available for both Windows and Mac users; along with that, every online tool also supports MP4 format for video editing.

Now the world demands quality. In terms of quality, MP4 has better quality than WMV. WMV has lost the battle of quality provision against WMV. MP4 is a larger file than WMV in terms of file size. It is less compressed than WMV format, but the compression gives WMV an advantage over MP4.

Having a compressed file format produces files of smaller size, which can be easily stored. Easy storage of video files makes WMV a better option in places where the quality of the video can be compromised.
