The gaming world is ever-changing, with developers looking to create innovative ways to immerse players into their digital worlds. One such technology that has begun to sweep is **AI in the game industry**.

AI is a powerful tool in many ways to improve the gaming experience. It can make **artificial intelligence in computer games** more believable and add replayability and immersion to games, and we can expect to see even more impressive applications in the future.

#### In this article

01 [What Is AI in Gaming?](#Part 1)

02 [Why Does AI in Gaming Matter?](#Part 2)

03 [How AI Will Completely Change Video Games](#Part 3)

04 [8 Games with Incredible Artificial Intelligence](#Part 4)

05 [What AI Video Games Assets Do Filmora Have?](#Part 5)

## Part 1 **What Is AI in Gaming?**

In simple terms, AI is a set of algorithms that allow a computer to learn and improve from experience. Although you can apply it in many ways, **artificial intelligence in video games** is usually helpful to create more intelligent and more believable non-player characters (NPCs).

For example, an AI system might be helpful to determine how an NPC reacts to the player's actions. If the player tries to steal from an NPC, the AI might make the NPC angry and more likely to attack the player. Alternatively, if the player is friendly to an NPC, the **AI game playing** might make the NPC more likely to help the player in future interactions.

## Part 2 **Why Does AI in Gaming Matter?**

One of the most vital aspects of **AI in video games** is that it can make games more believable and immersive for players. When games can convincingly simulate human-like behavior, it can be a much more enjoyable experience for gamers. AI can make NPCs seem more lifelike and make the game world feel more believable.

AI is also becoming increasingly important for creating procedural content. This is where the game generates content on its own, rather than relying on pre-made assets. For example, a game might use procedural generation to create random dungeons or quests that the player can explore. This can add a lot of replayability to a game, as the player never knows what they will encounter next.

## Part 3 **How AI Will Completely Change Video Games**

It is not a secret that AI is changing the world as we know it. With its ability to enable computers to learn and improve from experience, AI is paving the way for a future where machines can handle more complex tasks. And nowhere is this more apparent than in the world of video gaming.

In the past, developers brought in AI primarily for simple things like making certain NPCs (non-player characters) move and act realistically. But now, **artificial intelligence in video games** is being used for much more complex tasks like generating procedural content and creating believable human-like behavior. This results in a new generation of **AI game playing** that are more immersive and playable.

## Part 4   **Games with Incredible Artificial Intelligence**

One of the most vital aspects of **AI in video games** is that it can make games more believable and immersive for players. When games can convincingly simulate human-like behavior, it can be a much more enjoyable experience for gamers. AI can make NPCs seem more lifelike and make the game world feel more believable.

AI is also becoming increasingly important for creating procedural content. This is where the game generates content on its own, rather than relying on pre-made assets.

This can add a lot of replayability to a game, as the player never knows what they will encounter next.

## Part 1\. What is VN editor?

VN editor is one of the best choices for video editing on mobiles and Mac. Fast editing, transitions, effects, filters, colors, subtitles, music, and many other features make the VN video editing app a great tool for producing and editing videos. It aims to make editing shorter and more feature-rich, empowering everyone to take control of their own lives. You cannot only produce great videos but good films as well. In the following, we will discuss how you can add LUTs to your videos using it.

## Part 2\. How to use LUTs in VN editor?

First, we must know that it is compatible with which platforms. So, it is now available for Android, iOS, and Mac OS only. However, you can also use it on Windows with some Android or iOS emulators, but it is not a very continent way in our suggestions. Even after doing this, it does not work well on your Windows. Maybe you will face some glitches or malfunctioning problems. So it is better to use it on only those platforms for which it is primarily available. Please read the instructions below since we will go through how to use LUTs in it later on.

**On Mac:**

First of all, we will learn how you can do it on Mac:

1. Download the VN Editor for Mac and open it.
2. Add your video and then tap the filters option.

![tap the filters option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/luts-fo-vn-editor-completed-2.jpg)

1. Now choose custom filters and then select the LUTs pack.

![select the luts pack](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/luts-fo-vn-editor-completed-3.jpg)

1. Select the desired LUT and apply.

![select the desired lut and apply](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/luts-fo-vn-editor-completed-4.jpg)

**On Mobile:**

Secondly, we will discuss how we can do this on our mobiles (Android or iOS). The procedure on both devices (Android or iOS) is almost comparable. Therefore, we will discuss the steps from the perspective of both of these here:

1. First, download the VN editor from your mobile app store (Android or iOS) and the LUTs pack you want to use in your video.

![download the vn editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/luts-fo-vn-editor-completed-5.jpg)

1. After downloading them on your mobile, open the VN editor application.
2. Create a new project and add your video to it.

![create a new project](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/luts-fo-vn-editor-completed-6.jpg)

1. Then click on the **Filters** option and select add external or custom filters option next to the existing filters.

![click on the filters](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/luts-fo-vn-editor-completed-7.jpg)

1. It will take you to the File manager of your mobile, from which you have to find the folder in which you have stored your LUTs.

![file manager](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/luts-fo-vn-editor-completed-8.jpg)

1. After finding them, you can select those LUTs you want to use in your video and then click on the done or select button.

![click on the done or select button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/luts-fo-vn-editor-completed-9.jpg)

1. Your downloaded LUTs start showing in the VN editor, and you can use them in your videos as you want.
