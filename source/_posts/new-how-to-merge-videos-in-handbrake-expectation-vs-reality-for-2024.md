## This Blog Post Will Walk You Through How to Resize Videos Using VLC. We'll Cover What the Default Settings Are for Video Resolutions, How to Change Them, and Why It's Important to Know What Size of Video You're Uploading Before Uploading It

Videos are one of the most popular types of content on the internet. There are millions of videos uploaded to YouTube, Facebook, and other video-sharing sites each day. Sharing your videos with others is possible when you know how to resize them in VLC. VLC is a free media player that allows you to convert or compress your videos in order to make them smaller for uploading or downloading.

Videos are a great way to showcase your business, company, or product on social media sites like Facebook and Twitter. But what happens when you use the wrong size for your video? The whole thing looks distorted and low quality. It's not very appealing.

Luckily, resizing videos in VLC is simple. All you need is the right software and the right steps.

This blog post will walk you through how to resize videos using VLC. We'll cover what the default settings are for video resolutions, how to change them, and why it's important to know what size of video you're uploading before uploading it.

So without further ado, let's get started!

## Step by step to resize your video in VLC

Anyone who has a lot of videos on their computer knows how frustrating it can be to find the video you want among the hundreds of ones you have. Well, VLC makes it possible to resize your videos so they'll fit onto your desktop. Here's how:

### Resizing by converting to a smaller file size

Because some video formats, such as MKV and AVI, take up too much space, it's a good idea to convert videos to smaller formats, such as FLV, WMV, and so on. To lower the video size, you'll be pleased to learn that VLC allows you to convert video/audio files without the need to install any other software. The video conversion guide for VLC can be found below.

Step 1: Launch the VLC Media Player.

![resize-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-vlc-1.png)

Step 2: Go to the menu and pick Media > Convert/Save from the drop-down menu, then Add > Convert/Save from the drop-down menu.

![resize-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-vlc-2.png)

Step 3: Choose a profile for the video you wish to convert.

![resize-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-vlc-3.png)

Step 4: Select the Start button to start VLC video compression.

### Resizing by cutting unnecessary video segment

Step 1: Launch the VLC Media Player

![resize-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-vlc-4.png)

Step 2: Go to Menu > View Menu > Advanced Controls in VLC Media Player and select it from the menu.

![resize-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-vlc-5.png)

Step 3: Play the video you want to crop and then click the Record button on the scene you want to crop and then the same button to pause the video where you want to crop it.

![resize-video-vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-vlc-6.png)

Step 4: In Windows 7, 8, and XP, the film will automatically save in Library > Videos, and in My Documents > My Videos in Windows 7.

VLC Media Player is unquestionably one of the greatest video players available for free. Nonetheless, it isn't the finest video reduction because it just reduces the size of videos by using certain simple parameters rather than complex ones. As a result, we offer Fimora, an all-in-one video toolbox that can convert, compress, download, record, edit, burn, and more, as a better video compressor. You can change the video resolution, bit rate, encoder, format, and other settings to compress video and audio files in a variety of formats.

## Why Is It Necessary to Remove Audio from a Video?

You can make a video far more versatile and successful for many different things by removing the audio.

### Your Video Becomes Multipurpose

Taking the audio out of a video makes it more versatile. Presentations, slide decks, and instructional videos may all benefit from this. The original audio or background noise might be too distracting in such videos.

The muted or removed audio lets you reach viewers who speak a different language. By removing the original audio, the video becomes language-neutral. Thus, you save time adding subtitles or dubbing without disturbing the narration.

### Place Emphasis on the Video Itself

Cutting off the sound may make the video's visuals the main attraction. It may be beneficial when creating tutorials or instructional videos. That's because viewers may prefer to see the demos without the sound.

### Eliminating Excessive Background Noise

The video might get dull with background noises, echoes, or unwanted sounds. Deleting the audio stream helps to eliminate distractions. As a result, viewers get a cleaner viewing experience.

### Keeping Copyright Concerns at Bay

Businesses can avoid copyright infringement problems by eliminating audio from videos. Removing someone's audio work before using it in public venues is necessary. It supports copyright laws on audio material by limiting display to visual components.

So, how do silent videos improve your video production strategies? Let's find out!

## How Can You Improve Storytelling With Silent Videos?

There is a much unrealized narrative potential in silent videos. Most videos rely only on visual elements to convey narratives. Thus, mute clips have a unique ability to captivate audiences. It also offers many possibilities for storytelling, allowing for a more immersive experience.

### Setting a Narrative

Videos without sound force viewers to rely more on their visual perception of the tale. It can draw your viewers closer to the visuals. Moreover, it also heightens their involvement with the story as it develops.

### Improving Stories

Silence directs the viewer's attention to certain visual aspects. When you remove all sound distractions, the audience can focus on the pictures. It helps you highlight essential story aspects.

For instance, rely on more than just dialogue to convey emotion. Instead, you can take a modest close-up of the character's face.

### Build Emotions With No Audio

One effective method of building intense emotions is the complete absence of sound. Remember, silent clips can keep viewers on the top of their seats. The audience may get more invested in the story's raw essence when a scene unfolds in silence. In short, this technique aims to evoke a range of emotions in the audience.

### Add Metaphor

The lack of audio permits the use of symbolic language only via visual representations. You can use each picture to convey information. It eliminates the need for dialogue or background music.

The audience can interact with the story on a deeper level via interpretation. Here, video scenes, objects, or actions work as symbols.

### Simplify Complex Stories

Silent videos let storytellers elicit strong emotional reactions from audiences. They can co-create the story by deciphering visual cues. Besides, they can also add thoughts, emotions, and interpretations in silent videos. Without words, silent videos can help you convey stories that captivate audiences.

## Why Is It Necessary to Remove Audio from a Video?

You can make a video far more versatile and successful for many different things by removing the audio.

### Your Video Becomes Multipurpose

Taking the audio out of a video makes it more versatile. Presentations, slide decks, and instructional videos may all benefit from this. The original audio or background noise might be too distracting in such videos.

### No Language Issues

The muted or removed audio lets you reach viewers who speak a different language. By removing the original audio, the video becomes language-neutral. Thus, you save time adding subtitles or dubbing without disturbing the narration.

### Place Emphasis on the Video Itself

Cutting off the sound may make the video's visuals the main attraction. It may be beneficial when creating tutorials or instructional videos. That's because viewers may prefer to see the demos without the sound.

### Eliminating Excessive Background Noise

The video might get dull with background noises, echoes, or unwanted sounds. Deleting the audio stream helps to eliminate distractions. As a result, viewers get a cleaner viewing experience.

### Keeping Copyright Concerns at Bay

Businesses can avoid copyright infringement problems by eliminating audio from videos. Removing someone's audio work before using it in public venues is necessary. It supports copyright laws on audio material by limiting display to visual components.

### Content Personalization

Creators can let viewers add their soundtracks or voiceovers by removing audio. Thus, it can make the watching experience more customized. It suits projects that need a high degree of personalization or user-generated content.

### Confidential Data Security

Sometimes, a video might capture sensitive conversations or information. So, it's essential to **remove the audio** to protect privacy. Remember, sharing the visual footage does not compromise confidentiality. It hides the crucial discussions or data from the original audio.

As you can see, removing audio from a video has several benefits. Many options are available when you mute the audio in a video. By eliminating background noise, you're freeing your imagination.

So, how do silent videos improve your video production strategies? Let's find out!

## How Can You Improve Storytelling With Silent Videos?

There is a much unrealized narrative potential in silent videos. Most videos rely only on visual elements to convey narratives. Thus, mute clips have a unique ability to captivate audiences. It also offers many possibilities for storytelling, allowing for a more immersive experience.

### Setting a Narrative

Videos without sound force viewers to rely more on their visual perception of the tale. It can draw your viewers closer to the visuals. Moreover, it also heightens their involvement with the story as it develops.

### Improving Stories

Silence directs the viewer's attention to certain visual aspects. When you remove all sound distractions, the audience can focus on the pictures. It helps you highlight essential story aspects.

For instance, rely on more than just dialogue to convey emotion. Instead, you can take a modest close-up of the character's face.

### Build Emotions With No Audio

One effective method of building intense emotions is the complete absence of sound. Remember, silent clips can keep viewers on the top of their seats. The audience may get more invested in the story's raw essence when a scene unfolds in silence. In short, this technique aims to evoke a range of emotions in the audience.

### Add Metaphor

The lack of audio permits the use of symbolic language only via visual representations. You can use each picture to convey information. It eliminates the need for dialogue or background music.

The audience can interact with the story on a deeper level via interpretation. Here, video scenes, objects, or actions work as symbols.

### Simplify Complex Stories

Silent videos let storytellers elicit strong emotional reactions from audiences. They can co-create the story by deciphering visual cues. Besides, they can also add thoughts, emotions, and interpretations in silent videos. Without words, silent videos can help you convey stories that captivate audiences.

### Method 2: Use the Audio Detach feature

Now, let's turn our focus to a different, efficient way. The Audio Detach function becomes a potent feature for separating audio from videos. Let's check out its detailed instructions for precisely separating audio and video.

#### Step1Upload Your Video

First, select the video clip whose audio you want to extract. You can start by clicking "Import" and then navigating to the relevant folder on your hard drive.

Now, you should drag videos from the dashboard into the Video Timeline. After that, you can right-click the video to choose the "Audio Detach" option.

The Music Timeline will immediately display a new audio file. Here, you can see the original video's soundtrack. Now, pressing the "Delete" button can remove the sounds.

You can also detach audio from multiple video files. Remember, all the files will mesh together perfectly on the Video Timeline.

Thus, you need to click the application icon on the left-hand side of the screen and choose "Save As..." to create new project files if you need to extract audio from more than one file. Then, export each output file individually after reloading the project file.

To be sure this is what you need, double-tap the file in the Video Timeline. You can add suitable music files to the clip if needed. To save only the video track, click the "Create" option directly. A popup will open up, asking you to choose a format before you can save it to your PC.
