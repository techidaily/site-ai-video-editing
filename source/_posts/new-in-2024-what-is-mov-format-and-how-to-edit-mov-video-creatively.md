## Part 5\. Differences Between MP4 and MOV

Both MP4 and MOV file format is almost the same thing. Some of the minor differences that exist are MOV format is recommended best for Mac devices. On the contrary, MP4 is universal that can be used on any device irrespective of the operating system or the software.

![mp4 vs mov](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/mov-file-format-8.jpg)

MP4 files are more compressed, thus taking less space than MOV video format, which takes slightly more space. The quality of payback that MP4 provides is less than what the MOV file format provides. MOV format, thus, for this reason, is used more by professionals.
