The free FFmpeg command line tool is a great way to record a live internet stream and listen back to it later. If you have a Windows PC and want to record a video stream or screen using FFmpeg, our following step-by-step method will help you go through this process without facing many difficulties.

Step1 First, launch a browser of your choice on your Windows PC and head to the [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-windows) website. Hover over the Windows icon in the middle pane and select either the **gyan.dev** or **BTbn** build.

![downloading ffmpeg on windows](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/downloading-ffmpeg-on-windows.png)

On the next screen, select the latest **Windows 64-bit** file from the list. Why? You need to use a computer compatible with the Windows 64-bit version. Next, download the ZIP file on your PC and use ZIP file extraction software to open the file contents.

Step2 Locate the **ffmpeg.exe** file on the extracted file and copy it to a new folder on your computer hard drive (e.g., C:\\VideoRecorder).

Step3 In the next step, click the **Start** icon on your Windows dashboard and type **cmd** in the search box. Right-click on Command Prompt, select **“Run as Administrator,”** and launch the program.

Now, write the command to select the FFmpeg directory. For example, cd **C:\\VideoRecorder**, and hit the **“Enter”** key.

Step4 To start recording the video stream, simply call FFmpeg and use the following command line. In this case, we are taking the example of capturing a YouTube video of “Running up that hill” from the top-rated TV show Stranger Things.

ffmpeg.exe -y -i <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV0RAcuG2Ao> runningup.mp4

Hit the “Enter” key, and the output of this command will be displayed on the Command Prompt interface.

The command options have the following meanings:

**\-y** allows automatic rewriting of existing files.

**\-i** <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV0RAcuG2Ao> is the stream URL that FFmpeg will record. You can change it with any video stream URL.

**runningup.mp4** is the name of the output file.

### Tips: Automatically Recording Video Streams on Windows PC

If you want your computer to record a specific video stream time automatically, use the Windows Task Scheduler to create a Timer to stop the recording after a particular time is passed.
