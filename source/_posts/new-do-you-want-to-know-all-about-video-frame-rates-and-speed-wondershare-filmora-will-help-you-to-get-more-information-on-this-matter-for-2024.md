While the frame represents a single second, this defines the frequency of the video. This is the display of consecutive frames every second, which brings up the illusion of motion for the viewers. In this way, the entire frame rate is explained as terminology to users new to video editing.

### Importance of Frame Rate in Videos

We will highlight some prominent points explaining the importance of **video frame rates**. Continuing with these points, this will help users understand how essential video frame rate is:
