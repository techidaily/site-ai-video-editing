## Part 3\. Tips to use green screen on Zoom video

Here are some important tips to use green screen on Zoom video for a better outcome.

Buy Large Green Screen - Since you are going to invest in buying green screen, you should buy a large green screen instead of buying two. Firstly, when you have one large green screen, you can set it up without any wrinkles or overlaps.

Secondly, a large green screen means greater surface area, and even when you slightly change the angle of your camera, your background will still have green screen instead of the exterior wall showing up and ruining virtual background effect.

Buy Green Screen Stand - Along with green screen, you should buy a sizeable green screen stand. A regular green screen stand contains two vertical supports at both ends and one horizontal support where you hand the green screen.

You can buy it according to the size of green screen you have bought. And you need to buy stand because you cannot fix the green screen on the wall properly. If you use any other means, there are going to be wrinkles and uneven virtual background effect.

Green Screen Quality - You can purchase any shade of green screen, but we recommend you opt for vibrant green color for a better outcome. Most importantly, the color should be even across the surface, and there should not be light and dark patches to dampen the virtual background effect and make it look unrealistic. That is why you should not compromise with quality.

Avoid Green Objects - You should not wear anything green. If your green screen has a lighter shade, you can wear deep color dresses and vice versa. Most importantly, you should not keep anything that is green while attending Zoom attending as it will disturb the green screen effect and it will look embarrassing. If you need to keep any green objects in your Zoom meetings, you should have blue screen instead of green screen.

Focus On Lighting - Lighting is extremely important when you want to use green screen. You should place the light so that it spreads evenly across the green screen. Otherwise, there are going to be light and dark patches, and the effect can get disturbed. Make sure you do not cast any shadow on the green screen by positioning the green screen accordingly.

Select A Proper Background - Last but not least, when you change your green screen to any virtual background photo or video, make sure you keep your audiences in mind. If you are attending a meeting, you should keep a professional-looking background. The background should not be distracting and match the theme of your meeting.

## Part 2: Alternative Way to Loop a Video

If you're using a [video editing software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) like Adobe Premiere or Final Cut Pro, it is likely that you have seen the generic technique of looping a video is by splitting it in two and pasting it together again. What if you need to put on repeat just one individual cut? This is where [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) steps in! It is a handy tool for trimming and adding clips into your recordings.

The Filmora software can be used to quickly create continual sequences of any duration, irrespective of how long the footage is. It makes possible to synchronize sound and video clips, splice them into one another, and even add titles and motion graphics for a special effect. If you utilize Filmora, you do not need to be an expert in video editing to make professional-looking results. Let us explore why Filmora is necessary for video editing.

Filmora is a video editing software that allows you to make professional-looking videos from your footage. It has a loop feature that lets you create seamless loops where each clip in the sequence plays over and over until you stop it. This can be useful for creating music videos, for example, or for creating small clips that loop seamlessly through the whole video.

The loop feature in Filmora software is a great way to put your video editing skills to the test. It allows you to edit a clip of any length and then play it back over and over again, which can be useful when you're looking for an ideal looping point or want to see how long a clip is before going back to find out why it didn't work.

Let's have a look that how can we loop the video on Filmora:

**Step 1: Download Filmora for free and Create a project in it:**

**Step 3: Add Transition to the video to make it more seamless**
