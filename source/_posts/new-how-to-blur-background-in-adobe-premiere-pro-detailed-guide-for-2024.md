## How To Change Speed of Video in Final Cut Pro?

When there are certain boring but necessary parts in your video, you need to speed them up. Similarly, you may need to reduce the duration of the entire video. Speeding up the video is your only option when you do not want to cut any part. You must have also observed that certain videos look funny when you speed them up. To speed up videos, you will need a video editor that does not degrade the video quality.

Final Cut Pro is a popular choice to speed up video without distorting the pitch. Many think that the video quality can degrade when they change the speed of the video clip. This concern can be taken care of when you alter the video speed with Final Cut Pro. Instead of changing the speed of the entire video, you can change the speed of specific parts. We will illustrate how to speed up the video using Final Cut Pro and suggest a better choice than FCP.

![speed up the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-up-video-with-final-cut-pro-1.jpg)

## Part I. Speed Up Video using Final Cut Pro

The video editor is suitable for beginners as well as professionals. FCP, as a video editor, is super fast in rendering and processing video while exporting. Here are the steps for the Final Cut Pro speed-up clip.

Step1 Open FCP. Navigate to File>New> and tap Project to start a new project.

![start a new project](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-up-video-with-final-cut-pro-2.jpg)

## Part II. Tips for Speeding Up Video in Final Cut Pro

You have to keep a few points in mind when you speed up videos in Final Cut Pro. This ensures that the video does not get distorted while speeding up a section. Here are some tips to follow to speed up the video in FCP.

**Adjust The Pitch of Sped-Up Clips -**

By default, Final Cut Pro preserves the pitch of the audio even when you change the speed of the video. However, you may want to change the pitch per the video's speed. This is because you might want to make the audio sound funny. You need to turn off the Preserve Pitch option from Retime menu. Once you do that, the pitch of the sped-up clip adjusts itself as per the change in speed.

**Speeding Up Video by Adjusting Frame Rate -**

You can shoot at a low frame rate for the scene you want to speed up. The frame rate should be lower than the overall video project's frame rate.

You can add the scene to your video project on the timeline. Then you need to choose Automatic Speed from Retime menu. This will increase the frame rate from the scene to the video project frame rate. Once the frame rate increases, the video will speed up automatically.

![speed up automatically](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-up-video-with-final-cut-pro-7.jpg)

**Smoothen Out the Sped-Up Video -**

Sometimes, the overall video may look old when you speed up a particular portion. That is why there are two options available on Final Cut Pro. The first option is frame blending which is more suitable for the slow-motion clip.

The second option is the optical flow that smoothens out the sped-up clip. It adds in-between frames by analyzing the directional movement of pixels. You can find the option from Video Quality present in the Retime menu.

## Part III. The Right Final Cut Pro Alternative for Changing Speed - Filmora

Final Cut Pro has a steep learning curve. Unless you have some experience in video editing, you will find the user interface slightly complicated. Besides, Final Cut Pro is only available for Mac users since it is an Apple product.

##### Step1 Add a video you want to edit

![add a video you want to edit](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1920s-1.jpg)

Upload your video on Filmora, then move it to the editing timeline by dragging it. This should take a second or two.

##### Step2 Add a crop effect

![add a crop effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1920s-2.jpg)

After successfully adding your video to the timeline, tap the **Effect** tab on top of the screen and click **Utility**. Then, choose the **Crop** effect and add a few tracks above the video clip.

![tap the effect tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1920s-3.jpg)

Next, double-tap the **Crop** effect on the editing timeline to open the effect editing tools. Now change the crop amount to 15 to add a vintage feel to your video. Just enter 15 on the Left and Right boxes.

##### Step3 Add the Dirty Film and Silent Film effects

![add the dirty film and silent film effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1920s-4.jpg)

Tap the Effect tab, then open the **Overlay** drop-down menu. Then, choose the **Old Film** category before adding a **Dirty Film** effect above the clip. To apply a more vintage feel to your video, add a **Silent Film** effect to the track above the Dirty Film effect.

##### Step4 Add a black & white effect to your video

![add a black and white effect to your video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1920s-5.jpg)

Up to this point, your film should now start having a more vintage feel. But to make it look even older, double-click the video clip and tap the **Color** tab. After that, open the **3D LUT** arrow and choose the **B&W Film** option. Now play the video and enjoy.

## Summary

See, you don't need to break a sweat to add a vintage feel to your funny video. With Filmora, you'll access multiple tools and effects to create an old-looking film with just a single click. And don't forget to play around with other Filmora overlays and effects to bring out the inner video editor in you. Thanks for reading!
