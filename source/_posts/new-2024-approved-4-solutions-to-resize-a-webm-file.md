## 4 Solutions to Resize a WebM File

People resize videos for many reasons, the most common one being to reduce file size. Others might be to meet a specification, or for compatibility. When you resize a video file, you reduce its file size considerably- making it load faster on devices, reduce processing time, and save a lot of space. Most people prefer watching videos that are smaller in size compared to larger ones, that’s why some social media sites like Instagram, Tiktok, etc have preferred video resolutions, so if you are a user on these sites you might want to resize your video to fit.

The biggest concern most people have about resizing videos is whether it will retain its quality, another concern is that you don’t want to crop out your video while resizing. If the format of the video is mp4, wmv, avi, etc which usually have very large size, resizing it might be a bit of a problem because the video quality will reduce a lot, but if it’s a WebM video file, you can still achieve a good video quality even after multiple compression or changing its resolution, that’s because its codecs- VP8 and VP9 were designed specifically for that, and it’s supported by all browsers.

In the course of this article, we’re assuming you already have a WebM video and you want to resize it, and still maintain its quality so you can upload on your favourite websites without any hassles. We have handpicked some proven methods to help you with that, let’s see them:

## Method 1: Resize WebM file with Wondershare Filmora

Wondershare [Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is a great video editing software that comes with a lot of features. You can easily perform basic editing techniques in a few minutes. It also comes with lots of filters to make your videos pop.

For video resizing, Filmora offers you a couple of options: First you have an option of changing the resolution just before you export your video; you also have the option of cropping your videos to your preferred size and cutting out redundant parts of your videos to save space; but the third option is what we’ll show you in this guide, because we imagine you already have your video exported and you just want to resize. You can easily do that by changing the aspect ratio and we’ll show you in a few steps:

Select your preferred aspect ratio from the list of options- 16:9 (widescreen), 4:3 (standard), 1:1 (Instagram), 9:16 (portrait).

## Method 2: How to resize WebM file with VLC

VLC is a free and open source multimedia player. It is arguably the best media player out there and that’s for a reason- it can play almost everything without the need for any external codecs.

The playback feature is amazing but that’s not the only thing it can do. VLC outshines most other media players because of some extra features it possesses.

 your rotation. However, your video will be just perfect if you type in -90

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-13.jpg)

ALTERNATIVE WAY TO ROTATE AVI VIDEO ON ADOBE PREMIERE PRO

* STEP 1 - Go to the effects window and search for ‘flip’
* STEP 2 - Click on ‘Transform’. You can then decide to do a horizontal flip or a vertical flip
* STEP 3 - All you need to do is click and drag it on to your clip and it will flip, whether horizontal or vertical
* STEP 4 - It is easy to remedy when you click and drag the other to place on your footage, whether horizontal or vertical.

TO ROTATE YOUR CLIP

* STEP 1 - Highlight your footage on the timeline and go to your effects controls window. Underneath ‘motion’, there is the perimeter of rotation. If you click and drag the mouse on the number, it will rotate either clockwise or counter-clockwise. Also, you can type in whatever rotation amount you want

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-14.jpg)

* STEP 2 - It’s also worth mentioning that when you rotate a clip, you’re always rotating around the inker point (the little blue cross in a circle). You can click and drag this through the program monitor to any point on the clip and start rotating it around the inker point. In fact, it doesn’t have to be on the clip; you can make the inker point up further and rotate, and will still rotate around the inker point. If you don’t see this on your program monitor, that’s because you haven’t highlighted the motion.

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-15.jpg)

* STEP 3 - A good tip is using guides to help you level and horizontal or whether you are working with on-screen. To get a slant perfectly leveled, there’s an easy way to reference a straight line on your program monitor. On the bottom right of your program monitor is the button \[a plus (+) button\] editor. Click on it and a box full of tools will pop up which you can work with. Click ‘add show rulers’, ‘show guides’ and ‘safe margins’

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-16.jpg)

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-17.jpg)

* STEP 4 - In the ruler section, take your mouse, click and drag it down to the little crosses of your safe margins. The same goes for the vertical ruler; click and drag over. That will create a new guide. For your footage, what you might need to do is get your horizontal guide down to your horizon view. You can go to your rotation and rotate your footage to get straight with your guide. If you are left with black bars at the corners, take off your safe margin rulers and guides and then zoom in on your footage and take off the black bars. To do this, go back to your effect controls

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-18.jpg)

* STEP 5 - Instead of doing rotation, you scale by clicking and sliding the mouse on the number to the right

ALTERNATIVE WAY TO ROTATE AVI VIDEO ON ADOBE PREMIERE PRO

* STEP 2 - Click on ‘Transform’. You can then decide to do a horizontal flip or a vertical flip

TO ROTATE YOUR CLIP

* STEP 1 - Highlight your footage on the timeline and go to your effects controls window. Underneath ‘motion’, there is the perimeter of rotation. If you click and drag the mouse on the number, it will rotate either clockwise or counter-clockwise. Also, you can type in whatever rotation amount you want

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-14.jpg)

* STEP 2 - It’s also worth mentioning that when you rotate a clip, you’re always rotating around the inker point (the little blue cross in a circle). You can click and drag this through the program monitor to any point on the clip and start rotating it around the inker point. In fact, it doesn’t have to be on the clip; you can make the inker point up further and rotate, and will still rotate around the inker point. If you don’t see this on your program monitor, that’s because you haven’t highlighted the motion.

Click on it and a box full of tools will pop up which you can work with. Click ‘add show rulers’, ‘show guides’ and ‘safe margins’

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-17.jpg)

* STEP 4 - In the ruler section, take your mouse, click and drag it down to the little crosses of your safe margins. The same goes for the vertical ruler; click and drag over. That will create a new guide. For your footage, what you might need to do is get your horizontal guide down to your horizon view. You can go to your rotation and rotate your footage to get straight with your guide. If you are left with black bars at the corners, take off your safe margin rulers and guides and then zoom in on your footage and take off the black bars. To do this, go back to your effect controls

Video editing is the process of cutting and rearranging multiple clips or segments of video to create a new and more improved video. This involves adding titles, animations, sound effects, music and more. Video editing has not ceased to follow the trend of technology as it keeps thriving tirelessly through the ages. With advancement springing forth from many sides, video editing followed every pace to ensure it’s not left behind. This largely involves gadgets, computers and smartphones.

Before the advent of smartphones, computers have been the only video editing tools, and that culture is preserved even till date as its use has spread round the world. It is therefore evident that film making cannot bypass this process. Improvements have been made over the years on video editing softwares for computers to stay up to date as regards features and usability. There are other video editors which were introduced, and are still being updated such as Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut, Filmora and so on.

* Go to ‘scale’, and type in the number according to the degree you desire to effect

 your rotation. However, your video will be just perfect if you type in -90

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-13.jpg)

ALTERNATIVE WAY TO ROTATE AVI VIDEO ON ADOBE PREMIERE PRO

* STEP 1 - Go to the effects window and search for ‘flip’
* STEP 2 - Click on ‘Transform’. You can then decide to do a horizontal flip or a vertical flip
* STEP 3 - All you need to do is click and drag it on to your clip and it will flip, whether horizontal or vertical
* STEP 4 - It is easy to remedy when you click and drag the other to place on your footage, whether horizontal or vertical.

TO ROTATE YOUR CLIP

* STEP 1 - Highlight your footage on the timeline and go to your effects controls window. Underneath ‘motion’, there is the perimeter of rotation. If you click and drag the mouse on the number, it will rotate either clockwise or counter-clockwise. Also, you can type in whatever rotation amount you want

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-14.jpg)

* STEP 2 - It’s also worth mentioning that when you rotate a clip, you’re always rotating around the inker point (the little blue cross in a circle). You can click and drag this through the program monitor to any point on the clip and start rotating it around the inker point. In fact, it doesn’t have to be on the clip; you can make the inker point up further and rotate, and will still rotate around the inker point. If you don’t see this on your program monitor, that’s because you haven’t highlighted the motion.

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-15.jpg)

* STEP 3 - A good tip is using guides to help you level and horizontal or whether you are working with on-screen. To get a slant perfectly leveled, there’s an easy way to reference a straight line on your program monitor. On the bottom right of your program monitor is the button \[a plus (+) button\] editor. Click on it and a box full of tools will pop up which you can work with. Click ‘add show rulers’, ‘show guides’ and ‘safe margins’

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-16.jpg)

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-17.jpg)

* STEP 4 - In the ruler section, take your mouse, click and drag it down to the little crosses of your safe margins. The same goes for the vertical ruler; click and drag over. That will create a new guide. For your footage, what you might need to do is get your horizontal guide down to your horizon view. You can go to your rotation and rotate your footage to get straight with your guide. If you are left with black bars at the corners, take off your safe margin rulers and guides and then zoom in on your footage and take off the black bars. To do this, go back to your effect controls

![rotate-av](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/rotate-avi-18.jpg)

* STEP 5 - Instead of doing rotation, you scale by clicking and sliding the mouse on the number to the right

## How to Overlay Video in Premiere Pro

In order to make it simple to combine the shot's components into a sequence, video overlays are pieces of film that are often recorded in a dark studio. Using image overlays on a video production is fairly frequent. However, adding pictures to every video you export might be tiresome and time-consuming if you have several films to send. For instance, an overlay video in Premiere Pro might be preferred by you rather than a manual addition of the overlay media.

There is a quick and easy method to know how to overlay a video on a video in Premiere Pro and we’ve got it covered. However, depending on the kind of element, there may be some color blending that affects the components themselves. Overlays may be filmed on either a green screen or a blue screen. Snow components photographed against a green screen may have a green hue shift, necessitating further color grading before the footage might be used.

## Part 1\. How to Overlay Video in Premiere Pro

Videos sometimes need a splash of color to elevate them. With the built-in color effects in Adobe Premiere Pro, you can apply overlays to any video, whether you want to add a little drama to a clip or a splash of color to a social media post. We'll demonstrate how to overlay videos in this article. To liven up your intros, make your outros stand out, and spruce up your summer social media posts, add a gradient video overlay effect. Adobe Premiere Pro and gorgeous video clips are all you need.

**Steps to Overlay Video in Premiere Pro**

##### Step1Activate Premiere Pro

To build a new sequence, start a new project in Premiere, import your footage, then drag your clip onto the timeline. The clip's parameters will be reflected in the sequence.

![activitate premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/activitate-premiere-pro.jpg)

##### Step2Select Overlay Effect

Secondly, choose the Effects workspace (located near the top of your window). This will guarantee that the tools we need are accessible. Alternately, you may go to Window > Workspaces > Effects.

![select overlay effects pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/select-overlay-effects-pr.jpg)

##### Step3Create a layer of adjustments

Go to File > New > Adjustment Layer to begin. Make sure your Project panel is chosen if the option is not accessible. Your clip and sequence will show up in your Project panel with the adjustment layer. Add the timeline with the adjustment layer selected.

![create a layer adjustment pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/create-a-layer-adjustment-pr.jpg)

##### Step4Create the Video Overlay

Transitions, generators, audio effects, and video effects are all included under the Effects panel. We'll begin by selecting the 4-Color Gradient from the "Generate" folder, which contains generators for patterns and gradients, to produce the video overlay effect. Right-click on the adjustment layer in the timeline and drag the appropriate effect there.

![create the video overlay pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/create-the-video-overlay-pr.jpg)

##### Step5Change the Effect Control

In the Effect Controls panel, you may manage and adjust effects. You may change the default effect settings for each element in your timeline, such as size and opacity, under the Effect Controls panel along with any additional effects you've added. To access an item's effect controls, click on it in the timeline.

![change effects control pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/change-effects-control-pr.jpg)

By selecting the ‘Show all properties’ next to the adjustment layer in your timeline, you can get a before-and-after comparison. Increase the value by selecting "blend with original." To change the effect's strength, move this up and down.

##### Step6Save the Project

Try switching the linear mode to radial. You can make a color transition for circles by doing this. You will be able to highlight various things with color after this transition. The circle's starting point may be animated to follow a certain item in the scene.

![save the project pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/save-the-project-pr.jpg)

To the right of the Presets drop-down menu, choose the Auto Save button. Check the Save Effects Settings box when the Choose a Name dialog box appears. Future exports made with this preset will automatically take into account any Image Overlay settings you've configured.

![combine-video-instagram-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/combine-video-instagram-3.jpg)

Move videos from the User's Album to the video track on the Timeline after that. All video files will be combined into a single video with no transition. However, you can use the following method to add transitions between video clips.

1. Add transitions in the third step (optional)

![combine-video-instagram-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/combine-video-instagram-4.jpg)

Add transitions between clips for a smooth transition from one to the next to make the linked videos look like a complete movie. Go to the Transition tab and drag the desired change to the intersection of two clips. You can also right-click any transition to bring up a menu with choices such as "Apply to All" and "Random to All" for your convenience.

Step 4: Combine video files into a single file.

![combine-video-instagram-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/combine-video-instagram-5.jpg)

Now that you've seen the merged Movie click the "Export" option to save the several video segments to a single file. Select any format from the list under the Format tab. All of the most common video formats are supported. Choose "Device" and choose the thumbnail of your device to play the combined video file on iPod, iPhone, or iPad. You may also publish the combined Video on YouTube or burn it to DVDs to watch on television.

**Other Online Video Mergers**

1. **Video Toolbox**

Users can merge and unite videos up to 600MB in size using this fantastic video editing tool. This platform is popular among professionals due to its comprehensive cutting, cropping, combining, and effects editing services. More significantly, joining videos is completely free.

1. **Inshot**

![combine-video-instagram-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/combine-video-instagram-9.jpg)

 This is a free video editing app that allows you to merge multiple videos into a single file. This is how:

1) Install and run Inshot.

2) Select Video.

3) Tap the check button after selecting multiple videos.

4) Optional: Here is where you can edit the videos. Select the 16:9 comprehensive video layout or another option by tapping Canvas.

1. **With iMovie**

![combine-video-instagram-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/combine-video-instagram-10.jpg)

Apple's iMovie app is available for free on iPhones, iPad, and Mac. Here's how to combine two or more videos for an Instagram post:

1) Get iMovie and open it on your iPhone.

2) Select Movie from the Create Project menu.

3) Choose your movies. To see only the clips, go to the top left and tap Media, then Video. Choose a video and press the check button.

4) Tap Create Movie after selecting two or more video clips.

5) Swipe horizontally to the point where one video clip ends and another begins if desired. You can edit or remove the transition effect between videos by tapping the two triangle icon.

6) Optional: You can also experiment with other iMovie features such as adding music, text, and video speed changes. You can tap a video clip, tap the tiny plus icon, and zoom in and out with two fingers.

8) When you're done, tap Done in the top left corner.

9) From the bottom, tap the share button and select Save Video.

10) Your iPhone's Photos app now contains the merged clip. Open Instagram and make an individual post with the final combined Video.

This is how you can combine multiple clips into one Instagram video. I hope you found this quick tutorial helpful. Of course, you can merge two or more clips into one single video file using any other video editing app besides the ones listed above.
