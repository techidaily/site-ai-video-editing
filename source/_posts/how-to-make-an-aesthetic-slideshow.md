## Ultimate Guide on How to Film Better in Public

Filming in public and different locations can add a new dimension to any video. The possibilities are limitless, from the hustle and bustle of a busy city street to the tranquil beauty of a remote beach.

Suppose you're a new vlogger and want to capture the perfect scene in public. Then this blog is for you. It will explain various tips and tricks to help you create the best videos, regardless of location. So let's start and learn more about how to film better in public!

## Part 1\. What Gear Will You Need to Record a Better Video in Public?

While recording in public, you want to avoid setting and holding unnecessary camera gear. That's why you should keep your gear as low-key as possible. The essential shooting gears that you are going to need are as follows:

### A Good Camera

A good camera is essential to record a video in public because it will provide quality footage. It will also allow you to capture more detail and create more engaging videos. But if you use a phone instead, make sure it is the latest iPhone or other with high pixels camera.

![a dslr camera](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/create-better-film-footage-1.jpg)

### A Tripod

A tripod is essential when recording video in public to ensure that your shots are stable and steady. Without a tripod, your camera can shake and create a distorted, blurry image that can ruin a shot. So having a secure tripod will help you capture professional-looking footage.

![a tripod](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/create-better-film-footage-2.jpg)

### A Microphone

A microphone is essential for recording a video in public because it captures the sound in the environment, allowing the video to be recorded with better-quality audio. Without a microphone, the video would be recorded with distorted sound and would likely be challenging to understand.

![a vlogging microphone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/create-better-film-footage-3.jpg)

Apart from the gear mentioned above, you can also bring an ND filter, extra batteries, and SD cards. Because If the battery runs out or the SD card becomes full, the video recording could be lost. The spare batteries and SD cards help to ensure that the video can be captured uninterrupted. Let's see what we need further.

## Part 2\. What Do You Need to Accomplish With Your Video?

While recording a video in a busy location, you need to accomplish three things with your video to record it better. Which are as follows:

### 1\. Clean Shots

When recording in a busy location, it is essential to try and capture clean shots. It can be done by using a wide-angle lens to get the full shot or zooming in to focus on a particular element.

### 2\. Clean Audio

Getting a clean and clear sound when recording audio in a busy location is essential. A good quality microphone, an audio recorder, or external noise reduction can help minimize background noise and capture the desired audio.

### 3\. Decent Lighting

In a busy location, decent lighting is as important as the other two factors. Look for natural light sources that can provide good light, even illumination. If these are unavailable, consider using portable lighting equipment or lamps to create a more flattering environment.

Now that we know what we need let's see how to make a video.

## Part 3\. How to Get the Best Shot While Filming Outdoor?

Whether you are a vlogger, a YouTuber, or a student filmmaker, shooting a video in a busy area is always a challenge. You must be able to plan and execute your production in a way that minimizes disruption and produces quality footage. By following these instructions, we hope you can make a difference in a shot you record:

##### Step1 Scout the Location

Before recording, visit the location in advance to plan your shots. Take note of potential distractions or noise sources and plan your angles accordingly.

![scouting the location](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/create-better-film-footage-4.png)

##### Step2 Choose the correct shooting time

The best time to record a video in a busy location is when the area is less crowded, such as early in the morning or late at night. Avoiding peak times and holidays is also a good idea.

##### Step3 Choose the right angle

Once you get to the location, you must find the right angle.

**Select Background**

Try to find a background that will best capture the atmosphere of the area and minimize any background noise.

![select the background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/create-better-film-footage-5.png)

**Set the frame**

If your frame is too broad, you will face potential distractions that could interfere with your video, such as people walking in and out of the frame.

![setting the frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/create-better-film-footage-6.png)

**Set your position**

Instead of getting closer to your talent, get further away and zoom in this way, you leave space for other people in the location, and you can still get your shot!

![zoom in the talent](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/create-better-film-footage-7.png)

Try to get your shot and then get out quickly so you don't bother other people trying to get their photos.

## Part 4\. Best Way to Record Audio While Filming Outdoor

Audio is essential to any video production, and recording audio while filming outdoor scenes can be challenging.

Outdoor environments come with more variables to consider, such as wind, traffic noise, and other background noise, that can make capturing clear audio more difficult. Even if you use a high-quality mic, you still have chances of interruption.

The best thing about the software is that you can quickly blur the background of your footage to add a bit of depth and interest, as well as to make your subject stand out more.

To make things simpler for you, we’ve compiled this comprehensive guide to walk you through the step-by-step process of **how to blur the background in Premiere Pro** so that you notice a big difference in your videos!

## Part 1\. Why Do You Need To Blur The Video Background?

The blurred background effect is a useful technique used by many professionals to create a focus on the element in the video and remove any distortions. By doing so, they add emphasis on the most important on-screen subject and make it pop on the screen.

You may need to blur the video background for several reasons. Perhaps you're recording a tutorial and want to add focus on one element, or maybe you're filming a scene in a crowded public place and wish to minimize distractions in your video.

Blurring the BG can also be a way to add a creative touch to your video or make them more immersive, polished, and professional.

## Part 2\. How To Blur Your Background In Premiere Pro?

Below, we’ve provided a step-by-step guide to help you **blur the background in Premiere Pro:**

Step1 In the first step, open a browser and visit the [Adobe Premiere Elements](https://www.adobe.com/in/products/elements-family/premiere-elements/download-trial/try.html) download page. Log in with your Adobe ID or [create a new one](https://helpx.adobe.com/in/manage-account.html#CreateanAdobeID). Choose the platform and language, and click **“Download”** to get the installation file.

![downloading premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/downloading-premiere-pro.png)

Click the downloaded installer to install the software and launch it. Now, click the **“File”** option from the top toolbar and select **“Import”** to open the **File Explorer** window. Locate your video footage and click **“Open”** to import it to Adobe Premiere.

![importing file to premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/importing-file-to-premiere-pro.png)

Step2 In the next step, click the **“Window”** option from the top toolbar and select **“Effects”** from the drop-down menu to open the **“Effects Panel.”**

In the Effects Panel, type **“Blur”** in the search bar and scroll down to find the **“Gaussian Blur”** effect. Drag and drop the effect on the clip in the timeline to apply.

Step3 Now, click **“Window”** in the top toolbar and select **“Effect Controls”** to open its panel. Scroll down to **“Gaussian Effect”** in the panel and increase the blurriness amount. This will make your entire clip blurry, including the subject/main element.If the edges of your clips become dark, checkmark the **“Repeat Edge Pixels”** option to resolve this issue.

Step4 Next, you have to create a mask around the subject to unblur it. To do so, click the **“Free**

**Draw Bezier”** under the **“Gaussian Blur”** option in the **Effects Control Panel.**

Now, in the **Program Monitor** window, trace the outline of the element/subject in your video. Make sure to bring the trace line to the original point.

Step5 Checkmark the **“Inverted”** option under the **Mask Expansion** header in the **Effects Control Panel** to make your background blurry. Click the **“Play”** icon to preview your video and if you find any hard edges around the subject, click **“Mask”** and choose the selection tool.

![inverting the mask to blur background in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/inverting-the-mask-to-blur-background-in-premiere-pro.png)

Now, make adjustments to the individual points in the outline. Click **“Mask Expansion”** and increase its value to expand the mask size. Then, click **“Mask Feather”** and decrease its value to soften the edges.

Step6 If your subject moves around in some parts, click the toggle next to **“Mask Path”** to create keyframes. Now, move through the timeline and adjust the mask on the subject to make a professional-looking video.

Finally, navigate to **“File” > “Export”** from the top toolbar, type your file name, specify a location and click **“Export”** to save your file on your PC.
