Or, click on the “File” button on the top menu to import files and drag and drop both clips to the same timeline.

As you can see, there are two clips on the timeline. The first clip is called “Cherry Blossom,” and the second clip’s name is “Plating Food.”

**Step 3: Keep Video Clips on the Same Timeline**

There shouldn’t be any gap or spaces between the two clips.

It is because gaps will create a dark blank space between the clips when you export the clips, like this:

Therefore, slide the second video right next to the first video without leaving any gaps with your mouse.

And guess what? You have already merged the two clips.

**Step 4: Save Video on Your PC**

Now, hit the “Export” button and save the merged video on your computer.
