### 2.4 Make Fullscreen Tiktok Video

It can be a frustrating experience to watch a Tiktok video when you have the For you tab at the top, blocking your video. The like button and share buttons all do a number on your valuable screen space at the sides. The comment section with the scrolling ribbons of comments is the worst offender at making the TikTok video seem unappealing.

One way you can make your TikTok experience better is through full-screen viewing of your TikTok video. You can do this by simply saving the video to your phone. Save the video by pressing the share button. In the second half of the share section, you have the “save video” option, and you can select this for a blissful video viewing experience.

One other way users can view TikTok on full screen is to go to their android’s ‘settings’ page. Go into the ‘Display and Brightness’ settings. Look for the tab titled ‘Full-Screen Display”. In this section, scroll down to TikTok and select. Once there, enable ‘Notch Area Display.’

There you go, your TikTok account can now be graced with full-screen videos. This will make the user experience a lot better.

### Conclusion

One of the keys to creating high-quality content for your brand on social media is recognizing how much aspect ratio brings to the table and how to apply it to your videos and images. There is no doubt that using videos for promotion is the most effective technique to increase brand engagement nowadays.

To make it easy to cut, edit, and even design your images and movies for the most outstanding performance, use an excellent online video editor like Wondershare Filmora. It’s one of the best video editors for both beginners and experienced professionals.

##### Step4 Create a Folder for Production Sound

After that, add three new folders and rename them to Production Sound, SFX, and Music. Production sound is usually the sound that is recorded on set. If you have recorded all dialects from the subjects on the location, you can put them into this folder.

![create a folder for production sound](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_4.jpg)

**2\. Organize your Timeline and Video Tracks**

##### Step1 Create Tracks for Picture Editing

Keep the first three tracks for picture editing. These tracks are usually for picture editing that includes footage with no effects or some simple effects—for example resizing, keyframing, transitions, or Green Screen.

![create tracks for picture editing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_7.jpg)

##### Step2 Create Tracks for Temporary Footage

Set up the fourth track for the temporary footage or placeholders so you can quickly switch the temporary footage without spending extra time looking for them.

![create tracks for temporary footage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_8.jpg)

##### Step3 Create Tracks for Effects

Set the fifth video track as the effect track. It will include all effects from firmware that do not apply to the footage directly.

![create tracks for effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_9.jpg)

##### Step4 Create Tracks for On and Off Content

Next, on the sixth video track, you can add the content that you would want to turn on and off from time to time. In this example, you can put the subtitles here.

![create tracks for on and off content](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_10.jpg)

![create tracks for ambient sound](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_14.jpg)

![color code your clips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_16.jpg)

## Part 2: Pro Tips about Improving Video Editing Efficiency

**1\. Rename Individual Clips**

It would be much simpler to organize the timeline if you could quickly rename individual clips. Cut a clip into smaller segments and give each clip a different name. Make sure these clips have a name other than the source video to avoid confusion.

**2\. Remove Empty Timeline**

For quick video editing, timeline organization is essential. Organize your materials and footage at all times to prevent delays. Put everything in the correct folders with the proper labels. To keep your timeline organized, select "Delete Empty Tracks" from the context menu when right-clicking on the track window on the left.

**3\. Use Keyboard Shortcuts**

Knowing keyboard shortcuts allows you to carry out the editing process quickly and precisely.

**4\. Select Good Music**

Don't only concentrate on the images; the music also affects how well your video comes out. For example, suppose you're making a drama movie. In that case, you should pick the right music track to evoke particular emotions in your viewers.

**5\. Add Text and Graphics**

Depending on the style of the video, adding text, graphics, or stock video to your project could be helpful. You should provide more text than just the title for some videos.

Here's how you can use the customization mode on the Speed Ramping panel.

1. Click **Customize.**
2. Place the playhead on the part of the video clip which you want to speed up or slow down.
3. Click **Add** to add a speed keyframe in that spot. Filmora will mark Speed Ramping on the media.
4. Drag the white dot in the adjustment panel to change the video speed. Drag it upwards to accelerate the video speed or downwards to decelerate it.

### Splice Video Editor FAQs

##### 1\. Why can't I upload projects when using Splice?

Relinking your Splice folder could help if you experience problems downloading or uploading projects. The cache folder in your Splice app can also be cleared to resolve most download problems. Splice may require more space than is available before exporting the movie, relying on your export preferences. Any stored files that are kept may also use space. For instance, the app may require up to 2 GB of storage space if your finished film is 1 GB.

If you're experiencing trouble downloading samples from the website, check that your Splice account is logged in on both the website and the desktop client. If you're not logged onto the same profile on both the website and the app, samples/packs you've purchased online won't appear.

##### 2\. How to remove watermarks on my video saved from Splice?

* **Android**

You can choose between utilizing the Splice app and learning how to speed up video on the splice app or an online watermark removal tool to remove a watermark from Splice. Launch the application and choose the video you wish to modify. To erase any watermarks from your movie, click the three dots in the right corner of your screen and select **"Watermarks."** Following that, you must submit your video to the software and adhere to the watermark removal instructions. Following that, you must submit your video to the software and adhere to the watermark removal instructions.

* **iPhone**

You must confirm that Splice is already loaded on your iPhone and is the most recent version. Open the program after installation, browse the project with the watermark and learn how to speed up video on iPhone with Splice. After selecting the watermark with a tap, click **"Edit"** from the menu in the screen's top right-hand corner. You'll now see a new tab labeled **"Effects"** immediately below the **"Audio"** tab; tap on it, and scroll down until you find the "Watermark" slider. To remove the watermark, slide it the entire way to the left. Your project is now free of the watermark.

## Bottom Line

Most people need help to produce high-quality videos on their devices. Most often, they'll need to transfer them to their computers for extensive editing and polishing. That's no longer the case, particularly with the emergence of mobile editing programs like the Splice app. You can quickly and effortlessly produce high-quality video material with a few clicks.
