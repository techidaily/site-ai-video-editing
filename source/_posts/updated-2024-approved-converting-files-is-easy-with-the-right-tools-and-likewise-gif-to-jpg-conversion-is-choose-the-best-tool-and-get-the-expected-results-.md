The added music clip in ’Blue’ will detach to appear as an independent clip in ‘Green’ within the software timeline.

**●** **Fade Audio In and Out**

To ensure a smooth audio transition between successive clips, try hands at fading the audio in and out by pointing the cursor at a detached green or an attached blue audio clip, followed by dragging the small round circles at the beginning or end of the footage. To introduce a gradual fade in or out effect, drag the round button to the center of the video clip.

**●** **Include Transitions**

Transitions allow a seamless presentation flow by ensuring a smooth movement between different slides appearing in continuity. Add a suitable transition element to the video footage of your slideshow by navigating to and hitting the ‘Transition’ tab in the ‘Functions Toolbar’. The default transition screen time is 1 second, but you can customize the same by double clicking on the effect post the latter’s addition within the editor timeline.

## Quickly Turn Any Video Into a Paper Rip Effect

Video editors use different effects to add creative flair to their projects. These effects can also create a transition between clips, make text or images stand out, or add movement to a static image.
