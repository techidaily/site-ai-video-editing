## Part 1\. What Is Ray Tracing?

Ray Tracing is a powerful rendering technique that can create incredibly realistic lighting and shadows. By tracing the path of light, algorithms can simulate the way that light interacts with virtual objects in a computer-generated world.

This results in more lifelike shadows, reflections, and translucence. Ray Tracing has been responsible for the dramatic increase in realism we've seen in video games over the years, and its benefits are only becoming more apparent as technology improves.

In simple words, Ray Tracing is a computer graphics technique for generating realistic images and works by tracing the light's path from the camera through the scene. This allows for accurate simulations of light interactions, such as reflection, refraction, and shadows.

## Part 2\. Overview Of Ray Tracing

In this part, we will explain what Ray Tracing is from the following sides and for your better understanding.

### History

Albrecht Dürer first gave the idea of Ray Tracing in the 16th century through his invention, the Dürer's door. However, it was not until 1968 that Arthur Appel used a computer for the first time to create a shaded picture through Ray Tracing.

First conceptualized in 1969, Ray Tracing is a common technique used to create computer-generated graphics for movies and TV shows today. This is because studios can use the processing power of multiple computers to get the job done quickly and efficiently. However, even with this extra processing power, Ray Tracing can be a long and difficult process.

Despite the challenges, Ray Tracing is becoming increasingly popular due to computer hardware and software advances. And as technology continues to improve, we can expect to see even more realistic images in the future.

### Advantages

Here're some advantages of Ray Tracing:

1. **Realistic Rendering:** Ray Tracing can create more realistic images than those created with traditional rendering techniques. This is because it calculates the light path more accurately, resulting in more realistic shadows, refraction, and reflections.
2. **Anti-aliasing And Depth Of Field:** Ray Tracing can help you quickly get the anti-aliasing and depth of field effects.

### Disadvantages

The downside of Ray Tracing technology is that it requires a lot of computing power to run, and it can be difficult to create more complex lighting effects like [caustics.](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/3ds-max/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2017/ENU/3DSMax/files/GUID-174FC56F-A781-4D0A-98D7-790D436E98AE-htm.html#:~:text=Caustics%20are%20the%20effects%20of,or%20refraction%20through%20another%20object.&text=To%20calculate%20caustics%2C%20the%20mental,by%20the%20default%20scanline%20renderer.%29)

## Part 3\. How Does Ray Tracing Work?

Ray Tracking uses the process of denoising. The algorithm starts with the camera and traces the shades of shadows and lights.

Ray Tracing uses machine learning to fill in the gaps to form a realistic image. The brighter the scene, the higher the graphics quality; the higher the quality, the more expensive it is. This is why Ray Tracing didn't become popular in the video game industry until recently.

## Part 4\. Ray Tracing In Adobe After Effects

After the introduction of Ray Tracing, we will combine it with a popular video editor - Adobe After Effects to see how it works. Adobe After Effects is a useful and powerful tool for creating visual effects and animated graphics. Adobe introduced Ray Tracing or **Ray-Traced 3D** feature in After Effect to help graphic designers create photorealistic 3D images and render light and shadow. This feature was added in 2012 with the release of After Effects CS 6.

![ray tracing in adobe after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/ray-tracing-in-adobe-after-effects.png)

However, the Ray Tracing feature was later removed from After Effects in 2020 due to multiple reasons:

* The Ray Tracing tool always faced bugs and glitches.
* This feature did not work correctly if you were not using Adobe Media Encoder.
* NVIDIA would change the standards from time to time.

### Functions

Though as mentioned above, the Ray Tracing feature was removed in 2020, its advanced 3D features are still worth of introducing. Here're some functions of **Ray Traced 3D After Effects:**

* Ray Traced allows you to generate and place multiple lights.
* You can set a material option for 3D layers.
* Moreover, you can control how shadows are cast.

### How Does It Work

3D Ray Tracing in After Effects works by giving your text and paths more depth. Extruded layers have a z-axis depth, making them three-dimensional. This extra dimension is viewable from all angles, even when the layer is rotated. In contrast, non-extruded layers have zero depth on the z-axis. So, they will disappear if you try to rotate them 90 degrees on the x or y-axis.

## Part 5\. Ray-Traced 3D Settings In Adobe After Effects

The release of the **Ray-Traced 3D** setting in After Effects CS6 made it easier than ever to create stunning 3D images and animations. Let’s focus on how to use it in After Effects appropriately.

### How To Set It

Adobe After Effects has a three-dimensional space animation setting, but this doesn't include Ray Tracing. You need to change the default settings if you want to use it in your animation. To do so:

Step1 Go to the **Composition Settings** panel to set up the **Ray-Traced 3D** composition.

Step2 Open the **Advanced tab,** and from the **"Renderer"** option, select **"Ray-Traced 3D"** from the drop-down menu.

![setting ray traced 3d in after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/setting-ray-traced-3d-in-after-effects.png)

A layer becomes a 3D layer when the 3D checkbox is checked in the timeline and has more options than a normal layer regarding composition. When you open the layer properties timeline, you can access two options: Geometry Options and Material Options.

The former deals with the layer's depth and edges shape, while the latter deals with the interaction of layers with depth and includes shadow, reflection, refraction, and transparency option.

![layer properties timeline in after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/layer-properties-timeline-in-after-effects.png)

### When To Use It

Here're some instances of when to use **Ray-Traced 3D** compositions in After Effects:

* When you want to create true 3D types and animate them.
* If you want to get a logo extruded and present it as if it was a real object.
* When you want to create realistic shadows or reflections to create stunning motion graphics.
* You can also use it to create realistic images or simulate lighting effects.

![video-editing-tips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/video-editing-tips.jpg)

## Part 1: Things to Learn Before Editing First Draft

You have shot your video and now you’re stuck on the post-processing of that video. Don’t worry! We got you covered through this article which will guide you through the different things which you must learn before editing the first draft of your video.

### Start a video project

Your smartphone and digital camera can let you record multiple videos but what now? You head out to edit your first draft by choosing a suitable platform or software and then you can surely lay back and see the software doing wonders to your raw videos. By starting off with editing, you choose your video editing preferences and then you just let the video editing tools do the magic.

### Get to know the video editing software workspace

Video editing software offer customizable workspaces for different editing tasks. The software workspace streamlines routine actions you take with clips, like editing clips, making DVD and Blu-ray menus, and sharing movies. By placing panels in the layout that best matches your working style, you can personalize your workspace. The additional panels adjust automatically to fit the window as you rearrange them. For various jobs, such as one for editing and one for preview, you can build and store multiple workspaces.

### Understand the timeline

The timeline of your video is the backbone of your digital video editing process. It’s called a timeline because the various pieces of video will be lined up horizontally. In a video editing software, the timeline is where you arrange your video clips and plan out all the modifications you want to do. As you work, you will see every single one of your video and audio clips, effects, and transitions sorted chronologically from beginning to end. All the fundamentals of video editing, including reordering, trimming, and enhancing your footage, are available. To preview how your adjustments will turn out, you can also play your project at any point in the timeline.

### Add clips to timeline

When you have grasped the idea behind a timeline, the next step you need to follow is to add clips into your timeline. Before adding clips to your timeline, it is suggested that you label each clip. Although it does seem like a lot of work, it will be easier to locate all of the clips later on if you're working on a large project. after the footages are gathered and named, add important clips in the beginning of the timeline to begin establishing the video's overall structure and order.

### Editing tools

Besides basic cutting, trimming and cropping, video editing software offer multiple professional editing tools which enhance the outlook your videos and make them 10x better. For example, instead of cutting up a clip into a bunch of small clips and unwanted gaps, use the Ripple Edit tool keep your timeline clean. This means when a clip is trimmed, it causes a ripple effect throughout the rest of your timeline, shifting all other clips into a new timeline position.

Similarly, when working with lengthy timelines, the Razor tool is also really helpful because you can select the clip you wish to cut by dragging your razor over it. So, the Razor cut is the tool to use if you need to make a lot of cuts in your videos quickly.

### Syncing audio and video

You already know how annoying it can be if audio and video don't sync while you're listening to a podcast or viewing a YouTube vlog. The video editing software offer helpful manual and auto sync tools. It can be though a bit of hard work for beginners, but the 'Lights, Camera, Action' approach works best in syncing your audio with your video. To sync audio, you need to record audio first and then through matching the wavelengths displayed on your timeline, you can sync the audio with your video.

### Edit download talking head/interview footage

Now with professional video editing tools, you can make ‘talking head videos’ if you want to share your expertise as a YouTube vlogger or if you want to do employee training. Talking head films are a fantastic way to stimulate the mind and the heart while increasing learner retention in this digital age.

Additionally, with other video editing tools, you can edit your interview footages and for that, you don’t have to mess with timestamps, cutting or splicing videos, or creating transitions between clips, you just edit the transcript of the video and the video edits itself to match.

### Video properties: Scale, position, opacity

Any screen recording, camera-based video, imported video clips, and text picture clips can have their visuals altered using video properties. In video editing software, multiple video properties are offered which include scaling, positioning, rotating, changing the opacity, changing level of reflection and shadow. Additionally, Video properties also include editing the video as a whole or just altering a clip from the video.

### Types of cuts: Straight, J-Cut, L-Cut etc

The different types of cuts used in the video editing process is an effective way to make the transitions in your video pop. Basically, these cuts join two or more clips together via audio. Professional editors call these cuts as ‘split edits. The most common cuts are called J-Cut and L-Cut. They help to mix the content's flow and keep the on-screen narrative in motion. In essence, these edits are necessary to make your scenes feel warm and more authentic.

## Part 2: Practical Video Editing Tips

### Choose right software

The push start of video editing for beginners is based on one common step: know your software or workspace. Selecting the appropriate software for editing your video is the first step in streamlining your video editing process. Although all software often includes the tools that you need to make ordinary video edits, you could favor one over the others based on its usefulness, digital interface, and features. Instead of just using the latest and trending video editing software available, the key is to choose what functions for you and your editing style.

### Use a fast computer

Slow rendering hinders video editing process and other commands given to a computer. From a practical point of view, it is recommended that irrespective of the model of the computer or version of your software; your computer must be efficient to help you to access your files and software easily and to speed up your export time. With a slow computer, you will definitely feel stuck and the video editing complications will haunt you in your dreams.

![video-editing-tips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/edit-video-fact-computer.jpg)

### Watch video editing tutorials

None of us is a pro until we’ve practiced something enough to know everything about it. Video editing requires both; technical knowledge as well as your creativity, so it is better not to do try things on your own. A little guidance can surely help you get through the basics of the video editing process. There are tons of helpful tutorials for making excellent videos on YouTube, vlogs, and educational websites. The majority of tutorials you'll discover online are free, making the readily available at the tip of your fingers.

### Get the project files

Most of the beginner video editors prefer to use the same project files as the tutorial instructors when they are following along. Your work will exactly resemble the demo's sample, which will aid in your understanding of the steps. For precisely this reason, many tutorials let you download the project files. You can repeat a process with your own video files once you've mastered this technique.

### Edit for a story

Remembering your creative objective to create a wonderful story or message through your edited video is one of the most crucial lessons you should learn from this article. It is critically important that you make your film visually appealing and dramatically engaging to effectively evoke the right emotions and to communicate your desired message. Instead of merely adding a huge amount of effects to wow your audience, use your practical and technical skills to do this.

### Maintain an efficient workflow

You'll need to be systematic and organized in addition to having an editing software if you want to become a more competent editor. Putting your projects and files in folders that you may use repeatedly is one method to streamline your process. Besides this, organizing your projects and files into an external hard drive or USB is recommended in case of losing access to your intricately designed projects.

![video-editing-tips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/efficient-workflow-video-editing.jpg)

### Utilize keyboard shortcuts

Keyboard shortcuts speed up the process of video editing and save you ample time. Different keyboard shortcuts are compatible with different video editing software; leaving a few which are mutual in every software. Don't attempt to put all of these shortcuts into action at once. Pick a small number to begin with, and as they become instinctive, add more. You'll progress more quickly if you use less mouse while editing your video.

### Learn important terms

As a beginner, you may not want to feel a lump in the throat caused by the complicated dictionary of video editing software. There are some broad video editing terms that refer to videography as a whole as well as video editing terms specific to the process of editing footage. You must first learn what these terms means for example you may want to know what the terms like ‘aspect ratio, B-roll, bit rate, close up, compression, crop and compositing’ mean.

### Color correct your clips

Do you own a rather boring video? Perhaps it's a little too dull or the colors don't stand out as much as they should? A crucial step is to modify the video's color. This will assist in reducing the saturation and revive your video. Yet, there are some color correcting presets which can be easily accessed in different video editing apps.

![video-editing-tips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/color-correct-video-clips.jpg)

### Select good music

You ever saw an ad on YouTube or other social media platforms without an audio background. You may just want to skip it because the video, which may apparently be appealing, fails to strike you. Coordinating and complimenting your video with a music in the background is like cherry on top. It’s a huge plus to attract viewers’ attention. Though it is necessary that the music you choose must be relevant to your video file and should target the majority. So, choose good music to adorn your videos and trigger emotions in your target audience.

### Add text and graphics

Some people are attracted more towards textual descriptions rather visual representation of content. It is crucial that considering the preferences of majority, you add significant details to your video which can target your audience in a multidimension. You might need to include more text in addition to the title, opening/closing billboards (for broadcasting), and film credits, depending on the type of film you're making. However, you can make dazzling visuals using your editing program if you feel the urge to do so.

### Export web versions

When your film is finished and is ready to be exported, you would have a natural urge to export it at the highest video resolution possible. If it's going to be shown in theatres and on ultra-HD screens, this is unquestionably the best course of action. However, you should also export smaller, higher-quality versions for simpler viewing in the modern day where video projects are typically promoted online and on social media.

The objective of creating a file for the web is to keep its high quality while not making it too large for upload and online viewing. Don't worry if you're unsure of the export settings to utilize. Websites like Facebook, YouTube, and Vimeo all provide suggested export settings to assist you in correctly resizing your content.

## Part 3: 10 Advanced Editing Tips for Professionals

Step 3: Be sure to save your video screenshot on your computer.

Step 4: Since you have exported a relevant frame from your video as a screenshot, you need to open it in a photo editor that can handle PNG pics and transparency, like the GIMP Image Manipulation program. Use any selection tool to select the area of the picture you want to blur on the video. Depending on your preferences, you can choose the free select tool, the ellipse select tool, or the rectangle select tool.

Step 10: You now have a perfect photo with full transparency, which is represented by a checkerboard canvas, except for the section of the video frames you would like to blur that should be pixelized.

Step 11: Use the Export option under the File menu to export the photo to your PC as a . PNG file. To save a picture with a transparency channel, you need to use the . PNG extension.

Step 14: The picture will be displayed before the video, blurring only the portion of the video where you modified the frame. The other parts of the video won’t be touched.

## How to Blur Part of a Video Using OpenShot

Designed for Windows, Mac, and Linux, OpenShot is a free, open-source, and cross-platform video editor. While there's no predefined function or filter in this tool to help you blur part of a video, OpenShot has another way of blurring static parts of your video: it uses an image.

OpenShot blur part of video is free, and you'll use its open-source programs as a base program for the edition of the video and GIMP Image Manipulation software to edit photos. Follow the guide below to learn how to blur out something in a video using OpenShot.

Step 1: Download OpenShot and install it on your device.

![blur part of a video using openshot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-12.png)

Step 2: Take a screenshot from your video, where the part you want to blur is easily visible. You can do this by going to a relevant frame and utilizing Save Current Frame with a camera icon, located on the right side of the video preview window in a standard program configuration.

![blur part of a video using openshot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-11.png)

Step 3: Be sure to save your video screenshot on your computer.

Step 4: Since you have exported a relevant frame from your video as a screenshot, you need to open it in a photo editor that can handle PNG pics and transparency, like the GIMP Image Manipulation program. Use any selection tool to select the area of the picture you want to blur on the video. Depending on your preferences, you can choose the free select tool, the ellipse select tool, or the rectangle select tool.

![blur part of a video using openshot - select blur area](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-13.png)

Step 5: In the blur filters submenu, open the Pixelize tool and adjust the options that suit your preferences. You can use CTRL-Z to cancel the operation, and repeat it until you find the best combination of blurring settings.

Step 6: When you are satisfied with blurring, right-click on the blurred area and select Invert in the Select submenu; this will allow you to select the entire part of the frame that has not been blurred, which is the part you would like to get rid of because you will only have to use the blurred part of your video overlay where necessary.

Step 7: Now, cut the section of the picture you do not want to keep. You can do this by using CTRL-X. The blurred filter for your video is now ready.

![blur part of a video using openshot - cut unwanted section](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-14.png)

Step 8: If after cutting you notice a plain color rather than a checkerboard canvas representing transparency, use CTRL-Z to cancel the cut. Then, use CTRL-I to invert the selection again to get control of the blurred selection again, and copy or cut it using CTRL-X or CTRL-C.

Step 9: Create another image using CTRL-N, and ensure you have navigated to the advanced options and selected transparency as the fill-in color, and paste your selection there.

Step 10: You now have a perfect photo with full transparency, which is represented by a checkerboard canvas, except for the section of the video frames you would like to blur that should be pixelized.

Step 11: Use the Export option under the File menu to export the photo to your PC as a . PNG file. To save a picture with a transparency channel, you need to use the . PNG extension.

Step 12: Now return to OpenShot video editor and import the generated picture with a pixelized portion in the OpenShot video project. Next, add the picture as an overlay track. Make sure it's above the video track.

Step 13: If the program asks you to import the photo as an image sequence, select the NO option because you need to import a still photo, and not a video sequence.

Step 14: The picture will be displayed before the video, blurring only the portion of the video where you modified the frame. The other parts of the video won’t be touched. You can make adjustments to ensure the picture track is only displayed at required moments. And that's how to blur part of a video using OpenShot.

## Conclusion

● Now that you know how to blur out part of a video, you can have fun and censor anything you want in your clips. Use Filmora to blur moving and still parts on your video.

Step 11: Use the Export option under the File menu to export the photo to your PC as a . PNG file. To save a picture with a transparency channel, you need to use the . PNG extension.

Step 12: Now return to OpenShot video editor and import the generated picture with a pixelized portion in the OpenShot video project. Next, add the picture as an overlay track. Make sure it's above the video track.

Step 13: If the program asks you to import the photo as an image sequence, select the NO option because you need to import a still photo, and not a video sequence.

Step 14: The picture will be displayed before the video, blurring only the portion of the video where you modified the frame. The other parts of the video won’t be touched. You can make adjustments to ensure the picture track is only displayed at required moments. And that's how to blur part of a video using OpenShot.

## Conclusion

● Now that you know how to blur out part of a video, you can have fun and censor anything you want in your clips. Use Filmora to blur moving and still parts on your video.
