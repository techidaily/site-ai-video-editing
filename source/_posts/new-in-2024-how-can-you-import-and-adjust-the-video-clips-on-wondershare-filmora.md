The main difference is that VLC is more of a media player. People use it to watch movies or play songs. Yes, it also lets you merge audio and video, convert videos, and screen record. But that's about it; it does not give you features that challenge your creativity.

On the other hand, Wondershare Filmora is a video editor. It gives you tools that enable you to create original videos and enhance them. Therefore, it is the better option if you want to be a YouTuber or renowned video maker.

That said, the best use case for VLC is using it to play videos and music. It's also a great free media converter. Meanwhile, Wondershare Filmora is better suited for video content creation. The tools it provides you with allow the creation of videos that are sure to captivate your audience.

## Conclusion

Merging audio and video is easy. VLC and Wondershare Filmora are fantastic tools that can help you with that task. Suppose you want to do more than just merge audio and video. The latter is the better option. It includes powerful video editing tools that help you create amazing videos. Aside from merging, Filmora also offers audio synchronization, auto beat sync, audio detaching, and more. These features ensure the output file will be of high quality.
