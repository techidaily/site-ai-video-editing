## Part 1 **What is AR and the Technology Used for Augmented Reality Development?**

Expanding the acronym, AR stands for Augmented Reality, a relatively newer concept in the world of graphic imaging and other computer based real-time applications. Talking of the exact explanation, augmented reality refers to a responsive synchronization of real world elements into digital platforms, while upgrading the same with high end perceptual information generated from specialized computer systems.

The entire concept of augmented reality rests on 3 major aspects, viz., a synchronized combination of the virtual and real world environments, a responsive interaction of associated elements in real-time, and a precise 3-dimensional registration of virtual and real elements. The aforesaid aspects of augmented reality are often guaranteed by a number of sensory modalities, like that of auditory, visual, somatosensory, olfactory and haptic ones.

**Technology Behind Augmented Reality**

As far as the technology behind the development of **augmented reality video** is concerned, the overall implementation is categorized into 3 different tasks. The process is initiated with generating concise, high resolution images of real world elements, followed by creating an overlay of computer generated 3D images on the previously generated real world images. This is further succeeded by facilitating an interactive user engagement and interaction within the simulated surroundings.

The process of technology implementation is seconded by a responsive display mechanism which can be done conveniently on any one among glasses, smartphones, screens, head-mounted displays and handheld devices. Concerning the factor of output credibility, head-mounted displays take the credit of generating a much more immersive augmented reality in comparison to the other display alternatives.

## Part 2 **What Is the Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality?**

02 [What Is the Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality?](#Part 2)

03 [10 Examples of Augmented Reality (AR) In Marketing](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **What is AR and the Technology Used for Augmented Reality Development?**

Expanding the acronym, AR stands for Augmented Reality, a relatively newer concept in the world of graphic imaging and other computer based real-time applications. Talking of the exact explanation, augmented reality refers to a responsive synchronization of real world elements into digital platforms, while upgrading the same with high end perceptual information generated from specialized computer systems.

The entire concept of augmented reality rests on 3 major aspects, viz., a synchronized combination of the virtual and real world environments, a responsive interaction of associated elements in real-time, and a precise 3-dimensional registration of virtual and real elements. The aforesaid aspects of augmented reality are often guaranteed by a number of sensory modalities, like that of auditory, visual, somatosensory, olfactory and haptic ones.

**Technology Behind Augmented Reality**

As far as the technology behind the development of **augmented reality video** is concerned, the overall implementation is categorized into 3 different tasks. The process is initiated with generating concise, high resolution images of real world elements, followed by creating an overlay of computer generated 3D images on the previously generated real world images. This is further succeeded by facilitating an interactive user engagement and interaction within the simulated surroundings.

The process of technology implementation is seconded by a responsive display mechanism which can be done conveniently on any one among glasses, smartphones, screens, head-mounted displays and handheld devices. Concerning the factor of output credibility, head-mounted displays take the credit of generating a much more immersive augmented reality in comparison to the other display alternatives.

## Part 2 **What Is the Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality?**

Advancements in technology has treated the world with a multitude of concepts to simulate real-time elements into digital environments. In addition to augmented reality, the techniques of virtual and alternate reality have come into focus in recent times to address the diversely specific needs of digital and real world integration.

Lack of proper awareness, however, leads to the treatment of these fundamentally different concepts as one and the same thing. Considering the credibility of such technologies towards addressing certain specific purposes, it becomes important to understand the difference among these apparently similar concepts. Having said that, let us make an attempt to realise the dissimilarity between augmented and virtual reality in the following section:

**●** **Underlying Concept**

Stressing on the parameter of conceptual utility, augmented reality refers to the integration of digital aspects into a real-time surrounding, most probably through a smartphone or camera, whereas, virtual reality on the other hand, is responsible for the replacement of a real-time setting with a simulated environment.

**●** **Existence Constraints**

Talking about augmented reality, the technique showcases the coexistence of the real and virtual surroundings, with the primary goal of supplying extra information about the real-time environment, which can be accessed without a content search. Conversely, virtual reality is predominantly concerned with bringing about a complete shift of the user’s actual ambiances to an entirely fabricated environment that undertakes an independent existence.

**●** User Control

Speaking on the extent of user control, augmented reality allows you to monitor your real world presence, mostly with a smartphone, while users of virtual reality are entirely controlled by the system, with strictly no self-access. Also, you would require a headset equipment to make use of virtual reality.

## Part 3 **Examples of Augmented Reality (AR) In Marketing**

Having discussed enough about the fundamental aspects of augmented reality, let us proceed towards understanding the credibility of **augmented video** in the light of modern day information centered applications. While there are manifold varieties of augmented reality usage, the following section highlights the best examples of integrating AR into brand marketing:

### 01Walmart- Inventory Control

## Want to Give a Bold and Colorful Look to Your Ad or Abstract Art Project? This Quick and Easy Tutorial Teaches How to Create a Risograph Effect in Photoshop

Risograph printing is a digital printing process that combines the best features of offset and screen printing used by many small print shops and design studios to provide trendy vibes and a classic look to the images.

If you’re a novice graphic designer or illustrator, you’ve probably seen Risograph prints and wondered how they are made. Well, this article will help you **create a risograph effect in Photoshop** quickly!

Without further delay, let’s get started with our step-by-step tutorial!

## What Is Risograph Effect?

Before we look into how to create a risograph effect in Photoshop [in the later part of this article](#%5FHow%5FTo%5FUse), let’s have a basic understanding of Risograph.

Risograph was created in **1986** by a Japanese company called **Riso Kagaku Corporation.** It’s a form of stencil printing, a technique that uses a stencil to create an image on a piece of paper.

The Risograph machine prints images by building them up one layer at a time, with each subsequent layer being a different color. Because of this, each print produced is imperfect, though some artists believe this only adds to the Risograph's unique charm and distinct look.

The Risograph printing effect gives images a vibrant and bold look, making them perfect for ads, magazines, and abstract artworks. The printing method is also used for many products, including books, fabric, magazines, newspapers, plastic, metal, and even some forms of packaging.

## How To Use Photoshop To Create Risograph Effect

The tutorial will be divided into three parts to help you master the risograph effect-creating skills to give your design project a distinct look.

Firstly, we will focus on how to use Photoshop in the following way to create the primary risograph effect.

### How To Create the Basic Risograph Effect in Photoshop

Step3 Let's place an object/subject onto our canvas. Set the issue to "**Multiply**," right-click on it and choose "**Convert to Smart Object**."

![choose convert to smart object](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/converting-main-object-to-smart-object-to-create-risograph-effect-in-photoshop.png)

Step4 To add a Gradient Map Layer, click **“Layer,”** scroll down and click **“New Adjustment Layer.”** Select **“Gradient Map…”** from the drop-down menu and click **“OK”** to confirm.

![click layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/selecting-gradient-map-from-layer-to-create-risograph-effect-in-photoshop.png)

Use the **“Properties”** panel and select the **“gradient”** colors. Here we’ve chosen shades of **“White”** and **“Red.”** Click **“OK”** to apply.

![select the gradient color](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/applying-gradient-map-to-create-risograph-effect-in-photoshop.png)

Step5 For the image to have less contrast, click **“Image”** in the top toolbar and click **“Adjustments.”** Select **“Levels…”** from the menu. Now, set the black output to **73.**

![click image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/applying-adjustment-level-to-create-risograph-effect-in-photoshop.png)

Finally, click **“Filter”** and open the **“Filter Gallery.”** Select **“Sketch” > “Torn Edge,”** set Image balance to **30,** smoothness, and contrast to **15, 15** respectively. Click **“OK”** to apply the changes.

### How To Create A Dual-Tone Risograph Effect

After creating an image with the risograph effect, how to make it more visually vertical? At this time, the dual-tone impact will help us have a more delicate picture.

The dual-tone effect is a technique in the risograph effect that combines two or more overlapping images to give a more vibrant look to the final project or emphasize the critical concept, information, or idea.

To create a dual-tone risograph effect in Photoshop, do the following steps.

Step1 To create a dual-tone risograph effect, add another subject to the canvas and set the blending mode to **Multiply.** Also, change its opacity to blend the two issues well. Make sure to turn the subject to **Smart Object** by right-clicking on the object's layer and selecting **"Convert to Smart Object."** Adjust the position of the subject on the previous one.

![add another subject to the canvas](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/converting-subject-to-smart-object-in-photoshop-to-create-risograph-effect.png)

Step2 Select the layer of the new subject and click **“Layer”** Click **“New Adjustment Layer”** and select **“Gradient Map…”** from the drop-down menu.

Open the Gradient Editor and set the gradient colors of the new subject. Click **“OK”** to confirm. Click **“Image”** and choose **“Adjustments”** from the drop-down menu. Select **“Levels”** and set the **Black Output** to **73.**

Step3 Click **“Filter”** and open **“Filter Gallery.”** Navigate to **“Swatches” > “Torn Edge”** and set the **Image Balance, Smoothness, and Contrast** to **30, 15, and 15,** respectively, if you want to smooth down the subject.

Finally, your dual-tone effect is created in Photoshop!

### How To Blend Images Using Layer Modes

In this part, let’s see how to use the layer modes to add another subject to the canvas and blend it with the previous ones.

Step1 Place the new subject on the canvas and set the layer mode to **Multiply** by pressing the **“Ctrl + Shift + N”** and selecting **“Multiply”** from the drop-down menu in the new pop-up window. Click **“Ok”** to apply your changes.

To adjust the size of the object, click **“Edit”** from the top toolbar, and select **“Transform.”** From the drop-down menu, select **“Scale.”** Use the handles to make the object smaller or larger.
