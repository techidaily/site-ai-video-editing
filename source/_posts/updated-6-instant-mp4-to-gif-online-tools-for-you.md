Color grading can feel daunting, especially if you don’t have much experience grading footage. Fortunately, LUTs can help you grade your footage almost effortlessly. Like your favorite Snapchat or Instagram filters, a LUT can instantly transform dull-looking footage into something more vibrant. So, what is a LUT?

LUT is an acronym for “look up table.” A LUT is a preset color that you can apply to footage to transform how it looks. Video editors, colorists, and filmmakers use LUTs to speed up color grading. However, you don’t need to be an experienced professional to use them. With minimal color grading and video editing experience, you can easily apply LUTs to your footage.

LUTs are usually denoted by the .LUT, .CUBE, or. 3DL file extensions. You can create LUTs using several video editing and color grading applications, such as Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, DaVinci Resolve, and Filmora. In this guide, we’ll explore how to create your own LUT and use custom LUTs in Filmora.

03 [How to Use Custom LUTs in Filmora](#part3)

## Why We Need to Create Our Own LUT

Many video editing tools usually come with pre-installed LUTs that you can quickly apply to footage. However, you may need to create your own LUT in some cases. Here are some reasons why you may need to create your own LUT:

### 1\. To Create a Particular Feeling

Clients may want their videos to evoke a particular emotion. If the pre-installed LUTs that come with your video editing software can’t evoke the particular feeling the client wants, you may need to create your own LUT. Some key questions to ask yourself when creating the LUT include:

* What is the genre of the video project?
* What kind of atmosphere do you want to create?
* Are there any colors or tones that you should emphasize?
* Once you ask yourself these questions, you’ll be able to create an appropriate LUT for the client.

For instance, if the genre of the video project is a comedy, you may want to create a LUT that highlights orange, yellow, and its tones to create a cheerful atmosphere.

On the other hand, if the project’s genre is an action video, you may want to create a LUT that highlights blue, green, and other similar tones to evoke a serious feeling.

### 2\. To Showcase Several Looks

Color grading often comes down to preference. There isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution when grading footage, especially if the video project is on a neutral topic.

Creating custom LUTs can allow you to preview different looks for clients and allow them to choose the footage they like.

### 3\. To Speed Up the Color Grading Process

Perhaps the biggest pro of LUTs is their ability to speed up the color grading process. Creating your own LUTs can allow you to use the same LUT for multiple projects that are similar and save time during color grading.

In addition, since color grading can take a considerable amount of time, creating your own LUTs can be helpful if you regularly work on projects with tight deadlines.

And if you’re working with an editor or team of editors, adding your own LUT to the footage can speed up editing and give the final cut a more refined look.

### 4\. When Working with Multiple Editing Tools

Nearly all popular video editing applications support LUTs. If you regularly use several applications for editing and color grading, LUTs can help you quickly achieve the same colors across all the various applications you use.

All editing applications have different color grading tools, so it’s relatively challenging to achieve the same colors across several applications. Creating your own LUTs can make it easier to transfer color values between different software.

## How to Create Your Own LUT

Creating LUTs is fairly simple. However, to create effective LUTs, ensure you prepare your source footage to avoid issues down the line when applying the LUT to your footage.

Here are some crucial things you should do when prepping your source footage:

* Ensure your exposure is perfect.
* Ensure your white balance is correct.
* Ensure your lighting reflects an accurate balance of highlights and shadows.

By ensuring these things are in order, you will be able to create a versatile LUT that you can apply across a wide variety of footage.

After prepping your source footage, you can then create your own LUT. Here’s how you can create a LUT in Filmora following a few simple steps:

#### Tips for Filmora New Version Users

Due to the updating of Filmora, some of the following operations may be different from the operations of the new version, new version users can click on the latest operation guide - [**Apply 3D LUT in color correction**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) in the User Guide section.

## Conclusion

LUTs can make the color grading process easier and quicker. They can prove incredibly useful, especially if you’re unfamiliar with the color grading workflow or hard-pressed for time. They can also elevate your footage and make it look more cinematic.

While many video editing applications come with several pre-installed LUTs, try to create your custom LUTs using the steps above. Creating your LUTs from scratch may take you slightly more time than using pre-created LUTs, but creating the perfect LUT could save you time grading future projects.

When creating your own LUTs, try to create and apply several different LUTs to see which one is suitable for your footage. There usually isn’t a one-size-fits-all LUT option, so creating and testing out different LUTs is the best way to find the perfect custom LUT for your projects.

## Conclusion

LUTs can make the color grading process easier and quicker. They can prove incredibly useful, especially if you’re unfamiliar with the color grading workflow or hard-pressed for time. They can also elevate your footage and make it look more cinematic.

While many video editing applications come with several pre-installed LUTs, try to create your custom LUTs using the steps above. Creating your LUTs from scratch may take you slightly more time than using pre-created LUTs, but creating the perfect LUT could save you time grading future projects.

When creating your own LUTs, try to create and apply several different LUTs to see which one is suitable for your footage. There usually isn’t a one-size-fits-all LUT option, so creating and testing out different LUTs is the best way to find the perfect custom LUT for your projects.

Color grading can feel daunting, especially if you don’t have much experience grading footage. Fortunately, LUTs can help you grade your footage almost effortlessly. Like your favorite Snapchat or Instagram filters, a LUT can instantly transform dull-looking footage into something more vibrant. So, what is a LUT?

LUT is an acronym for “look up table.” A LUT is a preset color that you can apply to footage to transform how it looks. Video editors, colorists, and filmmakers use LUTs to speed up color grading. However, you don’t need to be an experienced professional to use them. With minimal color grading and video editing experience, you can easily apply LUTs to your footage.

LUTs are usually denoted by the .LUT, .CUBE, or. 3DL file extensions. You can create LUTs using several video editing and color grading applications, such as Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, DaVinci Resolve, and Filmora. In this guide, we’ll explore how to create your own LUT and use custom LUTs in Filmora.

## Why We Need to Create Our Own LUT

Many video editing tools usually come with pre-installed LUTs that you can quickly apply to footage. However, you may need to create your own LUT in some cases. Here are some reasons why you may need to create your own LUT:

### 1\. To Create a Particular Feeling

Clients may want their videos to evoke a particular emotion. If the pre-installed LUTs that come with your video editing software can’t evoke the particular feeling the client wants, you may need to create your own LUT. Some key questions to ask yourself when creating the LUT include:

* What is the genre of the video project?
* What kind of atmosphere do you want to create?
* Are there any colors or tones that you should emphasize?
* Once you ask yourself these questions, you’ll be able to create an appropriate LUT for the client.

For instance, if the genre of the video project is a comedy, you may want to create a LUT that highlights orange, yellow, and its tones to create a cheerful atmosphere.

On the other hand, if the project’s genre is an action video, you may want to create a LUT that highlights blue, green, and other similar tones to evoke a serious feeling.

### 2\. To Showcase Several Looks

Color grading often comes down to preference. There isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution when grading footage, especially if the video project is on a neutral topic.

Creating custom LUTs can allow you to preview different looks for clients and allow them to choose the footage they like.

### 3\. To Speed Up the Color Grading Process

Perhaps the biggest pro of LUTs is their ability to speed up the color grading process. Creating your own LUTs can allow you to use the same LUT for multiple projects that are similar and save time during color grading.

In addition, since color grading can take a considerable amount of time, creating your own LUTs can be helpful if you regularly work on projects with tight deadlines.

And if you’re working with an editor or team of editors, adding your own LUT to the footage can speed up editing and give the final cut a more refined look.

### 4\. When Working with Multiple Editing Tools

Nearly all popular video editing applications support LUTs. If you regularly use several applications for editing and color grading, LUTs can help you quickly achieve the same colors across all the various applications you use.

All editing applications have different color grading tools, so it’s relatively challenging to achieve the same colors across several applications. Creating your own LUTs can make it easier to transfer color values between different software.

## How to Create Your Own LUT

Creating LUTs is fairly simple. However, to create effective LUTs, ensure you prepare your source footage to avoid issues down the line when applying the LUT to your footage.

Here are some crucial things you should do when prepping your source footage:

* Ensure your exposure is perfect.
* Ensure your white balance is correct.
* Ensure your lighting reflects an accurate balance of highlights and shadows.

By ensuring these things are in order, you will be able to create a versatile LUT that you can apply across a wide variety of footage.

After prepping your source footage, you can then create your own LUT. Here’s how you can create a LUT in Filmora following a few simple steps:

#### Tips for Filmora New Version Users

## Cropping a Video in Davinci Resolve [Step by Step]

Sometimes, when it comes to editing a video, we don’t even know where to start, because there are too many options –online platforms which instantly help us edit our clips, without lengthy process of downloading and installing computer programs;

Mobile applications with user-friendly interface, allowing us to manipulate the footage quickly, easily choose our preferred formats and effects and adjust the clips according to the requirements our target platforms set; more time-consuming and advanced software with even more options, but which seem to require us to be more skilled and experienced in editing.

Even though editing, as other innovative and creative actions, is limitless in its possibilities, sometimes we just need to make a little change in our project and it’s quite enough for us to be satisfied with our work and material. One of the things which is rather simple to do, but sometimes essential, when it comes to making our clips better and more picturesque for the audience, is cropping a video.

So, in this article, we have discussed software Davinci Resolve and how to crop a video there. A step by step, written guides help you make the best out of your video clips and never lose track of what you are doing, also, comparing different video editing platforms and tools will make you understand which one works best for you or/and your company. Another part of this article was Wondershare Filmora X and how to crop a video there, also, with a detailed guide there. We hope you know a little more about programs, editing, and your own choice!

To touch upon the functions, Davinci Resolve includes modules for video editing, color correction, audio mixing and effects, and visual effects. The interface of it is quite advanced, but would be well and soon understandable for someone who has ever used a similar editing software, such as Adobe Premiere Pro. If you are interested in everything the software has to offer, we recommend watching this very viral beginner [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63Ln33O4p4c).

Now, back to cropping – so, you want to crop the video you took or got somehow, and you also think about using Davinci Resolve? Cropping, in most cases, meaning different applications, platforms and software, is not a complicated task at all, and you can do it in a very short amount of time in Davinci Resolve, too. Therefore, let’s delve into the steps on how to do it!

First, download and install the software, and when it is finished, launch it. You will see a totally clean program, until you add the video you want to work on. To do so, you have to find File in the top menu, find Import and then choose Media.

![crop-video-davinci](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-davinci-2.jpeg)

Then it will open a new window where you can choose your file…

![crop-video-davinci](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-davinci-3.jpeg)

Your chosen file will be added in Media Pool, and to direct it into the sequence, you have to drag and drop it there.

![crop-video-davinci](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-davinci-4.jpeg)

![crop-video-davinci](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-davinci-5.jpeg)

And then you might have difficulty to find the crop button. But here it is – below the screen, on the left, there are two icons, and the second one says – Tools…

![crop-video-davinci](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-davinci-6.jpeg)

 Click on the Tools button and more options will appear down the screen where the video clip is shown. And there, you will notice the famous Crop icon, just the second one, which will put your clip in a new window with the option below to crop each side, plus, to add feather around the cropped video.

![crop-video-davinci](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-davinci-7.jpeg)

When you are ready to make a video bigger and adjust it to a frame size, you need to choose Transform button, left to the Crop icon. You can “touch” the dots on the video and manually manage the size of your cropped clip.

![crop-video-davinci](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-davinci-8.jpeg)

![crop-video-davinci](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-davinci-9.jpeg)

When you are ready to save the video you cropped, find Quick Export – you will see the button above the clip, on the right. A little window with settings will appear, so you can choose the format you want to save your video in, and then, of course, click on Export for the last time.
