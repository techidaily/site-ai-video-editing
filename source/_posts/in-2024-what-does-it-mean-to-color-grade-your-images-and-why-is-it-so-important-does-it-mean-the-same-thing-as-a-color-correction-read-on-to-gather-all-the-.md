## Don't Confuse Color Grading With Color Correction

The first way to fully appreciate color grading is by differentiating it from its closest term—color correction. Many people use both of them interchangeably, and that's wrong. Although color grading and color correction are post-production processes that enhance image colors, they perform different roles.

Here's how to differentiate color grading from color correction:

| Differentiating Factor          | Color Grading ;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Color Correction                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Definition                      | Color grading is a process that enhances an image's color by stylizing or giving it a cinematic appearance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Color correction is a process that adjusts color mistakes in an image by giving it a consistent appearance. This process balances colors by adjusting whites and blacks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Purpose                         | The primary aim of color grading an image is to evoke specific emotions in the viewers. Color grading leverages the emotional and psychological effects of colors to manipulate the viewers' moods. You can use color grading to give your images different tones or themes like fear, femininity, youthfulness, passion, anger, sadness, etc.                                                               | Unlike color grading, the color correction does very little in setting the tone or mood that an image carries. Instead, it corrects specific mistakes in the image to make it look as natural to the human eyes as possible. Generally, camera lenses and the human eyes view pictures differently. Color correction changes a photo's look to make it more appealing to humans than the camera. It makes black colors appear darker and adds more white to whites to create the desired effect. |
| Stage in the production process | Color grading typically comes after color correction in the post-production process. That's because the effects of color grading are more appealing on a color-corrected picture.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Color correction comes before color grading. This process does the major work of balancing colors and correcting errors. Color grading only fine-tunes what color correction has done, giving it a professional finish.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Example                         | One of the most obvious examples of color grading is in motion pictures. For example, Sci-Fi movies typically have a very saturated blue color. However, you will notice a little redder in romantic movies. Note that filmmakers can use different color grades in movies to draw attention to specific details or represent changes in the storyline. Color grading produces the same effects in pictures. | Color correction is most prominent in documentaries to make pictures and videos look more real to the human eye. Other times, color corrections just adjust one color to merge the rest of the image or video.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

## Terms and Tools Used In Color Grading

These are the most common terminologies photo editors use when color grading an image:

#### ● Hue

Hue is the general name for describing pure color. That means it defines color without alluding to its brightness, vividness, etc. It describes a color's position in the color wheel.

#### ● Saturation

When a photo editor talks about saturation, they refer to the hue concentration that defines a specific color. Saturation describes color shades and focuses on how colorful they are. Examples of colors with zero saturation are white, black, and grey.

![color grading photography - saturation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/color-grading-photography-2.jpg)

#### ● Luminance

Luminous describes how bright, well-lighted or dark a color is. Highlights, mids, and shadows can influence luminance.

![color grading photography - luminance](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/color-grading-photography-3.jpg)

#### ● Additive Color

Additive colors are non-primary colors. However, they typically result from mixing primary colors (blue, red, green).

#### ● Color Cast

Color cast means that the image's coloring doesn't look as natural as it should be. This usually happens when different light sources get mixed.

#### ● Temperature

Temperature defines how cool or warm a color is. Cool temperatures typically describe blues and purples, while orange and red represent the warmth.

### The essential tools for color grading include

#### ● White Balance

White balance helps to make your photos look more natural by correcting color cast issues. After using white balance, the result is that the whites in your pictures would look exactly like the human eye will perceive it. White balance adjusts your image's color cast to make them look warmer or cooler.

#### ● Brightness and Contrast

Brightness and contrast are essential in color grading and are among the most used photo editing tools. Different sliders control brightness and contrast during editing. It's important to note that your image's brightness will affect the contrast and vice-versa. That's why they usually appear together, even if they refer to different tools.

#### ● The Three-Way Color Corrector

Many photographers refer to the three-way corrector as the color correction's workhorse. That's because this tool adjusts hue, saturation, brightness, and contrast in a single interface. The three-way corrector performs the job of three tools in one interface. Using the three-way corrector ensures that you work faster than usual.

#### ● The Fast Color Corrector

The fast color corrector is like the three-way corrector. However, there are many limitations with the number of potential looks you can achieve with this tool. The fast color corrector primarily focuses on adjusting tint and saturation. Its major advantage over the three-way corrector is its user-friendliness and simplicity.

#### ● Curves

While using curves is pretty complicated, the tool offers impressive functionality that you can't refuse. Curves are very powerful and precise. Their main function is to overhaul or remove your image's brightness altogether to give it a distinctive look.

#### ● The Unsharp Mask and Sharpening Tools

With the unsharp mask and sharpening tools, you can give your picture's edges a sharp illusion by modifying the contrast. This is typically useful for images that you shoot in dark conditions.

Sharp pictures are always a lovely sight. However, these tools can't correct pictures taken out of focus. To get the best results from these tools. Then you can start moving them back till you get your desired sharpness.

#### ● Color Match

As the make implies, color match tools modify a target picture's colors to fit the reference image. This is an automatic process and helps to save time.

## Common Steps To Color Grade a Photo

These are the essential stages for color grading your images:

● Step 1:  
The first step in color grading is deciding how warm or cool you want your image to look. Then, modify the white balance to suit your desired warmth or coolness.

● Step 2:  
After adjusting the white balance, the next step is to adjust saturation or hue.

● Step 3:  
The next step is to focus on the histogram. A histogram is a common feature in many photo editing software that informs you of your image's tonal values. The goal in this stage is to ensure equal color distribution. Keep adjusting your image till the colors are even.

● Step 4:  
Work on your highlights and shadows by modifying the green, red, and blue curves. Also, adjust your vibrancy setting for a good effect.

● Step 5:  
Explore split toning. Split toning is a process that involves adding colors to highlight and shadows independently. Learning how to split tone can make a difference in your photo editing.

## Tips For Color Grading Photography

The following best practices will enhance your color grading:

* About oversaturation or under-saturation. Your saturation should be just right to produce the perfect result. So, always be sure to pay maximum attention to this process. This tip is particularly useful when working with portraits.
* Remember that color grading doesn't fix a bad shot. So, be sure to improve your photography skills and take the best shots for excellent color grading results.
* Shoot your images in RAW. Doing this guarantees more control over your pictures' colors.
* Always experiment with different looks until you get your precise effect. Lightroom is one of the best color grading apps to use.
* Exercise maximum caution when manipulating backgrounds. Don't do too much, especially when you're taking an indoor shot. That's because manipulating indoor backgrounds too much can mismatch the foreground and background, making your portrait look weird.

| Example                         | One of the most obvious examples of color grading is in motion pictures. For example, Sci-Fi movies typically have a very saturated blue color. However, you will notice a little redder in romantic movies. Note that filmmakers can use different color grades in movies to draw attention to specific details or represent changes in the storyline. Color grading produces the same effects in pictures. | Color correction is most prominent in documentaries to make pictures and videos look more real to the human eye.

## Terms and Tools Used In Color Grading

These are the most common terminologies photo editors use when color grading an image:

#### ● Hue

Hue is the general name for describing pure color. That means it defines color without alluding to its brightness, vividness, etc. It describes a color's position in the color wheel.

#### ● Saturation

When a photo editor talks about saturation, they refer to the hue concentration that defines a specific color. Saturation describes color shades and focuses on how colorful they are. Examples of colors with zero saturation are white, black, and grey.

#### ● Luminance

Luminous describes how bright, well-lighted or dark a color is. Highlights, mids, and shadows can influence luminance.

![color grading photography - luminance](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/color-grading-photography-3.jpg)

#### ● Additive Color

Additive colors are non-primary colors. However, they typically result from mixing primary colors (blue, red, green).

#### ● Color Cast

Color cast means that the image's coloring doesn't look as natural as it should be. This usually happens when different light sources get mixed.

#### ● Temperature

Temperature defines how cool or warm a color is. Cool temperatures typically describe blues and purples, while orange and red represent the warmth.

#### ● White Balance

White balance helps to make your photos look more natural by correcting color cast issues. After using white balance, the result is that the whites in your pictures would look exactly like the human eye will perceive it. White balance adjusts your image's color cast to make them look warmer or cooler.

#### ● Brightness and Contrast

Brightness and contrast are essential in color grading and are among the most used photo editing tools. Different sliders control brightness and contrast during editing. It's important to note that your image's brightness will affect the contrast and vice-versa. That's why they usually appear together, even if they refer to different tools.

#### ● The Three-Way Color Corrector

Many photographers refer to the three-way corrector as the color correction's workhorse. That's because this tool adjusts hue, saturation, brightness, and contrast in a single interface. The three-way corrector performs the job of three tools in one interface. Using the three-way corrector ensures that you work faster than usual.

#### ● The Fast Color Corrector

The fast color corrector is like the three-way corrector. However, there are many limitations with the number of potential looks you can achieve with this tool. The fast color corrector primarily focuses on adjusting tint and saturation. Its major advantage over the three-way corrector is its user-friendliness and simplicity.

#### ● Curves

While using curves is pretty complicated, the tool offers impressive functionality that you can't refuse. Curves are very powerful and precise. Their main function is to overhaul or remove your image's brightness altogether to give it a distinctive look.

#### ● The Unsharp Mask and Sharpening Tools

With the unsharp mask and sharpening tools, you can give your picture's edges a sharp illusion by modifying the contrast. This is typically useful for images that you shoot in dark conditions.

Sharp pictures are always a lovely sight. However, these tools can't correct pictures taken out of focus. To get the best results from these tools. Then you can start moving them back till you get your desired sharpness.

The first step in color grading is deciding how warm or cool you want your image to look. Then, modify the white balance to suit your desired warmth or coolness.

● Step 2:  
After adjusting the white balance, the next step is to adjust saturation or hue.

● Step 3:  
The next step is to focus on the histogram. A histogram is a common feature in many photo editing software that informs you of your image's tonal values. The goal in this stage is to ensure equal color distribution. Keep adjusting your image till the colors are even.

● Step 4:  
Work on your highlights and shadows by modifying the green, red, and blue curves. Also, adjust your vibrancy setting for a good effect.

● Step 5:

## Don't Confuse Color Grading With Color Correction

The first way to fully appreciate color grading is by differentiating it from its closest term—color correction. Many people use both of them interchangeably, and that's wrong. Although color grading and color correction are post-production processes that enhance image colors, they perform different roles.

Here's how to differentiate color grading from color correction:

| Differentiating Factor          | Color Grading ;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Color Correction                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Definition                      | Color grading is a process that enhances an image's color by stylizing or giving it a cinematic appearance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Color correction is a process that adjusts color mistakes in an image by giving it a consistent appearance. This process balances colors by adjusting whites and blacks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Purpose                         | The primary aim of color grading an image is to evoke specific emotions in the viewers. Color grading leverages the emotional and psychological effects of colors to manipulate the viewers' moods. You can use color grading to give your images different tones or themes like fear, femininity, youthfulness, passion, anger, sadness, etc.                                                               | Unlike color grading, the color correction does very little in setting the tone or mood that an image carries. Instead, it corrects specific mistakes in the image to make it look as natural to the human eyes as possible. Generally, camera lenses and the human eyes view pictures differently. Color correction changes a photo's look to make it more appealing to humans than the camera. It makes black colors appear darker and adds more white to whites to create the desired effect. |
| Stage in the production process | Color grading typically comes after color correction in the post-production process. That's because the effects of color grading are more appealing on a color-corrected picture.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Color correction comes before color grading.

| Definition                      | Color grading is a process that enhances an image's color by stylizing or giving it a cinematic appearance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Color correction is a process that adjusts color mistakes in an image by giving it a consistent appearance. This process balances colors by adjusting whites and blacks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Purpose                         | The primary aim of color grading an image is to evoke specific emotions in the viewers. Color grading leverages the emotional and psychological effects of colors to manipulate the viewers' moods. You can use color grading to give your images different tones or themes like fear, femininity, youthfulness, passion, anger, sadness, etc.                                                               | Unlike color grading, the color correction does very little in setting the tone or mood that an image carries. Instead, it corrects specific mistakes in the image to make it look as natural to the human eyes as possible. Generally, camera lenses and the human eyes view pictures differently. Color correction changes a photo's look to make it more appealing to humans than the camera. It makes black colors appear darker and adds more white to whites to create the desired effect. |
| Stage in the production process | Color grading typically comes after color correction in the post-production process. That's because the effects of color grading are more appealing on a color-corrected picture.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Color correction comes before color grading. This process does the major work of balancing colors and correcting errors. Color grading only fine-tunes what color correction has done, giving it a professional finish.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Example                         | One of the most obvious examples of color grading is in motion pictures. For example, Sci-Fi movies typically have a very saturated blue color. However, you will notice a little redder in romantic movies. Note that filmmakers can use different color grades in movies to draw attention to specific details or represent changes in the storyline. Color grading produces the same effects in pictures. | Color correction is most prominent in documentaries to make pictures and videos look more real to the human eye. Other times, color corrections just adjust one color to merge the rest of the image or video.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

## Terms and Tools Used In Color Grading

These are the most common terminologies photo editors use when color grading an image:

#### ● Hue

Hue is the general name for describing pure color. That means it defines color without alluding to its brightness, vividness, etc. It describes a color's position in the color wheel.

#### ● Saturation

When a photo editor talks about saturation, they refer to the hue concentration that defines a specific color. Saturation describes color shades and focuses on how colorful they are. Examples of colors with zero saturation are white, black, and grey.

![color grading photography - saturation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/color-grading-photography-2.jpg)

#### ● Luminance

Luminous describes how bright, well-lighted or dark a color is. Highlights, mids, and shadows can influence luminance.

![color grading photography - luminance](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/color-grading-photography-3.jpg)

#### ● Additive Color

Additive colors are non-primary colors. However, they typically result from mixing primary colors (blue, red, green).

#### ● Color Cast

Color cast means that the image's coloring doesn't look as natural as it should be. This usually happens when different light sources get mixed.

#### ● Temperature

Temperature defines how cool or warm a color is. Cool temperatures typically describe blues and purples, while orange and red represent the warmth.

### The essential tools for color grading include

#### ● White Balance

White balance helps to make your photos look more natural by correcting color cast issues. After using white balance, the result is that the whites in your pictures would look exactly like the human eye will perceive it. White balance adjusts your image's color cast to make them look warmer or cooler.

#### ● Brightness and Contrast

Brightness and contrast are essential in color grading and are among the most used photo editing tools. Different sliders control brightness and contrast during editing. It's important to note that your image's brightness will affect the contrast and vice-versa. That's why they usually appear together, even if they refer to different tools.

#### ● The Three-Way Color Corrector

Many photographers refer to the three-way corrector as the color correction's workhorse. That's because this tool adjusts hue, saturation, brightness, and contrast in a single interface. The three-way corrector performs the job of three tools in one interface. Using the three-way corrector ensures that you work faster than usual.

#### ● The Fast Color Corrector

The fast color corrector is like the three-way corrector. However, there are many limitations with the number of potential looks you can achieve with this tool. The fast color corrector primarily focuses on adjusting tint and saturation. Its major advantage over the three-way corrector is its user-friendliness and simplicity.

#### ● Curves

While using curves is pretty complicated, the tool offers impressive functionality that you can't refuse. Curves are very powerful and precise. Their main function is to overhaul or remove your image's brightness altogether to give it a distinctive look.

#### ● The Unsharp Mask and Sharpening Tools

With the unsharp mask and sharpening tools, you can give your picture's edges a sharp illusion by modifying the contrast. This is typically useful for images that you shoot in dark conditions.

Sharp pictures are always a lovely sight. However, these tools can't correct pictures taken out of focus. To get the best results from these tools. Then you can start moving them back till you get your desired sharpness.

#### ● Color Match

As the make implies, color match tools modify a target picture's colors to fit the reference image. This is an automatic process and helps to save time.

## Common Steps To Color Grade a Photo

These are the essential stages for color grading your images:

● Step 1:  
The first step in color grading is deciding how warm or cool you want your image to look. Then, modify the white balance to suit your desired warmth or coolness.

● Step 2:  
After adjusting the white balance, the next step is to adjust saturation or hue.

● Step 3:  
The next step is to focus on the histogram. A histogram is a common feature in many photo editing software that informs you of your image's tonal values. The goal in this stage is to ensure equal color distribution. Keep adjusting your image till the colors are even.

● Step 4:  
Work on your highlights and shadows by modifying the green, red, and blue curves. Also, adjust your vibrancy setting for a good effect.

● Step 5:  
Explore split toning. Split toning is a process that involves adding colors to highlight and shadows independently. Learning how to split tone can make a difference in your photo editing.

## Tips For Color Grading Photography

The following best practices will enhance your color grading:

* About oversaturation or under-saturation. Your saturation should be just right to produce the perfect result. So, always be sure to pay maximum attention to this process. This tip is particularly useful when working with portraits.
* Remember that color grading doesn't fix a bad shot. So, be sure to improve your photography skills and take the best shots for excellent color grading results.
* Shoot your images in RAW. Doing this guarantees more control over your pictures' colors.
* Always experiment with different looks until you get your precise effect. Lightroom is one of the best color grading apps to use.
* Exercise maximum caution when manipulating backgrounds. Don't do too much, especially when you're taking an indoor shot. That's because manipulating indoor backgrounds too much can mismatch the foreground and background, making your portrait look weird.

## Are You Aware that You Can Create Your Own Lower Thirds for Video? Read This Article for a Tutorial on How to Customize One

As a video creator, there are times when you need to use Lower Thirds. Although many lower-third presets are available, making unique and personalized ones can ensure your video stands out.

So, to empower your inner video creator, this article will show you how to make your own Lower Thirds in Filmora.

## Part 1: What is Lower Third

A Lower Third is a mix of motion graphic design and texts that are placed in the lower area of the screen. It provides additional information, such as a person's name or other relevant information, without distracting the audience from the main content.

Lower Thirds can be used in various settings, such as news broadcasts or interviews, to help provide viewers with additional context.

### (1) A simple line and texts

![a simple line and texts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-1.gif)

##### Step1 Create a simple line

Go to the **Media library > Sample Media folder > choose a color sample**. For this tutorial, we will select the white color. Then, drag and drop this sample color onto the upper video track.

![create a simple line](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-2.jpg)

Double-click the white sample clip to open the settings and scale it to 30%. Then, reposition the white bar to your desired place.

![double-click the white sample clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-3.gif)

##### Step2 Mask the white sample

Since we want to create a thin horizontal shape, you need to make some adjustments to the white sample by using an image mask. So, go to the **Effect window > Utility > Image Mask**. Then, drag and drop the “Image Mask” onto the white color sample.

![mask the white sample](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-4.gif)

After that, double-click the white sample on the timeline and find the Image Mask setting. Choose the shape that works best for your needs. For this tutorial, we are going to use this one. Then, adjust the X and Y-axis scale numbers until it becomes a thin white line. Click OK.

![double-click the white sample](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-5.jpg)

##### Step3 Add a text for your lower thirds

Go to **Titles > Plain Text > Basic 6** and drop it onto the second video track above the white line clip. Don't worry about the exact position yet. We can adjust it later.

![add a text for your lower thirds](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-6.jpg)

Double-click on the text clip to open the settings, then type some text there and adjust the size and font.

![double-click on the text clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-7.jpg)

##### Step4 Add animation to the text

Click **Advanced > Animation > Up Down 1** animation. Adjust the animation length by dragging the two brackets on the timeline on the right side. Click Ok.

![add animation to the text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-8.jpg)

##### Step5 Add keyframes to the white line clip when entering

Double-click on the white line clip on the timeline to show the animation keyframe setting window. Then, playback the animation of the text, find a position before the text animation starts and move the play head there. Make sure it is close enough to when the texts show up so the white line enters the keyframe right before the text enters.

![add keyframes to the white line clip when entering](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-9.gif)

Click to add a keyframe, double-check to make sure it is the final position you want, and the opacity should be 100 at this point.

After that, move the play head to the left for a few frames and click add again. To make sure the white line is out of the frame before entering, you need to change the Y-axis number. Change the opacity to 0 as the white line starts in transparent color.

![move the play head to the left](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-10.gif)

These two keyframes will create an effect of the line entering the frame while turning from transparent to white. Playback the animation and adjust the keyframes marks by dragging them to the left or right until you feel the timing looks good.

##### Step6 Add keyframes to the white line clip when exiting

Playback again to find where the texts disappear, then move the play head to a position after it. Also, make sure it's close enough to where the texts disappear so you can ensure the white line exits right after the texts disappear. Then, add the keyframe.

![add keyframes to the white line clip when exiting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-11.gif)

You don't need to change the setting this time because this keyframe is used to keep the position and opacity unchanged.

Instead, move the play head again to the right for a few frames and add another keyframe. Move the texts out of the frame by changing the y-axis number, then change the opacity to 0\. This keyframe is used to create the white line animation exiting the frame and turning back to transparent in the meantime.

![move the texts out of the frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-12.gif)

Playback the video and see how it looks.

### (2) A name card with a solid background

![a name card with a solid background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-13.gif)

Sometimes you might want to create a name card with a solid background like the sample above. To create it, we can use the same method. Here's how to do it:

##### Step1 Make the lower third background

Select the white color sample from the sample color folder and drop it onto the upper video track of the video.

![make the lower third background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-14.jpg)

Change the scale to 30%, then reposition the white sample to your desired place. Click OK.

![change the scale to 30%](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-15.gif)

##### Step2 Create an image mask for the lower third background

Drag and drop the Image Mask onto the white sample clip on the timeline.

![create an image mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-16.gif)

Double-click on the white sample clip to activate the video setting window and find the Image Mask settings. Then, choose the mask shape you need. You can also adjust its size by changing the X or Y-axis.

![double-click on the white sample clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-17.jpg)

##### Step3 Add some text

Once the background card is in place, go to Titles > Plain Text > ‘Basic 6' and drop it onto the third video track.

![go to titles](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-18.jpg)

Now, type in the texts as needed. Reposition and scale the texts to make sure they are on top of the background shape.

![type in the texts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-19.jpg)

##### Step4 Add animation to the text

Click Advanced > Animation > Push. Then, adjust the animation length accordingly. Click Ok.

![click advanced](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-20.jpg)

Double-click on the background clip to show the animation tab setting. Then, playback the text animation and find a position earlier than the start and add a keyframe.

![double-click on the background clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-21.jpg)

Similar to the tutorial before, move the play head again a few frames earlier to the left and add another keyframe. If you want to have the name card flying in from the left while expanding, you can change the X-axis and scale of the background card to 0\. Change the opacity to 0 to create a color change from transparent to white.

![move the play head again](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-22.gif)

To let the background card exit the frame, add two more keyframes to the background card. Add a keyframe with no changes to settings. Move the play head to the right for a few frames and add another keyframe.

![add two more keyframes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-23.gif)

If you want the name card to exit to the bottom, change the Y-axis number until it exits. Change the scale and opacity to 0\. Then, playback and adjust the keyframes.

Finally, you can add a Subscribe button from the new default Filmora element pack “Social Media.”
