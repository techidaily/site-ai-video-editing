**Step 3: Cut Video Part to Slow Zoom**

Dissect the specific part of the video that you want to put in the slow zoom feature from Filmora. Take the red indicator across the timeline to the point where you want to start the specific part. Click the split icon on the red line to divide the video. Drag the indicator to the point where you want to end the specific part of the video for the slow zoom feature.

**Step 4: Set the Speed of the Clip**

**Step 5: Add Animation Keyframes**

To add animation keyframes, right-click on a certain clip of the TikTok video and select the "Add Animation" button from the option of “Animation” in the drop-down menu. Go across the “Customize” section in the “Animation” tab across the menu that opens up and move the indicator where you want to create a keyframe. Click on "Add' and find a keyframe added to the video. Move the indicator further along the clip to add another animation, as two keyframes create an animation keyframe.
