## So, without Wasting Time, Let Me Show You How to Mask a Video in Wondershare Filmora. Let's Get Started

Masking is a video effect that allows you to cut out a scene and use the overlay to duplicate, hide, modify, or reveal your video footage. Just think of it as cutting something on your video so you can see what's in the bottom layer. So, without wasting time, let me show you how to mask a video in [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Let's get started!

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

### _Masking Trick 1:_

First, you need to shoot footage to add the masking effect. To do that, find a doorway with enough space to walk back and forth before setting up a camera with a tripod facing the entrance. Make sure you set the camera at the center height of the door to prevent lens distortion.

![place the camera facing the door](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/place-the-camera-facing-the-door.gif)

With the tripod set up, film yourself walking behind the door toward the camera. Get close to the camera, then walk back to the door. Then, cross the doorway slowly before walking out of the frame. Now let's get editing with Wondershare Filmora.

![walk backwards](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/walk-backwards.gif)

Step 1 Fire up Wondershare Filmora, then import the clip on the video editor. After that, move the clip to the timeline by merely dragging it. Add two clips on the first and second tracks.

![fire up wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-1.jpg)

Step 2 Now proceed to hide the first track before adding a freeze frame on the second track. To do that, move the playhead to find the starting scene with the door frame without your subject. Then, right-click the clip and tap **Add Freeze Frame**. After that, extend the freeze frame area and cut out the rest of the clip.

![proceed to hide the first track](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-2.jpg)

Step 3 Next, click the **Effect** button and find the **Image Mask** effect in the **Utility** folder. Now drag the effect to the top layer.

![click the effect button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-3.jpg)

Step 4 Double-click the clip to open the video editing options, then choose a rectangle image mast under **Video Effects**. Ensure the mask is inverted by clicking the **Invert Mask** checkbox. Now adjust the mast to match the door frame before clicking **Ok**.

![double-click the clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-4.jpg)

Step 5 Up to this point, unhide the first track, then find the scene where the subject appears on the door frame. On the first track, cut the clip before the subject appears on the stage before cutting the scene where the subject crosses the door frame for the second time on the second track. Now play the video to view your masking effect.

![unhide the first track](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-5.jpg)

### _Masking Trick: 2_

In the second masking effect, we want to create a subject walking in and outside a tree. To do that, find a tree with a clear background, then place your camera to film the center of the tree trunk where the subject will be walking.

![create a subject walking in and outside a tree](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/tree-with-clear-background.gif)

Now film the subject walking from one side of the tree, stop for a second, and then turn back. They should repeat the same action, but this time they'll walk forward outside the frame after the one-second stop. That's all!

![film the subject walking from one side of the tree](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/walk-away-from-the-tree.gif)

Step 1 Import the clip on Filmora, then add the footage on the first and second timelines. After that, hide the first track, then find the scene where the subject walks forward away from the tree in the second track. Cut off the area before that action.

![import the clip on filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-6.jpg)

Step 2 Next, click **Effects**, choose **Utility**, then drag the **Image Mask** effect on the second video track. Then, double-click the second clip, select **Video Effects**, and choose a rectangular option that masks the right side of the frame.

Now adjust the mask until it covers the entire right side of the tree. After that, unhide the first clip and move the second to match the first clip's timing. You can also cut out everything outside the scene of the first clip.

![adjust the mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-7.jpg)

Step 3 Play the video to see your subject walking in both directions of the tree.

![play the video to see your subject walking in both directions of the tree](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-8.jpg)

### _Masking Trick 3:_

For this masking illusion, we'll create a video with a subject jumping over a house. So, set up your camera tripod on a low level in front of the building. You can also add a mark on the ground for your subject to know where to jump.

![create a video with a subject jumping over a house](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/set-the-camera-low.gif)

Now tell your subject to walk to the marker before jumping and walking out of the scene.

![tell your subject to walk to the marker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/jump-in-front-of-camera.gif)

Step 1 Import the clip into Filmora and add it to the first and second tracks. Now hide the first track before finding the scene without the subject in the second track and add a freeze frame. After that, extend the freeze frame area and cut out the rest of the clip.

![import the clip into filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-9.jpg)

Step 2 Now, it's time to customize the clip with a mask. To do that, head to the **Utility** folder under **Effects** and choose **Image Mask**. Click the **Invert Mask** box to invert the mask.

![customize the clip with a mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-10.jpg)

Step 3 Double-click the video track and choose an image mask under **Video Effects**. Note that you may need several combinations of masks to mask out the sky and leave the building. So, play around with different masking shapes until the sky is covered.

![double-click the video track](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-11.jpg)

Step 4 After masking, unhide the first track on the timeline before playing the video to find the scene where the subject appears and cut off everything before that scene. Also, find the scene where the subject jumps in the air and cut the clip in the second track. Then, delete everything after that scene.

![unhide the first track on the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/masking-tricks-12.jpg)

Step 5 Play the video to see your subject jumping over the building and walking away from the scene.

## Step by Step to Crop Videos with CyberLink PowerDirector

Video Editing is an art form dependent on various elements and factors that are part of your video; this means people, items, or objects in the background can often make or break the viewing experience.

Can you imagine having shot a scene with impeccable attention to detail, but a small uncontrollable action leaves a portion of an unwanted cable or equipment in the frame? Bummer, right? But luckily, due to the power of video editing software, it is not hard to deal with such problems.

A way to work with such clips is to use the crop function while editing, as it can help emphasize or detract attention from a particular part of any video project.

**Author's Note:** While filming, try to capture footage in the highest resolution allowed by the available camera hardware; this will give you more room to play with while using the crop function.

To preface, CyberLink PowerDirector is a free video editing tool capable of accomplishing this and providing a professional touch to your video projects. And like other competing software, the program not only allows you to crop into clips but also uses keyframes to modify aspects like panning and zoom. So to help you perform this action, in this article, we list the steps you will need for cropping into video clips with PowerDirector. As an added bonus, we have also included the method to perform the same actions in WonderShare Filmora.

**_Note:_** _We documented the steps in this guide with PowerDirector 365 and WonderShare Filmora X._

## How to Crop Videos with CyberLink PowerDirector?

The idea of cropping into clips has always been an easy action to perform; once you have PowerDirector 365 open, follow the steps listed below.

_If you do not already have CyberLink PowerDirector 365, download the software by visiting_ [_Cyberlink's official website_](https://www.cyberlink.com/products/powerdirector-video-editing-software/features%5Fen%5FIN.html)_._

**Step 1:** Create a new video project in Cyberlink PowerDirector 365 by choosing Full Mode.

![crop-video-in-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-in-powerdirector-1.jpeg)

**Note:** Full Mode in Cyberlink PowerDirector 365 provides access to a full-featured video editing tool, similar to Wondershare Filmora. The other available options cater to distinct video types.

**Step 2:** Import media onto the Timeline from the Media Library; in this guide, we have gone ahead and used the pre-existing stock footage.

![crop-video-in-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-in-powerdirector-2.jpeg)

**Step 3:** Now, click on the video file on the Timeline; this will activate the video toolbar giving you access to the various controls built into PowerDirector 365\. Hover over the tools open, following which you need to click on the Crop, Zoom, and Pan option.

![crop-video-in-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-in-powerdirector-3.jpeg)

**Step 4:** Pick either corner of the frame visible around the video and set the area you want the clip to focus upon; following this, click Save.

![crop-video-in-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-in-powerdirector-4.jpeg)

This action will crop the video clip according to your desired size.

**Tip**:

The activation of Keyframes while cropping will allow you to create an effect that slowly zooms into the footage. To do this, set Keyframe Point 1 at a specific time (say the fifth second) and at one zoom level (say zero) and create Keyframe Point 2 at another time (fifteenth second) and a different zoom level (say fifty). So, between the fifth second and fifteenth second, the zoom will steadily increase and raise emphasis on an object. You can also add an element of position to this action if you want the focus to be on something not in the center of the screen.

**Definition:** Keyframes while Video Editing is a software-based feature that allows you to set In and Out Points, giving clips between the two positions different properties that change as the playhead continues to move. These properties can be increased zoom, rotation, different colors, or even a gradual pan.

We recommend experimenting with this feature if you want to bring a more dynamic feeling to your video project.

## **An Easier Way to Crop Video with Wondershare Filmora**

While Cyberlink PowerDirector 365 is a powerful video editing tool, in our experience, its menus are not as simple to navigate as some of the other competing video editing tools available, Wondershare [Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) included.

Having read this bit of the guide, we believe you may have noticed how Filmora is more convenient due to the easier access it provides to the crop function.

## The Bottom Line

So, at the end of the day, both software listed in this article are fully functional and highly-capable video editing tools, but saving time spent in front of the computer is a huge factor for any video editor.

And Wondershare Filmora does just that with its modern iconography and increased accessibility. With its thoughtful, less-frills approach, Filmora is the one to pick if you do not want to be bogged down by needless menus and have to hunt for actions that will help you create a video that you would want to watch yourself.

**Note:** Full Mode in Cyberlink PowerDirector 365 provides access to a full-featured video editing tool, similar to Wondershare Filmora. The other available options cater to distinct video types.

**Step 2:** Import media onto the Timeline from the Media Library; in this guide, we have gone ahead and used the pre-existing stock footage.

![crop-video-in-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-in-powerdirector-2.jpeg)

**Step 3:** Now, click on the video file on the Timeline; this will activate the video toolbar giving you access to the various controls built into PowerDirector 365\. Hover over the tools open, following which you need to click on the Crop, Zoom, and Pan option.

![crop-video-in-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-in-powerdirector-3.jpeg)

**Step 4:** Pick either corner of the frame visible around the video and set the area you want the clip to focus upon; following this, click Save.

![crop-video-in-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-in-powerdirector-4.jpeg)

This action will crop the video clip according to your desired size.

**Tip**:

The activation of Keyframes while cropping will allow you to create an effect that slowly zooms into the footage. To do this, set Keyframe Point 1 at a specific time (say the fifth second) and at one zoom level (say zero) and create Keyframe Point 2 at another time (fifteenth second) and a different zoom level (say fifty). So, between the fifth second and fifteenth second, the zoom will steadily increase and raise emphasis on an object. You can also add an element of position to this action if you want the focus to be on something not in the center of the screen.

**Definition:** Keyframes while Video Editing is a software-based feature that allows you to set In and Out Points, giving clips between the two positions different properties that change as the playhead continues to move. These properties can be increased zoom, rotation, different colors, or even a gradual pan.

We recommend experimenting with this feature if you want to bring a more dynamic feeling to your video project.

## Step by Step to Resize Video in Davinci Resolve

While editing videos, you may change the aspect ratio of the video to change the size of the video to upload on different platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Pinterest, and Instagram. Videos come in different sizes and shapes. Some videos are portraits while the others are landscapes. Similarly, videos are captured in different places with different devices. So, we need to set a certain size of the video.

Definitely, a very large video can make delays in the work, similarly, a small size video can result in low resolution and bad quality. Resizing a video saves a lot of time and money whether you have a business, a YouTube channel, a short film, or a feature film. Today, we shall discuss **how to resize the videos?**

The two **free ways to resize the video…**

Here are a number of tools used in the market to resize the videos. We are going to teach How to resize the video in **Davinci resolve** and **Fimora wondershare**. Once you have mastered How to resize a video, it would be as simple as the ‘click’.

Now the good news is, you can dramatically export the videos in the same resolution in a very short time.

**Let’s dive in** **!**

## **Part 1\. How to resize video in Davinci Resolve**

Davinci Resolve is a very powerful tool to edit videos. Let’s suppose, you have some videos shots and all the videos have different sizes, some of the videos fit in the timeline and some are out of the timeline. No matter, you are going to make a video on the same scale with the same size.

Resize the video can be done in three ways:

1. Zoom in zoom out
2. Cropping
3. Retime and scaling

### **1\. Zoom in and Zoom out**

First of all, select the videos in your timeline. You should stay in the middle of the frame to set it because it’s too wide. The timeline moves forward and backward. Let your video be 4k, go to the bottom-right corner and click on timeline format. Select timeline resolution, select ultra HD, or whatever you want from the drop-down list.

![resize-video-davinci](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/resize-video-davinci-1.png)

Go to the **inspector** from the up-right corner and select **Transform** under the **video** section. Here you can resize your image. Place the mouse over **zoom** **x** (Horizontal) and **zoom** **y** (vertical) values to drag left or right for zoom in or zoom out. The video can be resized accordingly.

Here you can also change its **rotation**.

![resize-video-davinci](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/resize-video-davinci-2.png)

### **2\. Cropping**

Go to the **inspector** from the up-right corner and select **Transform**. Now choose **Cropping.** Here are four options **Crop left, crop right, crop Bottom,** and **crop Top.** You can drag the scale from left to right to adjust the crop settings according to the desired result.

![resize-video-davinci](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/resize-video-davinci-3.png)

### **3\. Retime and scaling**

Go to the **inspector** from the up-right corner and select **retime and scaling**. You can choose stretch, Fit, Fill, or crop for cropping the video from the drop-down list.

* The **Crop** function is used to remove the unnecessary or uneven part of the video.
* The **Fit** function is to have the video auto-center and the selected clips are formatted according to the screen dimensions.
* **Stretch** Function allows changing the length of the certain clip at a certain duration.

![resize-video-davinci](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/resize-video-davinci-4.png)

After transforming, cropping, and resizing the videos, you can copy the same settings without repeating the above steps for each video.
