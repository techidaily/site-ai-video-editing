Making several backups is perhaps the most critical thing you can do for your project. Whether your computer dies suddenly or your editing application crashes, you'll have a point to fall back on if you have a backup. Making this a habit will save you a lot of time and work in the long term. How many copies of your data should you make? You should create at least three project duplicates in the best-case scenario.
