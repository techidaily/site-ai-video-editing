## Top 5 Best Video to PPT Converters You Should Know

Almost three decades after its debut, Microsoft PowerPoint has become a hallmark of professionalism and quality in the presentation software industry. Traditional PPT files produced by PowerPoint have many drawbacks, including the fact that the content of your presentations may be readily edited and reused by others.

The Save to Video option in 2010 and subsequent versions of PowerPoint addresses this problem by allowing users to produce video files that may be readily shared on social media, video sharing sites, or utilized in eLearning courses. The built-in PPT file conversion function in newer versions of PowerPoint has several restrictions that prohibit you from picking the video file type or incorporating embedded media files in the PowerPoint presentation video.

That's why we've compiled a list of the top five video to ppt converter to make the process of turning a PowerPoint presentation into a movie as simple and enjoyable as possible.

![camtasia-studio-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/camtasia-studio-poster.jpg)

**Price: A free trial is offered, and a single-user license is $249.**

An unencumbered trial edition of this video editing program helps you create professional-looking films from PowerPoint presentations. Camtasia Studio's single-user license is a good alternative for those who just need to convert a few presentations for free, but if you're searching for a full-featured video to ppt converter, you should consider purchasing Camtasia.

When using the software's premium edition, you may add multimedia files, such as PowerPoint presentations and webcam footage to your final video project. With Camtasia Studio, you can easily post your films in nearly any video file type on social media.

##### Pros

With Camtasia Studio, adding transitions, callouts, or text effects is a cinch.

Expensive.

## Best 8 Educational Video Websites for Teachers

The examples below are the only few that are possible to find on the internet and offer a thousand free educational videos usable in the classroom or online classroom. It's up to you if you can use or follow all the websites I provide. Of course, the internet offers unlimited help for teachers to tap into, but it has dangers around quality, inappropriate content, advertisement, and copyrights. Double-check everything before you use in your classes and show it to your students.

## Khan Academy (<https://www.khanacademy.org/>)

Provides a free personalized learning resource for all ages. Khan Academy also offers different exercises and instructional videos that empower the students to study at their own pace inside the classroom or outside. For the students who want to learn something, these are the following subjects they tackle: Science, Mathematics, History, Economics, Reading & Language, Life Skills, and more.

![khan academy](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/khan-academy.jpg)

They are working hard to ensure that Khan Academy gives teachers of all stripes the tools they need to understand better the students' activities and how to assist them effectively. The Khan Academy teacher dashboard offers an overview of the overall performance of the class as well as comprehensive student profiles. Khan Academy is free, and anyone can learn anything. They are nonprofit because, according to Khan Academy, they believe in free, world-class education anywhere.

**Is Khan Academy suitable for learning?**

An excellent and convenient resource for academic study is Khan Academy. Anyone who desires to study may benefit from Khan, even though it is specially designed for kids in grade school through the college level stage. The website has several fantastic features, like the ability to enable subtitles for each video and the availability of the whole Khan Academy course in at least 18 other languages.

However, it would be convenient if the text-only material could use the built-in text-to-speech feature. Students may now access all courses using the Khan Academy app, which also enables downloading for offline learning. It's doubtful that many students will open Khan Academy and be eager to start using it because its organization and interface are both rather formal, and its activities are simple.

## SchoolTube (<https://www.schooltube.com/>)

\- is a secure platform for sharing videos without distraction-causing side video suggestions and advertising. Teachers and students can upload a YouTube video to their SchoolTube playlist. Still, all ancillary material, including advertising that would typically be included on the YouTube website, has been stripped off.

![school tube](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/school-tube.jpg)

Many choices are available on the SchoolTube website, including the ability to submit movies, screenshot a device's display, record video inside the application, add attachments to films, and add a video quiz. Further exploration of the application reveals more possibilities for the editor. SchoolTube is suitable for teachers and students since it lets them contribute or make their movies with brand-new features that encourage more interactive learning in a secure digital setting.

**Is SchoolTube suitable for learning?**

This product is an excellent place to submit student-made movies or to obtain videos related to your classroom topics. The subject or topic they are discussing can be used to filter channels for students and teachers. I think it is a fantastic alternative to using YouTube, a more restricted site in the classroom. When you require students to watch films related to the ideas you are discussing, SchoolTube is a terrific resource to use. It is a safer or more closely supervised website than YouTube.

## TeacherTube (<https://www.teachertube.com/>)

\- is an online community for sharing instructional videos. They seek to offer a safe venue or site for teachers, schools, and students to access educationally focused videos. Currently, they provide an incredible 60 topics or subjects for all ages from Science, Math, History, Social Studies, Language & Arts, and more. They also have educational songs for kids and programming languages for the higher level. TeacherTube also provides anytime, anywhere professional development for teachers. And the site where teachers can post educational videos on their own designed for students to view to learn a concept or skill.

![teacher tube](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/teacher-tube.jpg)

**Is TeacherTube suitable for learning?**

Despite being helpful in situations with no access to YouTube, this has a restricted search function. For each topic searched, there are just a few relevant search results. Results might range widely in terms of quality. If required, this would be a helpful resource, but it might be even better if it were more thorough.

## TED-Ed (<https://www.ed.ted.com/>)

\- the videos and courses on TED-Ed may be used to supplement practically any topic by adding video learning, knowledge tests, and conversation prompts. Students are likely to get immediately engaged with the content because it is outstanding and comes from some of the top brains in the world. Videos are excellent for group viewing or use in flipped classrooms.

![ed ted](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/ed-ted.jpg)

You can use TED-Ed's videos and lessons to supplement almost any subject with video learning, basic knowledge checks, and discussion questions. Browse by topic or subtopic or search by keyword. You can filter by target age, content type, subtitles, etc. The content is remarkable and comes from some of the world's best minds, and the students will likely engage with it immediately. Videos can be great to watch as a class or to include as part of a flipped classroom.

**Is Ted-Ed suitable for learning?**

TED-Ed is a fantastic tool for students and instructors searching for inspiration, knowledge, and perhaps even some fun, thanks to the high-quality videos and the vast library of lesson ideas. The cartoons and films are just as well-made and engaging as some of the most remarkable television programming. The website presents a complicated subject intelligently, while a few students may feel bored or annoyed with videos on more advanced topics.

## Crash Course (<https://thecrashcourse.com/> _)_

Can provide a free high-quality educational video on various subjects. Crash Course also alters the traditional textbook model by presenting information in a fast-paced format to enhance students' learning experience. With the help of the Crash Course team, they created different kinds of videos on 21 subjects for high school and college learners.

![crash course](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/crash-course.jpg)

Primary and Intermediate or grade school students can also use this site. According to Crash Course, they also have hundreds of millions of views on their YouTube channel. While the show is a beneficial tool for teachers and students, it also has an extensive viewership of casual learners seeking online educational content independently.

**Is Crash Course suitable for learning?**

The sarcastic tone and rapid speed of Crash Course will undoubtedly keep students intrigued, but the material is often dubious, and the videos offer primarily passive learning. Each Crash Course video's host is enthusiastic about the subject. The majority of the Crash Course videos are pretty accurate. However, in an attempt to simplify topics, several Crash Course Kids videos fall short.

## National Geographic Kids (<https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/>)

It offers educational videos, games, and other activities, especially on animals and the natural world. The students will enjoy playing games with simple instructions and a range of difficulties and frequently practice memory, logic, and other skills. They can contribute to the site by leaving some comments, taking quizzes, viewing user photos, and sharing their own.

![national geographic kids](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/national-geographic-kids.jpg)

**Is National Geographic Kids suitable for learning?**

The National Geographic Kids website is easy to navigate and contains exciting materials for students, while some content isn't properly structured and may be challenging to find. Clicking on a menu choice at the top of the screen leads you to a related page, but lingering over that same option brings up extra alternatives that you wouldn't see if you clicked. Keyword searches and links supplied by the teacher will be helpful here. For example, the site has tools such as a Homework Help section that teaches kids how to be an expert fact-checker, write an animal report, and more. Still, it's not precisely apparent how to get there unless you search for it.

## NeoK12 (<https://www.neok12.com/>)

Uses educational videos and animations for the students. It is a great way to learn, allowing the students to build a visual model in their minds by watching their videos. The graphical representation of the ideas aids their comprehension, piques their interest, and promotes self-directed learning in each learner. Educational videos in NeoK12 and games are possibly one of the most effective learning tools. Even the higher levels of students will find the platform enriching and entertaining. NeoK12's website also features tools not only for learners but also for teachers.

![neo k12](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/neo-k12.jpg)

**Is NeoK12 suitable for learning?**

This platform is a rather extensive library of interesting educational tools, and the films and brain games are both free and well worth a look. Kids may augment the movie with other resources, such as interactive diagrams, flowcharts, fun, and puzzles, for a relatively inexpensive monthly charge. The films are simple teaching tools that usually contain supplementary resources that help youngsters to put what they've learned into practice. There are various "Universe" films, for example, under the Earth and Space area. Children who watch these films may also access relevant games, diagrams, activities, and photographs to prepare presentations.

## Discovery Education (<https://www.discoveryeducation.com/>)

Has made a name for itself as the top supplier of digital content, curriculum resources, and professional development for grades K–12\. Discovery Education is used by almost 5.6 million students in Canada, all 50 states, and other countries. Why not give it a shot in the Philippines or somewhere else in Asia?

![discovery education](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/discovery-education.jpg)

Teachers can use the free resources on Discovery Education to enhance their existing curriculum from the Grade School Level up to High School Level. An example of a tool with this platform is the Puzzlemaker, whose vocabulary makes crosswords and other types of puzzles. They can also be assigned specific videos or interactive activities to introduce new ideas at home.

**Is Discovery Education suitable for learning?**

Discovery Education is an excellent free resource. The commercial edition has considerably more resources, and after using it, I sincerely wished they would make it accessible for free or at a lower cost. The items aimed at students are straightforward and uninspiring; the website is intended for teachers. I would love to see them unlock more of the stuff that is locked behind the barrier, maybe in a cyclical manner where some films or resources are made available for free for a month at a time.

## How To Make A Do-It-Yourself Video

Wondering how YouTubers make their own video from scratch? Want to open a YouTube channel and you don’t know how to start? Then, in this article; I’ll explain you the details. Please stay with me.

If you love to speak in front of the camera as if anyone is watching you, and if you’re someone with low self-esteem like me, and you want to develop your self-confidence, then you’re on the right track. People nowadays look for something that can add spice to their life like vlogging. But first, you need to know the reasons why you're opening a YouTube channel in the first place. Have a me time and ask yourself what do you want to share with your target audiences.

Things that can be of great influence to someone who badly needed it (in a positive way of course.) People nowadays search answers to their questions on YouTube. It is the second largest search engine next to Google and because of the YouTubers who give fuel to it, people around the globe watch it on a daily basis, I’m sure of it.

And now that you’ve already know what you want to share outside the world, you just need your vlogging equipment's.

1. [Videos Are Impactful](#part2-1)
2. [People Access Video Everywhere](#part2-2)
3. [You Don’t Need a Fortune to Produce Videos](#part2-3)

* [Preparations for a Vlog](#part3)

## Part 1\. Things That You Need when You Want to Start Vlogging

A smart phone and a tripod will do. You don’t need to have all those professional vlogging equipment's if you’re a new YouTuber. Each and every smart phone now can record a high-definition resolution. I started with my Samsung S6 and a pile of books as my tripod. Silly me! But you need to be resourceful. As the time went by, I bought a tripod from JOOM (an online store just like Ali Express). Very cheap and it last long. You also need a video editor for post editing. You don’t want to upload a raw video on YouTube without anything in it. It will be dull and boring.

## Part 2\. Reasons Why You Need a Video Editor?

### 1\. Videos Are Impactful

While pictures can tell a thousand words, video tells a thousand more. On your videos, your audiences can see your feelings about a particular topic, and with the correct techniques and editing secrets, you can effectively tell someone or many people a message you want to get across. Whether it is a message on how to make a do-it-yourself video or what is the best video editor for beginners?

### 2\. People Access Video Everywhere

You are probably one who does too. In this modern era of technology, you see people watching videos not only on television or the computer but on their laptops, tablets and smart phones as well. So, if you want something across, putting out your message or promotion through a video to these people makes sense. And it does not have to be that hard. You might say people only want to watch good looking videos. Well, yes, but using [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), a video editing software can let your video look more professional.

### 3\. You Don’t Need a Fortune to Produce Videos

That's right. If you have a video editor installed on your phone, you’re ready to go. I started to edit my first ever video using [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) go. It’s very handy and easy to use for a beginner like me before. And it has lot of features that you can put in your video, like cool titles, transitions and even stickers. If you want to produce your video using your computer or a laptop, you can definitely use Wondershare Filmora. You probably will not be able to edit and produce “Hollywood” videos but with a decent computer or laptop and correct editing techniques, you can make pretty professional looking videos. I always recommend using Wondershare Filmora even if you’re a beginner. If you learn how to use Wondershare Filmora well, you can make videos compared to everyone else. I guarantee you that.

## Part 3\. Preparations for a Vlog

I take down notes when preparing a video, I used to write the things that I need to say. Things that I mostly want to highlight when expressing my thoughts to everyone who will watch it.

![do it yourself video prepare](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/do-it-yourself-video-prepare.jpg)

I put myself a little make up on when producing a video, it makes me feel more confident to speak in front of my virtual audiences because I know that I looked presentable in any way.

Now we need to set our do-it-yourself like studio (it can be your room; it can be in the living room or anywhere that you can see that has a good background) or you can use a green backdrop and just make wonders in the post editing.

![how to make a do it yourself video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/how-to-make-a-do-it-yourself-video.jpg)

During these days, I’m filming using my Canon GX7 Mark II and it’s a result of my first ever YouTube salary. When you’re into vlogging, at some point you need to upgrade your vlogging equipment's. I know it will take time, but you can do it.

After you finished a vlog/video, you need to edit it and that’s the most exciting part for me, at least. Put your teaser, your intro, the body of the video itself and don’t forget the outro.

![do it yourself video editing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/do-it-yourself-video-editing.jpg)

## Conclusions

If you want to open up a YouTube Channel, then do it now. Maybe you’ll feel down because people around you will not support you from the beginning and that’s the cruel part of being a YouTuber. As the saying goes by, “birds of the same feather, flock together”; people with the same passion as you can understand all your endeavors. Don’t always think of the money that you will receive afterwards because that brings pressure and you’ll push yourself to the limit until you’ll feel and say “enough is enough”. Just do your own thing and the rest will follow. And if you think that you have something to offer to someone out there virtually, then don’t think twice. We only live once, make the most out of it.

And if you’re looking for the best video editor for Personal Computers this year 2022, choose [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and you’ll be thrilled. Trust me, I’ve been there. Happy editing!
