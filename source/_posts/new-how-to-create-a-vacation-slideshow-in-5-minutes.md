Step 2: In the timeline, place the playhead at the beginning of the clip.

Step 3: With the playhead still at the beginning of the clip, drag the rotation handle in the preview window to rotate the video.

Step 4: Move the playhead to the end of the clip and drag the rotation handle again to rotate it further.
