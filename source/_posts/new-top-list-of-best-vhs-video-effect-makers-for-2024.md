02 [The Best 8 Free Collage Makers at a Glance](#Part 2)

## Part 1 What Are the Benefits of Using Collage Software?

We start this off with the short guide we promised for using a **photo collage app for PC** What are the benefits? Well, the main benefit is that you can get something fun and interest out of it, of course.

And, unlike with traditional collages — which are messy and require lots of prep-work and glue — you can go create pic collages with a **photo collage app for PC** relatively easily. All you have to do most of the time is to choose a layout that you like and then fill it with the photographs, videos, GIFs, etc. that you want. Most programs also give you the choice to add things like text (for making the collage more meaningful), stickers, frames, and so on, so that you can fully deck out your photo collages exactly how you want to.
