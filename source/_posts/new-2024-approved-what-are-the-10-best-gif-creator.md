GIFs have become a popular way to share short and engaging videos online. They are widely used on social media platforms and messaging apps, making it easy to share moments, reactions, and emotions with friends and family. But not all GIFs are created equal. Some GIFs can look choppy and low-quality, detracting from the viewing experience.

To improve the quality of your GIFs, you can convert your MP4 videos to 60 FPS (frames per second). This will give your GIFs a smooth, fluid motion that looks professional and visually appealing. In this article, we'll go over the steps you need to follow to convert your MP4 videos to 60 FPS GIFs and create high-quality GIFs that are perfect for sharing online.

![convert mp4 video to 60 fps gif](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/convert-mp4-video-60-fps-gif.JPG)

## Why Convert MP4 to 60-FPS GIF?

GIFs are a great way to share short, eye-catching videos online, but not all are made the same. GIFs with low frame rates tend to look choppy, and the motion could be smoother, making the video look unprofessional and detracting from the overall viewing experience. On the other hand, GIFs with higher frame rates look smoother, and the motion is more fluid, making the video more visually appealing.

Converting your MP4 videos to GIFs has several benefits:

* **Smoother Motion:** By converting MP4s to GIFs, you increase the frame rate of your GIFs, giving them a smoother and more fluid motion.
* **Increased Detail:** Higher frame rates allow for more detail and clarity in fast-moving scenes, making the video more engaging and easier to watch.
* **Reduced Ghosting:** A higher frame rate reduces the "ghosting" effect in low-frame rate GIFs, making the video clearer and reducing distractions.
* **High-Quality Videos:** Converting MP4s to GIFs eliminates the ghosting effect and creates high-quality GIFs that are perfect for sharing online.
* **Increased Engagement:** High-quality GIFs will engage and entertain your audience, making them more likely to share and interact with your content.

Converting MP4s to GIFs is a great way to improve the overall quality of your GIFs and create visually appealing videos that are perfect for sharing online. Whether you're sharing a reaction, a moment, or an emotion, a high-quality GIF will engage and entertain your audience.

### Can I Get a 60 FPS GIF?

While it's true that many people search for 60 FPS GIFs, it's important to understand that there is no such thing as a true 60 FPS GIF.

![60 fps gif](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/60-fps-gif.jpg)

GIFs are an image format designed to display simple animations. [GIF files store delay time between frames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF) which is defined as multiples of 1/100th of a second. Value 1 would give you 100 FPS; value 2 would already have half of 100 FPS, that is, 50 FPS; value 3 would give you 33.3 FPS GIF, etc. So there are 20 FPS GIFs, 33.3 FPS GIFs, 50 FPS GIFs, and 100 FPS GIFs.

In addition, many websites or programs (including Google Chrome) ignore value 1 (100 FPS GIFs) and default to a much slower animation speed when viewing GIF files. Therefore, 100 FPS GIFs are technically possible but are rarely used. Value 2 (50 FPS) is the most you can get.

If you want to create high-quality animations, consider using MP4s or alternative image formats better suited for high frame rates and detailed animations.

That being said, some websites may have a "60 FPS GIFs" category, but it's important to understand that most of the content in these categories is not 60 FPS. Instead, it's likely to be either an MP4 video or a GIF with a lower frame rate, like 50 FPS, labeled as "60 FPS" for marketing purposes.

## Is There Any 60 FPS GIF Maker?

Unfortunately, there is no such thing as a 60 FPS GIF maker. As mentioned before, there is no 60 FPS GIF, so it is impossible to create a 60 FPS GIF using traditional methods. However, many excellent video-to-GIF converters in the market allow you to set the GIF frame rate.

These video-to-GIF converters allow you to convert MP4 videos to GIFs with a higher frame rate, which can give your GIFs a smoother and more fluid motion. While these GIFs may not be 60 FPS, they can still provide a significant quality improvement compared to traditional GIFs.

## People Also Ask

Here are some of the most frequently asked questions about converting MP4 to GIF and other related topics:

#### Q1\. Can a GIF be 30 FPS?

It is impossible to get an exact 30 FPS GIF. Frame rate refers to the number of images (frames) displayed per second in a video or animation. That frame rate is stored as an integer (n) that defines n/100ths of a second. So you can specify a frame of 1/100 second (100 FPS), 2/100 second (50 FPS), 3/100 second (33.33 FPS), 4/100 second (25 FPS), etc. but not something like 3.3333.../100 second (30 FPS).

#### Q2\. How Do I Get the FPS of a GIF?

To determine the speed or frame rate of a GIF, you can use online tools that show the delay time between its frames in milliseconds. The frame rate of a GIF is calculated by counting how many delays fit in 1 second of animation. The delay time determines the playback speed and can be adjusted to increase or decrease the frame rate. These tools also allow you to preview the speed changes and compare the input and output GIFs.

#### Q3\. What FPS Should a GIF Be?

GIF files store delay time between frames in whole hundredths of a second. They typically run between 10 and 100 frames per second (FPS). The common frame rate for a GIF is 10 FPS, 20 FPS, 12.5 FPS, 25 FPS, and 50 FPS. With online tools, it's possible to determine and change the speed of a GIF.

#### Q4\. What Is the Max FPS for a GIF?

The maximum fps for a GIF is 100 FPS, but browsers or consumer screens do not support it. The browser-engine image decoders will automatically reduce the framerate to 10 fps, playing it ten times slower. If a GIF appears slow, the browser has reset the speed to 10 fps. Some software and devices may support higher frame rates.

## Conclusion

GIF is a popular format for short animations and videos. The frame rate of a GIF determines its playback speed, which is usually set at 10, 20, 12.5, 25, and 50 per second. However, the highest possible frame rate that can be represented in the GIF format is 100 FPS, but most browsers and consumer screens cannot display it accurately.

There are various tools available, both online and desktop-based, that can convert videos to GIFs and adjust their frame rate as desired. With these tools, you can create high-quality, personalized GIFs that fit your specific needs and preferences.

## How to Use Motion Tracking in Video Editing

Motion tracking makes it easier to follow the movement of objects and provide the sensed data to a program for additional processing. Motion tracking involves recording an object's movements that match a previously stored motion template. This has a wide range of uses, including in robotics, entertainment, sports, the military, and the entertainment industry. Additionally, it is utilized in the creation of video games and films. While motion tracking is frequently referred to as match movement in the film and video game industries, motion tracking is frequently referred to as motion capture in other contexts.

With that said, let's begin!

8. [PowerDirector](#part2-8)

* [Differences between camera tracking and motion tracking?](#part3)

## Part 1\. Learning to Understand Motion Tracking

We need to ask the really crucial question now that we have a fundamental understanding of what it is. What in the world am I going to do with this? In order to do that, let's quickly review some excellent applications for motion tracking. You could,

Utilize tracking information to stabilize motion  
Add text or solids as additional compositional elements  
Add 3D elements to 2D footage  
Use effects or color gradation methods  
Replace the screens on your computer, mobile device, or television

These are just a few examples of how motion tracking might be useful. You need to be able to track motion in compositions of any complexity.

## Part 2\. What software do you need?

There are numerous options for motion tracking applications. With advantages and downsides, we've compiled a list of the finest motion tracking programs. The following are the best video editors for motion tracking in our opinion:

### Filmora

Wondershare created [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to enable you to fully express your creativity. FilmoraPro is the best option if you want to make some high-level modifications to your video. In addition to the pre-sets offered, it allows you to tweak the effects for a more expertly edited appearance.

![filmorapro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/MotionTracking1.png)

You won't have to worry about getting lost because FilmoraPro features an amazingly simple UI. Simply click on the person or object you wish to track and choose Motion Track from the Effects menu.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

### Blender

Open-source and cost-free motion tracking software is called Blender. It's an excellent 3D creating tool. Modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing, video editing, 2D animation, and of course motion tracking is all supported.

![blender video editing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/blender-video-editing.jpg)

### Kdenlive

A motion tracker was recently added to Kdenlive, an open source and free video editing tool, under its Effects section. This program analyzes an object's tracking information and automatically generates a map of the object's motion. Following that, you can align a title, an image, an icon, and any other 2D elements to the moving object using this track. Motion Tracker's regularly updated algorithms are one of its key characteristics, which leads to a higher tracking success rate and faster tracking speed.

![kdenlive adjust slider](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kdenlive-adjust-slider.jpg)

### HitFilm Express

The free edition of HitFilm Express is a wonderful place to start if you're learning the fundamentals of 2D motion tracking. To get superior tracking results, it offers two motion tracking types: Single Point for tracking simply position and Double Points for tracking position, scale, or rotation of an object. You can either steady the video with the tracking data or change the point with a CG object.

![hitfilm express](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hitfilm-express.jpg)

Its optical flow tracking technique is outstanding. It successfully tracks a moving item that changes into multiple shapes or is veiled for a few frames by figuring out the brightness flow of the moving object. Beginners can therefore save a great deal of time and effort when designing settings to deal with complex frames.

### VEGAS Pro

In VEGAS Pro 18 and later, auto motion tracking is a freshly upgraded function. Despite its late birth, it included the Mocha masking and planar tracking technology, winner of an Academy Award. It enables you to accurately attach images and messages and even adjust for shifting perspective. You can hide faces, license information, and any private objects using this capability.

![vegas pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vegas-pro.jpg)

### Adobe Premiere Pro

Because of its superior editing capabilities, Premiere Pro seems to be a requirement for anyone learning video editing. Premiere Pro, however, has a limited number of presets and automatic tools in order to provide consumers the most control.

![adobe premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-premiere-pro.jpg)

When masking and blurring a face, motion tracking only works with the auto option. If not, you will need to enter and alter multiple keyframes to add text or resize the video, or you will need to install an extension to convert the mask's tracks to any transformed parts.

### PowerDirector

Due to its simplicity of use, PowerDirector is unquestionably among the greatest motion tracking programs currently available. It accomplishes complex effects without having an advanced learning curve, in contrast to other video editing tools. As demonstrated in the introductory video up top, a simple interface may be used to easily track and manage one or more motion-tracked items.

![powerdirector for mac](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/powerdirector-for-mac-5.jpg)

With this program, creating a simple motion track may be done in only three easy steps. This editor is for you if you want to finish the job swiftly and painlessly and are new to intermediate video editing.

## Part 3\. Differences between camera tracking and motion tracking?

Making the audience forget that there is a camera in the room is one of the primary goals of filmmaking. To engage the audience, tracking shots like camera tracking and motion tracking are helpful. Tracking shots provide filmmakers the chance to immerse their audience more deeply in the storyline of their characters. I discovered that there is some ambiguity around how motion tracking and camera tracking differ from one another. I'll explain where the confusion might have originated and give you examples of how to use both strategies.

What distinguishes motion tracking from camera tracking? Their differences are due to how they view the course of action. From a camera's perspective, motion tracking monitors an object's movement. The scenario is more immersive thanks to camera tracking, which detects the movement of the camera and presents it as though you are in a virtual or augmented reality environment.

We'll examine tracking's development in the movie and its significance to the business. What it is and how it affects the cinematography industry. Along with the many software used for both motion tracking and camera tracking, we'll also look at some of the popular applications for both.

**Motion tracking**

Motion tracking is similar to a car pursuit on the highway in an action movie. Let's use a SimCity environment as another illustration: your Sim's movement is monitored against the steady scene of your home. The frame is set on your Sim, regardless of what your Sim does.

**Camera tracking**

When the camera must move and the object being "tracked" must remain stationary, camera tracking might be utilized instead of motion tracking. Information from a recorded live shot taken with a live camera is used for camera tracking. Then, using this data, a parallel virtual camera is projected in a three-dimensional composition frame. fresh 3D pieces are added while scenes are recreated.

On the Internet of Vehicles, motion tracking will be crucial. IoV will project the motion of your vehicle along the 2D path. Then, utilizing the information about your surroundings, you are informed of any potential roadblocks.

The same basic idea underlies motion tracking and stabilization. Both follow a moving target. When stabilizing, you choose the location where you wish to remain concentrated and centered despite movement. You track the object you wish to concentrate on while moving when you use motion tracking.

Sports videos frequently use basketball and football and use motion tracking. wherein the player is surrounded by a circle as he circles the court or the field for basketball.

## Conclusion

In video editing, techniques like motion tracking and camera tracking are frequently employed. Even though they are frequently compared, both employ various vantage angles to depict motion. By following the moving object's movement throughout the frame, motion tracking maintains the moving object in focus. A post-production technique called camera tracking uses data from a pre-shot movie to project a parallel virtual camera that displays a 3D perspective. If motion tracking and camera tracking have anything in common, it's the way they draw the viewer into the tale and make them feel like a part of it. This gives your audience a sense of immersion in the story and enables your movie to linger in their minds emotionally and visually long after the credits have rolled.

### HitFilm Express

The free edition of HitFilm Express is a wonderful place to start if you're learning the fundamentals of 2D motion tracking. To get superior tracking results, it offers two motion tracking types: Single Point for tracking simply position and Double Points for tracking position, scale, or rotation of an object. You can either steady the video with the tracking data or change the point with a CG object.

Its optical flow tracking technique is outstanding. It successfully tracks a moving item that changes into multiple shapes or is veiled for a few frames by figuring out the brightness flow of the moving object. Beginners can therefore save a great deal of time and effort when designing settings to deal with complex frames.

### VEGAS Pro

In VEGAS Pro 18 and later, auto motion tracking is a freshly upgraded function. Despite its late birth, it included the Mocha masking and planar tracking technology, winner of an Academy Award. It enables you to accurately attach images and messages and even adjust for shifting perspective. You can hide faces, license information, and any private objects using this capability.

When masking and blurring a face, motion tracking only works with the auto option. If not, you will need to enter and alter multiple keyframes to add text or resize the video, or you will need to install an extension to convert the mask's tracks to any transformed parts.

### PowerDirector

Due to its simplicity of use, PowerDirector is unquestionably among the greatest motion tracking programs currently available. It accomplishes complex effects without having an advanced learning curve, in contrast to other video editing tools. As demonstrated in the introductory video up top, a simple interface may be used to easily track and manage one or more motion-tracked items.

With this program, creating a simple motion track may be done in only three easy steps. This editor is for you if you want to finish the job swiftly and painlessly and are new to intermediate video editing.

## Part 3\. Differences between camera tracking and motion tracking?

Making the audience forget that there is a camera in the room is one of the primary goals of filmmaking. To engage the audience, tracking shots like camera tracking and motion tracking are helpful. Tracking shots provide filmmakers the chance to immerse their audience more deeply in the storyline of their characters. I discovered that there is some ambiguity around how motion tracking and camera tracking differ from one another. I'll explain where the confusion might have originated and give you examples of how to use both strategies.

What distinguishes motion tracking from camera tracking? Their differences are due to how they view the course of action. From a camera's perspective, motion tracking monitors an object's movement. The scenario is more immersive thanks to camera tracking, which detects the movement of the camera and presents it as though you are in a virtual or augmented reality environment.

We'll examine tracking's development in the movie and its significance to the business. What it is and how it affects the cinematography industry. Along with the many software used for both motion tracking and camera tracking, we'll also look at some of the popular applications for both.

**Motion tracking**

Motion tracking is similar to a car pursuit on the highway in an action movie. Let's use a SimCity environment as another illustration: your Sim's movement is monitored against the steady scene of your home. The frame is set on your Sim, regardless of what your Sim does.

**Camera tracking**

When the camera must move and the object being "tracked" must remain stationary, camera tracking might be utilized instead of motion tracking. Information from a recorded live shot taken with a live camera is used for camera tracking. Then, using this data, a parallel virtual camera is projected in a three-dimensional composition frame. fresh 3D pieces are added while scenes are recreated.

On the Internet of Vehicles, motion tracking will be crucial. IoV will project the motion of your vehicle along the 2D path. Then, utilizing the information about your surroundings, you are informed of any potential roadblocks.

The same basic idea underlies motion tracking and stabilization. Both follow a moving target. When stabilizing, you choose the location where you wish to remain concentrated and centered despite movement. You track the object you wish to concentrate on while moving when you use motion tracking.

Sports videos frequently use basketball and football and use motion tracking. wherein the player is surrounded by a circle as he circles the court or the field for basketball.

## Conclusion

In video editing, techniques like motion tracking and camera tracking are frequently employed. Even though they are frequently compared, both employ various vantage angles to depict motion. By following the moving object's movement throughout the frame, motion tracking maintains the moving object in focus. A post-production technique called camera tracking uses data from a pre-shot movie to project a parallel virtual camera that displays a 3D perspective. If motion tracking and camera tracking have anything in common, it's the way they draw the viewer into the tale and make them feel like a part of it. This gives your audience a sense of immersion in the story and enables your movie to linger in their minds emotionally and visually long after the credits have rolled.
