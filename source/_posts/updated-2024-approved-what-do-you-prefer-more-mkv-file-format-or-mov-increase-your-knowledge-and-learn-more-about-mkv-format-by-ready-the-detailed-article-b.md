## Part 5\. Which One Is Better? MKV or MOV?

MKV file format is not as commonly used as MOV because of its poor compatibility when it comes to mobile devices. If we talk about the file size, MKV tends to have a larger file size as compared to other used formats. MOV is a container file format that can store multiple media files of different tracks. Whereas MKV is an envelope format, even supporting to store complete movies with subtitles.

MKV format was developed by Matroska, whereas Apple developed the MOV file format. MKV format is good for storing HD videos, and MOV format is great for saving movies.

### Last Words

MKV format is a container format that can store different files with different encodings. The article above has discussed the file format in detail. We talked about how you can use the format, play MKV video format, and also how to edit MKV videos. We will conclude the article by suggesting a great video editor, Wondershare Filmora.
