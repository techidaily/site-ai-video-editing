## Part 2: Alternative Way to Loop a Video

If you're using a [video editing software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) like Adobe Premiere or Final Cut Pro, it is likely that you have seen the generic technique of looping a video is by splitting it in two and pasting it together again. What if you need to put on repeat just one individual cut? This is where [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) steps in! It is a handy tool for trimming and adding clips into your recordings.

The Filmora software can be used to quickly create continual sequences of any duration, irrespective of how long the footage is. It makes possible to synchronize sound and video clips, splice them into one another, and even add titles and motion graphics for a special effect. If you utilize Filmora, you do not need to be an expert in video editing to make professional-looking results. Let us explore why Filmora is necessary for video editing.

Filmora is a video editing software that allows you to make professional-looking videos from your footage. It has a loop feature that lets you create seamless loops where each clip in the sequence plays over and over until you stop it. This can be useful for creating music videos, for example, or for creating small clips that loop seamlessly through the whole video.

The loop feature in Filmora software is a great way to put your video editing skills to the test. It allows you to edit a clip of any length and then play it back over and over again, which can be useful when you're looking for an ideal looping point or want to see how long a clip is before going back to find out why it didn't work.
