## Dubbing Videos With Voiceovers | Wondershare Filmora Tutorial

Voiceovers have been a great utility in the digital ecosystem for a while. From movies to videos, the use of voiceovers has provided content creators with new dynamics. While it has enhanced the quality of video creation, there are other technicalities that have arisen against it. In this article, we will be discussing the details involving voiceovers and recordings.

Also, it includes a discussion of tools that can be used to ensure professional voice recordings. Go through the provided details to know how to utilize voiceovers to perfection.

## Part 1: What is The Difference Between Voice Recording and Voiceover?

Do you know **voiceover** and voice recording are two different terms? They are often used correspondingly but have different meanings. Here are a few differences between the two in the section below:

**Voice Recording**

It is a process in which you can capture audio in your device using a microphone. Voice recordings can be any type of audio content, such as conversations, interviews, and much more. There are various settings for voice recording as well. It starts from studio recordings, outside and even home set-up recordings.

**Voiceover**

On the other hand, voiceover specifically refers to a recorded narration or video commentary. This includes documentaries, advertisements, films, television shows, and more. It provides information, explains visuals, or narrates a story to your audience. Mostly voiceover is scripted and well synchronized to convey the message to its audience successfully.

**Summary**

Wrapping up, the main difference between these two terms is the intent of audio content. In general, voice recording allows you to capture audio. In contrast, voiceover refers explicitly to the recording of some specific narrations. Ultimately, we can say that voiceover is a part of voice recording that should be synchronized with the visual media to fulfill its purpose.

**●** There are a lot of transitions and filters to make the slideshow look amazing.

**●** There are various text templates to help you annotate more effectively.

Let your imagination run wild with editing tools that are both powerful and easy to use.

**Step 1**: Uploading Images and Videos to Filmora

Once the video editor has loaded, go to the Media tab's Import menu and select Import a Media Folder. Navigate to the folder containing the materials for your slideshow, select it with a click, then hit OK to import it into your project.

 **Step 2**: Position the Media Files on the Timeline

 Simply select a file to be added to the timeline and drag and drop it to the preferred location. Repeat this method for all of the images you'd like to include in your slideshow, then organise them in the same order as they'll appear in the presentation.

**Step 3**: Avoid Hard Cuts Between Slides by Using Transitions

A hard cut between two photographs can break the flow of your slideshow, but you can simply correct this by transitioning gently from one slide to the next.

If you double-click a transition after it's been added to the timeline, you'll be sent to the Transition Setting Window, where you can define the default duration for all transitions you add to a slideshow and choose your preferred transition mode.

**Step 4**: Enhance the colours in your slideshow with filters and overlays.

The Effects tab, which is next to the Transitions tab, contains a variety of visual effects that desaturate or brighten the colours in your images. Filmora's visual effects are divided into filter and overlay categories, each with its own subcategories such as Lomography, Sepia Tone, and Light Leaks.

**Step 5**: Incorporating Motion Graphics Elements into Slides

Hundreds of motion graphics templates are available in the Elements tab, which you can rapidly add to the timeline.

**Step 6**: Creating Slideshow Soundtracks and Recording Voiceovers

Select the Record Voiceover tool from the Record drop-down menu on the Media tab. When the Record Audio window appears on the screen, select the microphone you'll use to record the narration and press the Record button.

You may use Filmora's large library of music and sound effects for free. Simply navigate to the Audio tab and browse the subcategories of Electronic, Young & Bright, and Rock until you select the perfect song for the slideshow's soundtrack.

**Step 7**: Exporting Slideshows from Filmora

The final step in the process of creating a slideshow in Filmora is to export the project. Click on the **Export** button and wait for the **Export window** to appear on the screen. You can then select the output file format, set a preferred frame rate or resolution for your slideshow, or export

## Vintage Film Effect 1980S - How to Create

The 1980s is widely regarded as the golden era of music and film-making. If you play a video recorded in the 80s, you'll notice graininess, blurriness, and light exposure, giving the footage a dreamy vintage touch. So, in this short tutorial, we'll learn how to create a vintage 1980-style video with a retro effect that will leave your audience yearning for more.

## Preparation

![1980s vintage scene](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/1980s-vintage-scene.gif)

In this tutorial, you'll need at least two video clips. First, take clear footage of a hoop dancer playing to music and a disco ball footage that you'll add to the background. You can also add another footage to give your dancing video the perfect transition.

**How to create a retro-style music video shot in the 80s:**

##### Step1 Import the video clips on [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

![import the video clips on filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1980s-1.jpg)

First, run Wondershare Filmora and add the video with the hoop dancer on the first track. Then, move the disco ball footage right above the first video track.

##### Step2 Add an animation keyframe

![add an animation keyframe](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1980s-2.jpg)

With the two videos imported on Filmora, move the playhead to the point where the hoop dancer begins to dance and double-click the disco ball footage.

![move the playhead to the point](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1980s-3.jpg)

Now find the **Animation** tab, then click the **Customize** tab. Next, click **Add** to apply a keyframe to this point of the video. Don't stop there. Move the playhead to the right and add another keyframe to the footage before changing the opacity to 50%.

![find the animation tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1980s-4.jpg)

Meanwhile, we'll add a keyframe to the third video with a lady removing her sunglasses. To do that, add the footage to the third track, then double-click the video track. After that, place the playhead at the start of the video and apply an animation keyframe before changing the opacity to 0%. Move the playhead a few keyframes forward and add another animation keyframe.

##### Step3 Add retro filters and effects to the video

![add retro filters and effects to the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1980s-5.jpg)
