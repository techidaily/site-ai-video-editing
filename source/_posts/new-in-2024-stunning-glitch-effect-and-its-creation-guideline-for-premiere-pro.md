### Step 3: Changing the Distortion Control

Scroll down to find "Distortion" in the controls and expand it. The user is suggested to increase the color distortion to give an RGB effect to the footage. After that, you should reduce the distortion rate to 0 so that different artifacts can be eliminated effortlessly.

![customize distortion settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/glitch-effect-in-premiere-pro-11.jpg)

### Step 5: Animating the Glitch Effect

To animate the glitch, use the playhead on the top and drag it to the first position where the effect should start from. Hit the stopwatch located on the left of "Master Amplitude." It will create a keyframe. Alter the "Master Amplitude" to 0 as we do not want the clip to begin with a glitch.

Now, use your keyboard's right arrow to move the playhead three frames forward. After that, set the "Master Amplitude" to 100\. Again, move the playhead three frames forward and set the "Master Amplitude" to 0\. The animation is produced on the RGB color distortion.

![customize master amplitude settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/glitch-effect-in-premiere-pro-14.jpg)

### Step 7: Positioning the Video

Move back to the first keyframe and head to the top that shows "Scale" settings. Enhance the scale value so that the video position can be leveled. Click on the stopwatch next to "Position" to create a keyframe. Move the playhead one frame forward and adjust the position of the frame.
