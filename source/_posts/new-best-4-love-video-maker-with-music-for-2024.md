## Steps To Fade Audio In Premier Pro

Audio is a very big part of any video project and it can make or break the video project. This is why it is very important to not just choose a video editor that also offers audio editing, but one that is easy to use and offers a lot of editing options. This way, you can edit the audio in your project to suit your video's production and end up with a great professional final product.

One of the video editing tools that offer features that can accomplish all that is Adobe Premier Pro. In this article, we will look at how you can use Premier Pro to fade audio in or out.

## Steps to Fade Audio in Premier Pro

Premier Pro gives you two different options to fade audio in or out. Let's look at both options and then you can choose the one that suits you best;

### Fade Audio using Crossfade Audio Transition

Step1To begin, open Premier Pro on your computer and then open the audio that you want to edit.

Step2Once it is open, select the audio clip in the timeline and then click on “Sequence” at the top menu and select “Apply Audio Transition.”

![apply audio transition](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/apply-audio-transition.jpg)

You can also use the keyboard shortcut Shift + Command + D (macOS) or Shift+ Ctrl + D (PC). This will add the “Constant Power Cross Fade” effect at the beginning and the end of the clip.

Step3You can then just change the duration of the effect by simply dragging the end of the transition.

![add transitions premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/add-transitions-premiere.jpg)

### Fade Audio using Clip Keyframes

Step1Adobe Premier Pro has two volume keyframes; Track and Clip. Make the audio larger so you can see the volume line and then under the audio name, click on the volume keyframes option to make sure “Clip Keyframes” is enabled.

![clip keyframes premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/clip-keyframes-premiere.jpg)

Step2You can then press down on the Command Key (macOS) or the Control Key (PC) and drag the volume line down to add a fade-in or fade-out effect.

![drag volume line premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/drag-volume-line-premiere.jpg)

## Adobe Premiere Alternative Way to Fade Audio

If you are like most people and you find Adobe Premier Pro to be very difficult you use, we have a tool that is just as effective but also simplifies the process. This is the very simple to use [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

Just like Premier Pro, Filmora gives you two options to fade audio in and out. Let's look at both options;

**Adding Fade in and Out in Audio Pane**

Step1Download and install Wondershare Filmora onto your computer, open the program and then import the audio clip that you want to edit.

Step2Once the video has been added to the timeline, double-click on it to access the “Audio” editing panel.

Step3Here, you can very simply add the fade-in and fade-out effects by simply dragging the sliders to the desired duration or by manually entering the duration in seconds.

![add fade in or out effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/add-audio-fade-in-fade-out.jpg)

**Using the Audio Waveform**

You can also use the fade icons on the left and right edges of the audio waveform to quickly add a fade in and out.

To add a fade-in effect, drag the fade-in maker to the right. Then go to the end of the clip to drag the fade-out maker to the left to add a fade-out effect.

## Related FAQs about Audio Fade

### 1\. How Do I Fade to Black in Adobe Premiere Pro?

You can easily add the Fade to Black transition in Adobe Premiere Pro using the “Effects” tab. Just open the two clips in Premiere Pro and go to “Effects.” Type in “dip to black” in the search box and when you find the effect, drag it between the two clips in the timeline. The effect will appear on the right side of the project.

You also have several customization options that you can apply to the effect to get it just right. To see these options, go to Effect Controls and you should be able to change the alignment of the effect to “Center at Cut” so that the first video fades out to black before the second video appears.

### 2\. Premiere Pro Audio Fade Not Working?

Sometimes you can complete all the editing steps we have described above but you are unable to tell if the fade-in and fade-out effects are working because you can't play the audio in Premiere. This is a very common problem that can easily be fixed using the following troubleshooting steps;

Check the master volume on your computer to see if this is the problem

Then check the volume in Premiere to see if the audio meter is moving as you play the clip. It is the green bar usually in the lower right corner.

If your volume is fine but you still can't hear the audio, you may need to adjust several settings. Go to Edit > Preferences (on PC) or Preferences menu under the main Premiere Pro CC menu (macOS) and select “Audio Hardware” in the options that appear. You can then change the “Default Output” device to something else.

### 3\. How Do You do Audio Transitions in Premiere Pro

Adding audio transitions in Premiere Pro is very easy; just open the audio that you want to edit and then Right-click (PC) or Control- Click (macOS) on either the “Constant Gain” or “Constant Power” effect from the Effects panel. Then choose “Set Selected as Default Transition” from the options in the menu.

To add a duration for the audio transitions, go to Edit > Preferences > Timeline (PC) or Premiere Pro Menu > Preferences (macOS) and enter the duration value under “Audio Transition Default Duration.”

## 1\. What is a Lower Third?

![What is a Lower Third](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/how-to-add-a-lower-third-to-your-video-01.jpg)

What is a Lower Third

A lower third is text and/or a graphical element put on top of your video for the purpose of sharing information with your audience.

A lower third provides important information but is done without distracting from the actual video content.

Take a look at the shot below. The lower third is used to convey the speaker’s name and profession. This is a type of lower third often used in documentary films and newscasts.

## 2\. Why Add A Lower Third

So the next question a new filmmaker might ask is, “Why add a lower third?”

Funnily enough, despite its name, a lower third does not have to be in the lower third of the video but can be found in other areas of the screen.

In the shot below, the viewer automatically knows he is looking at the rooftops of Alfama, a neighborhood in Lisbon, without someone having to say it - no distractions from the video content.

![Why Add A Lower Third](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/how-to-add-a-lower-third-to-your-video-02.jpg)

Why Add A Lower Third

Lower thirds can also create movement. Many lower thirds come gliding onto the screen and add visual interest to a plain shot.

As simple as it may sound, seeing an overlay on a screen or a moving lower third adds professionalism to even the simplest videos. It gives the audience a sense of polish and high perceived value.

![Filmora Note](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Tips:** A lower third lasts approximately 3-6 seconds and is placed in the “title safe area” of your video. A quick explanation of the “title safe area” is that if the video is cropped to fit certain resolutions, your lower third will still appear without the fear of it being cropped out and losing pertinent information for the audience.

## 3\. 6 Quick Tips to Add A Lower Third

As simple as putting in a lower third sounds, here are 6 quick tips to ensure a lower third is effective and conveys the right message.

[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) comes equipped with pre-built video-based lower thirds in a ton of unique styles and colors. The cool thing is that you can customize the text easily and quickly, including changing the text color and font style – so you can match your style perfectly.

Tip #1

###### Use Readable Font

Part of communicating information without distraction is to make sure the font used in the lower third is readable. A lower third only graces the screen for 3-6 seconds, so you want it to be short and easy to read at a glance.

Tip #2

###### Don’t Make It Too Long

There is a limited amount of space to use. If you need to communicate more information, consider using a title slide instead which will give you more space to communicate your ideas. Less is more when it comes to lower thirds.

Tip #3

###### Use Branding

A lower third is another way to have people remember and recognize your brand. If you have your own branding colors and logo, use it in your lower third.

Tip #4

###### Use Templates

Pick one style and stick with it. Consistency in video editing helps communicate trust to your audience. It’s fun to use different styles sometimes, but it can be disjointed. With Filmora you can add elements like lower thirds and title to your favorites – so they are easy to use on your different video projects.

Tip #5

###### Keep It Simple

Remember the purpose of your lower third - to convey information without being distracting. Don't use a lot of text. Brevity is the key. Usually, lower thirds are used to detail a name, profession or a location. The most you want is 2 lines of text. Sometimes you may want to use just one line.

Tip #6

###### Emphasize With Your Lower Third

Often, I might use a lower third to emphasize a certain point, or to use different wording (than I used in my video) if I think it makes the point clearer. This can be helpful if you make a small mistake in your original video and it makes more sense than adding b-roll over the video.

## 4\. Step By Step To Explain Filmora

Using [Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) it is extremely easy to create a lower third for your video.
