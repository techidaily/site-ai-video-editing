03 [Compared with Filmora, What Are the Advantages of Freeze-frame After Effects?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 **How to Freeze-frame in After Effects**

This part explains how to **hold a frame in After Effects** and the working of the freeze-frame button. After Effects requires ample resources, and the layers need to be solo for the editing process to speed up. However, sometimes you may need to see other objects in the scene, and that is where the freeze-frame button will be helpful. This freeze-frame Effect temporarily freezes the selected layers while you continue editing the video and does not overload the After Effects editor. In addition, you can press the button again to remove the freeze. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use **Adobe After Effects to freeze-frame**:

**Step 1: Add Video Clip to Adobe After Effects**

First, make sure you have the AE composition open, and the video clip added. Next is to find the point where you want the video to "pause" or freeze by moving the time position indicator on the timeline.

**Step 2: Choose Layer for Freezing Frame**

Next, select the layer and then right-click on the layer to find Time in the menu that appears, and under Time find Freeze-frame and click it. Once done, the entire layer will get stuck on that frame.

**Step 3: Add Multiple Layers for Effects**

Start the same way before and repeat it several times by splitting the layer, which means that After Effects will take the layer at the time position indicator and cut it into two layers. To achieve this, use the keyboard shortcut Command+Shift+D if you are using a Mac or Control+Shift+D if you are using a Windows operating system.

**Step 4: Zoom in**

Next, hit the plus (+) sign a few times to zoom into the timeline, move forward one frame, select the new layer, the one on top, and split the layer again using the keyboard shortcut, and now have three layers.

## Part 1 **How to Freeze-frame in After Effects**

This part explains how to **hold a frame in After Effects** and the working of the freeze-frame button. After Effects requires ample resources, and the layers need to be solo for the editing process to speed up. However, sometimes you may need to see other objects in the scene, and that is where the freeze-frame button will be helpful. This freeze-frame Effect temporarily freezes the selected layers while you continue editing the video and does not overload the After Effects editor. In addition, you can press the button again to remove the freeze. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use **Adobe After Effects to freeze-frame**:

**Step 1: Add Video Clip to Adobe After Effects**

First, make sure you have the AE composition open, and the video clip added. Next is to find the point where you want the video to "pause" or freeze by moving the time position indicator on the timeline.

**Step 2: Choose Layer for Freezing Frame**

Next, select the layer and then right-click on the layer to find Time in the menu that appears, and under Time find Freeze-frame and click it. Once done, the entire layer will get stuck on that frame.

**Step 3: Add Multiple Layers for Effects**

Start the same way before and repeat it several times by splitting the layer, which means that After Effects will take the layer at the time position indicator and cut it into two layers. To achieve this, use the keyboard shortcut Command+Shift+D if you are using a Mac or Control+Shift+D if you are using a Windows operating system.

**Step 4: Zoom in**

Next, hit the plus (+) sign a few times to zoom into the timeline, move forward one frame, select the new layer, the one on top, and split the layer again using the keyboard shortcut, and now have three layers.

But that's not all; the software also allows users to visualize their music online and even create a website. Users must create an account to utilize the app because it is online-based. Once you've created an account, you'll have access to Renderforest's massive visualization templates, which you can customize with the song title, artist name, and background photo or video. Then you pick your favorite visualization style and color. Then you finish up by uploading the song you want to use in your video. Click the "Preview" icon to have Renderforest email the music visualization video to you when you're done. **Features**:

* Each template is tagged with a rating and exported to make it easier for you to compare and choose.
* You can use free stock photographs as a background or submit your photos. It is also possible to add text.
* You can share your music visualizer on YouTube, Facebook, and other social media platforms.

**Price**: $9.99/month, but a free version is also available. **Cons**:

* It is necessary to register and log in. The output will be limited to 2 minutes in 360p with a watermark if you merely wish to utilize this online music visualizer for free.
* Error - In addition to the slow processing and unexpected crashes, there is no OK or Back button after applying a filter during image editing.
* **ProjectM Music Visualizer**

![audio-visualizers-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/audio-visualizers-10.jpg)

**Supported system**: Android and iOS **Introduction**: ProjectM Music Visualizer is compatible with Android and iOS devices, demonstrating its versatility. While both the Android and iPhone versions can be used to create powerful audiovisuals for your music, the iOS version is preferred. It has a built-in media player that lets you listen to your recordings to get a sense of how the final product will seem. Both versions, however, feature hundreds of music visualization effects and multi-touch interactive visualizations. ProjectM also supports Chromecast, which is a remarkable feature. **Features**:

* It supports Chromecast and offers hundreds of graphic effects.
* Additional modes are available, such as the Immersive Option for KitKat smartphones.
* Search and browse visual effects
* Detects sound from microphones and music players automatically.

**Price**: Free to use but can be upgraded to a premium account for $2.99/month. **Cons**:

* It does not offer any presets in the library.

Nothing rivals the thrill of watching your songs play with gorgeous, real-time animated graphics, whether you're a professional music mixer or just a sound freak. The apps we've evaluated will assist you in choosing and adding graphics to your music.
