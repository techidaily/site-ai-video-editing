## Hyperlapse VS Timelapse Videos

You've probably heard the terms "hyperlapse" and "timelapse" before. Whether it was in a blog post, a how-to guide, or on your preferred social media platform. Each of us has seen at least one image of one of them. However, what makes a difference? You're about to learn in this article!

With that said, let's begin!

## Part 1\. What is a timelapse, and how is it used?

Timelapses are familiar to you, whether they were used in a series to demonstrate a swift change from night today or at the beginning of your favorite influencer's vlog. But exactly what is it? The term "timelapse" refers to a photography method in which static images are stitched together to produce a time-warping video. When the video is played, the time seems to pass more quickly, creating the illusion that time is slipping away.

Put your camera in a fixed position, stop it from moving, panning, or tilting, then record for a long time to make your own timelapse. This period of time could last for five minutes, an hour, days, or even years. Once the film is gathered, all that's left to do is speed everything up.

The fact that time-lapses make for a pleasant visual effect is what makes them so popular in Vlogs and other media. This method enables you to describe the passage of time, the movement of individuals through space, etc. utilizes time-lapse.

## Part 2\. What is a hyperlapse?

On the other side, there are these things that we refer to as hyperlapses. In the subgenre of time-lapse photography known as cinematography, a hyperlapse is a filmmaking method used to generate motion shots by capturing movies rather than taking images. In order to create a hyperlapse, the camera does not remain stationary; rather, it follows the subject around and is typically held by the photographer.

The amount of time that elapses between pictures in a stop-motion video typically ranges from tenths of a second up to a few fractions of a second, although this can change significantly depending on what you want to show. However, after you have picked it, it must remain consistent in the same way that the timelapse does.

The attractive 3D look that hyperlapse produces is the primary draw for its utilization. The hyperlapse that is formed can produce a dreamy image, regardless of whether the camera is attached to a moving vehicle or is mounted on a tripod that is moving towards its target.

Additionally, you may use this approach to make stunning photographs with motion blur by employing long exposures. In most cases, the final image will be stabilized in post-production in order to eliminate some of the flaws that may have been captured in the original photo.

## Part 3\. What differentiates them from each other?

The movement of the camera is what differentiates these two approaches the most from one another. When capturing a time lapse, the camera is kept relatively still and in the same position throughout. In addition, when you use a hyperlapse, the camera is continuously moving, which creates a 3D appearance in the image.

You could be scratching your head right about now, wondering when you should employ one of the two methods. If your subject is moving, you should take a time-lapse photograph; if the camera is moving, you should take a hyperlapse photograph. This question has a relatively straightforward answer.

The act of recording video for a hyperlapse can cause your storage to be filled up really rapidly. Therefore, you may wish to swap between the two methods depending on the length of time that you want to shoot for. If you are going to be filming for a significant amount of time, you should consider using a timelapse.

It is simple to determine the timelapse interval if you already know these answers. Choose the video's final frame rate. It may be 24, 25, or 30 fps. You shouldn't select more quickly. Choose the option that best fits your audience and location. Additionally, a time-lapse calculator is available.

The shoot time should then be converted to seconds. For instance, two hours are equal to 2 x 60 x 60 seconds, or 7200 seconds. Determine how many frames are required for your chosen timelapse now. For instance, the final product should be 30 seconds of 25fps video. You'll need to capture 750 frames in total because 30 x 25 is 750.

Divide the time (7200s in this case) by the number of frames to obtain the interval (750). You can round up the result, which is 9.6, which is pretty near to 10 seconds. Therefore, in our case, your interval should be set to 10s.

## Part 4\. Motion control timelapse

Now that we understand how the timelapse images that are static are created, we are able to incorporate some movement into the shots that are static. Moving the camera around during a timelapse is much more difficult than it appears to be in the video. Every movement of the camera is slowed down when using slow motion, which means that you can make even a shaky handheld movie look good when using slow motion. The situation is completely reversed while viewing a timelapse.

Because every movement of the camera is sped up, shooting with the handheld mode is nearly impossible. If you want the camera to appear to be moving slowly in the final timelapse, you will need to move it very slowly while shooting in order to achieve this effect.

For this reason, we will need to make use of motion control devices in order to accomplish our goal. Therefore, we refer to these kinds of photos as motion control timelapses. The camera can be moved very slowly and accurately along one, two, or all three axes using motors that are controlled electronically. The three-axis systems, which include a slider as well as a pan-tilt head, are by far the most popular.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **Does AI manufacture voices?**

Yes, Artificial Intelligence (AI) can produce a wide range of varied voices that seem pretty natural. Today, several advanced tools employ genuine voice actors whose voices are collected and retained using artificial intelligence.

These voices have permission to say whatever you want them to. All you have to do is enter some text into the tool. The AI will read the text and provide a natural-sounding voice with clear audio.

### **What Does a Voice Overlay Imply?**

Voice overlay, or Voice-Over, is a form of a production technique that is often employed in films and animation material.

In tv news, radios, movies, and other mediums, it is a method in which a pre-recorded voice-over that is not part of the story is used. It's a method usually reserved for the entertainment industry, especially when it comes to giving animated figures a voice.

### **How Can You Improve the Quality of Your Voice When Recording?**

You can improve the sound of your voice by implementing one or more of the following methods:

* Use the proper microphone and position it near your mouth as feasible.
* Make use of a high-quality voice recorder.
* Record your audio in a sound-proofed environment.
* Drink plenty of water to keep your speech clear.

### **Is Lovo for free?**

Lovo Studio's AI-powered voice cloning technology will amaze you if you seek a free AI Voice Generator. Although Lovo is a premium voice generator, it still has a free version that is quite useful. The unpaid version, on the other hand, has some limits.

For example, the free version allows for three monthly downloads and three days of premium voice access and is restricted to personal use. Lovo's free version will suffice if you don't mind the limitations.

## **Pro-Tips:**

The market is flooded with AI-powered speech generation software. Many alternatives are available, so selecting the ideal voice generator might be difficult. Here are a few pieces of stuff to consider when deciding what software to look for:

* The Voice Generator should be simple to use and understand.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **Does AI manufacture voices?**

Yes, Artificial Intelligence (AI) can produce a wide range of varied voices that seem pretty natural. Today, several advanced tools employ genuine voice actors whose voices are collected and retained using artificial intelligence.

These voices have permission to say whatever you want them to. All you have to do is enter some text into the tool. The AI will read the text and provide a natural-sounding voice with clear audio.

### **What Does a Voice Overlay Imply?**

Voice overlay, or Voice-Over, is a form of a production technique that is often employed in films and animation material.

In tv news, radios, movies, and other mediums, it is a method in which a pre-recorded voice-over that is not part of the story is used. It's a method usually reserved for the entertainment industry, especially when it comes to giving animated figures a voice.

### **How Can You Improve the Quality of Your Voice When Recording?**

You can improve the sound of your voice by implementing one or more of the following methods:

* Use the proper microphone and position it near your mouth as feasible.
* Make use of a high-quality voice recorder.
* Record your audio in a sound-proofed environment.
* Drink plenty of water to keep your speech clear.

### **Is Lovo for free?**

Lovo Studio's AI-powered voice cloning technology will amaze you if you seek a free AI Voice Generator. Although Lovo is a premium voice generator, it still has a free version that is quite useful. The unpaid version, on the other hand, has some limits.

For example, the free version allows for three monthly downloads and three days of premium voice access and is restricted to personal use. Lovo's free version will suffice if you don't mind the limitations.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **Does AI manufacture voices?**

Yes, Artificial Intelligence (AI) can produce a wide range of varied voices that seem pretty natural. Today, several advanced tools employ genuine voice actors whose voices are collected and retained using artificial intelligence.

These voices have permission to say whatever you want them to. All you have to do is enter some text into the tool. The AI will read the text and provide a natural-sounding voice with clear audio.

### **What Does a Voice Overlay Imply?**

Voice overlay, or Voice-Over, is a form of a production technique that is often employed in films and animation material.

In tv news, radios, movies, and other mediums, it is a method in which a pre-recorded voice-over that is not part of the story is used. It's a method usually reserved for the entertainment industry, especially when it comes to giving animated figures a voice.

### **How Can You Improve the Quality of Your Voice When Recording?**

You can improve the sound of your voice by implementing one or more of the following methods:

* Use the proper microphone and position it near your mouth as feasible.
* Make use of a high-quality voice recorder.
* Record your audio in a sound-proofed environment.
* Drink plenty of water to keep your speech clear.

### **Is Lovo for free?**

Lovo Studio's AI-powered voice cloning technology will amaze you if you seek a free AI Voice Generator. Although Lovo is a premium voice generator, it still has a free version that is quite useful. The unpaid version, on the other hand, has some limits.

For example, the free version allows for three monthly downloads and three days of premium voice access and is restricted to personal use. Lovo's free version will suffice if you don't mind the limitations.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **Does AI manufacture voices?**

Yes, Artificial Intelligence (AI) can produce a wide range of varied voices that seem pretty natural. Today, several advanced tools employ genuine voice actors whose voices are collected and retained using artificial intelligence.

These voices have permission to say whatever you want them to. All you have to do is enter some text into the tool. The AI will read the text and provide a natural-sounding voice with clear audio.

### **What Does a Voice Overlay Imply?**

Voice overlay, or Voice-Over, is a form of a production technique that is often employed in films and animation material.

In tv news, radios, movies, and other mediums, it is a method in which a pre-recorded voice-over that is not part of the story is used. It's a method usually reserved for the entertainment industry, especially when it comes to giving animated figures a voice.

### **How Can You Improve the Quality of Your Voice When Recording?**

You can improve the sound of your voice by implementing one or more of the following methods:

* Use the proper microphone and position it near your mouth as feasible.
* Make use of a high-quality voice recorder.
* Record your audio in a sound-proofed environment.
* Drink plenty of water to keep your speech clear.

### **Is Lovo for free?**

Lovo Studio's AI-powered voice cloning technology will amaze you if you seek a free AI Voice Generator. Although Lovo is a premium voice generator, it still has a free version that is quite useful. The unpaid version, on the other hand, has some limits.

For example, the free version allows for three monthly downloads and three days of premium voice access and is restricted to personal use. Lovo's free version will suffice if you don't mind the limitations.

## Part 2: How to Edit Time-lapse Video on a Computer

Time-lapse video is a type of video that allows you to see a huge amount of change in a very short time. You can see it on all social media websites such as YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram. It can be used to make all kinds of videos, from simple scenes of nature to complex events. The first time-lapse video was made in France in 1872 by Léon Bouly.

There are a lot of steps to make a time-lapse video on a computer.

Step1 You need to download the free software that comes with the camera. You can find it on the manufacturer's website or through a search engine.

Step2 You'll want to plug in your phone's charging cable and plug it in so that it can stay charged while filming.

Step3 You'll need to find somewhere quiet where you can set up your camera and tripod. If possible, try to do this outside so that there's no worry about getting dust or dirt on your lens.

Step4 Set up your phone so that it will record once every hour for an hour straight. This will give you enough time for each frame of video before switching over to the next one after an hour has passed.

Step5 Start recording!

**Why we should make a time-lapse video on a computer?**

Time lapses are also useful for showing how something changes over time. For example, if you want to show how an environment changes from day to night, or how a plant grows from seedlings into mature plants after being watered and nourished by sunlight, these videos would be perfect for demonstrating this change in real-time.

You can also create time-lapse videos that show the growth of plants or flowers over time. You could use this method to demonstrate how plants grow from seedlings into fully grown trees or bushes. You could even try creating a time-lapse video showing the growth of a weed from the seedling stage into full bloom with its seeds spread out across the ground below it!

You can make your videos more fun and engaging. By recording multiple angles at the same time, you can capture all the exciting moments, like when something unexpected happens. Or when something amazing turns out to be a total disaster in real life. You can easily share with friends and family members who might not be able to come to see you in person.
