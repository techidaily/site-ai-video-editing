### 03Why do you need a Storyboard?

A Storyboard is a process of pre- production. It lets you know how your story is going to flow. You will get to know the mistakes in the early stages if you make a storyboard and this will help you to save your money and time. Here are some essentials because of which you need to have a storyboard.

**●** **Is this concept is going to work? -** A storyboard lets you know whether the concept is going to work out or not. A storyboard helps the client to confirm whether the concept will work or not.

**●** **Arranging Shots -** A Storyboard lets you to tell you story in a limited time frame in the best way. In commercials we don’t have much time. It is like you have 60 seconds, 30 seconds, or sometimes it is just 15 seconds. So, it is the best way to make every shot count.

**●** **Saving Money -** Before making the final product, it is better to have an accepted storyboard from your client. In complex animations, it takes a lot of time and money so it is better to have an approved storyboard. This will let you know how the final product would look like. This will let the client know what is on your mind.

**●** **Recognizing the mistakes -** On a storyboarding phase, you can recognize the mistakes related to the media, narration or any other details. This will save your energy, time and money and then you will be ready for the production phase.

### 04How to Label Storyboards?

If you are using numerous storyboards for the same shot, keeping the shots labeled is important so that everything is arranged in an order and your team can stay focused and organized. If you will use any software it will name the panel numbers automatically. In case you are not using any software and your client wants to delete, add or move a panel then you can’t name that panel.

For example: Panel\_7\_New\_New\_New. It will be very difficult to figure out and also time consuming. The correct way to do is this: Project name\_ Script#\_Scene\_Frame\_01.JPG

### 05Do Storyboards have Dialogues?

Storyboards have dialogues and you can include dialogues which will flow underneath the panels for each and every scene. If you want, you can save it on your drawing. You can name the angles and just specify them "OTS 1" and "OTS 2" with the corresponding dialogues.

If you are using numerous storyboards for the same shot, keeping the shots labeled is important so that everything is arranged in an order and your team can stay focused and organized. If you will use any software it will name the panel numbers automatically. In case you are not using any software and your client wants to delete, add or move a panel then you can’t name that panel.

For example: Panel\_7\_New\_New\_New. It will be very difficult to figure out and also time consuming. The correct way to do is this: Project name\_ Script#\_Scene\_Frame\_01.JPG

### 05Do Storyboards have Dialogues?

Storyboards have dialogues and you can include dialogues which will flow underneath the panels for each and every scene. If you want, you can save it on your drawing. You can name the angles and just specify them "OTS 1" and "OTS 2" with the corresponding dialogues.
