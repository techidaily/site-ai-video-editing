You will get a new Photoshop tap for the editing of GIF files. Just freely close the original tab.

**Step 3: Begin The Editing Part**

Find the blue line called the Timeline at the bottom of the screen. This Timeline will help you to edit the GIF. To make your editing easy, you can zoom on the frames with the help of a slider located at the bottom of the screen.

For a better outcome, the frame-by-frame deletion of the GIF background is advisable. It might be a little time-consuming but it is the most appropriate and accurate approach. So, delete the background from each frame independently.

To move from one frame of the GIF to another, hold and move the blue arrow having a red line.

**Step 4: Delete The Transparent GIF Background**

Now, delete the background of each frame of your GIF. To delete the background of any particular frame, click on that frame. For this, you can either use a "Quick Selection Tool" or a "Polygonal Lasso Tool". You will get the final result that will be background free.
