## How To Use Slow Zoom Effect in Your Video?

A raw video without any effect will fall flat on its face when it comes to engagement and watch time. Nobody likes watching videos without effects as there is no entertainment value, and the video is not soothing and pleasing to the eyes. That is why effects in videos are extremely important especially when it is a video you are posting on social media to get everyone’s attention. You should definitely consider adding slow zoom effect in your video to make it stand out.

The slow zoom effect is one of the most common but widely loved video effects that work for any video. Human eyes love when there is slow motion effect of panning and zooming into the central or specific portion of a video. The slow zoom in effect is extremely popular among TikTok videos. We will illustrate how to apply slow zoom effect to your video on your smartphone as well as on your computer.

## Part 1\. How to create slow zoom-in effect in [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

You will need to combine slow motion and keyframe to achieve the desired slow zoom effect. Here are the steps on how to create slow zoom in effect for your videos.
