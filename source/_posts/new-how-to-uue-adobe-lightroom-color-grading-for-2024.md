## How to Uue Adobe Lightroom Color Grading

The main focus of color grading is changing the colors and tones in your photographs. Recent updates to Lightroom and Photoshop's color grading functionality have improved its use and increased its capabilities. Color grading is ideal for giving your photograph a bit extra interest and improving the lighting.

All forms of photography benefit from and depend on color grading. The color grading tools in Lightroom and Photoshop will be especially appreciated by landscape and portrait photographers. If you're wondering what happened to split toning, it was replaced by the Color Grading module, which is why split toning is now referred to as color grading.

## 1\. Getting to Color Grading

Select the photo you want to modify and go to the develop module in Lightroom to access the Color Grading tool. Then, move your cursor down to the Color Grading menu on the right side of the screen. To see three separate color wheels, choose this.

The same choices are available in Photoshop's Camera Raw Filter. Simply scroll down on the right side of the screen once you've opened a photo in the Camera Raw Filter until you see Color Grading. The process of color grading is identical in Photoshop and Lightroom. I'll be using Lightroom to demonstrate the example photographs for the purposes of this blog article.

## 2\. How to Use Color Grading

The first thing you'll notice is that there are actually three identical color wheels. Each color wheel, though, has a distinct purpose. Midtones are controlled by the top wheel, shadows, and highlights by the left and right wheels, respectively.

Before moving on to the color grading stage, it's crucial to notice that you should balance the temperature and tint of your image. Instead of balancing the colors to create the image, color grading is a technique for enhancing the colors in the image.

Avoid using the midtones color wheel when using the Color Grading tool for the first time. First, try modifying only the highlights and shadows wheel. Warm hues in the highlights and cold colors in the shadows appear great in the majority of photographs. However, when using these sliders to create some truly incredible photos, you may let your creativity run wild!

I've added some yellow (warmth) to the highlights and some blue (coolness) to the shadows in this particular example. As a result, the sunlight in my image appears to be very warm and inviting, and the shadows take on a colder, bluer appearance.

The color wheels are actually fairly easy to use. To select a color, merely click and drag it anywhere on the color wheel. The color will become stronger the further you are from the circle's center. Each circle has a hidden slider bar underneath it. This modifies the related color wheel's brightness value. In other words, you can brighten or darken the highlights by adjusting the bar underneath the highlights color wheel. The ability to quickly change the brightness levels in the highlights, shadows, or midtones is a convenient feature.

Blending and balancing are the other two parameters that you can modify. You can alter how well the color in the highlights, midtones, or shadows blend with one another with the blending slider. The colors will blend in more naturally by moving the blending slider higher.

The amount of the image that is judged to be in the highlights, shadows, or midtones can be changed with the balance slider. For instance, if I move the balance slider to the right, less of the highlights will show the adjustment. Only the highlights with the highest brightness will be affected by the change.

## 3\. HSL/Color Panel

Move to the HSL/Color Panel, which stands for Hue, Saturation, and Luminance, after your image is ready to use. It is located under Tone Curve in the Develop Panel. This adjustment panel, in contrast to the ones stated before, will let you change different colors in your image independently of one another. Hue, Saturation, and Luminance are the three modifications that each color will receive.

## 4\. Hue

Hue is measured in terms of the color wheel's degrees. It's possible to change the color's real shade in this panel. For instance, you can modify the turquoise or blue to a more greenish tone if your scenario is a beach (as in our example photo). It's advisable to begin making adjustments to your panel's Hue before moving on to the others.

## 5\. Saturation

The strength of the hue is known as saturation. (Remember that this HSL panel modification only affects the saturation of individual colors, not the saturation of the entire image.) In order to achieve a more subdued, muted appearance for this example, I reduced the Saturation on the aqua, blue, and green hues. To increase the intensity of your shot, you can do the exact reverse. Find the tweaks that suit your photo and the appearance you want to achieve best.

## 6\. Luminance

Each color's luminance measures how brightly it reflects light. Use this tool to brighten or darken specific areas of your image (it works especially well to provide contrast to black and white images). To make the water and sky behind the model darker in this example photograph, I decreased the Luminance setting on the aqua panel.

## 7\. Adjustment Brush

Further isolate a section of your image using the Adjustment Brush so that you can change the Hue and any other parameters you like. Your Adjustment Brush is the final brush icon on the top of your editing panel. Adjust your Hue and begin painting on your image where you wish to change the color to begin color grading.(At the bottom of the Adjustment Brush Panel, you can adjust the brush's size or feathering.)

This is perfect if you only want to edit one part of your shot. You can keep using the adjustments after you've painted your image to witness more changes as they happen in real time.

Here are a few tips to set you on the correct course because color grading might take some time and practice to master. Shooting in RAW will give you the most dynamic control over your colors, so be sure to do this. Try your best to start with a good photograph and to alter your default settings so that the canvas is even. Use color psychology to visually transmit the mood or feeling you wish to portray through color grading.

Utilize each panel to practice and experiment. There is no right or wrong method to color grade; it all depends on how you want your photographs to look stylistically. Press the Reset button in the right -hand corner of your panel to return to your original image.

## How to Concatenate Videos Using FFmpeg

Video editing is a crucial aspect of creating content for many people. Whether you're a YouTuber, a marketer, or just someone who wants to share videos with friends and family, being able to edit and manipulate your videos is key. One of the most basic video editing tasks is concatenating videos, which combines multiple files to create one cohesive video.

FFmpeg is a powerful tool that allows you to do just that, and in this guide, we'll walk you through the process of FFmpeg concatenate videos. Whether a beginner or an experienced video editor, this guide will provide you with all the information you need to seamlessly merge your videos. From installation to execution, we'll cover it all so you can streamline your video editing process.

![concat videos with ffmpeg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ffmpeg-concat-videos.JPG)

## Overview and Installation of FFmpeg

FFmpeg is free, open-source project that allows you to record, convert, and stream digital audio and video. It is a command-line tool widely used in video editing and transcoding. FFmpeg can be used to concatenate videos and other tasks, such as adding subtitles, changing video resolution, and more. It is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux, making it a versatile and accessible tool for anyone to use.

Here's how to install FFmpeg:

Step1 **Log in** to your Ubuntu server via SSH and **update** the package index.

_$ sudo apt update_

Step2 **Install** FFmpeg and all the required dependencies

_$ sudo apt install ffmpeg_

Step3 **Verify** the version of FFmpeg that you've installed.

_$ ffmpeg -version_

## Prerequisite

Before we merge videos using FFmpeg, we must understand the various methods available to us. FFmpeg offers three ways to concatenate videos: a demuxer, a filter, or a protocol. However, each method has its own set of considerations, and the best method for you will depend on the properties of the videos you're working with.

It's crucial to ensure that all encoding-related properties align with your chosen method. This includes the timebase, height and width, codecs, and pixel format. Some methods require the videos you're merging to have the same encoding, while others allow for different encodings. It's essential to keep this in mind to ensure that the final video is seamless without any breaks. Remember that these prerequisites will help you have a smooth process.

### Concatenate Videos With Same Codecs Using FFmpeg

If the videos you want to concatenate have the same codec, you can use the FFmpeg "concat" demuxer or protocol to join them together. This simple and efficient method doesn't require re-encoding the videos, saving time and preserving the original quality. This section will review the steps to concatenate videos using the "concat" demuxer and "concat" protocols in FFmpeg.

**Merge Videos With the "Concat" Demuxer**

The concat demuxer in FFmpeg allows you to join together multiple video files with the same codecs by reading a list of file paths from a text file and demuxing them in sequence. Each video starts where the previous one finishes without needing to re-encode the videos. Here's how to do it:

Step1 **Create** a **.txt file and list** the paths of the video files you want to merge.

_Join\_video.txt_

_file /Users/Video/input1.mp4_

_file /Users/Video/input2.mp4_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You can add more than two video files.

Step2 **Run** the FFmpeg command:

_ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i join\_video.txt -c copy output\_demuxer.mp4_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note: _\-safe 0_** is added to accept any file name.

**_\-c copy_** will copy all the streams.

As this method allows you to "stream copy" the files instead of re-encoding them, the concatenation is very fast. This can be a good option if you have videos with the same codecs and want to join them quickly without losing quality.

**Join Videos With the "Concat" Protocol**

The concat protocol in FFmpeg allows you to join together multiple video files in a specific format that supports file-level concatenation, such as MPEG-2 TS. However, it cannot be used for other video formats like MP4 and WEBM.

Here's how to use the "concat protocol:

Step1 **Run** the FFmpeg command:

_ffmpeg -i "concat:input1.ts|input2.ts" -c copy output\_protocol.ts_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** The concat protocol allows you to "stream copy" the files by adding the option **_\-c copy_**.

Step2 **Input** the file name of the video using this code:

_ffmpeg -i "concat:input1.mp4|input2.mp4" -c copy output\_protocol.mp4_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** If you try to use this method on video formats that are not supported, only the first input video will be saved in the output video. And the video ends after the first video.

Although this method is limited in terms of supported video formats, it's very easy to use if you merge videos in the supported formats. It's a single command in the terminal without needing a text file. Additionally, using the -c copy option makes it efficient as it doesn’t require re-encoding, saving time.

### Concatenate MP4 Video Files of Different Codecs & Resolutions Using FFmpeg

If the videos you want to concatenate have different codecs or resolutions, you can still use FFmpeg to join them together. However, this method requires re-encoding the videos, which can take longer and may result in a loss of quality. This section will cover the steps to concatenate videos with different codecs or resolutions using FFmpeg.

Here's how to do it:

Step1 **Provide** the names of the input files to FFmpeg.

_ffmpeg -i file1.mp4 -i file2.mp4 -i file3.mp4 \\_

Step2 **Use** the **filter\_complex** filtergraph parameter to instruct FFmpeg from where to take the audio and video.

_\-filter\_complex "\[0:v\] \[0:a\] \[1:v\] \[1:a\] \[2:v\] \[2:a\]_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note: \[0:v\]\[0:a\]** means FFmpeg needs to take the video and audio from the 0th video (file1.mp4).

Step3 Tell FFmpeg to concatenate three files (n=3).

_concat=n=3:v=1:a=1 \[vv\] \[aa\]" \\_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** The **v=1:a=1** implies one stream for the audio and one stream for the video.

Step4 **Map** these audio and video outputs to the final video container. This is done as follows:

_\-map "\[vv\]" -map "\[aa\]" mergedVideo.mp4_

It is important to note that this method requires re-encoding the videos, which can take more time and may result in a loss of quality. However, it offers the flexibility of filtering the videos before concatenating them. The filter\_complex method in FFmpeg allows you to concatenate videos of different codecs and resolutions. The final step is to map the audio and video outputs to the final video container. This can be done using the -map command.

### Concatenate Videos With Multiple Audio Streams Using FFmpeg

Concatenating videos with multiple audio streams can be more complex than concatenating videos with a single audio stream. This section will cover the steps to concatenate videos with multiple audio streams using FFmpeg. We'll be using the filter\_complex method in FFmpeg, which allows you to manipulate and concatenate multiple audio and video streams in a single command. This method is more advanced but allows you to join videos with different audio streams and create a final video with multiple audio tracks.

Step1 **Specify** the input files and opening.mkv, episode.mkv, and ending.mkv:

_$ ffmpeg -i opening.mkv -i episode.mkv -i ending.mkv -filter\_complex_

Step2 **Use** the **filter\_complex** parameter in FFmpeg to specify the input streams for the video and audio.

_\[0:0\] \[0:1\] \[0:2\] \[1:0\] \[1:1\] \[1:2\] \[2:0\] \[2:1\] \[2:2\]_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note: Single video stream** (\[0:0\], \[1:0\], \[2:0\])

**Dual audio streams** (\[0:1\]\[0:2\], \[1:1\]\[1:2\], \[2:1\]\[2:2\])

Step3 **Use** the **concat** filter to specify that you want to concatenate 3 files (n=3) with 1 video stream (v=1) and 2 audio streams (a=2). Specify the output streams as \[v\], \[a1\], \[a2\]:

_concat=n=3:v=1:a=2 \[v\] \[a1\] \[a2\]_

Step4 **Use** the **\-map** option to map the output streams to the final video container:

_\-map '\[v\]' -map '\[a1\]' -map '\[a2\]' output.mkv_

Step1 **Provide** the names of the input files to FFmpeg.

_ffmpeg -i file1.mp4 -i file2.mp4 -i file3.mp4 \\_

Step2 **Use** the **filter\_complex** filtergraph parameter to instruct FFmpeg from where to take the audio and video.

_\-filter\_complex "\[0:v\] \[0:a\] \[1:v\] \[1:a\] \[2:v\] \[2:a\]_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note: \[0:v\]\[0:a\]** means FFmpeg needs to take the video and audio from the 0th video (file1.mp4).

Step3 Tell FFmpeg to concatenate three files (n=3).

_concat=n=3:v=1:a=1 \[vv\] \[aa\]" \\_

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** The **v=1:a=1** implies one stream for the audio and one stream for the video.

Step4 **Map** these audio and video outputs to the final video container. This is done as follows:

_\-map "\[vv\]" -map "\[aa\]" mergedVideo.mp4_

It is important to note that this method requires re-encoding the videos, which can take more time and may result in a loss of quality.

## What If Quicktime Player Speed up With No Sound?

No sound may be heard when the video is played back if it was encoded in a format that QuickTime cannot understand. Verifying your QuickTime installation is the most obvious way to find out whether it has decoded all of the video files. Let’s investigate the issue to its root.

### Updating Your Quicktime to the Latest Version

The user must carefully study the QuickTime player. For some reason, your QuickTime behaviour is out of whack.

People often neglect to keep their QuickTime software up-to-date, which results in problems with video playback, such as no sound or stuttering, among many other things. To fix this issue, just download and install the most latest release of QuickTime player.

### Examine the System and Driver

Faulty speakers, audio issues in the system, and update failures will ultimately cause media playback difficulties.

To find the root cause, you should first check internally to see whether your speakers are working correctly. Speaking straight to Siri and hearing her reaction is the fastest and most straightforward option.

Another reason you may be hearing no sound on QuickTime is because of a recent system update. Apple, as we all know, often releases new operating systems, and you must keep track of the most current versions of updates in order to keep your system running effectively.

You just need to ensure that your machine is running the most recent version. As a result, your system will resume regular functioning, and QuickTime will be immediately fixed and restored.

### Inspect if the File is Corrupted or not

Checking the file to see whether it has been corrupted is a good idea regardless of whether QuickTime and your system are up and running. To make matters worse, the lack of sound in QuickTime will be the consequence of a corrupted video file.

Try opening the file in a different programme or player to see if the issue may be resolved. If this is the case, your source video file is either destroyed or corrupted. You may wish to consider regaining access to the file in this situation. The likelihood of your file being corrupted by malware or a virus is relatively high. Remember to be patient if this does happen to you.

It is necessary to use third-party repair programmes to successfully fix the file. Consequently, using third-party software to recover and restore the source file should be considered if you are in a situation where the source file is crucial and do not have a backup. As we'll see, there are a number of options available, including Filmora.

## How to Play Videos at 2X Speed with Sound in Quicktime?

Follow the below-mentioned steps to play video at 2x speed with sound in Quicktime:

* Launch QuickTime.
* Click on Edit, which is located on the toolbar on the top. A drop-down menu will appear.

### Unique and Distinct Features of Filmora

Software is not nearly as good if it does not have the appropriate set of functionalities, and most users will not bother to use it if it does not include these features. Listed here are the most eagerly anticipated features of Filmora's latest version:

#### Motion Tracking

The Motion Tracking module enables you to identify an object or point inside a video and then have the computer track that object or point to generate a moving path.

It allows you to capture the motion of a moving object in the frame and add text, subtitles, effects, and other components to the frame that follow the moving object's motion as it moves around the screen.

This team has always considered that Filmora's colour grading and correction tools were excellent, but their most recent addition to the 'Color Matching' program has garnered them even more praise.

Colour matching is crucial when trying to merge several video images obtained by two different cameras. In this semi-automated module, you may match video from multiple sources or footage acquired at different times of day with one another.

#### Keyframing Feature

Keyframing is an essential feature for users who wish to boost the appeal of their video by incorporating critical animation sequences throughout the film.

It enables you to create custom animations and have fine-grained control over the effects you apply to your projects via the use of keyframes.

Keyframing becomes critical when creating special effects, custom title cards at the beginning or middle of a film or conjuring precise paths for visuals or picture-in-picture movies to follow.

#### Audio Ducking

Audio ducking is a method used in video editing and production that allows the narrator's voice to be heard consistently and clearly over other sounds on the recording that are happening at the same time, such as background music, without being dominated.

No sound may be heard when the video is played back if it was encoded in a format that QuickTime cannot understand. Verifying your QuickTime installation is the most obvious way to find out whether it has decoded all of the video files. Let’s investigate the issue to its root.

### Updating Your Quicktime to the Latest Version

The user must carefully study the QuickTime player. For some reason, your QuickTime behaviour is out of whack.

People often neglect to keep their QuickTime software up-to-date, which results in problems with video playback, such as no sound or stuttering, among many other things. To fix this issue, just download and install the most latest release of QuickTime player.

### Examine the System and Driver

Faulty speakers, audio issues in the system, and update failures will ultimately cause media playback difficulties.

To find the root cause, you should first check internally to see whether your speakers are working correctly. Speaking straight to Siri and hearing her reaction is the fastest and most straightforward option.

Another reason you may be hearing no sound on QuickTime is because of a recent system update. Apple, as we all know, often releases new operating systems, and you must keep track of the most current versions of updates in order to keep your system running effectively.

You just need to ensure that your machine is running the most recent version. As a result, your system will resume regular functioning, and QuickTime will be immediately fixed and restored.

### Inspect if the File is Corrupted or not

Checking the file to see whether it has been corrupted is a good idea regardless of whether QuickTime and your system are up and running. To make matters worse, the lack of sound in QuickTime will be the consequence of a corrupted video file.

Try opening the file in a different programme or player to see if the issue may be resolved. If this is the case, your source video file is either destroyed or corrupted. You may wish to consider regaining access to the file in this situation. The likelihood of your file being corrupted by malware or a virus is relatively high. Remember to be patient if this does happen to you.

It is necessary to use third-party repair programmes to successfully fix the file. Consequently, using third-party software to recover and restore the source file should be considered if you are in a situation where the source file is crucial and do not have a backup. As we'll see, there are a number of options available, including Filmora.
