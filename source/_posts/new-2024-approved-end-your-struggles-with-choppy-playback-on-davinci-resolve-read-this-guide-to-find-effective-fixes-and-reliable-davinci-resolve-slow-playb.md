<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Solution 1: Lower Playback Resolution

In DaVinci Resolve, full timeline proxy resolution is set by default. To enjoy a smooth playback while editing, you should reduce the playback resolution. Open your project in DaVinci Resolve and press the "Playback" menu from the top. Then, select "Timeline Proxy Resolution" and pick one either "Half" or "Quarter" options. It will reduce the playback resolution and speed up the playback.

### Solution 2: Change Timeline Resolution

DaVinci Resolve can work on 4K high-resolution footage that might disrupt the playback. So, cutting down the resolution to speed up your playback is suggested. To do so, click the "Settings" icon from the bottom right side and enter the “Project Settings” window. Expand the “Time Resolution” menu and choose 1920x1080 HD if working on 4K or high resolutions. Now, apply the changes by hitting on “Save.”

Adjust the timeline resolution and right-click on the timeline in the Media Pool. Choose “Timeline” and then “Timeline Settings.” Lastly, check the “Use Project Settings” option and decide a resolution to click on "OK."

![change timeline resolution slow playback](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/fix-slow-playback-issues-in-davinci-resolve-2.jpg)

### Solution 3: Enable Render Cache

It’s another solution to fix the **DaVinci resolve slow playback**. Render cache is a file that stores the rendered frames and makes the rendering faster. Start by hitting the “Playback” option and choose “Render Cache.” Then, you’ll see 3 options: None, Smart, and User. You should select "Smart" and let DaVinci Resolve pick one clip to be cached.

### Solution 4: Disable the Live Save Feature

Every change you make gets saved with the Live Save option in DaVinci Resolve. If your remote drive is linked, this feature can drag the playback speed down. You can disable it for a **DaVinci resolve faster playback**.

Look for the “User Preference” menu and click on the top left side button of DaVinci Resolve. Go to the “Preferences” under the user tab. From the “Project Save and load,” check the “Disable Live Save” option. Now, you should remember to manually save your projects after editing.

![disable live save feature slow playback](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/fix-slow-playback-issues-in-davinci-resolve-4.jpg)

### Solution 5: Use Proxy Media Files

Another solution is to use proxy media during the project editing. Proxy files are small copy files transcoded from a larger, original video file. Get the proxy file to increase the playback and go to your "Media Pool" in DaVinci Resolve. Right-click on the intended file and choose "Generate Proxy Media" from the list.

![use proxy files slow playback](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/fix-slow-playback-issues-in-davinci-resolve-5.jpg)

### Solution 6: Disable Color Grades

If you are still failing to resolve the slow playback issue on Davinci Resolve, try this fix. Disable color grades and other effects in the first place. To do so, head to the DaVinci Resolve Edit Page. After getting there, press the "Bypass Color Grades and Fusion Effects” button from the top right side. This way, you can surely solve the **DaVinci Resolve slow-down playback** error.

## Part 2: What Makes a Slow-Motion Video Good?

After resolving the **DaVinci Resolve slow playback**, let's continue further editing. Create a slow-motion video to emphasize certain information in the video. It involves technical and creative elements for a good-quality video. You can read this section to understand the points that contribute to a good Slow-motion video.

* **Frame Rate:** Keep the frame rate higher for a good slow-motion video. In this regard, you can use common frame rates such as 60fps, 120fps, and 140fps. Moreover, you should pick video clips that are originally captured in a high frame rate.
* **Shutter Speed:** Minimize the motion blur in footage and use a faster shutter speed. It is important when you are shooting fast-moving objects. Adjusting the shutter speed can enhance the look of slow-motion videos.
* **Resolution:** A good slow motion is only possible when it is captured in high-quality resolution. Better image quality allows more detail in such footage. Moreover, you can optimize the camera settings for the desired resolution.
* **Editing and Timing:** Thoughtfully chosen clips, timings, and editing can set the stage. Thus, maintain a cohesive flow and pay more attention to the video pacing. Edit all segments in a way that fits seamlessly to contribute a good slow-motion video.
