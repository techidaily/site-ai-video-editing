## Step by Step to Cut Videos in Adobe Premiere Pro

Video editing is an essential skill in a world that has a growing focus on creative fields. And if you work with videos, knowing which clips to use and where to cut is essential in conveying your story and increasing its impact. So, if you are a beginner and want to familiarise yourself with steps and terms used in video editing, in this article, we will go through the steps you will need to cut your video file in Adobe Premiere Pro and Wondershare Filmora.

_This guide uses Adobe Premiere Pro 2022 and Wondershare Filmora X._

## How to cut video in Adobe Premiere Pro?

Once you have Adobe Premiere Pro open on your computer, follow the steps listed below.

**Step 1:** Create a new project in Premiere Pro.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-1.jpeg)

During project creation, we recommend keeping an eye on the file name set and the storage location; this can help reduce the time spent in locating the Premiere Project.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-2.jpeg)

**Step 2:** Import a video file into Premiere Pro with a double click in the marked area and choose the file from its stored location.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-3.jpeg)

**Step 3:** Double click on any imported media to activate it and send it to the Source Window.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-4.jpeg)

You can continue to import more media by double-clicking within the marked area. For better organization, users can also create **Bins**, which are folders within a Premiere Pro File that are often in use to sort out imported media.

_Users can create Bins with a right-click in the red box marked area (refer to image above)._

**Step 4:** Select either the whole clip or a part of it from the Source Window and drag it onto the Timeline.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-5.jpeg)

**Step 5:** Select the Razor Tool from the Tools Window. Now, pick the point where you want to introduce a cut and confirm with your left mouse button; this will split your video track into two parts.

Make a second cut where desired, following which you can move around the newly generated clip or delete it.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-6.jpeg)

**Tip:**You can also select the Razor Tool by pressing C on the keyboard_._

We also recommend using the _Snap in Timeline_ feature (activated with (S) on your keyboard or by choosing the magnet option), which will match your mouse pointer with the Playhead to ensure your cut will match the exact frame shown on your screen.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Some more tips for Adobe Premiere Pro:**

1. Using the I and O keys on your keyboard while playing a video in the Source Window will allow you to set an **In Point**and an **Out Point.** These markers will allow you to move a specific part of your video file into the Timeline, thus, reducing the amount of time spent making the right cut.

_We have tagged the Mark In and Mark Out buttons with a Green Box in the image below._

1. Clicking on the Step Frame Buttons \[marked in Yellow\] will also help increase the accuracy of your cut by allowing you to select the exact moment you desire.
1. You can also mark a Point of Interest in your video file with the help of Markers in Premiere Pro. These afford you the ability to come back to the moment at a later time and see why it interested you in the first place, as editing sessions can often take hours at an end.

## An alternative way to cut video with Wondershare Filmora

In Wondershare [Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) , the steps to cut a video are simplified and don’t require as many steps as seen earlier. Opening the application throws you straight into a project, and following this, you can import a video file and begin editing. From the process you will learn below, it is easy to assume that Wondershare Filmora is more convenient for beginners and provides software features that match paid professional software.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For Win 7 or later (64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For macOS 10.14 or later

**Note:** If you don’t have Wondershare Filmora installed, you can get the video editor by visiting its [official website](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Once the setup program download completes, execute it and begin the installation process.

Once you have the editing software open, follow the steps listed below.

**Step 1:** Import a video file by clicking on the import window.

The default project setting for Filmora X is 1920x1080 at 25 frames per second. Users can change this to match their video file by going into Project Settings under the File tab or by accepting the automatic prompt that appears when dragging the video file onto the Timeline.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-8.jpeg)

**Note:** If you have a PC with weak hardware, Wondershare Filmora gives you the option to create Video Proxies that will reduce the load on your computer by creating smaller clips that are lower in size, resulting in a smoother and faster experience. You can also do this in Premiere Pro, but Filmora does it for you automatically once given permission.

**Step 2:** Drag the video file onto the Timeline to begin previewing it in the Playback Window and commence editing operations.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-9.jpeg)

**Step 3:** Locate where you want to cut in the video file and click on the orange scissors option to split the video file.

![cut-video-in-premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-10.jpeg)

**Tip:** You can also use the keyboard shortcut (CTRL+B) to cut without using a mouse click, in case you make use of a trackpad while editing.

The Bottom Line

As said earlier, knowing where to cut is essential in improving the feel of your video, and we hope this guide showed you exactly how to perform the actions to create your best project. If you are a beginner, the simplistic approach of Wondershare Filmora will be more welcoming and easier to navigate. In addition, the software is also free to download, with added features that you can activate by paying a monthly, yearly, or one-time fee. Adobe Premiere Pro is an option worth considering if you plan on using third-party plugins and other applications from the Creative Cloud Suite.

During project creation, we recommend keeping an eye on the file name set and the storage location; this can help reduce the time spent in locating the Premiere Project.

## Make A Tattoo Disappear Like A Magic

Do you have any tattoos that you don't like anymore? Have you ever wished you had the superpower to make unwanted tattoos vanish? Then, keep reading this article since this article will provide you with how to use masking and colour correction to make a tattoo disappear in [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

## Part 1: What You'll Need to Getting ready

![need a video clip of your arm](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/tattoo-effect-1.jpg)

Step2 After that, put the arm on the tableand keep it still while filming. Meanwhile, have another hand perform on the other side of the frame and pretend to use magic to remove the tattoo.

![put the arm on the tableand](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/tattoo-effect-2.gif)

Step3 Next, you need a picture of a tattoo. Indeed, it would be better to have the tattoo in the same position on the arm so it can match the video clip we just filmed.

![need a picture of a tattoo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/tattoo-effect-3.jpg)

After preparing everything, you need to go to Filmora 11 and start editing. If you haven't downloaded Filmora already, you can visit filmora.wondershare.com.

![go to filmora 11](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/tattoo-effect-4.jpg)

![drag and drop the arm video clip onto the first video track](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/tattoo-effect-5.jpg)

Step2 Add a mask around the tattoo part from the picture. You must hide the first video track to see the mask clearly.Then, double-click on the picture on the timeline and go to the setting window on the top left. Find the Mask Section and select the circle shape. Now you can see the mask is applied.

![add a mask around the tattoo part](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/tattoo-effect-6.jpg)

Step3 Adjust the position and size of the mask to reveal only the tattoo part. Then you must change the "Blur Strength" to add more blur to the edge of the mask.

## What If Quicktime Player Speed up With No Sound?

No sound may be heard when the video is played back if it was encoded in a format that QuickTime cannot understand. Verifying your QuickTime installation is the most obvious way to find out whether it has decoded all of the video files. Let’s investigate the issue to its root.

### Updating Your Quicktime to the Latest Version

The user must carefully study the QuickTime player. For some reason, your QuickTime behaviour is out of whack.

People often neglect to keep their QuickTime software up-to-date, which results in problems with video playback, such as no sound or stuttering, among many other things. To fix this issue, just download and install the most latest release of QuickTime player.

### Examine the System and Driver

Faulty speakers, audio issues in the system, and update failures will ultimately cause media playback difficulties.

To find the root cause, you should first check internally to see whether your speakers are working correctly. Speaking straight to Siri and hearing her reaction is the fastest and most straightforward option.

Another reason you may be hearing no sound on QuickTime is because of a recent system update. Apple, as we all know, often releases new operating systems, and you must keep track of the most current versions of updates in order to keep your system running effectively.

You just need to ensure that your machine is running the most recent version. As a result, your system will resume regular functioning, and QuickTime will be immediately fixed and restored.

### Inspect if the File is Corrupted or not

Checking the file to see whether it has been corrupted is a good idea regardless of whether QuickTime and your system are up and running. To make matters worse, the lack of sound in QuickTime will be the consequence of a corrupted video file.

Try opening the file in a different programme or player to see if the issue may be resolved. If this is the case, your source video file is either destroyed or corrupted. You may wish to consider regaining access to the file in this situation. The likelihood of your file being corrupted by malware or a virus is relatively high. Remember to be patient if this does happen to you.

It is necessary to use third-party repair programmes to successfully fix the file. Consequently, using third-party software to recover and restore the source file should be considered if you are in a situation where the source file is crucial and do not have a backup. As we'll see, there are a number of options available, including Filmora.

## How to Play Videos at 2X Speed with Sound in Quicktime?

Follow the below-mentioned steps to play video at 2x speed with sound in Quicktime:

* Launch QuickTime.
* Click on Edit, which is located on the toolbar on the top. A drop-down menu will appear.
* From the drop-down menu, click on QuickTime Preferences.
* Then select Audio from the dialogue box.
* Then moving forward, change the music synthesizer to Promethean Audio Device, Promethean USB Audio or USB Audio Device. These options might vary depending on the user's specific hardware.
* Click on Apply and then OK.

## What If Quicktime Player Speed up With No Sound?

No sound may be heard when the video is played back if it was encoded in a format that QuickTime cannot understand. Verifying your QuickTime installation is the most obvious way to find out whether it has decoded all of the video files. Let’s investigate the issue to its root.

### Updating Your Quicktime to the Latest Version

The user must carefully study the QuickTime player. For some reason, your QuickTime behaviour is out of whack.

People often neglect to keep their QuickTime software up-to-date, which results in problems with video playback, such as no sound or stuttering, among many other things. To fix this issue, just download and install the most latest release of QuickTime player.

### Examine the System and Driver

Faulty speakers, audio issues in the system, and update failures will ultimately cause media playback difficulties.

To find the root cause, you should first check internally to see whether your speakers are working correctly. Speaking straight to Siri and hearing her reaction is the fastest and most straightforward option.

Another reason you may be hearing no sound on QuickTime is because of a recent system update. Apple, as we all know, often releases new operating systems, and you must keep track of the most current versions of updates in order to keep your system running effectively.

You just need to ensure that your machine is running the most recent version. As a result, your system will resume regular functioning, and QuickTime will be immediately fixed and restored.

### Inspect if the File is Corrupted or not

Checking the file to see whether it has been corrupted is a good idea regardless of whether QuickTime and your system are up and running. To make matters worse, the lack of sound in QuickTime will be the consequence of a corrupted video file.

Try opening the file in a different programme or player to see if the issue may be resolved. If this is the case, your source video file is either destroyed or corrupted. You may wish to consider regaining access to the file in this situation. The likelihood of your file being corrupted by malware or a virus is relatively high. Remember to be patient if this does happen to you.

It is necessary to use third-party repair programmes to successfully fix the file. Consequently, using third-party software to recover and restore the source file should be considered if you are in a situation where the source file is crucial and do not have a backup. As we'll see, there are a number of options available, including Filmora.

## How to Play Videos at 2X Speed with Sound in Quicktime?
