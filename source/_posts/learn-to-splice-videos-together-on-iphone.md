## **Part 1: What is a Video Background Changer?**

A video background changer is a tool that can swap the background of any video. These tools usually work in three simple steps.

* Analyze the footage,
* Separate the subject or “subjects” from the background,
* Switch backgrounds.

The process starts when a user uploads a video clip. The tool analyzes the footage and separates the subjects from the background. The user can select other available pre-made backgrounds or upload a preferred one to the platform. After this process, users can share the finished video or save it to their devices. Other kinds of background changers only merge a transparent clip with a background.

**Step 2: Trim to shorten the video**

Next, you will need to trim the video. This is optional, but important if you want to make a GIF from a video. A longer video means a bigger file size and an increased loading time for your final GIF, so try to keep it as short as possible!

**Step 3: Export as GIF**

Click on the Export button to open up the Export dialog box. From here, you can choose how you want your file exported from a number of options including GIF under the Formats tab. Under the Video tab, select the video quality settings that best suit your requirements. You can also set the frame rate and resolution for your GIF image file at this point. Once you are done, click on Save to specify a location for your file as well as a name for it.

![export mov to gif in wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mov-to-gif-converters-11.jpg)
