## Part 1: Not All Subtitles for MKV files Can Be Extracted (Hardsub Vs. Softsub)

As we have mentioned that there are tools and programs available that can help you remove the subtitle srt files, but here one thing needs to be remembered not all types of subtitle files can be extracted from the MKV videos. The reason for this lies in the type of subtitles used in the videos. So, first, let's learn about subtitle types and their differences.

There are two major types of forms of subtitles- hardsubs (also known as hardcoded subtitles or open subtitles) or softsubs (also known as closed subtitles or softcoded subtitles).

**Hardsubs** are the subtitles that are burned in the image of the videos and thus cannot be extracted, removed, hidden, or disabled when the video files are played.

**Softsubs** are the subtitles that are added as external files to the video container as an independent stream and thus can be turned off, removed, or extracted.
