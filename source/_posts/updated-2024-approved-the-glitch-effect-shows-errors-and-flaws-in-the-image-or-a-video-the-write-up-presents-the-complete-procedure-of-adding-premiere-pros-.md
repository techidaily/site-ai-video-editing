### Step 1: Importing the Targeted Video

![open effects tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/glitch-effect-in-premiere-pro-9.jpg)

### Step 2: Launching the VR Digital Glitch

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### Step 3: Changing the Distortion Control

Scroll down to find "Distortion" in the controls and expand it. The user is suggested to increase the color distortion to give an RGB effect to the footage. After that, you should reduce the distortion rate to 0 so that different artifacts can be eliminated effortlessly.

![customize distortion settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/glitch-effect-in-premiere-pro-11.jpg)

### Step 4: Changing the Noise Strength

Moving on, expand the "Noise" control section and increase the noise strength. It will give the footage a significant level of graininess.

![increase noise strength](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/glitch-effect-in-premiere-pro-12.jpg)

### Step 5: Animating the Glitch Effect

To animate the glitch, use the playhead on the top and drag it to the first position where the effect should start from. Hit the stopwatch located on the left of "Master Amplitude." It will create a keyframe. Alter the "Master Amplitude" to 0 as we do not want the clip to begin with a glitch.

![animate the glitch effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/glitch-effect-in-premiere-pro-13.jpg)

### Step 6: Playing with the Playhead

Now, use your keyboard's right arrow to move the playhead three frames forward. After that, set the "Master Amplitude" to 100\. Again, move the playhead three frames forward and set the "Master Amplitude" to 0\. The animation is produced on the RGB color distortion.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### Step 7: Positioning the Video

Move back to the first keyframe and head to the top that shows "Scale" settings. Enhance the scale value so that the video position can be leveled. Click on the stopwatch next to "Position" to create a keyframe. Move the playhead one frame forward and adjust the position of the frame.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### Step 8: Final Process

Again, move the playhead to the next frame and click on the "Reset" shaped icon to reset the position of the video. Move another frame forward and reposition the video. You can do this multiple times to give a glitchy effect to the clip. There you go! It is all done.
