You can use GIF makers to create loops in videos you upload but the trick to making your 3D GIF stand out is about to be explained in the following.

**●** **Step 1:** Choosing an Image.

The first step in creating a 3D image is to carefully sort out which moment in your video you wish to convert into 3D. Pick an images or video clips that already have an element that pops out in a forward moving motion.

**●** **Step 2:** It should have a smart composition.

Becoming a creator means you need to know more about composition. This can be applicable to anything from making virtual designs to creating GIFs. 3D GIFs requires you to use a special Tumblr ‘frame’ that adds two breaks to the image which creates three horizontal panels. In exceptional cases, you could also use three break points and divide the image into four panels.

**●** **Step 3:** Become a content creator.

It’s okay to feel a bit off beat when trying out new skills but the prospects are rewarding. Try taking your own video footage, edit in Photoshop or any similar editing software. You can also opt for instant GIF creator apps that directly converts the footage or image you clicked into a GIF.

**●** **Step 4:** Making the split.

The next step would be splitting the image or frame into three panels as guideline for the 3D effects. In Photoshop you can import a GIF and choose ‘View’ from the navigation menu and then click on ‘New Guide’ from the drop down menu. Set the guide to 33% at first and 66% in the second.

**●** **Step 5:** Placingthe magical white lines over the guides.

From the shape menu on the sidebar, select the rectangle tool. Right click on this tool to get the shapes menu. Set ‘Fill Colour’ to white and set the weight to five pixels. Click and drag the lines over the guides.

**●** **Step 6:** For the final touch.

Merge these line layers and add a layer mask. The objective here is to only mask the panel where the main 3D element of the image which will be moving beyond the guides. How it is done is that you make copies of the frames where the animation goes beyond the guidelines and mask the layers where the element is over the visible layer.

**●** **Step 7:**  Enjoy your GIF.

## Part 2: How to Set Slow Motion Settings in iMovie Video Making?

iMovie is a wonderful choice if you want to make slow-motion videos. Also, it allows users to change the speed of video clips per their needs. With **slo-mo in iMovie**, you can even fine-tune the speed of a single clip by splitting it into intervals, each with a different speed. You can set multiple ranges to cause a clip to speed up and down.

You can freeze a single frame in your film to create the illusion that time has stopped. The app is a fantastic option for Apple users who want to quickly add slow-motion effects to their videos. iMovie is a pretty straightforward tool that gives quick results. Follow the step-by-step guide below to **slow down video in iMovie**.

##### Step 1

Launch iMovie in your system and click “New Project.” Go to the “Movies” option to import the video you want to edit. Drag the media in the project timeline to make changes to it.
