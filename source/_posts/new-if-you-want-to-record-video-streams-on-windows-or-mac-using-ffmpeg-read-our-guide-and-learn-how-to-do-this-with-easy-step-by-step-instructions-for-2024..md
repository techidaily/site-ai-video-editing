## If You Want to Record Video Streams on Windows or Mac Using FFmpeg, Read Our Guide and Learn How to Do This with Easy Step-by-Step Instructions

FFmpeg is an open-source video processing tool with many powerful features. Many of these features are exposed through FFmpeg’s command line interface but can also be accessed from the program’s Python bindings and its Qt GUI frontend, called QFFMpeg.

This article will explain using FFmpeg command line tools to record video streams on Windows and Mac computers with step-by-step examples and screenshots.

## Part 1\. What is FFmpeg?

FFmpeg stands for "FF Multi-Platform Executable" and was originally developed by Fabrice Bellard in the year 2000 as an extension of the MPlayer project. The sole purpose of the software command-line design is to provide a complete solution for users to record live streams (audio and/or video) from any type of device that supports either the RTSP or HTTP streaming protocols.

FFmpeg is a complete, cross-platform solution to record, convert, mix, and edit audio and video files. The software has over 250 input formats, which allows users to **record video streams** in any media format. The FFmpeg commands stream the video back after recording, convert it into MP4 or MKV file, and process incoming data on the fly, such as rtmpdump.

## Part 2\. How to Record a Video Stream With FFmpeg on Windows?

The free FFmpeg command line tool is a great way to record a live internet stream and listen back to it later. If you have a Windows PC and want to record a video stream or screen using FFmpeg, our following step-by-step method will help you go through this process without facing many difficulties.

Step1 First, launch a browser of your choice on your Windows PC and head to the [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-windows) website. Hover over the Windows icon in the middle pane and select either the **gyan.dev** or **BTbn** build.

![downloading ffmpeg on windows](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/downloading-ffmpeg-on-windows.png)

On the next screen, select the latest **Windows 64-bit** file from the list. Why? You need to use a computer compatible with the Windows 64-bit version. Next, download the ZIP file on your PC and use ZIP file extraction software to open the file contents.

Step2 Locate the **ffmpeg.exe** file on the extracted file and copy it to a new folder on your computer hard drive (e.g., C:\\VideoRecorder).

![extracting ffmpeg files on windows pc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/extracting-ffmpeg-files-on-windows-pc.png)

Step3 In the next step, click the **Start** icon on your Windows dashboard and type **cmd** in the search box. Right-click on Command Prompt, select **“Run as Administrator,”** and launch the program.

![launching command prompt](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/launching-command-prompt.png)

Now, write the command to select the FFmpeg directory. For example, cd **C:\\VideoRecorder**, and hit the **“Enter”** key.

Step4 To start recording the video stream, simply call FFmpeg and use the following command line. In this case, we are taking the example of capturing a YouTube video of “Running up that hill” from the top-rated TV show Stranger Things.

ffmpeg.exe -y -i <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV0RAcuG2Ao> runningup.mp4

Hit the “Enter” key, and the output of this command will be displayed on the Command Prompt interface.

The command options have the following meanings:

**\-y** allows automatic rewriting of existing files.

**\-i** <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV0RAcuG2Ao> is the stream URL that FFmpeg will record. You can change it with any video stream URL.

**runningup.mp4** is the name of the output file.

### Tips: Automatically Recording Video Streams on Windows PC

If you want your computer to record a specific video stream time automatically, use the Windows Task Scheduler to create a Timer to stop the recording after a particular time is passed.

## Part 3\. How to Record a Video Stream With FFmpeg on Mac?

You can use the Mac Terminal to record video streams via FFmpeg in the following way.

Step1 First, launch a browser on your Mac computer and head to the [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-windows) website. Hover over the **Apple** icon in the middle pane and select the macOS 64-bit static build option.

![downloading ffmpeg on mac](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/downloading-ffmpeg-on-mac.png)

Download the ZIP file on your Mac and use ZIP file extraction software to open the file contents.

Step2 **Launch the terminal** on your Mac from the Apple menu, type the **“ffmpeg -f avfoundation -list\_devices true -i”** command to let the system know which device to record from, and hit the **Enter** key.

Step3 Next, designate the path where you want to save your video, e.g., **cd Path/to/my/videostream** and press **Enter**.

Step4 Type in the **“ffmpeg -f avfoundation -i "1:1"-c:v libx264 -qp 0-preset ultrafast out.mp4"** command and hit **Enter** to start recording the video stream.

![starting video stream recording on mac](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/starting-video-stream-recording-on-mac.png)

Stop recording the video stream by pressing **“q.”**

![stopping video stream recording on mac](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/stopping-video-stream-recording-on-mac.png)

## Part 4\. How to Record Video Stream More Easily?

A few benefits of using the Filmora Screen Recording software are as follows:

## Event Videography Is Popular in Weddings, Graduation, Family Reunion and Other Great Moments. Here I’m Going to Share some of the Tips to Make a Better Event Videography

There is no doubt that if you have an upcoming corporate event, you will want to record it using professional

corporate event video production. This is something that can't be stressed enough. Providing video footage of events is an excellent method to raise people's awareness of your brand, as well as interest in and enthusiasm for the work that your firm does.

Let's start!

![event videography](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/event-videography.jpg)

## 1\. A quality corporate event video represents your business

People who are watching your corporate event video aren't just learning about who your company is and what your company does. They're also learning about your commitment to quality. If your event video looks like it was shot off the cuff by an employee on someone's phone, people may assume you take that kind of approach to your business and service to your customers.

You don't, but it's an easy assumption to make. A professionally shot, high-quality video signals to viewers that your company appreciates quality and seeks it out in everything they do. It also shows your attention to detail and what they can expect when they choose your business to handle their own occasions or services.

## 2\. A professional videographer is capable of editing

Videoing your corporate event is about more than just filming, it's knowing how to cut the event together, how to mix the shots and the sound, and add music and any subtle effects or graphics that will make the video really shine. There is a lot that goes into post-production that an amateur simply cannot replicate.

Editing your video without the benefit of a dedicated studio with years of experience just won't have the same

effect when it comes to amplifying the energy and mission of your event. It also will not show the level of detail that your video could contain if a professional corporate event video production company did it.

## 3\. A professional video is completed on schedule

It can take longer than you anticipate if you opt to handle your corporate or conference videos yourself or

delegate the task to one of your workers. Without a lot of post-production knowledge, it could take a lot of trial and error to put your material together in a way that produces the desired outcome.

If you're trying to summarize an event and demonstrate to stakeholders or customers how effective it was, you might not have time for that. Even though unforeseen issues might always arise, if you and a competent

videographer agree on a finish date, they will be able to deliver. This is crucial if you want to utilize your video

to promote a recent event or for marketing purposes.

## 4\. A skilled videographer avoids interference

A skilled videographer is trained to film an event without getting in the way, so things can keep going as usual.

If you're not used to doing professional videography, you might not realize you're bothering your guests and

messing up the event while you're trying to film it. This can turn people off and hurt your finished product, as

well as the success of your event. If your occasion is streamed online, you don't want the videographer to get in the way or become visible in the frame your live show.

## 5\. A video that is done well tells a story

Companies with experience creating videos do more than just capture actions digitally, they also find the story

in the event they are recording and use their videography skills to tell that story. This storyline is defined in

what they choose to shoot, when they shoot it and how they edit it all together. It's that storyline that is going

to capture the attention from the audience and give your video the desired impact.

It's also going to stir up emotions and passion in your audience, creating momentum in your company and with your customers that will last until your next event. Remember that any video you share with your customers or employees is a video marketing exercise that helps you build brand awareness. Let your corporate event video reflect positively on your business.

## 6\. A videographer has a shot list

It is not enough to simply create a list; you must also put it to good use. The idea that you should plan your shot and then execute your plan is a fundamental element of production. Create a strategy and put it into action since your videographer will be knowing his job to adhere to this concept regardless of whether or not they are aware of it.

Also, get things you may or may not need for editing. It is usually excellent practice to use some B roll audio

and video, in addition to establishing shots, no matter what kind of event you are filming, be it a wedding or a business function. If you anticipate that it will be overly crowded during the event, take your creative shoton a pleasant day that occurs before the main event.

## Conclusion

We sincerely hope that some of these pointers will be of assistance to you as you navigate the area of special

events videos. Whether you are able to employ all of them or not will depend on your client, the event, and

your own workflow; nonetheless, the takeaway from this anecdote is that you should be prepared for the

worst-case scenario and find that you are better equipped to offer the best possible results. There won't be

many situations that you won't be able to manage with grace and professionally if you have the ability to

remain calm, cool, and professional.
