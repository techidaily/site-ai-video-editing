This is not a music visualizer for enjoyment; instead, it is designed for folks who want to know what's inside an audio file. As a result, you'll need some basic knowledge of phonetics and phonology to figure out what the depicted images mean. The solid third-party plug-ins it supports, such as pitch estimation and onset detection, are a significant element of this audio visualizer. The official lessons on utilizing it for musicological reasons may be found here. **Features**:

* Open source and free, with a plethora of plug-ins
* For musicologists, archivists, and other researchers, the best audio visualizer.

**Price**: $0 **Cons**:

* Requires you to install plug-ins.
* **After Effects**

![audio-visualizers-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/audio-visualizers-8.jpg)

**Supported system**: Windows/Mac **Introduction**: Adobe requires no introduction in the photo, audio, and video editing. So it's no surprise that it's one of the most reliable music visualization tools available. The Adobe Audio Spectrum Effect is simple to utilize if you have some prior Adobe experience. Even though it is a premium-based music visualizer, there are numerous music visualization capabilities to try out. You must first create a new composition and then add the sound file to it to utilize the tool. Then, finally, you set the audio duration and leave the rest to the visualizer. **Features**:

* The camera raw image file can be edited or imported.
* When you connect to a USB, this audio visualizer instantly updates the audio device.
* Copying media to a shared location is simple.
* This software allows you to work together on shared projects.

**Price**: $20.99/month as a single app and $52.99/month as a subscription model for all apps. **Cons**:

* Tricky to understand and use.
* Requires high device configuration for the software to run.
* **Rendersoft Music Visualizer**

![audio-visualizers-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/audio-visualizers-9.jpg)

**Supported system**: Online **Introduction**: Renderforest is one of the most versatile music visualization programs available, offering freemium and subscription-based plans. But that's not all; the software also allows users to visualize their music online and even create a website. Users must create an account to utilize the app because it is online-based. Once you've created an account, you'll have access to Renderforest's massive visualization templates, which you can customize with the song title, artist name, and background photo or video. Then you pick your favorite visualization style and color. Then you finish up by uploading the song you want to use in your video. Click the "Preview" icon to have Renderforest email the music visualization video to you when you're done. **Features**:

* Each template is tagged with a rating and exported to make it easier for you to compare and choose.
* You can use free stock photographs as a background or submit your photos. It is also possible to add text.
* You can share your music visualizer on YouTube, Facebook, and other social media platforms.

**Price**: $9.99/month, but a free version is also available. **Cons**:

* It is necessary to register and log in. The output will be limited to 2 minutes in 360p with a watermark if you merely wish to utilize this online music visualizer for free.
* Error - In addition to the slow processing and unexpected crashes, there is no OK or Back button after applying a filter during image editing.
* **ProjectM Music Visualizer**

![audio-visualizers-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/audio-visualizers-10.jpg)

**Supported system**: Android and iOS **Introduction**: ProjectM Music Visualizer is compatible with Android and iOS devices, demonstrating its versatility. While both the Android and iPhone versions can be used to create powerful audiovisuals for your music, the iOS version is preferred. It has a built-in media player that lets you listen to your recordings to get a sense of how the final product will seem. Both versions, however, feature hundreds of music visualization effects and multi-touch interactive visualizations. ProjectM also supports Chromecast, which is a remarkable feature. **Features**:

* It supports Chromecast and offers hundreds of graphic effects.
* Additional modes are available, such as the Immersive Option for KitKat smartphones.
* Search and browse visual effects
* Detects sound from microphones and music players automatically.

**Price**: Free to use but can be upgraded to a premium account for $2.99/month. **Cons**:

* It does not offer any presets in the library.

Nothing rivals the thrill of watching your songs play with gorgeous, real-time animated graphics, whether you're a professional music mixer or just a sound freak. The apps we've evaluated will assist you in choosing and adding graphics to your music.
