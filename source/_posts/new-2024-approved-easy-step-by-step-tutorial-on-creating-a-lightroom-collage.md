Professional Lightroom users concentrate on a few key graphic design considerations to keep their photo collage looking its best.In other words, every element should be in the right proportion, such as dimension, alignment, proximity, and theme.

**Balance**

Balance refers to the arrangement of all elements. It includes the division of pictures into equal or different dimensions according to the collage size. Maintaining balance enhances the overall appearance of a photo collage in lightroom. Some lightroom experts prefer symmetrical balance, but you can get better quality collages through asymmetrical balance.

**Alignment**

Don't underestimate the importance of alignment in **Lightroom collage**. How your pictures are aligned can have a drastic effect on their overall look. It provides a definitive structure and delivers a well-finished product to the client.

In graphic design, two kinds of elements exist: edge and centre alignment. These are applied to visual design and text as well.

**Proximity**

Proximity signifies the relationship between various elements on the basis of the distance between them. It follows two basic principles:

**●** Realistic pictures should be put together.

**●** Unrelatable images should be separated.

Moreover, the border width needs to be consistent throughout, irrespective of the number of pictures.

**Theme**

The theme, also known as tone or style, matters when it comes to collage design. Each image must have a similar style, as this idea can personify all the captured memories. It will completely beautify your artistic perspective, but it's not as measurable as others.

It will be a time-consuming process to make an original template, but we will still focus on both. If you want to create a **lightroom collage** of pictures, follow the steps given below.

**Create a Photo Collage with a New Template**

For a beginner, designing their own template can be a complex and hectic process. But, it's worth it in the end because the final collage will be the result of all your hard work. In addition, you can show your own creative style by designing a new layout template. This way, you can also deliver a unique creation to your client. Maybe they will end up paying you more as a reward. If you are up for it, then go read the steps to do so.

**Step 1: Import and Edit Photographs**

Your first step should be to import the photos into your lightroom before proceeding further. Next, to get a perfect collage, your pictures deserve a final touch, which you can do conveniently with the batch editing feature.

**Step 2: Establishing the Workspace**

After importing and editing the photos, it's time to create a workspace. Go to the "Print" panel and then to the "Print Job" menu. At this point, you can adjust the dimension of your collage. Make sure to provide ample space for the photos and borders.

**Step 3: Create a Photo Layout**

As you have photos in hand and space for distributing them, start forming individual spaces to place them. Try using individual boxes as per the required size or your choice with the "Add to Package" section. You can find it under the Cell of Print menu. Feel free to experiment with the size, placement, and more.

**Step 4: Add Photos to the Layout**

If you are satisfied with the collage template, now bring all your photos to the layout. It's pretty easy to do because you just have to click on the photo and drag it to where you want. At the end, rearrange as you want until the final design doesn't seem pleasing to your eyes.

**Create a Photo Collage with a Pre-designed Template**

Want to save some time without compromising on the final quality of the collage? **Make a collage in Lightroom** using a pre-designed template. But remember, you won't get enough freedom to customize the template. If you are up for creating a collage in Lightroom using a pre-designed template, go through the following points.

**Step 1: Import the photos into the program**

Here also, you can't create the collage without adding your photos to Lightroom. Simply click on "File" > "Add Photos" and choose the file location.

**Step 2: Download the collage layout**

Adobe Lightroom offers free as well as paid templates to make a **photo collage in Lightroom.** You are free to download any one that appeals to you.

**Step 3: Bring in the Template**

Click on the "Print" module > "Template Browser" > "Lightroom Templates" menu. Now, import the extracted **Lightroom collage template** using the "Import" button.

Scroll down until you reach the Filmstock option. You must click on it and find the Flicker option from the list. Under this collection, there are many options available. You must choose the Video\_seg effect and drag it to the editing timeline above Track 2.

![drag it down to the editing timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-glitch-text-effect-8.jpg)

At this point, ensure the effect falls right above the first and second clip parts in the track below. Tap on the edges of this clip to reduce the size of the video effect, taking careful note to keep the clip 8 frames long overall.

Then, copy the cut-down effect from Track 3 and paste it at every intersectional point between the separated word-based clips in Track 2.

![paste it at every intersectional point](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-glitch-text-effect-9.jpg)

## 9\. Zoom in to edit the first effect layer

Following this, you must zoom into the timeline for a better view and editing control for the next part.

Go to the Effects tab at the top and choose the Filters collection next. Under it, choose the Chaos 1 effect option, drag it down to the timeline, and place it above the previous clip on Track 4\. Adjust the starting edge of this clip to have the same starting point as the Video\_seg effect on Track 3 with an overall 8-frame duration.

![adjust the edges of the clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-glitch-text-effect-10.jpg)

## 10\. Edit the Effect

Next, you have to double-click on this clip to open the editing window for this effect. In this section, go to the Frequency parameter and increase the slider to 400\. Following that, click on the Position X parameter and move the slider to the 0.20 point. Next, do the same for the Position Y parameter, but to the 0.70 point.

Change the Position Z parameter by typing the value 40 and disable the RGB Separate setting. Then, press the OK button and go to the timeline again.

![disable the rgb separate setting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-glitch-text-effect-11.jpg)

## 11\. Adjust the Glitch effects

Click on the effect clip on Track 4 and copy it. Please do the same as you did for the effect in Track 3 and paste it at the same locations between the clips in this track.

Afterward, go to the Effects tab again and choose the Filmstock tab. Among the collections here, you have to choose the Glitch option and select Glitch Stripe 1 from the collection. For an easier searching experience, you can directly type the effect in the search bar under the Effects tab.

![select glitch stripe 1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-glitch-text-effect-12.jpg)

Then, drag and drop it on Track 5 of the timeline right above the previous effect and reduce its duration to the same level as the first two effects. Copy it and then paste the clip again for each clip-to-clip intersection.

After this part, drag the Glitch Dispersion effect down to the timeline. Place it above the previous effect and adjust the clip's size to the same length. Again, copy the effect and repeat the steps again. Next, repeat the same whole process with the Negative Flicker effect from the Flicker collection on Track 7.

![add negative flicker effect and adjust it](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-glitch-text-effect-13.jpg)

## 12\. See the preview and save the file

Finally, you are done adding all the effects, and you have to click on the Render Preview icon in the toolbar above the timeline. Then, press the Play button on the Preview window to see the full glitch text effect play out properly.

![press the play button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-create-glitch-text-effect-14.jpg)

## Conclusion

Now, you are done with creating a visually exciting and dynamic look for your introductory or ending title in the video using the glitch effect.

Ultimately, with the help of this software, you can expect a high-quality title look and use it for further video editing work.
