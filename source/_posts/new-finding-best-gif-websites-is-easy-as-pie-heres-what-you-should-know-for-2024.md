## Part 1: How to Make a Countdown timer in After Effects

Developed by Adobe, After Effects is one of the most widely used animation software that is used for creating and editing videos using a wide range of functions supported by the application. Among other functions, After Effects facilitates adding a countdown timer to your videos and this task can be done in multiple ways.

Listed below are these different methods.

### Method 1\. Adding Countdown Timer in After Effects using Expression

Step1 Launch the software and then choose to Create a new Text Layer.

![after effects text layer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/complete-tutorial-on-after-effects-countdown-timer-adding-01.jpg)

Step2 Open the text options and click on Alt + Click on your PC (For the Mac -Option + Click) on the stopwatch of the Source Text.

Step3 Next, you need to insert the expression - timeToCurrentFormat() inside the expression area.

Step4 Now, set the composition frame rate to 60fps which will make it look like an actual countdown timer.

Step5 Now count it down, pre-compose everything and then reverse the speed of the composition.

Composition speed can be reversed, right-click on the same, go to Time and then choose Time Reverse Layer.

![after effects expressions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/complete-tutorial-on-after-effects-countdown-timer-adding-02.jpg)

Above are the steps for **timer expression after effects** process.

### Method 2\. Adding Countdown Timer in After Effects using the Timecode plugin

In this method, you can use the Timecode plugin instead of using the “**timeToCurrentFormat()**” expression.

While using this **after effects timer** method, you would need to add a plugin to the New Solid that will create a timer layout automatically.

Next, follow the process as in the previous steps, and a countdown timer can be added.

### Method 3\. Creating a simple Countdown in After Effects

Step1 First of all, launch the software and then create a Text Layer.

Step2 Next, open the text options using Alt + Click for PC and Option + Click for Mac at the stopwatch of Source Text.

Step3 Next, at the expression area insert the expression- Math. Floor(-time) +10\. Here in the place of 10, you can choose any number desired and this will be the starting countdown value.

Above we have learned 3 ways by which After Effects can be used for adding a countdown timer. Though these are workable methods, at times you may have issues with them and thus an alternate tool may be needed.

![after effects simple countdown timer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/complete-tutorial-on-after-effects-countdown-timer-adding-03.jpg)

## Part 2: Why Countdown timer is not working in After Effects

Though a lot of people use After Effects for creating countdown times, there are situations when the software will not serve your purpose. We have collected some of the common reasons that lead to the countdown timer not working in After Effects.

**Software version out of date**

If the software version of After Effects is out of date, then several features including Countdown Timer may be missing or have issues with the same.

**Incorrect values or command**

If the value for the countdown or the statement is incorrect while using After Effects, the countdown timer will not work properly.

**The steep learning curve of the software**

After Effects comes in with a wide range of features, but you need to have a thorough knowledge of the procedure to use the tool. Thus, the software has a steep learning curve which can be a problem for a lot of users and have issues while creating a countdown timer.
