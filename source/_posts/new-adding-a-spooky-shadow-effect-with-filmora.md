## Adding a Spooky Shadow Effect with Filmora

Whether you're a horror content creator or simply living the Halloween vibe 24/7, continue reading to know how to use its latest masking feature to create a cool shadow effect for your next mind-blowing social media video.

## How to Use The Masking Effect

[Wondershare Filmora's](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) latest Masking feature allows its users to select a specific clip that they can overlay on other parts of the video or other clips.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

The feature allows you to insert the mask in any shape, such as a rectangle, circle, or triangle. You can also import any shapes you like if you can't find them in the presets library. You can also adjust the mask placement, width, height, and feather effect.

Without further ado, let's see the detailed step-by-step guide for this effect.

### a. Preparation

You will need at least three shots of the same frame to get the shadow effect to work. The first is the main video, the second is the shadow clip, and the last would be a clip portraying just a plain background.

Make sure that your camera stays at the same point and angle. You can use a tripod for assurance.

Take the first main video and don't forget to mark the positioning of the object for the next take. Then, you can shoot the shadow clip following the marking of the object to match its position in the main clip.

Finally, shoot the final clip without the object on the frame.

Filming underwater is always a dream of any videographer, but we were limited to get shots from the water's surface. So now it's time to add more creativity to your video.

First, you need to take a transparent container or any glass container. Pour water according to your need in it.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Ensure the container is light enough to put on the phone.

Then, place the container on the lens of the phone to make a video. Then, take care of the phone from the water.

## Part 4\. Make Colourful Shots Without Coloured Lights

All filmmakers love party lights and want to add colors like that in the video. Different colored lights in videos usually represent different mood swings and enhance the creativity of storytellers.

Professional videographers use expensive lights to give these effects. But you don’t need to purchase any expensive gear. Because you can make colorful shots easily with colored plastic binder dividers, or you can also use cellophane wraps.

First, wrap the colored divider around the LED light or any light you use to shoot video.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Check the light temperature after short intervals because it melts or burns the dividers when the light source gets hot.

![wrap the led light with a green divider](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/mimic-professional-filming-gears-4.png)

Now make the video and try with different colors to add suspense, horror, and happy effects to the video.

![final results after making colorful shots](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/mimic-professional-filming-gears-5.png)

The video still needs more creative effects and designs; scroll more to read exciting tips.

## Part 5\. Different Shapes of Light with Cardboard

To add a fantasy location in the video and make light effects in the form of shapes, try out easily available cardboard. Most of the time, aesthetic videos are made by these hacks, giving viewers different vibes.

Only a professional photographer and videographer know how to attract the audience to the shots by doing these simple hacks.

The interesting thing is that if light has more shape, it will precisely describe more about the scene's backstory, location, and context. Give it a try!

##### Step1 Cutting of cardboards

Cut the cardboard in any shape, whatever you want. We will experiment by cutting cardboard in window blinds shape.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** There is no specific recommendation for the cardboard, you can use any size or shape which suits you the best.

![shaping of cardboard](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/mimic-professional-filming-gears-6.png)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** The more precise the cutting of cardboard, the more professional it looks.

![final preview](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/mimic-professional-filming-gears-7.png)

Become more creative and make more shapes with cardboard because the audience always prefers new content in the market.

## Part 6\. Create Point of View Shots

After adding colors and shapes, now it's time to get some Point of View (POV) shots. Most of the time, viewers become bored by watching framing and filming coverages.

POV shots are mostly captured from a specific angle to show an object's characters. They are mostly seen in food commercials, and videographers of snacks just love to make these shots.

To make POV shots, there is nothing specific required. You just have to make a suitable position for the lens. Follow the below guidelines and capture it!

##### Step1 Cut ends of packet

To create POV shots of your favorite snack, first of all, cut down both ends of the packets.

##### Step2 Attach packet on a camera

After cutting, attach the packet of snacks to the camera lens or phone with the help of old-fashioned tape.

Ensure the camera is turned on, and then make a POV shot. Now, it's time to enjoy the rest part with the audience. Check out the final results, as shown below!

![final preview of pov shot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/mimic-professional-filming-gears-8.gif)

Due to this, the food seems good, and you can notice the number of spices too. This one actually looks amazing!

What if we add the rotatory shots, too, in the video? For this, check out the last tip and try that!

## Part 7\. Create a Barrel Roll Shot

Barrel roll shots are the full axial shot by spinning the camera lens. Epic shots that formerly required costly gimbals and sophisticated techniques are now as simple as strolling.

It’s pretty easy to make a rotatory shot at 360° by using equipment easily available at home. Rolling may feel anxiety and disorientation. Filmmakers utilize it to confuse or unnerve audiences in movies.

There is no need to purchase expensive gambles to make barrel roll clips. Instead, try this hack by utilizing a power drill present at your home. Then, follow the below steps to give it a professional look!

##### Step1 Take equipment

First, take a camera lens or smartphone, whatever you are using to make a video, and a power drill as a gimbal.

##### Step2 Camera with drill

Attach the camera to the power drill with the help of old-fashioned tape.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You should have a piece of square foam or soft block placed between the camera and drill to assist.

![smartphone attached to the power drill](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/mimic-professional-filming-gears-9.png)

Now, it’s time to turn on the drill and ensure that the video option is **“Turn On”** in the camera. Then, enjoy the shots of 360° with your audience!

## What You Should Know About Speech-to-Text  Technology

Speech-to-text technology (**STT**) improves communication, especially in a multi-language setting. One of the ways we practice multilingualism is via **speech-to-text technology:** speakers input a language, and viewers read another language. Other advantages include converting oral speech into a document, real-time compatibility, and offline usage. This article explains how you can utilize **speech-to-text assistance** technology for optimal productivity.

![speech to text technology](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/speech-to-text-technology.jpg)

## Part 1: What is speech-to-text technology?

Speech-to-text technology (STT) identifies oral pronunciation and converts them into computer codes: electronic words. The computer electro-communication requires a medium of conversion: receiver and interpreter. Therefore, speech-to-text technology contains both the receiver and interpreter, which exist electronically. The medium or receiver can be software installed on a device; it must have a receiver and a screen. The computer serves a good purpose, although other devices can receive words without displaying them.

A speech-to-text technology does not necessarily have to contain displaying screen: a sound interpreter may replace the screen. Thus, speech-to-text can be oral words - electronic recognition - word encoding - display, or recitation. Oral wordings are the human's contribution to speech-to-text technology, although all communication (especially speech) may be generated from a computer. Inter-device communication is another advancement of speech-to-text technology. For example, combining one or more devices allow you to use speech-to-text assistance technology in different languages.

Communication is the paramount importance in speech-to-text technology. Still, some advantages include easy data conversion, documentation, workflow flexibility, and easy access to data. For example, documentation is incomplete if every human cannot access the file. All humans cannot read; improvising data into oral documents reduces the percentage of people who cannot access the file. Speech-to-text increases the channel for less privileged individuals. For instance, the deaf who cannot listen to a recorded file can read the file via speech-to-text technology.

Speech-to-text technology incorporates many advantages. Learning to use the technology is the first step in familiarizing and getting yourself equipped.

## Part 2: What are the stages for the technology?

STT gives so many stages and applications for a daily and smooth organization. Some include:

### 1\. Education

Education and the love to study other languages increase with speech-to-text technology. The educative application is not limited to four corners of the room; it extends to all daily learning activities. Communication is educative if you learn new things via communication.

STT improves all processes associated with less privileged education. For example, everyone easily pours their mind into a computer screen page when they speak, especially in the language they understand using STT. Time and submission date are important factors in the educational system; STT improves time, submission, accuracy, and authentication.

### 2\. Video Subtitles

Videography and filmmaking carry a large percentage of today's media. Data input and integration in the video-making process weigh a lot, and the concept of STT reduces the load on the data specialist. Instead of long hours of typing, oral communication is applicable. Processing time is a factor of productivity; STTs do not only affect the time of production but also maintain accuracy.

### 3\. Chatbots

Chatbots are available on websites. Users have different preferences: some can type while others like to communicate via speech. The chatbots attend to users' needs; you can do more with STT if installed on the website. STT promotes freedom of communication and increases user interaction on your website. STT may be incorporated into mobile applications too. There is more to STT, and the advantage is unlimited if you add it to your chatbots.

### 4\. Translation

Translation is the interconversion of languages. The main reason translation is important is because communication is essential; without communication, production will be static. STT is among the tool that elevates productivity via communication. For example, STT improves communication in a situation where more than one language combines as one.

## Part 3: What are the best STT Technology provider

### 1\. Amazon web services

STT is one of the services in the Amazon web services. The STT is available for all users who subscribe to one or more Amazon services. Some features include unlimited conversion, easy download, and availability in multiple formats. To get started, you need to sign up for a free AWS account and begin to enjoy the offer. Although the services are available for all users, limitations, and upgrades come a few times when you must pay for certain premium services.

### 2\. Google docs voice typing

Google docs voice typing is available for all Google users. You can access the Google docs voice typing provided you are on a service by Google. The service is available on the Google docs application - one of the services created by Google. Google docs are free for download and available for desktop and mobile users.

### 3\. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Wondershare Filmora STT is quite different with other STT service providers. Other STT platforms/stages require you to use the application to convert speech-to-text, save, and export into other third-party software. However, Wondershare Filmora allows you to directly convert your speech-to-text on an ongoing production. For example, you can convert speech into subtitles during a video production on Wondershare Filmora.

### 4\. Microsoft dictate

The Microsoft dictate shows to have the same build-up as the Microsoft Cortana Virtual Assistant. It gives free access to all users who convert speech-to-text without subscribing to any platform. The Microsoft dictate is a default option for many Microsoft devices and partners' software. Microsoft dictates accuracy is appreciable; it is likewise easy to use.
