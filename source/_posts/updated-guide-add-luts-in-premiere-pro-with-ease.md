This app gives you two options when it comes to animating the text on your video; auto-motion and typography. It focuses on just adding and editing text on a video and as such may not have any of the other video editing features you will find on some of the other apps.

You even get a wide selection of royalty-free music that you can add to the video and motion stickers to make your title stand out even more. But the free version of Vimeo will add a watermark to the video.

## Part 1 Best 10 Augmented Reality Effects

Below we have listed the best 10 Augmented Reality Effects

### 01Indoor and OutdoorPowering and Navigation

This year, AR navigation has become more flexible and attainable. The increase in technologies like Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) antennas, Wi-Fi RTT, and ultra-wideband (UWB) make indoor navigation much more practical than before. One of the most useful applications of this technology is for displaying AR directions in large indoor locations like delivery centers, shopping malls, and airports.

![indoor outdoor navigation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/10-best-innovative-ar-video-effects-to-check-out-1.jpg)

By using indoor navigation, things bought online and picked up in-store services can be more well-organized. Group members whose job is to 'pick' the items in the store for order fulfillment can use AR directions for navigating and finding the item as different to following coordinated directions to find the item. This saves a lot of time looking through similar items and finding the exact aisle and section of the store.

### 02Healthcare and Augmented Reality

Deloitte Research has said that augmented reality and AI will change the old-style healthcare business model by giving AR/MR-enabled hands-free solutions and IA-based diagnostic tools. With the continued restrictions due to Covid-19, augmented reality solutions are becoming gradually significant to address matters such as the difficulty of distant patient support and the amplified burden on hospitals.

There are psychological healthiness apps helping individuals maintain psychological balance during these grim times.AR technology can also improve telemedicine solutions that are rising currently, such as drawing and interpreting on the 3D screen can make communication between doctors and patients much easier.

### 03Augmented Reality Shopping

Augmented reality has a huge part in the shopping sector. One of the prospects that are presently being comprehended is store mapping. With augmented reality, televised directions can help a person direct the store's layout to find the item they need. A person musthold their phone up and follow the augmented reality directions through the passages to their destination. It can also help people shop in stores from home.

### 04Improving Mobile AR Hardware & LiDAR

One of the popular tendencies in the augmented reality business is refining hardware for mobile devices. With the help of infrared lasers, smartphones can determine the depth of scenes with more precision than before. Analysis of scenes for AR experiences can now be done better than ever. The Apple and Android devices are relatively comparable in delivering AR experiences to users. However, now, it's important to consider convenience. LiDAR hardware is only available on higher-end Apple and Android devices, denoting that most AR customers will only have access to a limited level of quality.

### 05AR IN ACTION: VIRTUAL MANUALS

Virtual manuals are a gripping technology used in various industries to improve operator fulfillment and understanding of products. It also has many uses in education. It recognizes objects, and the AR guides can identify objects and inform the operator about their functions. This can be used for making effective guides for objects like electronics, vehicle interiors, and more.
