This app gives you two options when it comes to animating the text on your video; auto-motion and typography. It focuses on just adding and editing text on a video and as such may not have any of the other video editing features you will find on some of the other apps.

You even get a wide selection of royalty-free music that you can add to the video and motion stickers to make your title stand out even more. But the free version of Vimeo will add a watermark to the video.
