## Part 1: How to Zoom Discord on Computer

Step3On the right section, scroll down, and you will find three options for zooming – Chat font scaling, Space between message groups, and Zoom level.

Step1Open your web browser and visit the official website of Discord.

Step2Click on the three-dot icon at the top-right corner of the browser.
