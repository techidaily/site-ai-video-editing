## 5 Best Call of Duty: Warzone Thumbnails on YouTube That May Inspire You

Research is always key to accomplishing something. If you want to create kickass COD: Warzone video thumbnails, you should look at the ones that worked. Visit YouTube and find videos that have great success. That will help you get some ideas for your thumbnails.

Let us help you with that. Here are 5 Call of Duty: Warzone thumbnails you should check out.

### 1\. Call of Duty Warzone: THE BATTLE OF VERDANSK GAMEPLAY! (No Commentary)

![warzone thumbnail by noannoyingcommentary](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/warzone-thumbnail-1.JPG)

This video from the channel [NoAnnoyingCommentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3pBdi2Cf9Y) has 3.3 million views. It shows the player pointing their gun upwards. Flying in the sky are many fighter planes (obviously edited.) Then, a sepia filter is applied to make it look like a shot from past real-world wars. It is cool and sure to attract the attention of the COD: Warzone demographics.

### 2\. TOP 300 FUNNIEST FAILS IN WARZONE

![warzone thumbnail by red arcade](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/warzone-thumbnail-2.JPG)

This video is made by [Red Arcade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1UFojIiiK8). It has attracted more than 12 million views. Admittedly, the title and the video concept are already enough to attract many viewers. But we can't say that the thumbnail did not help. It's actually really good.

The thumbnail shows a screenshot from Warzone. A player's character is in the middle, with his back facing the camera. The words "AFK. Don't shoot!" are written on the wall he is facing. The character is viewed through a sniper scope. It's more "funny" than cool. But for what the video is about, it works fantastic.

### 3\. Clean House \[PS5 UHD 4K\] Next-Gen Ultra Realistic Graphics PlayStation 5 Call of Duty Gameplay

![warzone thumbnail by hedgehog](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/warzone-thumbnail-3.JPG)

This video from [HEDGEHOG ヅ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQlxN49jn6Y) has a whopping 12 million views. Again, the title likely is the main reason why it got that many views. But for sure, people did not read that long title at first. They were drawn to it by the thumbnail.

The thumbnail shows a clear-as-crystal screenshot of a team of 4 players on the battlefield. At the top left corner is the PS5 logo. Then, at the bottom left is an icon that says the video is in 4K UHD. If you're also uploading 4K Warzone videos, you can try doing this. Users are attracted to videos that are eye-pleasing.

### 4\. Call of Duty: Warzone Battle Royale | RTX 3080 10GB ( 4K Maximum Settings Ray Tracing OFF )

![warzone thumbnail by gtx 1050 ti](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/warzone-thumbnail-4.JPG)

The thumbnail for this video (made by [GTX 1050 Ti](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fU9zMSBcius)), with 5.2 million views, is just an in-game screenshot. At the top-right is a large logo of GEFORCE RTX 3080 and at the bottom left is an Intel logo. Like the previous one, it attracts viewers by stating the visual appeal of the video.

### 5\. NEW RECORD! 64 KILL GAME in CoD WARZONE! (Best Classes / Loadouts)

![warzone thumbnail by vikkstar123](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/warzone-thumbnail-5.JPG)

Like most Warzone thumbnails, this thumbnail from a [Vikkstar123](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5VNeLLs2yM) video features a gun. At the top right is the victory banner, and at the bottom is the logo for kills with the number 64 next to it. The top right shows the logo of COD Warzone.

Players are attracted to amazing gameplay. Unsurprisingly, the player who got 64 kills got 3.1 million views in his video. The gist is that if you have achieved something amazing, try to incorporate it into the thumbnail.

## Conclusion

Using in-game screenshots is recommended for making amazing COD Warzone thumbnails. But you should not use raw photos. You must edit them to ensure they have visual appeal. Of course, that means you need a good thumbnail maker.

Your best option is Wondershare Filmora. Why? Because it is a thumbnail maker and video editing software in one. Also, it allows you to make thumbnails for free! What could be better than that?

The character is viewed through a sniper scope. It's more "funny" than cool. But for what the video is about, it works fantastic.

## Summary

That's how you create a tutorial video with Wondershare Filmora. Ensure you follow all the steps below to get perfect results.

Step1 Firstly, open Filmora on your computer. If you haven't already downloaded it you can get it at filmora.wondershare.com. Once you open Filmora, click "File" and "Record screen." Here you can adjust various options like recording your computer's audio or including your webcam.

![begin recording your tutorial](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-tutorial-video-3.jpg)

## Part 2\. Keep your intro short

Avoid adding any long intro monologues or skits to your tutorial. First, your goal is to be informative and entertaining. Second, it's always best to lead with a peek at what the final result of your tutorial will look like whether it's a video effect arts and crafts or a recipe video.

![keep your intro short](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-tutorial-video-4.jpg)

## Part 3\. Break down your tutorial into steps

No matter what your tutorial is about, breaking down your process into steps makes your tutorial a lot easier to understand with Filmora. You can do this in just a few minutes.

Step1 Move the playhead to where you want your first section to begin. Next, click the "Tittles" and pick a style that appeals to you.

![click the tittles](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-tutorial-video-5.gif)

Step2 Click and drag your title on a track above your footage.

![click and drag your title](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-tutorial-video-6.jpg)

Step3 Double-click your new title and type in your section title. You can even adjust the style of the text to your liking. Repeat the process for as many steps as you'd like for your tutorial

![type in your section title](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-tutorial-video-7.jpg)

## Part 4\. Narrate your video

Narration is a crucial part of making an effective tutorial video. Indeed, with Filmora adding narration to your video couldn't be easier.

Step1 Moving your playhead to the beginning of your video. Then go to file record media and record voiceover and select your microphone. The drop-down menu and click the red button, then simply narrate your video as it plays out. Your voice will automatically be recorded and placed into the project. Additionally, make sure to speak, reduce background noise, and use simple language

![go to file record media](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-tutorial-video-8.gif)

Step2 Once you're done recording, you can adjust the volume and further edit the voiceover by double-clicking the new audio file on your timeline.

![adjust the volume](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-tutorial-video-9.jpg)

## Part 5\. Emphasize important steps

Since you are working in a visual medium, emphasizing critical steps visually is very important. Here are some of the easiest and most effective ways to do that in Filmora

Step1 firstly, the freeze frame. Move your playhead to the frame you want to freeze, select your clip, go to tools speed, and click add freeze frame.

![click add freeze frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-tutorial-video-10.gif)

Step2 To adjust the length of your freeze, click "freeze frame." and enter any duration you want.

![click freeze frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-tutorial-video-11.gif)

Step3 Next is about to zoom the video. Double-click your clip and click on "Animation" and then "customize."

![zoom the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-tutorial-video-12.jpg)

Step4 Move your playhead to where you want the zoom to begin and click "Add" to add a keyframe. Then move your playhead where you want your zoom to finish and click "Add" again.

![click add to add a keyframe](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-tutorial-video-13.jpg)

Step5 Now, you have to double-click the clip in the preview window and move and resize it to your liking.

![double-click the clip in the preview window](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-tutorial-video-14.jpg)

Step6 You can also use the sliders in the animation tab to do this if you want.
