Brighter videos always attract more attention. Indeed, a well-lit video can make your content shine and bring out the best in your story. But what if you forgot to turn on the lights or the camera just couldn't handle the situation? We’ve all been there: you’re shooting a video, but there aren't enough light sources. You end up with dark footage. It’s impossible to share this on your social media accounts or with your friends and family.

There are many reasons why people want to brighten a dark video. Maybe you recorded a video with your phone, but the lighting was too dim in the room. Or maybe you were outside, and the sun was behind you, casting shadows on your face while recording. In these cases, it can be helpful to know how to make a dark video brighter.

There is a way to apply simple corrections using Premiere Pro, no matter the reason. In this article, I'll show you how to brighten your video in Premiere Pro so you can keep all the details in the highlights. This can be very useful if you're working with a lot of footage that has been underexposed, and sometimes your shot might look too dark or even black.

## Can I Brighten A Dark Video?

This is a common question that comes up among video editors, so I thought I'd answer it here. The quick answer is yes. There are many online tools that can help you brighten a dark video or adjust the brightness of your video. A lot of times, you'll get a video file that was shot in low light, and it will make your subject look dark and underexposed. Video brightness is an important feature that is easy to adjust. However, if your video is too dark to start off with, it may be difficult to brighten it in a way that doesn't look unnatural.

There are several ways you can brighten a dark video. For example, you can use color correction or add more light to the scene before you film. If you already have a dark video, then you'll need to adjust the contrast and brightness of your video during post-production. You can easily do this by using video editing software but keep in mind that too much brightness or too much contrast can result in poor video quality. So, you have to keep everything in balance.

## How to Brighten Video in Adobe Premiere Pro?

Adobe Premiere Pro is your one-stop solution for editing videos, whether you're editing a film or a TV ad. It gives you the flexibility to edit videos of any format. Adobe Premium makes brightening videos easy. Follow the steps below.

### Step 1

Launch Adobe Premiere Pro, open a project, and then import the video file you want to brighten. Make sure that the video file has been imported into the media library before you start editing it.

### Step 2

Next, click on the brightness and contrast option in the Effects panel, located at the bottom left of the software to adjust the brightness and contrast of your video.

![how to brigthen a video in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/premiere-pro-brighten-video-1.png)

### Step 3

Bring the brightness and contrast option to the center area below the uploaded video. You can do this by simply dragging it and dropping it beneath the video.

### Step 4

You can now easily increase the brightness by changing the brightness number in the effects control panel located to the right of the uploaded video.
