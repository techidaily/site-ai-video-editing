Let's understand the steps that go into this process here.

## 1\. Launch Filmora on your Device

On Filmora's official website, you can get the latest software version when you click on the Download button at the top or in the description box. After you do so, the free software will download automatically into your device in an installer format.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

From the Downloads section of your browser, double-click on it and press the Install button when it appears. Give the necessary permissions that it prompts.

![click on the download button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-1.jpg)

Then, the software will start the installation instantly, likely taking a few seconds to complete.

## 2\. Add the Default Title and Edit its Font

After Filmora launches, click on the "Create New Project" button on the homepage of the editor. Then, click on the Title tab from the top toolbar and choose the default title available here. Drag it and drop it onto the editing timeline below on Track 1.

Double-click on the title on the timeline, which will open the text editing window. Under the Text's Preset tab, you will find the parameters for changing the main fault. Adjust the font style to the Impact style (or any bold title style you prefer), and click on the text field to add your custom title.

Following that, click on the text size option and change it to 15\. Scroll down the menu to the Text Spacing section. Change the value to 20 and tap on the OK button afterward.

![change the value here to 20](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-2.jpg)

## 3\. Split the title

On the editing timeline, tap on the Track 1 clip and click on the Snapshot icon at the far right side of the toolbar just above the timeline. This will automatically save in the media library section.

Then, take hold of the playhead on the timeline at the 3rd frame mark. Then, tap on the Scissor icon on the play head, which will split the clip into two portions. Click on the part following the 3rd frame mark and delete it.

![split the clip into two portions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-3.jpg)

## 4\. Copy the clipped section multiple times

Then, double-click on the amount still available on the timeline to open the title editor section again. Make changes to the title you added here, only keeping the first letter.

Click on this clipped section on the timeline and copy it. Next, keep copying this clip multiple times continuously until the length of the collection on Track 1 to the 5-second mark.

Following that, zoom in on the timeline for a better view of these clipped parts. Choose the last clip that you copied and drag it to expand its time duration to the 6:15 mark.

![zoom in on the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-4.jpg)

## 5\. Change the character of each clip

After making the previous edits, use your cursor to move to the first part of the timeline instead of zooming outward. Tap on the first clip that you had edited and double-click on it. In the text editing window, change the character to another random alphabet.

![change the character](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-5.jpg)

Repeat the same for all the split parts following the first one, changing the character to any random alphabet. At this time, ensure that you do not make two consecutive letters have the same alphabet, as that will put off the effect. However, keep the last elongated clip the same character as you originally put it.

## 6\. Export the first letter clip

Then, please tap on the Export button at the top of the screen and add a name, like the first letter of your title. Click on the Settings button on this page to adjust the resolution and quality of the clip to the highest resolution for the best results.

Press Export again to save it to your device.

## 7\. Edit the second letter clip and so on

After exporting the first file that will ultimately become the first letter of your random letter reveal intro title, you have to make the second letter-related clip.

For this, tap on the last clip on the timeline and double-click on it. Change the text in this clip to the second letter of your title. After doing this, go back to the first clip of your collection and double-click on it after selling it. Tap on the text field and give it another random letter.

![tap on the text field](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-6.jpg)

Like with the first clip, continue doing this step for all of the next clips, except for the final clip. Then, export it in the same manner as the first clip.

Now that you know how to edit the first and second letters in sequence, repeat this process for all of the letters of your title to create a full clip for all of the intro title letters. When you are done, please select these clips and press the Delete button to remove them from the timeline.

![select all of these clips and press delete](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-7.jpg)

## 8\. Add all clips back to Filmora

Now it's time to add all of the clips to Filmora and merge them into one cohesive intro title.

For this, click on My Media and go to Project Media. Right-click on the library section and press the Import button. This will take you to your device storage. Find the location where you saved all cut clips, and select them all. Press the Open button, and all of them will import into Filmora.

![press the open button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-8.jpg)

## 9\. Drag the Snapshot to Timeline

Tap on the Snapshot you saved earlier sitting on the media library and drag it onto the Track 1 of the editing timeline. Double-click on it to open the video editing window.

Click on the Opacity option in the Video editing section and change it to 20%. Press the OK button after that.

![click on the opacity option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-9.jpg)

## 10\. Drop the Clip into the Timeline

Select the first letter clip from the media library section and drag it onto the timeline. Drop it above the Snapshot in Track 2 part. Then, choose the first Snapshot clip and increase its duration to the 8-second mark.

Next, double-click on the first letter clip on the Track 2 section to open its editing window. Click on the Blending Mode option and choose Screen from the drop-down menu.

![click on blending mode and choose screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-10.jpg)

Then, right-click on the first letter clip in the timeline and choose the Copy Effects option from the next drop-down menu. Move the playhead to the ending position on the timeline and change the value on the relevant axis of Position until it matches its letter position on the original title.

See the preview playing on the side for a better reference while adjusting the position.

## 11\. Drop the next clips

Following this, click on the second letter clip and drag and drop it onto Track 3 on the timeline. Make sure to move the playhead to mark the starting position of this letter at the 5th frame mark.

Tap on this clip and move your playhead to the end position. Then, right-click on it and choose the Paste Effects option. Double-click on this clip on the timeline and change the position axis value until the letter aligns with its original position per the snapshot. Again, look at the Preview to ensure you align them correctly.

![look at the preview to align clips correctly](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-11.jpg)

Repeat this with all the other letters, making sure to change the starting position for each consecutive one-two frame forward.

## 12\. Hide and elongate each clip with snapshots

Then, click on the Snapshot clip on Track 1 and delete it. Following that, click the Hide icon on Track 3, Track 4, and onwards till the last one. Then, move the playhead to the end of the Track 2 clip and click on the Snapshot icon.

Choose the saved snapshot in the library window and drag-and-drop it behind Track 2 clip so it continues into it. Double-click on this Snapshot and choose Screen under Blending Mode. Then, right-click on this Snapshot and select "Copy Effects" from the menu.

![choose copy effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-12.jpg)

Then, hide the Track 2 clip, unhide the Track 3 and Track 4 clip, and take a snapshot of that. As you did with Track 1's screenshot, take this snapshot and place it beside Track 3 clip. Right-click on it and tap on "Paste Effects". Repeat this one by one for all the clips after unhiding them for their particular step.

## 13\. Finishing touches to Opacity

Finally, unhide all the clips and move the playhead to the 8-second mark. Click on the Scissor icon to Split them all at this position and remove the excess. Then, place the playhead at the beginning of Track 3 and double-click on it. Tap the Animation tab this time and adjust the Opacity to 0\. Then, move the playhead ten frames forward and increase the Opacity to 100\. Repeat this for all of the steps.

![adjust opacity to 0](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-13.jpg)

## 14\. Preview and Export

After everything, tap on the Render Preview icon. Make sure to move the second clip on Track 2 as the starting point of the video by moving it to the beginning position. Now, press the Play button under the Preview player.

![press the play button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-14.jpg)

## Conclusion

Finally, you are ready to use the same tactics as explained to optimize the quality and style of your video introduction title. Besides this, you can utilize other preset title options on video projects via Filmora. Try out multiple options and practice this particular approach on different video projects. Then, prepare stunning, visually captivating movies, vlogs, and documentaries quickly.
