Do you want to edit a time lapse video on an iPhone or want to know how to shoot a time-lapse video? If so, you've come to the right place.

Time-lapses, which show how much something changes over a period of time are some of the coolest videos you can make.

They aren't exactly easy to make and edit at first, but we've put together this guide to take you through the steps. We'll give you a few time lapse video ideas, steps to shoot them, and good practices for managing your footage after you've shot it.

Let’s get started.

## What Is A Time Lapse Video?

In its simplest definition, a time lapse video is a cinematography technique where the frequency at which film frames are captured (the frame rate) is much lower than that used to view the sequence.

When played at normal speed, time appears to be moving faster and thus lapsing. For example, an image of a scene may be captured once every second, then played back at 30 frames per second; the result is an apparent 30 times speed increase.

Time-lapse photography can be considered to be the opposite of slow motion.

## How to Shoot A Time-Lapse Video?

### Subjects to shoot in a time-lapse video

Wondering what can be shot in a time-lapse video? The answer is any subject that moves, grows, decays, or changes. But what's more important than the subject is the motion and change that it goes through.

When shooting a time-lapse video, you are composing not only the shot but also the movement of the subject. If a subject doesn't move or change throughout your film, then it is just a regular video. So try to think of subjects that are constantly moving or changing.

Time-Lapse videos are visually appealing and easy to make. When it comes to subjects that can be chosen to shoot in a time-lapse video, the possibilities are endless. But if you’re stuck for ideas, here are 10 suggestions to get you started:

#### 1\. Sunset/Sunrise

These are quite possibly the most common subjects for timelapse videos, but there’s a reason for it! Watching the sun go up and down is always mesmerizing.

#### 2\. Clouds

Clouds move very slowly most of the time, making them perfect for time-lapse sequences. You can shoot a single cloud passing overhead, or record a passing storm front as it sweeps across the sky. Depending on the weather conditions and movement of clouds, this can look stunning or simply spectacular!

#### 3\. Starry sky

Probably one of the most fascinating time lapse videos is the ones with stars on the move. Time-lapses that capture the Milky Way or starry sky are becoming increasingly popular as camera technology improves. There are even some cameras now that have built-in settings specifically for capturing stars and other celestial bodies.

#### 4\. Flowers

Flowers blooming is another fantastic subject for time-lapse photography. The change can be incredibly subtle; however, if you shoot a timelapse over several days or weeks, you will be amazed at just how much they grow and change!

#### 5\. Season changing

The most obvious example is trees budding and shedding leaves, but all sorts of plants and animals follow seasonal cycles. You can see flowers blooming, grasses growing, and migrating birds. Even if you don't have a chance to go somewhere exotic for your subject matter, you can find something interesting right outside your own door.

#### 6\. Cars or Pedestrians

If you want something a little more exciting then you can choose things like cars passing by or people walking on the street.

#### 7\. Cooking dinner

Got a recipe for dinner that has lots of steps? Rather than just snap photos of the process, why not make a time-lapse video instead? It's easy and fun to do, especially if you have kids who can help you out!

#### 8\. DIY projects

Are you building something? Whether it's a new table, shelves, or whatever else, set up your camera and take photos as you go along in a time lapse mode and you’ll get a fun time lapse video. It works well to show people how it all came together.

#### 9\. Construction work in progress

If you're watching construction work being done on your property or nearby, consider recording its time lapse video. It's hard to imagine the amount of resources it takes to construct an office building or skyscraper before it's finished. Time-lapse videos have helped reveal just how much work goes into something like that.

#### 10\. A fun art project

Capturing a time lapse video of an art project can make a mesmerizing video. Whether it’s you or someone else doing the artwork, always capture its time lapse video to show to others what goes into completing an art project. All you need to do is to set your camera up on a tripod aimed at the canvas and capture one or two frames per second to get an excellent time lapse video.

### Steps to shoot a time-lapse video

Time-lapse videography is something that most photographers and videographers are familiar with. But, shooting a time-lapse video needs more than setting the camera on a tripod and waiting for it to shoot for several hours.

The amazing thing about time-lapse videos is that they can be shot using your smartphone. There are apps and built-in camera settings to capture time lapse videos with just a click of the button.

If you want to create a time-lapse video that is high quality, you have to use professional cameras, and learn some important steps.

#### 1\. Decide on a subject

The movement of clouds, a sunrise or sunset, waves crashing at the beach, cars coming and going in your parking lot, people walking around your office building — all of these subjects can yield great time-lapse sequences.

#### 2\. Find a place to set up your camera on tripod

While recording a time-lapse video, it’s important to keep the camera as stable as possible. It ensures a smooth video, making it visually appealing and easy to edit post-shooting. Typically, a tripod is needed for stable recording. If you are not using a tripod, find something steady and level to set it upon.

_Important tip: Shoot only with manual settings. You don't want the camera to adjust for you; rather, you should adjust the camera settings so that it takes optimal pictures. Even if you use auto mode, make sure you take control of the camera and push it to its limits to get great shots._

#### 3\. Set the camera focus

Use either autofocus or manual focus to make sure the camera is focused on what you want to be the main subject of the video.

#### 4\. Set your exposure settings

Depending on how much the light is going to change over time, you may want to use aperture priority or shutter priority so that the camera will automatically adjust for changes in light. Or, if you know exactly how much light will be changing over time, you could set all exposure settings manually.

#### 5\. Calculate how many frames and shots are needed

For example, if you are shooting at 10 frames per second and want a total of 30 seconds of video at 24 fps (which is standard), you will need 720 frames/photos (30 seconds x 24 fps = 720 frames).

#### 6\. Import and stitch together

Once you’ve captured the images, import them into a video editing software, stitch them together, and perform necessary editing.

## How to Edit The Time Lapse on iPhone?

Now that you’ve recorded a time-lapse video, you might watch it and think it’s slower or faster than you want it to be. Fortunately, you can speed up and slow down the time lapse video on iPhone using iMovie.

Let’s see how to slow down time lapse on iPhone iMovie.

### 1\. Speed up The Time Lapse on iPhone

So you've taken a time lapse video on your iPhone and now you're trying to get it to speed up in iMovie but it looks a little jumpy or there is too much footage. Here's how to do it in iMovie for iOS.

* Launch iMovie on your iPhone and start a new project to speed up the captured time-lapse video.
* Now, tap the **plus sign** visible at the start of the Projects screen, then select **Movie**.

## Advanced Software: Edit A Time Lapse Video in Wondershare Filmora

If you have professionally captured RAW images of the time-lapse video, you need to use advanced software to stitch them together. That’s where Wondershare Filmora comes into play.

Wondershare Filmore is a professional video editing software with a wide variety of basic to advanced-level editing tools. It allows for turning RAW videos into fun, engaging, and professional videos.

If you need to refine your time-lapse video, you can use it and benefit from its capabilities. Similarly, you can use it to speed up or slow down your time-lapse video.

Let’s see how you can do both with Filmora.

### Speed up your time-lapse video

Why speed up a time-lapse in the first place? There are a couple of reasons you might want to speed up your time-lapse.

When shooting with a fast lens, you might want to dial down the shutter speed to achieve more motion blur, to make the scenes more interesting. However, doing so can also create motion blur on time-lapse footage when sped up.

Another reason you might want to speed up your time-lapse is when you have too many frames. When you shoot at low frame rate (e.g. 15 FPS), not everyone will experience the same viewing quality if they don’t have high frame rate monitors. Speeding up the footage is one way to reduce the number of frames without compromising the quality of your video.

Follow these steps to speed up the time-lapse video using Filmora:

* Download and install Wondershare Filmora on your computer.
* Launch Filmora and click the **New project** button to open the video editor or drag and drop the file directly.

![tap the New Project button and open the Video Editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/11-step-by-step-guide-how-to-edit-a-time-lapse-video-on-iphone.png)

* Once imported, drag the file to the timeline.

![drag the media file to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/12-step-by-step-guide-how-to-edit-a-time-lapse-video-on-iphone.png)

* Click the **Speed** icon and select the **Fast** option. Select 2x, 4x, 8x, etc, depending on how much you want to speed up.

![tap the Speed button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/13-step-by-step-guide-how-to-edit-a-time-lapse-video-on-iphone.png)

* Save the file and use it the way you want.

### Slow down your time-lapse video

As the speed at which your time-lapse moves increases, so does the amount of motion blur. This can make for an undesirable look, especially in shots where there is already a lot of movement.

The best way to avoid this is to slow down your time-lapse as much as possible while still maintaining an interesting level of movement within your shot.

You can slow down your time-lapse video in Filmora following the same process as you’d do for speeding-up the video (Explained above). However, there’s only one catch; instead of opting for the **Fast** option choose **Slow** when you’re at step 4.

## Conclusion

Hopefully, this guide has provided a good knowledge of how to put together your own time lapse video – and how to edit it on iPhone and Wondershare Filmora. It's easier than you may think, and the resulting videos are quite impressive.

Take your time with it, record your movies from different angles, and don't be afraid to create something unique and experimental.

As the speed at which your time-lapse moves increases, so does the amount of motion blur. This can make for an undesirable look, especially in shots where there is already a lot of movement.

The best way to avoid this is to slow down your time-lapse as much as possible while still maintaining an interesting level of movement within your shot.

You can slow down your time-lapse video in Filmora following the same process as you’d do for speeding-up the video (Explained above). However, there’s only one catch; instead of opting for the **Fast** option choose **Slow** when you’re at step 4.

## Conclusion

Hopefully, this guide has provided a good knowledge of how to put together your own time lapse video – and how to edit it on iPhone and Wondershare Filmora. It's easier than you may think, and the resulting videos are quite impressive.

Take your time with it, record your movies from different angles, and don't be afraid to create something unique and experimental.

Do you want to edit a time lapse video on an iPhone or want to know how to shoot a time-lapse video? If so, you've come to the right place.

Time-lapses, which show how much something changes over a period of time are some of the coolest videos you can make.

They aren't exactly easy to make and edit at first, but we've put together this guide to take you through the steps. We'll give you a few time lapse video ideas, steps to shoot them, and good practices for managing your footage after you've shot it.

Let’s get started.

## What Is A Time Lapse Video?

In its simplest definition, a time lapse video is a cinematography technique where the frequency at which film frames are captured (the frame rate) is much lower than that used to view the sequence.

When played at normal speed, time appears to be moving faster and thus lapsing. For example, an image of a scene may be captured once every second, then played back at 30 frames per second; the result is an apparent 30 times speed increase.

Time-lapse photography can be considered to be the opposite of slow motion.

## How to Shoot A Time-Lapse Video?

### Subjects to shoot in a time-lapse video

Wondering what can be shot in a time-lapse video? The answer is any subject that moves, grows, decays, or changes. But what's more important than the subject is the motion and change that it goes through.

When shooting a time-lapse video, you are composing not only the shot but also the movement of the subject. If a subject doesn't move or change throughout your film, then it is just a regular video. So try to think of subjects that are constantly moving or changing.

Time-Lapse videos are visually appealing and easy to make. When it comes to subjects that can be chosen to shoot in a time-lapse video, the possibilities are endless. But if you’re stuck for ideas, here are 10 suggestions to get you started:

#### 1\. Sunset/Sunrise

These are quite possibly the most common subjects for timelapse videos, but there’s a reason for it! Watching the sun go up and down is always mesmerizing.

#### 2\. Clouds

Clouds move very slowly most of the time, making them perfect for time-lapse sequences. You can shoot a single cloud passing overhead, or record a passing storm front as it sweeps across the sky. Depending on the weather conditions and movement of clouds, this can look stunning or simply spectacular!

#### 3\. Starry sky

Probably one of the most fascinating time lapse videos is the ones with stars on the move. Time-lapses that capture the Milky Way or starry sky are becoming increasingly popular as camera technology improves. There are even some cameras now that have built-in settings specifically for capturing stars and other celestial bodies.

#### 4\. Flowers

Flowers blooming is another fantastic subject for time-lapse photography. The change can be incredibly subtle; however, if you shoot a timelapse over several days or weeks, you will be amazed at just how much they grow and change!

#### 5\. Season changing

The most obvious example is trees budding and shedding leaves, but all sorts of plants and animals follow seasonal cycles. You can see flowers blooming, grasses growing, and migrating birds. Even if you don't have a chance to go somewhere exotic for your subject matter, you can find something interesting right outside your own door.

#### 6\. Cars or Pedestrians

If you want something a little more exciting then you can choose things like cars passing by or people walking on the street.

#### 7\. Cooking dinner

Got a recipe for dinner that has lots of steps? Rather than just snap photos of the process, why not make a time-lapse video instead? It's easy and fun to do, especially if you have kids who can help you out!

#### 8\. DIY projects

Are you building something? Whether it's a new table, shelves, or whatever else, set up your camera and take photos as you go along in a time lapse mode and you’ll get a fun time lapse video. It works well to show people how it all came together.

#### 9\. Construction work in progress

If you're watching construction work being done on your property or nearby, consider recording its time lapse video. It's hard to imagine the amount of resources it takes to construct an office building or skyscraper before it's finished. Time-lapse videos have helped reveal just how much work goes into something like that.

#### 10\. A fun art project

Capturing a time lapse video of an art project can make a mesmerizing video. Whether it’s you or someone else doing the artwork, always capture its time lapse video to show to others what goes into completing an art project. All you need to do is to set your camera up on a tripod aimed at the canvas and capture one or two frames per second to get an excellent time lapse video.

### Steps to shoot a time-lapse video

Time-lapse videography is something that most photographers and videographers are familiar with. But, shooting a time-lapse video needs more than setting the camera on a tripod and waiting for it to shoot for several hours.

The amazing thing about time-lapse videos is that they can be shot using your smartphone. There are apps and built-in camera settings to capture time lapse videos with just a click of the button.

If you want to create a time-lapse video that is high quality, you have to use professional cameras, and learn some important steps.

#### 1\. Decide on a subject

The movement of clouds, a sunrise or sunset, waves crashing at the beach, cars coming and going in your parking lot, people walking around your office building — all of these subjects can yield great time-lapse sequences.

#### 2\. Find a place to set up your camera on tripod

While recording a time-lapse video, it’s important to keep the camera as stable as possible. It ensures a smooth video, making it visually appealing and easy to edit post-shooting. Typically, a tripod is needed for stable recording. If you are not using a tripod, find something steady and level to set it upon.

_Important tip: Shoot only with manual settings. You don't want the camera to adjust for you; rather, you should adjust the camera settings so that it takes optimal pictures. Even if you use auto mode, make sure you take control of the camera and push it to its limits to get great shots._

#### 3\. Set the camera focus

Use either autofocus or manual focus to make sure the camera is focused on what you want to be the main subject of the video.

#### 4\. Set your exposure settings

Depending on how much the light is going to change over time, you may want to use aperture priority or shutter priority so that the camera will automatically adjust for changes in light. Or, if you know exactly how much light will be changing over time, you could set all exposure settings manually.

#### 5\. Calculate how many frames and shots are needed

For example, if you are shooting at 10 frames per second and want a total of 30 seconds of video at 24 fps (which is standard), you will need 720 frames/photos (30 seconds x 24 fps = 720 frames).

#### 6\. Import and stitch together

Once you’ve captured the images, import them into a video editing software, stitch them together, and perform necessary editing.

## How to Edit The Time Lapse on iPhone?

## Advanced Software: Edit A Time Lapse Video in Wondershare Filmora

If you have professionally captured RAW images of the time-lapse video, you need to use advanced software to stitch them together. That’s where Wondershare Filmora comes into play.

Wondershare Filmore is a professional video editing software with a wide variety of basic to advanced-level editing tools. It allows for turning RAW videos into fun, engaging, and professional videos.

If you need to refine your time-lapse video, you can use it and benefit from its capabilities. Similarly, you can use it to speed up or slow down your time-lapse video.

Let’s see how you can do both with Filmora.

### Speed up your time-lapse video

Why speed up a time-lapse in the first place? There are a couple of reasons you might want to speed up your time-lapse.

When shooting with a fast lens, you might want to dial down the shutter speed to achieve more motion blur, to make the scenes more interesting. However, doing so can also create motion blur on time-lapse footage when sped up.

Another reason you might want to speed up your time-lapse is when you have too many frames. When you shoot at low frame rate (e.g. 15 FPS), not everyone will experience the same viewing quality if they don’t have high frame rate monitors. Speeding up the footage is one way to reduce the number of frames without compromising the quality of your video.

Follow these steps to speed up the time-lapse video using Filmora:

* Download and install Wondershare Filmora on your computer.
* Launch Filmora and click the **New project** button to open the video editor or drag and drop the file directly.

![tap the New Project button and open the Video Editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/11-step-by-step-guide-how-to-edit-a-time-lapse-video-on-iphone.png)

* Once imported, drag the file to the timeline.

![drag the media file to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/12-step-by-step-guide-how-to-edit-a-time-lapse-video-on-iphone.png)

* Click the **Speed** icon and select the **Fast** option. Select 2x, 4x, 8x, etc, depending on how much you want to speed up.

![tap the Speed button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/13-step-by-step-guide-how-to-edit-a-time-lapse-video-on-iphone.png)

### Slow down your time-lapse video

As the speed at which your time-lapse moves increases, so does the amount of motion blur. This can make for an undesirable look, especially in shots where there is already a lot of movement.

The best way to avoid this is to slow down your time-lapse as much as possible while still maintaining an interesting level of movement within your shot.

You can slow down your time-lapse video in Filmora following the same process as you’d do for speeding-up the video (Explained above). However, there’s only one catch; instead of opting for the **Fast** option choose **Slow** when you’re at step 4.

## Conclusion

Hopefully, this guide has provided a good knowledge of how to put together your own time lapse video – and how to edit it on iPhone and Wondershare Filmora. It's easier than you may think, and the resulting videos are quite impressive.

Take your time with it, record your movies from different angles, and don't be afraid to create something unique and experimental.

## Guide to Synchronizing Your Audio And Videos Properly?

Video quality and engagement are prone to impact badly if your audio is not synchronized with the video. This can happen because of technical issues or frame rate mismatches. In case you somehow get unsynchronized audio in the video, you need to use a reliable video editor to cater to this issue. To help you with this issue, this article will provide the best-in-class video editor named Wondershare Filmora.

Along with the auto beat sync feature, we will also discuss some online alternatives that will assist you in syncing audio while online.

## Part 1: Why Should You Synchronize Your Audio And Videos in Video Editing?

Audio and video synchronization is important for presenting a good quality viewing experience. Here are the main reasons you shouldn’t neglect this in your audio and video.

### Lip Sync and Narrative Flow

Synchronizing audio and video is crucial to maintaining the film's narrative flow. Well-synchronized audio and video offer a very smooth experience to the viewers. If the lips and dialogue flow are not well maintained, it can cause distraction in the storytelling. As a result, the real message won't be conveyed to the viewers.

### Viewer Engagement

Do you wish to ensure that your viewers pay full attention to your video and that your message is well conveyed? Your video quality and sound matter the most for the best experience. When the audio and video are well-synced, the viewers pay attention to the content. They are not distracted due to the bad quality of the video.

### Value of Quality Production

A high-quality video with perfect sound quality and proper syncing builds a good perception. If the video quality is bad or does not have proper sync, it can leave a bad impression. Therefore, to enhance the impact of these emotional and dramatic effects, it is imperative to focus on these core things.

### Professionalism and Quality

To make your viewer experience outstanding, focus on paying attention to details. A good quality video represents your professionalism and the standards of your production. When it is synchronized, the viewer will always see this as a high-quality creation.

You might ask how do we use the eyedropper tool here. It can sample colors from anywhere in a video or an image and add them to your swatch panel. The steps to use the eyedropper tool to add a selective color to your video are below.

Step1 As same as the first one, launching Wondershare Filmora is the first priority. And drag your clip to the timeline.

Step6 Next, try selecting a second color to isolate within our shot. In this example, we are going to make the stems on the flowers stand out as well. Select second color and go to the tint section. And find a color that is close to the second color, which will be green in this case.

![clicking on the second color](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/add-selective-color-effect-to-videos-15.jpg)

Step6 Next, try selecting a second color to isolate within our shot. In this example, we are going to make the stems on the flowers stand out as well. Select second color and go to the tint section. And find a color that is close to the second color, which will be green in this case.

![clicking on the second color](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/add-selective-color-effect-to-videos-15.jpg)

The software lets us to log and transfer videos onto a hard drive, where it can be edited, processed, and output to a wide variety of formats. Final Cut Pro is so advanced that it is used by hobbyist filmmakers and industry professionals in TV, Film, and media. Anyone can get a free trial of the software for their Macs, but, to purchase directly from the Mac App Store it costs $299.99\.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-1.jpeg)

What are the features this advanced computer program offers to Mac users? – itreads on the web-site of Final Cut Pro:

But, one should not be alarmed when it comes to experience and knowledge in editing – even though Final Cut Pro seems so advanced with its powerful tools and the possibilities it contains, it is designed for easy use and can be used by amateurs as well as professionals.

The interface, which, when it comes to editing, is one of the most important aspects (if not the main one!), seems quite standard - an ordinary window configuration, sidebar with libraries, events, projects, collections… If you want to know more about the basics of Final Cut Pro, it would be helpful to watch a [beginner tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygBlgaT78mM), with the length of only 20 minutes, an introduction of the whole program.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-2.jpeg)

Anyway, the main topic of this article is about cropping – how to crop a video in Final Cut Pro? If you are a Mac user and have this program installed on your computer, and you as well have a footage where you want to remove some portions of the video and adjust the size of the cropped clip within a certain area, this article is for you. Even though cropping is especially used when it comes to the images, it is extremely helpful in certain situations about the video clips, as well. So, let’s dive into each step of cropping in Final Cut Pro!

## Steps to crop a video in Final Cut Pro

After getting Final Cut Pro ready to work in and opening it, you need to start as always, as in any other software: Of course, choose Import Media.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-3.jpeg)

The software will ask your permission to access files in your computer, so, in order to import some, guess you have to click on OK.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-4.jpeg)

Then, it will let you choose your file – but not by opening the new window (as in most cases), rather, you can choose file within the software.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-5.jpeg)

Once you have your file(s) chosen, you need to find Import Selected button on the down and right.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-6.jpeg)

This will lead you towards the editor again, but if you try to drag and drop your file into the sequence, the program will not follow this simple order…

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-7.jpeg)

This is because what the window below reads and looks like – it offers you create a New Project first. So, you need to hit it.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-8.jpeg)

This will create the sequence where you can add the video you have already selected and imported from your media.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-9.jpeg)

Now, it’s time to find where the cropping option is. It’s quite simple – look at the icon below and a little left of the screen where your video clip shows, click on it and you will see three options: Transform, Crop, and Distort. Needless to say, you will choose crop in this case, even if other options sound quite interesting, too!

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-10.jpeg)

Choosing Crop also gives you three options: Trim, Crop, and Ken Burns. Stick with the Crop again!

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-11.jpeg)

You will notice the kind of rulers on the angles of the video clip – they are there so you can crop your footage manually, by holding and moving them with your cursor to your liking.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-12.jpeg)

Of course, if you direct your cursor in the middle of the cropped video, you can move the whole cropping window around it, so you can find the area where you intend to crop better.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-13.jpeg)

And when the selected area is ready, you need to click on Done button on the right top side of the screen. If you are not satisfied with the result, you can take the step back, by clicking on Reset button right next to Done and modify the area again.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-14.jpeg)

On the right side of the screen, you notice a window where Crop is also written. Alongside it, if you hover over the option with your mouse, you will see the word: Show. Clicking on it will let you crop the video from each side from there, too.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-15.jpeg)

There, you can “play around” with Left, Right, Top, and Bottom sides.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-16.jpeg)

In the process, if you are unsure or you want to compare the original video to the cropped version of it, keep in mind that you can uncheck the Crop button.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-17.jpeg)

Finally, when you feel the result is what you have imagined, you can proceed to saving your work. For it to be done, you need to now find an Export button top right of the whole editor, and then, choose Export File (or else, if that’s what you are willing to do).

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-18.jpeg)

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-19.jpeg)

The next step would be Export Settings. You will see a new window which has three sections: Info, Settings, and Roles. The most important one here would be considered Settings, where you choose your preferred Format, Video Codec, Resolution, Color Space, Audio Format, and Action.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-20.jpeg)

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-21.jpeg)

 When you click on Next, you then choose the Name of your project and the location where you want to save it exactly.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-22.jpeg)

Then you click on Save, and in a short amount of time, you have your new cropped video where you chose to save it! So, that’s it with cropping in the Final Cut Pro!

The interface, which, when it comes to editing, is one of the most important aspects (if not the main one!), seems quite standard - an ordinary window configuration, sidebar with libraries, events, projects, collections… If you want to know more about the basics of Final Cut Pro, it would be helpful to watch a [beginner tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygBlgaT78mM), with the length of only 20 minutes, an introduction of the whole program.

So, let’s dive into each step of cropping in Final Cut Pro!

## Steps to crop a video in Final Cut Pro

After getting Final Cut Pro ready to work in and opening it, you need to start as always, as in any other software: Of course, choose Import Media.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-3.jpeg)

The software will ask your permission to access files in your computer, so, in order to import some, guess you have to click on OK.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-4.jpeg)

Then, it will let you choose your file – but not by opening the new window (as in most cases), rather, you can choose file within the software.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-5.jpeg)

Once you have your file(s) chosen, you need to find Import Selected button on the down and right.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-6.jpeg)

This will lead you towards the editor again, but if you try to drag and drop your file into the sequence, the program will not follow this simple order…

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-7.jpeg)

This is because what the window below reads and looks like – it offers you create a New Project first. So, you need to hit it.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-8.jpeg)

This will create the sequence where you can add the video you have already selected and imported from your media.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-9.jpeg)

Now, it’s time to find where the cropping option is. It’s quite simple – look at the icon below and a little left of the screen where your video clip shows, click on it and you will see three options: Transform, Crop, and Distort. Needless to say, you will choose crop in this case, even if other options sound quite interesting, too!

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-10.jpeg)

Choosing Crop also gives you three options: Trim, Crop, and Ken Burns. Stick with the Crop again!

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-11.jpeg)

You will notice the kind of rulers on the angles of the video clip – they are there so you can crop your footage manually, by holding and moving them with your cursor to your liking.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-12.jpeg)

Of course, if you direct your cursor in the middle of the cropped video, you can move the whole cropping window around it, so you can find the area where you intend to crop better.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-13.jpeg)

And when the selected area is ready, you need to click on Done button on the right top side of the screen. If you are not satisfied with the result, you can take the step back, by clicking on Reset button right next to Done and modify the area again.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-14.jpeg)

On the right side of the screen, you notice a window where Crop is also written. Alongside it, if you hover over the option with your mouse, you will see the word: Show. Clicking on it will let you crop the video from each side from there, too.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-15.jpeg)

There, you can “play around” with Left, Right, Top, and Bottom sides.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-16.jpeg)

In the process, if you are unsure or you want to compare the original video to the cropped version of it, keep in mind that you can uncheck the Crop button.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-17.jpeg)

Finally, when you feel the result is what you have imagined, you can proceed to saving your work. For it to be done, you need to now find an Export button top right of the whole editor, and then, choose Export File (or else, if that’s what you are willing to do).

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-18.jpeg)

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-19.jpeg)

The next step would be Export Settings. You will see a new window which has three sections: Info, Settings, and Roles. The most important one here would be considered Settings, where you choose your preferred Format, Video Codec, Resolution, Color Space, Audio Format, and Action.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-20.jpeg)

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-21.jpeg)

 When you click on Next, you then choose the Name of your project and the location where you want to save it exactly.

![crop-video-final-cut](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-22.jpeg)

Then you click on Save, and in a short amount of time, you have your new cropped video where you chose to save it! So, that’s it with cropping in the Final Cut Pro!
