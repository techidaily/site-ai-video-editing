![slow mo feature](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-convert-slow-motion-video-to-normal-1.jpg)

But do you ever feel like converting the slow-motion video in your iOS device to a normal video? Perhaps you thought the slow-mo video would be more attractive, but it's not, or maybe you want to determine how to remove slow-motion from a video iPhone.

No matter the reason, there are numerous ways to remove slow motion from iPhone video. In this article, you'll learn the various methods to convert slow-motion video into a regular video on your iPhone or iPad. Also, learn the steps involved in achieving it.

So, let's start.

## How To Convert Slow Motion Video to Normal on iPhone and iPad

Due to the slow-motion and Time-lapse modes that are built into the iPhone, people may quickly record slo-mo and time-lapse clips using their iOS smartphone cameras.

Access the iPhone camera, select Slo-mo, press the Record icon once to begin filming, and then press it once more to stop. This will create a slo-mo video.

Do you ever wish to get your video's slow motion removed? How to convert slow-motion video to normal on an iPhone? Well, here's your answer.

### Method 1\. Using the Photos App

The Photos app is an in-built app for iPhone and iPad that features editing capabilities like rotation, resizing, and auto-enhancement, in addition to helping you manage videos and images.

![using the photos app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-convert-slow-motion-video-to-normal-2.jpg)

You may quickly and effortlessly turn a slow-mo video into a regular-speed one with the Photos app's tucked-away slow-motion converter feature. Additionally, there won't be any quality loss in your video.

And here are the steps on how to remove slow-mo from iPhone video using the Photos app on an iPad or iPhone to turn it to normal speed.

Step1: Take your iPad or iPhone, navigate to the Photos app, open it, and then go to the bottom to hit the Albums tab.

Step2: Choose the Slo-mo option, and subsequently select the video you wish to turn into a regular speed video. Go to the top right corner of the screen and hit the Edit button.

![select the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-convert-slow-motion-video-to-normal-3.jpg)

![find vertical lines](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-convert-slow-motion-video-to-normal-4.jpg)

Step4: To learn how to remove slow mo from iPhone video is to learn how to turn it into regular speed. To do so, select the slow-motion bar and drag it towards the other one to position the lines at a close distance.

#### Editing Tip

* The Photos app on iPhone doesn't allow you to convert any video shot at 24fps or 30fps to slow motion.
* You cannot reduce or decrease the overall size of the video after conversion.

#### Pros & Cons

 Pros

* It is a built-in app on every iOS device.
* Saves the hassle of downloading any third-party app.
