Double-click on the title on the timeline, which will open the text editing window. Under the Text's Preset tab, you will find the parameters for changing the main fault. Adjust the font style to the Impact style (or any bold title style you prefer), and click on the text field to add your custom title.

## 4\. Copy the clipped section multiple times

Then, double-click on the amount still available on the timeline to open the title editor section again. Make changes to the title you added here, only keeping the first letter.

Click on this clipped section on the timeline and copy it. Next, keep copying this clip multiple times continuously until the length of the collection on Track 1 to the 5-second mark.

Following that, zoom in on the timeline for a better view of these clipped parts. Choose the last clip that you copied and drag it to expand its time duration to the 6:15 mark.

![zoom in on the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-4.jpg)

## 5\. Change the character of each clip

After making the previous edits, use your cursor to move to the first part of the timeline instead of zooming outward. Tap on the first clip that you had edited and double-click on it. In the text editing window, change the character to another random alphabet.

![change the character](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-5.jpg)

Repeat the same for all the split parts following the first one, changing the character to any random alphabet. At this time, ensure that you do not make two consecutive letters have the same alphabet, as that will put off the effect. However, keep the last elongated clip the same character as you originally put it.

## 6\. Export the first letter clip

## 7\. Edit the second letter clip and so on

After exporting the first file that will ultimately become the first letter of your random letter reveal intro title, you have to make the second letter-related clip.

For this, tap on the last clip on the timeline and double-click on it. Change the text in this clip to the second letter of your title. After doing this, go back to the first clip of your collection and double-click on it after selling it. Tap on the text field and give it another random letter.

![tap on the text field](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-6.jpg)

Like with the first clip, continue doing this step for all of the next clips, except for the final clip. Then, export it in the same manner as the first clip.

Now that you know how to edit the first and second letters in sequence, repeat this process for all of the letters of your title to create a full clip for all of the intro title letters. When you are done, please select these clips and press the Delete button to remove them from the timeline.

![select all of these clips and press delete](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-7.jpg)

![click on the opacity option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-9.jpg)

## 10\. Drop the Clip into the Timeline

Select the first letter clip from the media library section and drag it onto the timeline. Drop it above the Snapshot in Track 2 part. Then, choose the first Snapshot clip and increase its duration to the 8-second mark.

Next, double-click on the first letter clip on the Track 2 section to open its editing window. Click on the Blending Mode option and choose Screen from the drop-down menu.

![click on blending mode and choose screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-10.jpg)

Then, right-click on the first letter clip in the timeline and choose the Copy Effects option from the next drop-down menu. Move the playhead to the ending position on the timeline and change the value on the relevant axis of Position until it matches its letter position on the original title.

## Part 1: Top 10 Halloween-Themed Footage for Halloween Countdown Clock Video

Here we provide footage exclusively for horizontal videos, so that you can use them for your videos for YouTube, Vimeo, Twitch, etc. If you just want some clips for TikTok, Ins story, or anything else, go ahead Halloween footage for vertical videos.

### 1\. [Fog Stones Halloween Dead](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/fog-stones-halloween-dead-43000147017.html)

Spooky graveyard with scary tombstones is another good way to go about it when you are looking for vacation countdown clock videos. The mixture of the turbulent and serene environment is enough to set the Halloween mood and even scare some folks.

Remember the scene from the movie “The Fog” and its famous dialogues: When the fog rolls in the terror begin! If you do not, take a look at a scene and judge for yourself if scary enough or not.

![fog stones filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-1.jpg)

### 2\. [Scary Sadako ghost](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/p/Scary-Sadako-ghost.html)

What’s better than the Sadako ghost 7-day video call threat on Halloween? Well, nothing! So, why not create a prank video for your friends and family, especially those afraid of Sadako? Plus, Sadako creates a perfect backdrop for the countdown. Look at this Philippines creator who went to great lengths to scare his friends via a Sadako video call.

But you do not have to go through all that costume and scenery setup. Instead, you can use the video footage on any premium video and apply Sadako ghost via Green Screen.

![sadako ghost filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-2.jpg)

### 3\. [Transferring Halloween Cupcakes From The Tray To The Table Moments](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/transferring-halloween-cupcakes-from-the-tray-to-the-table-43000103154.html)

Halloween is adored for its trick-or-treat, but what about the party? What will you serve? Cupcakes sound like a good idea. But how will you entice your guest with your Halloween cupcakes? Well, you can include the cupcakes in the invitation video. While you can find many Halloween creative and savory cupcake recipes on YouTube, you can use stock footage to have them in the video.

![cupcakes halloween filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-3.jpg)

### 4\. [Skeleton breaking screen](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/p/Skeleton-breaking-screen.html)

The broken screen is the classic prank suitable for any event and day. But simply using apps or replacing the wallpaper on your friend's or spouse's mobile doesn’t cut in this age and day. With new technology coming in, you have to get creative. Plus, it’s for Halloween, meaning dead skulls are a must.

![skeleton breaking screen filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-4.jpg)

### 5\. [Dark Monster Halloween Horror](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/dark-monster-halloween-horror-43000084917.html)

Halloween house horror is another great backdrop for scaring your friends after a vacation countdown clock. You will find tons of videos on Halloween Horror houses on the internet. Look at how Jackie from Super Enthused (YouTube channel) gets scared while touring the 10 Halloween horror houses at the theme park. That was really scary, and this Halloween countdown effect can also help you do the same to your viewers.

![horror house filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-5.jpg)

### 6\. [Face Portrait Halloween Clown](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/face-portrait-halloween-clown-43000083759.html)

Scary clowns against a kid’s window have been the long norm of scaring the small ones. No doubt, such pranks can scare anyone, not just kids. If you do not believe me, look at the reaction video from Infinite featuring scaring clowns’ pranks.

But how about dropping such a scary face bomb in a vacation countdown clock video? You can easily get your hands on creepy clowns’ portraits for videos via premium stock libraries like Filmora’s Filmstock.

![scary clown portrait filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-6.jpg)

### 7\. [A Family Wearing Handmade Halloween Mask At Home](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/a-family-wearing-handmade-halloween-mask-at-home-43000093665.html)

Another not-so-fancy, subtle, and understated appeal for the Halloween vacation countdown clock video is a family together with Halloween masks. Given everyone will be in their costumes, you can also consider distributing self-made masks for everyone. You can take ideas from any of the numerous videos about Halloween mask design ideas.

![face mask family filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-7.jpg)

### 8\. [Halloween Buckets Stacked Together](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/halloween-buckets-stacked-together-43000180211.html)

What’s the simplest and most fitting footage for the Halloween vacation countdown clock? Well, it is the scary pumpkins. Carving out Jack-o’-lantern has long been the Halloween “tradition,” and featuring it in your countdown timer at the party is the most classic way to go about it. The vibe from simple Halloween buckets stacked together is on the next level; if you do not believe me, look at Angie Bellemare’s Halloween Bucket ideas and creativity:

![halloween bucket stacked filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-8.jpg)

### 9\. [Carving Of Pumpkin For Halloween](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/carving-of-pumpkin-for-halloween-43000011941?af=&sualg=)

Another Jack-o’-lantern idea for the vacation countdown clock video is the DIY Pumpin projects in the video. It doesn’t sound like much, but it really is enough to give the best feeling about Halloween without really indulging in the scary stuff. Take a look at how Jenn designs her Pumpkin Stack Fall Planter:

![halloween bucket carving filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-9.jpg)

### 10\. [Dough Halloween Cookies Bakery Products](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/dough-halloween-cookies-bakery-products-43000090890.html)

If Halloween is more about spending time with friends and family, a bunch of laughter, fun, and creating memories, then it cannot get better than focusing on the sweet stuff, like the dough used to cook the Halloween cookies. When you imagine the scenario of dough mixing for the Halloween countdown timer video, it does not sound like much! But they are cool-looking and set the perfect backdrop for a countdown timer video:

You can use such clips individually or mix them with other stock video footage mentioned here to create a perfect Halloween vacation countdown clock video clip.

![dough halloween cookies bakery product filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-10.jpg)

**Halloween Footage for Vertical Videos \[TikTok/Instagram Story\]:**

The above list discusses the panoramic footage suitable for big screens. If your screen is rather a vertical one, then you might be looking for vertical stock footage for the Halloween vacation countdown clock clip. Here are some vertical footage ideas and links to stock footage to create the perfect vertical vacation countdown clock video for Halloween:

### 1\. [Woman Decorating for Halloween \[TikTok\]](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/woman-decorating-for-halloween-43000095742.html)

Another simple backdrop for the Halloween countdown timer video is the decorations process to transform your indoors or outdoors for Halloween. And while you can use your own footage of decorating the house, chances are you may have missed filming yourself while decorating the house, given not everyone films themselves decorating the house and use it for their TikTok video. Here’s a video from Spooky Bones featuring the indoor decoration process for Halloween.

![women decorating for halloween filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-11.jpg)

### 2\. [Girl Blonde Portrait Halloween](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/girl-blonde-portrait-halloween-43000089959.html)

Another simple idea for a vertical countdown timer for Halloween is a scary face. In fact, if you are looking for the users to focus on the timer instead of footage is to use a slo-mo video, like this one from Tay. Tay tells a story about a real haunted house in her neighborhood while wearing scary Halloween makeup.

Of course, you can replace the story; and instead, use a clock with a girl wearing Halloween makeup.

![women wearing makeup filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-12.jpg)

### 3\. [An Outdoor Table With Halloween Theme Settings](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/an-outdoor-table-with-halloween-theme-settings-43000100754.html)

If you are looking to feature the vacation countdown clock outdoors in a vertical setup, then a table with a Halloween theme might create the perfect setting. After all, Halloween is all about setting the perfect theme, and featuring a non-relevant indoor or scary video outdoors spoils the theme. Take a look at how Stephanie Cunningham on TikTok showcases her outdoor table decoration setup for Halloween.

![table setting filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-13.jpg)

### 4\. [A Kid In A Mummy Costume Holding A Halloween Bucket](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/a-kid-in-a-mummy-costume-holding-a-halloween-bucket-43000093674.html)

If you are going for the classic mummy theme on Halloween, then how can you include any other footage than an actual mummy in the vertical countdown timer video? There are many ways to go about when looking to feature a mummy in the countdown clock; one idea is to show you made the mummy costumes, like Vina’s getup video on TikTok.

![mummy costume filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-14.jpg)

### 5\. [Stop Motion Of Halloween Candy](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/stop-motion-of-halloween-candy-43000095152.html)

Hosting a Halloween party for kids and in search of the perfect vertical footage for a Halloween vacation countdown clock video? It cannot get better than simply featuring a bunch of candy to lure the kids toward the countdown clock. When you look at this video and imagine using a clock for the countdown clock.

![halloween candy filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-15.jpg)

## Part 1: Top 10 Halloween-Themed Footage for Halloween Countdown Clock Video

Here we provide footage exclusively for horizontal videos, so that you can use them for your videos for YouTube, Vimeo, Twitch, etc. If you just want some clips for TikTok, Ins story, or anything else, go ahead Halloween footage for vertical videos.

### 1\. [Fog Stones Halloween Dead](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/fog-stones-halloween-dead-43000147017.html)

Spooky graveyard with scary tombstones is another good way to go about it when you are looking for vacation countdown clock videos. The mixture of the turbulent and serene environment is enough to set the Halloween mood and even scare some folks.

Remember the scene from the movie “The Fog” and its famous dialogues: When the fog rolls in the terror begin! If you do not, take a look at a scene and judge for yourself if scary enough or not.

![fog stones filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-1.jpg)

### 2\. [Scary Sadako ghost](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/p/Scary-Sadako-ghost.html)

What’s better than the Sadako ghost 7-day video call threat on Halloween? Well, nothing! So, why not create a prank video for your friends and family, especially those afraid of Sadako? Plus, Sadako creates a perfect backdrop for the countdown. Look at this Philippines creator who went to great lengths to scare his friends via a Sadako video call.

But you do not have to go through all that costume and scenery setup. Instead, you can use the video footage on any premium video and apply Sadako ghost via Green Screen.

![sadako ghost filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-2.jpg)

### 3\. [Transferring Halloween Cupcakes From The Tray To The Table Moments](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/transferring-halloween-cupcakes-from-the-tray-to-the-table-43000103154.html)

Halloween is adored for its trick-or-treat, but what about the party? What will you serve? Cupcakes sound like a good idea. But how will you entice your guest with your Halloween cupcakes? Well, you can include the cupcakes in the invitation video. While you can find many Halloween creative and savory cupcake recipes on YouTube, you can use stock footage to have them in the video.

![cupcakes halloween filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-3.jpg)

### 4\. [Skeleton breaking screen](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/p/Skeleton-breaking-screen.html)

The broken screen is the classic prank suitable for any event and day. But simply using apps or replacing the wallpaper on your friend's or spouse's mobile doesn’t cut in this age and day. With new technology coming in, you have to get creative. Plus, it’s for Halloween, meaning dead skulls are a must.

![skeleton breaking screen filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-4.jpg)

### 5\. [Dark Monster Halloween Horror](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/dark-monster-halloween-horror-43000084917.html)

Halloween house horror is another great backdrop for scaring your friends after a vacation countdown clock. You will find tons of videos on Halloween Horror houses on the internet. Look at how Jackie from Super Enthused (YouTube channel) gets scared while touring the 10 Halloween horror houses at the theme park. That was really scary, and this Halloween countdown effect can also help you do the same to your viewers.

![horror house filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-5.jpg)

### 6\. [Face Portrait Halloween Clown](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/face-portrait-halloween-clown-43000083759.html)

Scary clowns against a kid’s window have been the long norm of scaring the small ones. No doubt, such pranks can scare anyone, not just kids. If you do not believe me, look at the reaction video from Infinite featuring scaring clowns’ pranks.

But how about dropping such a scary face bomb in a vacation countdown clock video? You can easily get your hands on creepy clowns’ portraits for videos via premium stock libraries like Filmora’s Filmstock.

![scary clown portrait filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-6.jpg)

### 7\. [A Family Wearing Handmade Halloween Mask At Home](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/a-family-wearing-handmade-halloween-mask-at-home-43000093665.html)

Another not-so-fancy, subtle, and understated appeal for the Halloween vacation countdown clock video is a family together with Halloween masks. Given everyone will be in their costumes, you can also consider distributing self-made masks for everyone. You can take ideas from any of the numerous videos about Halloween mask design ideas.

![face mask family filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-7.jpg)

### 8\. [Halloween Buckets Stacked Together](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/halloween-buckets-stacked-together-43000180211.html)

What’s the simplest and most fitting footage for the Halloween vacation countdown clock? Well, it is the scary pumpkins. Carving out Jack-o’-lantern has long been the Halloween “tradition,” and featuring it in your countdown timer at the party is the most classic way to go about it. The vibe from simple Halloween buckets stacked together is on the next level; if you do not believe me, look at Angie Bellemare’s Halloween Bucket ideas and creativity:

![halloween bucket stacked filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-8.jpg)

### 9\. [Carving Of Pumpkin For Halloween](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/carving-of-pumpkin-for-halloween-43000011941?af=&sualg=)

Another Jack-o’-lantern idea for the vacation countdown clock video is the DIY Pumpin projects in the video. It doesn’t sound like much, but it really is enough to give the best feeling about Halloween without really indulging in the scary stuff. Take a look at how Jenn designs her Pumpkin Stack Fall Planter:

![halloween bucket carving filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-9.jpg)

### 10\. [Dough Halloween Cookies Bakery Products](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/dough-halloween-cookies-bakery-products-43000090890.html)

If Halloween is more about spending time with friends and family, a bunch of laughter, fun, and creating memories, then it cannot get better than focusing on the sweet stuff, like the dough used to cook the Halloween cookies. When you imagine the scenario of dough mixing for the Halloween countdown timer video, it does not sound like much! But they are cool-looking and set the perfect backdrop for a countdown timer video:

You can use such clips individually or mix them with other stock video footage mentioned here to create a perfect Halloween vacation countdown clock video clip.

![dough halloween cookies bakery product filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-10.jpg)

**Halloween Footage for Vertical Videos \[TikTok/Instagram Story\]:**

The above list discusses the panoramic footage suitable for big screens. If your screen is rather a vertical one, then you might be looking for vertical stock footage for the Halloween vacation countdown clock clip. Here are some vertical footage ideas and links to stock footage to create the perfect vertical vacation countdown clock video for Halloween:

### 1\. [Woman Decorating for Halloween \[TikTok\]](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/woman-decorating-for-halloween-43000095742.html)

Another simple backdrop for the Halloween countdown timer video is the decorations process to transform your indoors or outdoors for Halloween. And while you can use your own footage of decorating the house, chances are you may have missed filming yourself while decorating the house, given not everyone films themselves decorating the house and use it for their TikTok video. Here’s a video from Spooky Bones featuring the indoor decoration process for Halloween.

![women decorating for halloween filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-11.jpg)

### 2\. [Girl Blonde Portrait Halloween](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/girl-blonde-portrait-halloween-43000089959.html)

Another simple idea for a vertical countdown timer for Halloween is a scary face. In fact, if you are looking for the users to focus on the timer instead of footage is to use a slo-mo video, like this one from Tay. Tay tells a story about a real haunted house in her neighborhood while wearing scary Halloween makeup.

Of course, you can replace the story; and instead, use a clock with a girl wearing Halloween makeup.

![women wearing makeup filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-12.jpg)

### 3\. [An Outdoor Table With Halloween Theme Settings](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/an-outdoor-table-with-halloween-theme-settings-43000100754.html)

If you are looking to feature the vacation countdown clock outdoors in a vertical setup, then a table with a Halloween theme might create the perfect setting. After all, Halloween is all about setting the perfect theme, and featuring a non-relevant indoor or scary video outdoors spoils the theme. Take a look at how Stephanie Cunningham on TikTok showcases her outdoor table decoration setup for Halloween.

![table setting filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-13.jpg)

### 4\. [A Kid In A Mummy Costume Holding A Halloween Bucket](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/a-kid-in-a-mummy-costume-holding-a-halloween-bucket-43000093674.html)

If you are going for the classic mummy theme on Halloween, then how can you include any other footage than an actual mummy in the vertical countdown timer video? There are many ways to go about when looking to feature a mummy in the countdown clock; one idea is to show you made the mummy costumes, like Vina’s getup video on TikTok.

![mummy costume filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-14.jpg)

### 5\. [Stop Motion Of Halloween Candy](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/js/stop-motion-of-halloween-candy-43000095152.html)

Hosting a Halloween party for kids and in search of the perfect vertical footage for a Halloween vacation countdown clock video? It cannot get better than simply featuring a bunch of candy to lure the kids toward the countdown clock. When you look at this video and imagine using a clock for the countdown clock.

![halloween candy filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/spooky-halloween-with-the-best-15-halloween-countdown-video-clips-15.jpg)
