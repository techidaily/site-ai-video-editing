### Steps To Use Speed Ramping In Premiere Pro

Follow the below-mentioned steps to learn how to use speed ramping in premiere pro:

* Download and install Adobe Premiere Pro. Once installed, launch the application.
* Create a new project in Premiere by clicking the New Project button. After that, import the film that you want to speed ramp. It is the simplest and most straightforward method of importing film into Premiere to just click and drag the clip into the project window.
* Before commencing any work with speed, click and drag the video track in the timeline to make it taller by increasing the height of the track. This will guarantee that you can see the speed ramp as you go to the next stages.
* To create a sequence if you don't already have one, drag a clip into the timeline and drop it where you want it to appear. Using the clip's parameters, Premiere will automatically generate a sequence with the necessary settings.
* Decide when you want to apply the speed ramp and mark the spot on the screen where you will do so. The key to a pleasant speed ramp is movement, so choose a time when the environment is very active. You can specify in and out points, cut the clip with "Command+K," or divide the clip into parts using the razor blade tool (which is accessible through the "Command+K" shortcut).
* Keyframes will be created at this point. It's first and foremost important that the keyframes be clearly visible. Access the proper view by selecting "Show Clip Keyframes" from the context menu when you right-click on your clip.
* Another drop-down option will appear, from which you'll choose "Time Remapping" and then press the "Enter" key.
* Select "Speed" from the drop-down menu.
* To create a keyframe, choose the pen from the toolbar (or just use the "P" key on your keyboard) and click on the white line running across the video track. If you wish to make a speed ramp, you'll need at least two keyframes: one to indicate where the speed ramp should begin and another to indicate where it should terminate.
* If you wish to create more sophisticated speed ramps, you may do so by including more keyframes in your animation.
* Switch back to the selection tool when you've finished placing your keyframes. "V" is the shortcut key for this.
* Now comes the critical moment: it's time to change the speed. This is a task that Premiere Pro makes rather simple. The only thing you have to do now is click on the white line between the keyframes you have created and drag it either up or down, depending on your preference for speed or slowness.
* It's not finished yet; we still need to smooth it out a little more. With the selection tool selected, click and drag one of the keyframe markers to the other side of the screen. The number of frames across which the speed shift will occur will be stretched out as a result of this. The longer and more gradual the speed ramp will be, the greater the distance between the two sides of the keyframe indication is separated.
* Complete the process with the other keyframe, and your speed ramp will be complete!

* Simply dragging to divide a keyframe, like in the previous example, results in an equitable speed increase between the keyframes in the animation. Linear interpolation is the term used to describe this process.
* Instead of using Bezier Interpolation, you may utilize it to produce a smoother, more natural speed ramp. With Bezier Interpolation, the pace at which the speed increases will likewise accelerate, giving the effect of a more pronounced ramp.
* To build an S-curve shape, choose a keyframe and drag the Bezier handles to the desired position. Make adjustments until you are satisfied with the outcome.

### Speed Ramp Transition

Speed ramp transitions are easy to make and may be utilized to add visual interest to a wide range of video genres. This effect is achieved by boosting the clip speed at the end of a clip before transitioning into a cut.

* In the second clip, the tempo is abruptly boosted and subsequently decreased to provide a smooth transition between situations. It may symbolize the passage of time, a character's perplexity, or simply add flair to a commercial film.
* Using Premiere Pro, create a ramp-up at the end of your first clip and a ramp-down at the start of your second clip. The speed rubber band will be curved like a bell curve across the two clips when finished.

### Steps To Use Speed Ramping In Premiere Pro

Follow the below-mentioned steps to learn how to use speed ramping in premiere pro:

* Download and install Adobe Premiere Pro. Once installed, launch the application.
* Create a new project in Premiere by clicking the New Project button. After that, import the film that you want to speed ramp. It is the simplest and most straightforward method of importing film into Premiere to just click and drag the clip into the project window.
* Before commencing any work with speed, click and drag the video track in the timeline to make it taller by increasing the height of the track. This will guarantee that you can see the speed ramp as you go to the next stages.
* To create a sequence if you don't already have one, drag a clip into the timeline and drop it where you want it to appear. Using the clip's parameters, Premiere will automatically generate a sequence with the necessary settings.
* Decide when you want to apply the speed ramp and mark the spot on the screen where you will do so. The key to a pleasant speed ramp is movement, so choose a time when the environment is very active. You can specify in and out points, cut the clip with "Command+K," or divide the clip into parts using the razor blade tool (which is accessible through the "Command+K" shortcut).
* Keyframes will be created at this point. It's first and foremost important that the keyframes be clearly visible. Access the proper view by selecting "Show Clip Keyframes" from the context menu when you right-click on your clip.
* Another drop-down option will appear, from which you'll choose "Time Remapping" and then press the "Enter" key.
* Select "Speed" from the drop-down menu.
* To create a keyframe, choose the pen from the toolbar (or just use the "P" key on your keyboard) and click on the white line running across the video track. If you wish to make a speed ramp, you'll need at least two keyframes: one to indicate where the speed ramp should begin and another to indicate where it should terminate.
* If you wish to create more sophisticated speed ramps, you may do so by including more keyframes in your animation.
* Switch back to the selection tool when you've finished placing your keyframes. "V" is the shortcut key for this.
* Now comes the critical moment: it's time to change the speed. This is a task that Premiere Pro makes rather simple. The only thing you have to do now is click on the white line between the keyframes you have created and drag it either up or down, depending on your preference for speed or slowness.
* It's not finished yet; we still need to smooth it out a little more. With the selection tool selected, click and drag one of the keyframe markers to the other side of the screen. The number of frames across which the speed shift will occur will be stretched out as a result of this. The longer and more gradual the speed ramp will be, the greater the distance between the two sides of the keyframe indication is separated.
* Complete the process with the other keyframe, and your speed ramp will be complete!

## Techniques to Make Speed Ramping Smooth

In this section, we will be viewing some advanced time remapping features of Adobe Premiere Pro, which are as follows.

### Keyframe Interpolation

When creating a speed ramp, keyframes are used to indicate the beginning and finishing points of the speed shift. However, there are a number of methods in which Premiere may transport the clip from point A to point B.

In the video industry, filling in the data between the two locations is known as keyframe interpolation.

* Simply dragging to divide a keyframe, like in the previous example, results in an equitable speed increase between the keyframes in the animation. Linear interpolation is the term used to describe this process.
* Instead of using Bezier Interpolation, you may utilize it to produce a smoother, more natural speed ramp. With Bezier Interpolation, the pace at which the speed increases will likewise accelerate, giving the effect of a more pronounced ramp.
* To build an S-curve shape, choose a keyframe and drag the Bezier handles to the desired position. Make adjustments until you are satisfied with the outcome.

### Speed Ramp Transition

Speed ramp transitions are easy to make and may be utilized to add visual interest to a wide range of video genres. This effect is achieved by boosting the clip speed at the end of a clip before transitioning into a cut.

* In the second clip, the tempo is abruptly boosted and subsequently decreased to provide a smooth transition between situations. It may symbolize the passage of time, a character's perplexity, or simply add flair to a commercial film.
* Using Premiere Pro, create a ramp-up at the end of your first clip and a ramp-down at the start of your second clip. The speed rubber band will be curved like a bell curve across the two clips when finished.

Adding speed ramps to films in Premiere Pro may improve the usefulness and looks of a variety of movies, from narrative features to social media posts. In Premiere, you may easily create and adjust speed duration directly in the timeline to meet any needs.

* Now comes the critical moment: it's time to change the speed. This is a task that Premiere Pro makes rather simple. The only thing you have to do now is click on the white line between the keyframes you have created and drag it either up or down, depending on your preference for speed or slowness.
* It's not finished yet; we still need to smooth it out a little more. With the selection tool selected, click and drag one of the keyframe markers to the other side of the screen. The number of frames across which the speed shift will occur will be stretched out as a result of this. The longer and more gradual the speed ramp will be, the greater the distance between the two sides of the keyframe indication is separated.
* Complete the process with the other keyframe, and your speed ramp will be complete!

## Techniques to Make Speed Ramping Smooth

In this section, we will be viewing some advanced time remapping features of Adobe Premiere Pro, which are as follows.

### Keyframe Interpolation

When creating a speed ramp, keyframes are used to indicate the beginning and finishing points of the speed shift. However, there are a number of methods in which Premiere may transport the clip from point A to point B.

In the video industry, filling in the data between the two locations is known as keyframe interpolation.

* Simply dragging to divide a keyframe, like in the previous example, results in an equitable speed increase between the keyframes in the animation. Linear interpolation is the term used to describe this process.
* Instead of using Bezier Interpolation, you may utilize it to produce a smoother, more natural speed ramp. With Bezier Interpolation, the pace at which the speed increases will likewise accelerate, giving the effect of a more pronounced ramp.
* To build an S-curve shape, choose a keyframe and drag the Bezier handles to the desired position. Make adjustments until you are satisfied with the outcome.

### Speed Ramp Transition

Speed ramp transitions are easy to make and may be utilized to add visual interest to a wide range of video genres. This effect is achieved by boosting the clip speed at the end of a clip before transitioning into a cut.

* In the second clip, the tempo is abruptly boosted and subsequently decreased to provide a smooth transition between situations. It may symbolize the passage of time, a character's perplexity, or simply add flair to a commercial film.
* Using Premiere Pro, create a ramp-up at the end of your first clip and a ramp-down at the start of your second clip. The speed rubber band will be curved like a bell curve across the two clips when finished.

Adding speed ramps to films in Premiere Pro may improve the usefulness and looks of a variety of movies, from narrative features to social media posts. In Premiere, you may easily create and adjust speed duration directly in the timeline to meet any needs.
