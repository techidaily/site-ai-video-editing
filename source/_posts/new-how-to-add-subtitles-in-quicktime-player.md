## How to Add Subtitles in QuickTime Player?

QuickTime is among the most popular multimedia players available for PC users. Developed by Apple Inc. in 1991, it was initially made available for Mac OS. However, from 2005 till 2016, QuickTime was available for Windows operating systems as well. While QuickTime allows you to view images and music, it is a popular choice for playing videos.

Do you use QuickTime player to watch music videos, movies, and TV shows? Well, you may find it interesting that the QuickTime player allows you to add subtitles. As there are multiple methods through which you can add subtitles in QuickTime, we are going to discuss them one by one in this blog. So, let’s start our discussion!

## Method 1: Turn on the Subtitles in QuickTime

As you might know, some videos come with embedded subtitles. It’s up to you whether you want to view them while playing the video or not. If you are playing a video with embedded subtitles in the QuickTime player but are somehow unable to view the subtitles, it’s probably because the subtitles feature is turned off. So, you need to enable the subtitles by following certain steps.

### Steps to Turn on Subtitles in QuickTime

Step1 Open the QuickTime Player application on your Mac computer.

Step3 Within the menu bar, find the “view” tab and open it.

Step7 You can also click the “subtitles” button in the playback controls to view the subtitles available with a video.

## Method 2: Download and Add Subtitles to Videos in QuickTime

If you want to play videos in QuickTime that do not have embedded subtitles, you can add subtitles to them manually. With QuickTime player, it is quite easy to add external subtitles files and watch movies and TV shows with subtitles of your choice.

Step3 Right-click the file and select the “Open with QuickTime” option.

Part 1: What is Frame Rate and How Important It Is In Videos?

One of the most important metrics in videos is the **frame rate.** This term refers to the individual frames present in the video. While the frame represents a single second, this defines the frequency of the video. This is the display of consecutive frames every second, which brings up the illusion of motion for the viewers.
