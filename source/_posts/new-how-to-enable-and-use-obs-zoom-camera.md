You've undoubtedly acquired a reliable webcam by this point and learned how to adjust your lighting and frame to appear decent on video. You could have even splashed out on a green screen to make your online meetings' backgrounds seem more branded and professional. Without OBS, you may utilize your webcam directly with Zoom, but the picture quality will be poor. This is due to Zoom's lack of access to your webcam's exposure and white balance settings. Additionally, you cannot apply any filters, such as LUTs. This tutorial will show you how to use the OBS Virtual Camera to install OBS as a camera in Zoom.

## Part 1: Not All Subtitles for MKV files Can Be Extracted (Hardsub Vs. Softsub)

As we have mentioned that there are tools and programs available that can help you remove the subtitle srt files, but here one thing needs to be remembered not all types of subtitle files can be extracted from the MKV videos.

There are two major types of forms of subtitles- hardsubs (also known as hardcoded subtitles or open subtitles) or softsubs (also known as closed subtitles or softcoded subtitles).

**Hardsubs** are the subtitles that are burned in the image of the videos and thus cannot be extracted, removed, hidden, or disabled when the video files are played.
