## Part 1\. Shared Media Folder

You might have had the hassle of importing the same videos for a considerable time in a different project. It can become a problem for you. It may be fine if you have organized your videos from the start.

**Shared Media Folder** in Filmora, now called the **Global Media Folder,** can store video and audio that you've imported for future projects. So you don't have to keep re-importing your media for future videos.

## Part 2\. Customize Proxy Files

Before understanding the custom proxy settings, let us know what proxy files are.

### Proxy Files

Proxy files in Wondershare Filmora allow you to render and edit **4K** and other higher-resolution videos easily, regardless of your computer's processing power.

No one wants to compromise PC performance when editing videos. But if you are importing a video with a higher resolution than your PC, you can only play it sometimes. Other than that, your PC might get stuck and slow down.

If your PC has a built-in resolution of **1080p,** but the video you are going to import is **2160p**, you can encounter rendering and performance problems. But in the case of Wondershare Filmora Proxy files, you can smoothly edit your videos without any trouble.

### How to Customize Proxy Files in Filmora

Although Wondershare Filmora automatically creates proxy files when it encounters resolutions more significant than the PC performance. But you can also set them to your preference.

And customize your proxy files takes some simple and easy steps. But first, follow the steps mentioned below.

Rendering can be a giant leap to give you a smooth performance experience. However, when you import your videos into the timeline, you can always render to have an uninterrupted playback experience.

Doing so will allow you to work in your zone quickly and efficiently. You can do a manual rendering before you begin the editing process. Or you can also opt to choose automatic rendering. In the automatic rendering option, you can continue your editing process. In the meantime, your timeline will be rendered.

Step6 Click on **OK** to save your changes.

Now, whenever you close your project, your render cache will be deleted and would have given you extra space on your computer.

## Part 4\. Remove Split Button on Playhead

## Part 5\. Copy and Paste Effects

Copy and paste are one of the oldest tricks in editing procedures. Wondershare Filmora comes with a range of commands and features that allow you to save time and be reliable.

Suppose you want to add an effect to a video clip in the timeline. Then, after adding the effect to your video, make custom changes to make it look more closely to the style you want. You can now use the copy-and-paste function to add the same effect to another clip. That helps you save a lot of time from tedious and time-consuming work.

### How to Copy and Paste Effects

## Part 6\. Timeline Snap

You might have added multiple videos in the same timeline track. If you removed the video ahead of the video clip, you have to close the gap in between.

So, arranging and moving clips in the timeline are hectic and time-consuming. However, that is the case without timeline snapping.

### How to Apply Timeline Snap in Filmora

**Timeline snapping** will allow you to arrange video clips side by side without any breaks and cut-offs. Also, it will enable you to place it precisely above other video and audio gaps in the timeline.

Now you can easily enable and disable timeline snapping according to your choice!

## Part 7\. Color Code Video Clips

When editing footage from multiple cameras, you might want to organize which media is from which source in the timeline. You can do this by color coding your clips.
