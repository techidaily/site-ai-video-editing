## Part 2 How to Convert Slides to Digital - Step-by-Step Guide

Here, we will discuss step-by-step ways to turn the old slides into digital images. So, let’s begin:

**Step 1: Resolution**

The very first step for **converting slides to digital photos** is measuring and fixing the resolution of the slides. The technical measurement of image resolution is DPI (dot per inch). It helps you to predict the sharpness or clarity of the final image. The overall measurement depends on the size of the slide and the type of converter or scanner you are using. For example,

A 35 mm slide scanned at 10 MP will give you the images of size 13"\*9".

Step 2: Dust and Scratch Removal

If you have slides that have been wrapped in a box and remained untouched for so long, they might require cleaning. Such slides may develop mold buildup, age-related blemishes, or scratches. They need a cleaning process before using them to convert into slides. A lint-free cloth and an anti-static film cleaner are the best combinations to gently clean the slides and make them fresh.

Step 3: Color Correction and Restoration

Color correction and restoration is another important step when you are dealing with converting old slides into digital images. In order to correct the fading and color shift, you can use the built-in scanning software. You can also use other software for such purposes.

Wondershare Filmora is the best tool which can be used for the color correction of old slides. It is a handy tool with a variety of features. Filmora offers a number of options when it comes to color correction and grading. These options include color histogram, white balance, 3D LUT (3D Lookup table), color and light, HSL, vignette, etc.

Step 4: Using the Best Scanner cum Digital Converter

The next step is choosing the best quality scanner according to the requirement. 35 mm is the most common size of the slides. But, it does come with other uncommon formats too such as 110, 126, 120, 127, etc. You will come to know about the actual size when the image is mounted on the cardboard. Therefore, it is essential to select a quality and versatile scanner which can convert slides of any size effectively.

## How to Blur Part of a Video Using OpenShot

Designed for Windows, Mac, and Linux, OpenShot is a free, open-source, and cross-platform video editor. While there's no predefined function or filter in this tool to help you blur part of a video, OpenShot has another way of blurring static parts of your video: it uses an image.

OpenShot blur part of video is free, and you'll use its open-source programs as a base program for the edition of the video and GIMP Image Manipulation software to edit photos. Follow the guide below to learn how to blur out something in a video using OpenShot.

Step 1: Download OpenShot and install it on your device.

![blur part of a video using openshot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-12.png)

Step 2: Take a screenshot from your video, where the part you want to blur is easily visible. You can do this by going to a relevant frame and utilizing Save Current Frame with a camera icon, located on the right side of the video preview window in a standard program configuration.

![blur part of a video using openshot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-11.png)

Step 3: Be sure to save your video screenshot on your computer.

Step 4: Since you have exported a relevant frame from your video as a screenshot, you need to open it in a photo editor that can handle PNG pics and transparency, like the GIMP Image Manipulation program. Use any selection tool to select the area of the picture you want to blur on the video. Depending on your preferences, you can choose the free select tool, the ellipse select tool, or the rectangle select tool.

![blur part of a video using openshot - select blur area](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-13.png)

Step 5: In the blur filters submenu, open the Pixelize tool and adjust the options that suit your preferences. You can use CTRL-Z to cancel the operation, and repeat it until you find the best combination of blurring settings.

Step 6: When you are satisfied with blurring, right-click on the blurred area and select Invert in the Select submenu; this will allow you to select the entire part of the frame that has not been blurred, which is the part you would like to get rid of because you will only have to use the blurred part of your video overlay where necessary.

Step 7: Now, cut the section of the picture you do not want to keep. You can do this by using CTRL-X. The blurred filter for your video is now ready.

![blur part of a video using openshot - cut unwanted section](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-14.png)

Step 8: If after cutting you notice a plain color rather than a checkerboard canvas representing transparency, use CTRL-Z to cancel the cut. Then, use CTRL-I to invert the selection again to get control of the blurred selection again, and copy or cut it using CTRL-X or CTRL-C.

Step 9: Create another image using CTRL-N, and ensure you have navigated to the advanced options and selected transparency as the fill-in color, and paste your selection there.

Step 10: You now have a perfect photo with full transparency, which is represented by a checkerboard canvas, except for the section of the video frames you would like to blur that should be pixelized.

Step 11: Use the Export option under the File menu to export the photo to your PC as a . PNG file. To save a picture with a transparency channel, you need to use the . PNG extension.

Step 12: Now return to OpenShot video editor and import the generated picture with a pixelized portion in the OpenShot video project. Next, add the picture as an overlay track. Make sure it's above the video track.

Step 13: If the program asks you to import the photo as an image sequence, select the NO option because you need to import a still photo, and not a video sequence.

Step 14: The picture will be displayed before the video, blurring only the portion of the video where you modified the frame. The other parts of the video won’t be touched. You can make adjustments to ensure the picture track is only displayed at required moments. And that's how to blur part of a video using OpenShot.

## How to Blur Part of a Video Using OpenShot

Designed for Windows, Mac, and Linux, OpenShot is a free, open-source, and cross-platform video editor. While there's no predefined function or filter in this tool to help you blur part of a video, OpenShot has another way of blurring static parts of your video: it uses an image.

OpenShot blur part of video is free, and you'll use its open-source programs as a base program for the edition of the video and GIMP Image Manipulation software to edit photos. Follow the guide below to learn how to blur out something in a video using OpenShot.

Step 1: Download OpenShot and install it on your device.

![blur part of a video using openshot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-12.png)

Step 2: Take a screenshot from your video, where the part you want to blur is easily visible. You can do this by going to a relevant frame and utilizing Save Current Frame with a camera icon, located on the right side of the video preview window in a standard program configuration.

![blur part of a video using openshot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-11.png)

Step 3: Be sure to save your video screenshot on your computer.

Step 4: Since you have exported a relevant frame from your video as a screenshot, you need to open it in a photo editor that can handle PNG pics and transparency, like the GIMP Image Manipulation program. Use any selection tool to select the area of the picture you want to blur on the video. Depending on your preferences, you can choose the free select tool, the ellipse select tool, or the rectangle select tool.

![blur part of a video using openshot - select blur area](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-13.png)

Step 5: In the blur filters submenu, open the Pixelize tool and adjust the options that suit your preferences. You can use CTRL-Z to cancel the operation, and repeat it until you find the best combination of blurring settings.

Step 6: When you are satisfied with blurring, right-click on the blurred area and select Invert in the Select submenu; this will allow you to select the entire part of the frame that has not been blurred, which is the part you would like to get rid of because you will only have to use the blurred part of your video overlay where necessary.

Step 7: Now, cut the section of the picture you do not want to keep. You can do this by using CTRL-X. The blurred filter for your video is now ready.

![blur part of a video using openshot - cut unwanted section](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-14.png)

Step 8: If after cutting you notice a plain color rather than a checkerboard canvas representing transparency, use CTRL-Z to cancel the cut. Then, use CTRL-I to invert the selection again to get control of the blurred selection again, and copy or cut it using CTRL-X or CTRL-C.

Step 9: Create another image using CTRL-N, and ensure you have navigated to the advanced options and selected transparency as the fill-in color, and paste your selection there.

Step 10: You now have a perfect photo with full transparency, which is represented by a checkerboard canvas, except for the section of the video frames you would like to blur that should be pixelized.

Step 11: Use the Export option under the File menu to export the photo to your PC as a . PNG file. To save a picture with a transparency channel, you need to use the . PNG extension.

Step 12: Now return to OpenShot video editor and import the generated picture with a pixelized portion in the OpenShot video project. Next, add the picture as an overlay track. Make sure it's above the video track.

Step 13: If the program asks you to import the photo as an image sequence, select the NO option because you need to import a still photo, and not a video sequence.

Step 14: The picture will be displayed before the video, blurring only the portion of the video where you modified the frame. The other parts of the video won’t be touched. You can make adjustments to ensure the picture track is only displayed at required moments. And that's how to blur part of a video using OpenShot.

## Conclusion

● Now that you know how to blur out part of a video, you can have fun and censor anything you want in your clips. Use Filmora to blur moving and still parts on your video.
