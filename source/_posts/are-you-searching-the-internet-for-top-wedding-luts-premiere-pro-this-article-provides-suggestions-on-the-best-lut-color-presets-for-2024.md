![Travel Slideshow Tips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/best-tips-on-how-to-design-travel-slideshow-02.jpg)

### 01Identify the audience

Before creating a slideshow, you first need to ascertain who is your target audience. The slideshow can be created for your friends, family, relatives, or YouTube or social media platform viewers. Depending on the target audience, the content and other slideshow elements will vary.

### 02Choose a travel story

Next, you need to decide upon the story of your travel slideshow. Depending on the story, you can pick up the content to be included. The story can be based on the places you visited, food, local shopping, and others. Also draft a story that has an introduction, a middle part, and an end.

### 03Sort the pictures and videos

Next comes the trickiest part of selecting the pictures and videos to be added to the slideshow. For any trip, there are hundreds of images but you cannot add them all to your slideshow. So, depending on the target audience and your travel story, pick up the most appropriate ones. Pick up the number of images and videos so that the total slideshow length is around 5-7 minutes.

### 04Edit images and add effects

Next comes the editing part. Check out the images that need editing like cropping, color correction, and others. Also, you can add some effects to make your slideshow interesting. To edit the files and add effects, there are several editing online and desktop-based tools available. You can choose the ones that meet your requirements.

### 05Add transitions

Next, choose the transitions you want to add between the images and the videos. There are slideshow-making tools where you can check out different types of transition effects and use them.

### 06Add Music

Music will set the right tone and mood for your slideshow. You can either download the relevant song from any online site or a music library or can also combine multiple audio clips to be added to the slideshow.

## Part 2 Importance of using a travel slideshow template

Moreover, when it comes to travel, the task becomes even trickier with so many things to include and grab the attention of the viewers.

So, if you are not experienced or a pro at making a slideshow but want to create something impressive, templates come to a great rescue. The templates are like ready-to-use designs where you simply need to add the required elements that in turn will create a travel slideshow.
