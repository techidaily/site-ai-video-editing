## How to Become a Youtuber

I'm Sheila and I'm a Youtuber for five years in a row. I'm editing my vlogs using my cellphone only, not until I found this Wondershare Filmora for Personal Computers. Not like any other video editor that you need to crack your brain understanding each and every feature, this video editor that I'm talking about on the other hand, made it simple and very handy to use.

![Why I Become a Youtuber](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/how-to-become-a-youtuber-06.jpg)

Why I Become a Youtuber

## 1\. How I Decided to Start from Uploading the Video

But before we move forward for more details about the video editor itself, let's get back first five years ago. It all started when I filmed a certain place during a trip and somebody told me to upload it on YouTube. At first, I was hesitant doing that because I have no clue of what is YouTube. So, I did research and got curious, so I decided to upload the video. Time went by and I started to learn how to vlog.

![Uploading the Video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/how-to-become-a-youtuber-07.jpg)

Uploading the Video

## 2\. The Necessary Things a Vlog Should Have

* A teaser – wherein your aim is to caught the attention of your viewers.
* An intro – what is your channel all about.
* The body of the vlog – the part wherein you're explaining everything in depth, elaborating things about the topic you chose to share. In this part, you can insert the so called **"**call of action**"** \- wherein you can tell your viewers to subscribe, to like and comment something about your vlog you're tackling. And last is the
* Outro – closing session of your vlog.

![Vlog](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/how-to-become-a-youtuber-08.jpg)

Vlog

## 3\. What Have I Encountered on the Way

As the saying goes by, **"**The beginning is always the hardest part**"** and really it was. My YouTube journey was not as easy that even my friends didn't recognize my endeavors. But still, I continue what I'm doing because I love it. It's a hobby that at the same time, I'm learning something new on the process. And also, with the help of vlogging, I'm starting to gain my self-esteem that I forgot for many years back.

![What Have I Encountered on the Way](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/how-to-become-a-youtuber-09.jpg)

What Have I Encountered on the Way

It's not easy to become a Youtuber, because you, yourself is the only one that you've got. You are the director – managing everything all at once. The artist (youtuber) - the one who's going to talk in front of the camera. The scriptwriter – the one who's in charge of the whole story of the video and even the editor- the one who'll edit the video afterwards.

On YouTube platform, you have to be consistent. It doesn't mean that you need to upload a video thrice in a week, but even a video will do. After all, it's quality over quantity. You'll have to think what kind of video you'll upload because you need to give your viewers or audiences something significant out of your vlog. YouTube is the second largest search engine next to Google, so most of the people are searching for answers to their questions. Or even searching solutions to their problems. So, if you have something to offer, why not share it for free.

If you're a new YouTuber, you don't need to have high-end equipment's for vlogging. Anyone can start up by using his/her mobile phone. I used to vlog using my Samsung S-6\. Mobile phone nowadays, can record a high-definition resolution. You can add a tripod so that your phone can be sturdy during your filming session. Just film during day time so that you can minimize yourself from buying a ring light. A lavalier microphone can be a useful add-on so that your viewers or audiences can hear your voice clearly.

## 4\. What to Do As a YouTuber

As a Youtuber, you should find your own niche. Something that you're passionate about. Something denoting products, services, or interests that appeal to a small, specialized section of the population. Something that you're a hundred percent that you can deliver to them loud and clear.

![What to Do As a YouTuber](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/06/how-to-become-a-youtuber-10.jpg)

What to Do As a YouTuber

As a YouTuber, you should be yourself in front of the camera. At first it will be awkward, but in time you'll get used to it. Speak with your heart and not with your mind because when you start to think of the things that you need to say, you'll get distracted. But when you speak whatever is in your heart at that very moment, you can create miracles and wonders.

It's okay that you stutter once in a while. Even a reporter experiencing that kind of phenomena and besides, no one is perfect. Everything that you said unnecessarily can be omitted during the editing process. During editing, the first thing that you need to do is to put all the raw videos in your video editor's timeline. Cut all the unnecessary part specially the so called, **"**dead air**"** or the part that you're starting to think and not to talk at all. And your viewers can only see are all dead silence. After that you can add your personal touch. You can add your watermark (your trademark in other words), lower third green screens, subtitle if necessary (the hardest part to be honest) if you're doing it manually. Some cool stickers, effects and transitions.

## 5\. How I Started Video Editing

As I've told you at the start of this article, I'm a phone editor not until I found **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**.

## Ultimate Guide to Making Cinematography for Music Video

To visually represent the story in the music video, cinematography shots are helpful. It'll obviously and pleasing and eye-catchy effect in your video. These major requirements for making that cinematography can be covered as the following:

1. Light a subject
2. Create atmosphere
3. Light a set
4. Camera techniques
5. Aspect ratio
6. Framing
7. Camera movement

Before, we go deeper to the details on how to make a cinematography for music, let us know first about the cinematography for music video. Everything is represented in this article, from the camera movement to the setting of the lights in the studio. You will also learn about aspect ratio and framing while making shots from the DSLR.

## What Is Cinematography?

Cinematography covers all aspects of how a movie or music video is made, including choosing the lighting for the scene. The type of camera equipment to use, how to frame your photographs, and how to decide on camera movement are also included in this. Let's move toward the next lines to get the cool cinematography on display.

## Light a subject

Although you may assume that cinematography is just concerned with the usage of the camera, lighting plays an equally important role. While planning your photographs, you should think about how the scene is lit and how your subject is illuminated.

![lighting a subject](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/lighting-a-subject.jpg)

The cinematographer should consider the hard and soft lights for perfect illustrations during shooting. These are depicted with the following requirements!

### Hard light and soft light

The cinematographers mainly focus on the hard and soft lights during filmmaking. The **hard lights** give a softer look to the subject. They are pointing to the light sources which are closer to the subject in the video. It makes the photographs and shots harsher and more dramatic.

![hard light on the subject](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/hard-light-on-the-subject.jpg)

The **soft light** is trying to wrap around the subject. It gives diffused shadows and soft edges to the character of the music video.

![soft light on the subject](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/soft-light-on-the-subject.jpg)

![note](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** To get better results of the soft look, you need to add diffusion to lower the intensity.

## Create Atmosphere

You need a haze machine to create the atmosphere and give the environment true vibes. The haze machine gives a foggy appearance in every shoot and scene.

## Light a Set

To give proper lights in the set is illustrated with the help of an example as shown below!

### Examples

In this music video of the 3lau's, the main prop used is a bus, which is presented in the middle of the set and lit very well. The bus is rounded by many tungsten lights, which give a resemblance to those street lights. They are set up automatically in such a way that this stimulates the real movement of the bus on the road.

![lighting a set](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/lighting-a-set.gif)

The three projectors are set to give the street footage at the back scene to add more realism.

The three lights are set in the queue by the production team to get the memory of the protagonist. In the setup, soft lights are also added on top of all the upper windows of the bus to give blue interior light to the bus.

## Camera Techniques

The cameras used during filming play a major role in giving the cinematographic shots. All the techniques shown below are applied to the DSLRs and even the smartphones you use for filming.

### Prime lenses

The foremost and most helpful lenses in filming are called prime lenses, which have fixed focal lengths. There is no Johns to zoom out and zoom-in in prime lenses.

For filming, we need to choose the right level of zoom, which the DP does by picking the right lens for the footage.

![prime lens of the camera](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/prime-lens-of-the-camera.jpg)

In the close-up scenes, there is a requirement for a wider field of view which also depends on the aspect ratio of shooting.

## Aspect Ratio

In filmy view, the most appropriate aspect ratio is 2.35, which is also a cinematic ratio. There is also another ratio of 16:9, which is a wider ratio. While 2.35 gives a more narrow perspective as compared to the prior one.

![note](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** The narrow ratio is helpful in showing the relationships between the subjects.

![aspect ratio of the filming](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/aspect-ratio-of-the-filming.jpg)

Whenever we use a microscope, we are dealing with the aspect ratio and narrowing down to the required point where we want to look, and this is all about framing, which is discussed as shown below!

## Framing

Framing is a way used to illustrate the concepts such as the rule of thirds and leading lines. To give customized headroom to the subject, the framing is used from the top of the head and the top of the frame.

## Camera Movement

The camera movement actually shows the real story presented in the music video. The camera movements used for filming are mainly the pedestal, truck, pan, tilt, and roll.

![camera movements](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/camera-movements.jpg)

Whenever the protagonist looks out the bus's window, the camera operator will use the "Dolly" and "Trucking" movements.

### Trucking Movement

The trucking movement of the camera is done in left-to-right motion in the filming. This is used for emotional purposes and whenever the subject is in a pull-out shot.

### Dolly Movement

The dolly movement of the camera is done by moving towards or away from the subject. This often gives a sense of importance to the character.

## Final Words

The above article gives the exact preferences of the "Tokyo" song by which you learned a lot of techniques for your future use. By following the above rules and tips, you'll obviously come up with a viral music video.
