## Part 1 **How to Freeze-frame in After Effects**

This part explains how to **hold a frame in After Effects** and the working of the freeze-frame button. After Effects requires ample resources, and the layers need to be solo for the editing process to speed up.

This freeze-frame Effect temporarily freezes the selected layers while you continue editing the video and does not overload the After Effects editor. In addition, you can press the button again to remove the freeze. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use **Adobe After Effects to freeze-frame**:

**Step 1: Add Video Clip to Adobe After Effects**

First, make sure you have the AE composition open, and the video clip added. Next is to find the point where you want the video to "pause" or freeze by moving the time position indicator on the timeline.

**Step 2: Choose Layer for Freezing Frame**

Next, select the layer and then right-click on the layer to find Time in the menu that appears, and under Time find Freeze-frame and click it. Once done, the entire layer will get stuck on that frame.

## Part 1 **How to Freeze-frame in After Effects**

This part explains how to **hold a frame in After Effects** and the working of the freeze-frame button. After Effects requires ample resources, and the layers need to be solo for the editing process to speed up. However, sometimes you may need to see other objects in the scene, and that is where the freeze-frame button will be helpful. This freeze-frame Effect temporarily freezes the selected layers while you continue editing the video and does not overload the After Effects editor. In addition, you can press the button again to remove the freeze. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use **Adobe After Effects to freeze-frame**:

**Step 1: Add Video Clip to Adobe After Effects**

First, make sure you have the AE composition open, and the video clip added. Next is to find the point where you want the video to "pause" or freeze by moving the time position indicator on the timeline.

**Step 2: Choose Layer for Freezing Frame**

**Step 3: Add Multiple Layers for Effects**

Start the same way before and repeat it several times by splitting the layer, which means that After Effects will take the layer at the time position indicator and cut it into two layers. To achieve this, use the keyboard shortcut Command+Shift+D if you are using a Mac or Control+Shift+D if you are using a Windows operating system.

**Step 4: Zoom in**

Next, hit the plus (+) sign a few times to zoom into the timeline, move forward one frame, select the new layer, the one on top, and split the layer again using the keyboard shortcut, and now have three layers.

First, run Wondershare Filmora and add the video with the hoop dancer on the first track. Then, move the disco ball footage right above the first video track.

##### Step2 Add an animation keyframe

![add an animation keyframe](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1980s-2.jpg)

With the two videos imported on Filmora, move the playhead to the point where the hoop dancer begins to dance and double-click the disco ball footage.

![move the playhead to the point](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1980s-3.jpg)

Now find the **Animation** tab, then click the **Customize** tab. Next, click **Add** to apply a keyframe to this point of the video. Don't stop there. Move the playhead to the right and add another keyframe to the footage before changing the opacity to 50%.

![find the animation tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1980s-4.jpg)

Meanwhile, we'll add a keyframe to the third video with a lady removing her sunglasses. To do that, add the footage to the third track, then double-click the video track. After that, place the playhead at the start of the video and apply an animation keyframe before changing the opacity to 0%. Move the playhead a few keyframes forward and add another animation keyframe.

##### Step3 Add retro filters and effects to the video

![add retro filters and effects to the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1980s-5.jpg)

Go to the **Effect** tab and choose **Overlay**. Once that is done, select the **TV Static** option before choosing the **VHS Distortion** effect. This effect will give your video the retro feeling of the 1980s. Don't be afraid to try out the TV Static effects to find what works best in your video.

## Summary

Creating a retro-style 1980s film is as easy as pie with Wondershare Filmora. You can also check out more 80s-inspired video effects on Wondershare's Filmstock library. Ready to go back to the 80s? Hope so!
