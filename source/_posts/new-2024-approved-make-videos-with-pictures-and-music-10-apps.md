## Part 2 How to Make a Material Transparent in Blender

Blender is a top class graphic modulation tool; you can use to play with your editing creativity to your heart’s content, catering to a variety of design requirements, while adhering to a distinguished professional outlook. If you are pondering over the perfect task choice to start your editing journey with Blender, you can begin with making a material transparent in the software.

When beginning to create transparent artworks in Blender, you need to be familiar with the Transparent BSDF node. Here’s a quick explanation:

**Transparent BSDF Node**

When working with Blender, you get to access a variety of graphic nodes that cater to specific design purposes. Likewise, the transparent BSDF, as the name suggests, is an exclusive transparency creation graphic node that is essential to make materials transparent in Blender. Talking of the specific node function, it is there to facilitate the control of different transparency modes, in cohesion with specific user requirements.

Browse through the following section for a guided tutorial to make a material transparent using Blender:

**Step 1:**

Prepare a suitable BSDF material by selecting any image from your device and applying it to the object in the Blender’s viewport.

**Step 2:**

To start working with the Transparent BSDF node, you first need to insert the same into the node tree amongst the Principle BSDF and the Mix Shader nodes. To do this, you need to select ‘Add’ or press ‘Ctrl + A’, followed by locating the same in the ‘Shader’ submenu. Do not forget to add the ‘Mix Shader’ node, which is again, present in the ‘Shader’ submenu, to the node tree.

**Step 3:**

Plug in the Transparent BSDF output into the top Shader input of the Mix Shader, while dragging the latter into the connecting link between the Material Output and Principle BSDF nodes. This enables the Mix Shader node to pass through the two output generating nodes. The resultant ‘Transparency Effect’ can be seen on the viewpoint object within a few seconds.

**Step 4:**

Make an additional connection of two fresh nodes into the node tree as follows:

**●** Transparent BSDF output to the Mix Shader input

**●** Principal BSDF output to the Mix Shader input

**●** Mix Shader output to the Surface input

This will finally fetch a transparent material output for the selected image object.

## 4 Solutions to Resize a WebM File

People resize videos for many reasons, the most common one being to reduce file size. Others might be to meet a specification, or for compatibility. When you resize a video file, you reduce its file size considerably- making it load faster on devices, reduce processing time, and save a lot of space. Most people prefer watching videos that are smaller in size compared to larger ones, that’s why some social media sites like Instagram, Tiktok, etc have preferred video resolutions, so if you are a user on these sites you might want to resize your video to fit.

The biggest concern most people have about resizing videos is whether it will retain its quality, another concern is that you don’t want to crop out your video while resizing. If the format of the video is mp4, wmv, avi, etc which usually have very large size, resizing it might be a bit of a problem because the video quality will reduce a lot, but if it’s a WebM video file, you can still achieve a good video quality even after multiple compression or changing its resolution, that’s because its codecs- VP8 and VP9 were designed specifically for that, and it’s supported by all browsers.

In the course of this article, we’re assuming you already have a WebM video and you want to resize it, and still maintain its quality so you can upload on your favourite websites without any hassles. We have handpicked some proven methods to help you with that, let’s see them:
