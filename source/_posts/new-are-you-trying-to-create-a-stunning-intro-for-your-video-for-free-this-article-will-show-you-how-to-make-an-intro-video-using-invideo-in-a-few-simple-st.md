### 2.4 Make Fullscreen Tiktok Video

It can be a frustrating experience to watch a Tiktok video when you have the For you tab at the top, blocking your video. The like button and share buttons all do a number on your valuable screen space at the sides. The comment section with the scrolling ribbons of comments is the worst offender at making the TikTok video seem unappealing.

One way you can make your TikTok experience better is through full-screen viewing of your TikTok video. You can do this by simply saving the video to your phone. Save the video by pressing the share button. In the second half of the share section, you have the “save video” option, and you can select this for a blissful video viewing experience.

One other way users can view TikTok on full screen is to go to their android’s ‘settings’ page. Go into the ‘Display and Brightness’ settings. Look for the tab titled ‘Full-Screen Display”. In this section, scroll down to TikTok and select. Once there, enable ‘Notch Area Display.’

There you go, your TikTok account can now be graced with full-screen videos. This will make the user experience a lot better.

### Conclusion

One of the keys to creating high-quality content for your brand on social media is recognizing how much aspect ratio brings to the table and how to apply it to your videos and images. There is no doubt that using videos for promotion is the most effective technique to increase brand engagement nowadays.

To make it easy to cut, edit, and even design your images and movies for the most outstanding performance, use an excellent online video editor like Wondershare Filmora. It’s one of the best video editors for both beginners and experienced professionals.
