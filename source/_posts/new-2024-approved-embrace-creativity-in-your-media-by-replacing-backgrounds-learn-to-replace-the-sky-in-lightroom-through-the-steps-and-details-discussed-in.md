## Part 1 What Is AI Upscaling? And Why AI Upscaling Is Significant?

The process of generating or creating additional pixels of an image or frame in a video is AI Upscaling. This has many good results on the final video output.

This is mainly done to raise the bit rate of the video and, therefore, slightly improve the visual quality of the video. This is also used to improve the picture quality of DVDs and other low-quality videos. It is done to support lower quality videos or pictures on higher resolution screens like TV. This kind of upscaling is mostly done in TVs automatically.

## Part 2 How to Easily AI Upscale Video to 1080p or 4K?

The interesting part is that this upscaling is done by the higher resolution device itself.

## 20 Best LUTs for Music Videos

Have you ever wondered how music videos look so good and professional? One of the secrets lies in using LUTs, or Lookup Tables. With LUTs, music videos can match the song's mood and create a unique atmosphere for each track. Every music video has a different color grading, which helps convey the song's emotions and feelings.

Furthermore, using LUTs, music video creators can apply a consistent color grading to their videos. And the best part? You can also use **music video LUTs** to make your videos look more cinematic and professional, regardless of your level of expertise.

## Part 1: What Should One Know About LUTs?

LUTs are "Lookup Tables," which are small files containing color grading presets. In video editing or color-grading software, you can apply them to images or videos. Moreover, you can use **LUTs for music video color grading**, but first, learn more about LUTs.

Lookup Tables are often used in the film and video industry to give footage a particular look or feel. For instance, a vintage or retro LUT creates a more old-style feel with warmth and muddiness. They can help ensure that footage has a consistent color grading throughout a project. Moreover, they map the original footage's colors to new ones based on a predetermined color grading preset.

It makes applying a specific look to footage easy without manually adjusting individual colors or settings. There are different types of LUTs, like basic LUTs for overall color and contrast adjustments. Additionally, there are creative LUTs for specific looks and technical LUTs to correct color or exposure issues. You can create LUTs using software or purchase them from online marketplaces.
