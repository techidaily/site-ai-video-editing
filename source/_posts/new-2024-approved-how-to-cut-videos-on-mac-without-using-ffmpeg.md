**HOW TO CUT VIDEO ON MAC WITHOUT USING FFMPEG?**

What are FFmpeg and its cons for cut videos?

Without transcoding the media, FFmpeg can cut, trim, and extract videos. This is an excellent method for preserving original quality and avoiding generation loss.

Because of how keyframes work, it is impossible to cut at an exact point in time using FFmpeg without transcoding the video. As a result, you're left with a cut at the nearest keyframe.

Users can also use Avidemux to filter their videos, which include incorporating subtitles and color profiles, deinterlacing, resizing and sharpening the image of a video, and increasing or decreasing the overall volume of the audio.

Meanwhile, Avidemux has task automation features that make video processing and editing quick and painless.

If you are longing to pick up the best video cutter for Mac, you are supposed to evaluate it from different aspects, like operating interface, cutting features, output quality, post-processing ability, etc. Frankly speaking, there is no fixed answer. Everything depends on your actual requirements. If you want to cut videos on Mac with the forthright method, iMovie can be your top priority. If you prefer top-leading editing features, Blender is competitive enough for you.

**Conclusion:**

There you have it! Here is the alternative software to cut/shorten your video without using FFmpeg. All these editors cater to different needs, so be sure to try them out, understand your requirements, and use the right one for your project!

**Supported OS: Linux, BSD, Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows**

Avidemux offers three fundamental operations: cutting, encoding, and filtering. Cutting allows users to copy, paste, save, or delete a specific part of a video and is incredibly beneficial when users are only interested in a small portion of a video or want to remove commercials from a TV show that they have recorded.

Encoding, on the other contrary, is the way of transforming a video to various formats so that it can be played on different players. Users of Avidemux can use this feature on videos they want to use for business or archive for personal use. They could also use this to convert a video that they intend to post online.

Users can also use Avidemux to filter their videos, which include incorporating subtitles and color profiles, deinterlacing, resizing and sharpening the image of a video, and increasing or decreasing the overall volume of the audio.

Meanwhile, Avidemux has task automation features that make video processing and editing quick and painless. A feature called Joblist allows users to organize their projects in a queue so that they can access their files from a single location. They can use this queue to handle videos in bulk as well.

This software program additionally enables batch processing, which converts a couple of video files at the same time. Additionally, a plethora of presets are available to guide you to the preferred output without having to tinker with a plethora of options.

Handbrake is a powerful and excellent video converter for Windows, Mac, and Linux that should not be overlooked. It provides all of the necessary features in a simple tool that gives the user complete control over the output. Before we get into the specifics, here's a rundown of Handbrake's advantages and disadvantages.

**Supported OS: Linux, BSD, Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows**

Avidemux offers three fundamental operations: cutting, encoding, and filtering. Cutting allows users to copy, paste, save, or delete a specific part of a video and is incredibly beneficial when users are only interested in a small portion of a video or want to remove commercials from a TV show that they have recorded.

Encoding, on the other contrary, is the way of transforming a video to various formats so that it can be played on different players. Users of Avidemux can use this feature on videos they want to use for business or archive for personal use. They could also use this to convert a video that they intend to post online.

Users can also use Avidemux to filter their videos, which include incorporating subtitles and color profiles, deinterlacing, resizing and sharpening the image of a video, and increasing or decreasing the overall volume of the audio.

Meanwhile, Avidemux has task automation features that make video processing and editing quick and painless. A feature called Joblist allows users to organize their projects in a queue so that they can access their files from a single location. They can use this queue to handle videos in bulk as well.

* Full Editing Control
* Simple Interface
* Open Source

**Supported OS: Linux, BSD, Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows**

Avidemux offers three fundamental operations: cutting, encoding, and filtering.

Users of Avidemux can use this feature on videos they want to use for business or archive for personal use. They could also use this to convert a video that they intend to post online.

Users can also use Avidemux to filter their videos, which include incorporating subtitles and color profiles, deinterlacing, resizing and sharpening the image of a video, and increasing or decreasing the overall volume of the audio.

Meanwhile, Avidemux has task automation features that make video processing and editing quick and painless. A feature called Joblist allows users to organize their projects in a queue so that they can access their files from a single location. They can use this queue to handle videos in bulk as well.

## Part 5\. TS VS. MP4: What's the Difference?

What is the difference between the TS file format and MP4? Allow us to tell you some. You might have read about both formats, but a few differences are discussed as follows:

### TS

TS format is used in DVD and Blu-ray discs that you have on your respective device. It does the same work as MP4, but the TS file breaks the data into tiny chinks. TS format comprises a few elements, making it a faster transporter for MPEG-2 format compressed video data. It is used widely in broadcasting and streaming.

### MP4

MP4 is considered more compatible as compared to TS format, as not all the software allows the '.ts' extension. If the file is not transmitted properly or is not closed properly, it can lose the data it has. MP4 is divided into two parts, one has the media data, and the other has metadata. Due to compression differences in both formats, it has a smaller size than the TS format.

## Part 1\. What Is TS Video Format?

A TS format file is a Video Transport Stream file. The TS file extension is used to store video data, mostly on DVDs. The video files are standardly compressed with .MPEG video compression. If you are looking for a file extension to save streamed or broadcast videos, TS video format is ideal for this. Are you worried about how to play a TS file?

![what is ts format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/ts-file-format-1.jpg)

Well, a video file with this format can easily be played on a certain media player or [video editing program](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Various video playback apps, video development tools, and also DVD creation programs support the TS format. The .ts file extension can also contain any data, and TS files don't always need to store media or documents.

## Part 2\. Pros and Coins about TS Video Format

Everything has its beneficial factors and disadvantages, so does TS video format has. Are you ready to know more about the TS file format? After learning about the format, it’s time to share its advantages and drawbacks with you. Let’s get started!

### Advantages of TS File Format

A great thing about TS format is that, after each keyframe, the file information is added automatically. The format is impressive when it comes to maintaining transmission integrity. This is because of all the elementary streams, synchronization patterns, and error corrections; everything is encapsulated in a container format.

Do you know what else benefits TS format has? It is widely used for broadcasting because broadcasting doesn’t need the complete stream for playing it. You can easily share large files over the communication media in real-time as tiny chunks of the audio or video file are sent. Along with this, the error is easily detected as extra information is shared with every chunk, helping in error detection.

### Drawbacks of TS File Format

Moving on to its disadvantages, let’s start with the device compatibility. The biggest drawback of using the TS file format is that it is not compatible with many devices. For instance, a built-in media player like Windows Media Player does not support the format; eventually, users must change the file format.

Do you know another significant disadvantage? You cannot share TS files online. Different platforms like Facebook, YouTube, etc., support other famous formats, so hence, sharing TS video files requires a format converter. Do you know how much space does a TS file occupies? Well, it acquires a significant storage space, more than other file formats.

## Part 3\. How to Play TS Video Files with VLC Media Player?
