## Part 2: How to Get Motion Blur in Valorant?

In Valorant, you cannot add motion blur directly. Thus, to create **motion blur Valorant**, you can modify the settings of the recorder while recording your gameplay. To use the recording settings for creating a motion blur effect, here are useful instructions:

Step1 Before recording your gameplay, open your recorder and head to its settings. From there, go to the “Output” section and change the video format to MP4\. Once done, make sure to select “NIVIDIA” as your encoder. Moreover, choose “CQP” as your rate control and set 20 as the value of the CQ level.

Step2 On the same window, select your preset as “Max Performance” and profile as "High." Now go to the "Video" tab and select the value of base resolution and output resolution as “1920x1080”. Choose the numerator as 300 and the denominator as 1\. Make sure that the minimum value of the numerator should not less than 180.

Step3 Now head to the "Advanced" tab and select process priority as "Below Normal." Now head to the "Recording" section below and select the filename formatting according to your need. You can also adjust the settings of the stream display and automatically reconnect, preferably. Once done with all the recorder settings, click on the "OK" button.
