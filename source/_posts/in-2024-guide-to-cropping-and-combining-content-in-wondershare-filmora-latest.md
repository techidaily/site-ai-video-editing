This method is suitable if you have shot a video at a higher frame rate. This method is also plain and requires a few clicks to complete. Following is the detailed guide to creating a **DaVinci Resolve slow-motion smooth**:

**Step 1:** Once you have imported the video in the timeline, navigate towards the Media Pool. From there, find your clip, right-click on it, and click the "Clip Attributes" option.

![access clip attributes settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/slow-motion-in-davinci-resolve-4.jpg)

**Step 2:** From the Clip Attributes window, go to the "Video" tab and expand "Video Frame Rate." From the appearing frame rate options, select a lesser frame rate.

### AI-Backed Video Editing Features of Wondershare Filmora

Wondershare Filmora is a multifunctional software designed to increase productivity. Its AI technology enhances an editor’s productivity by offering automated options. This section emphasizes some of the AI-driven video editing features of Filmora:

#### 1\. [AI Copilot Editing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

You can ask its AI copilot feature anything about accessing effects or functions. It will give you detailed directions on it along with CTA buttons for direct access.

![ai copilot editing filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/slow-motion-in-davinci-resolve-8.jpg)

#### 2\. [AI Text-to-Video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

If you have an idea for a video but not the skill to create it, Filmora has got you covered. Using this feature, you can craft a proper video from text. You just need to add a script or textual direction in the prompt section. AI will handle and insert the AI voice, text, and graphics independently.

![ai text to video filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/slow-motion-in-davinci-resolve-9.jpg)

#### 3\. [AI Copywriting](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)
