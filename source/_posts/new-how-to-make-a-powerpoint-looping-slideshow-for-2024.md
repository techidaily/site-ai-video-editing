## What’re the Best Alternatives to Pexels?

Sites like Pexels provide you with royalty-free images to include in your messages to further their impact. Although Pexels is a great resource for royalty-free photos and animations, it is not without its limitations. Here is a list of Pexels alternatives for you to consider when creating content. It includes reasons why the sites are suitable alternatives and brief guides on how to get started on them.

## Part1: What are the best alternatives to Pexels?

There are several factors to consider when selecting a suitable image resource for your messaging. For example, you may consider a site favorable to another because of its intuitive user interface, or you may consider another because it has no pesky advertisements. Taking this into consideration, here is a list of the three best Pexels alternatives worth checking out for your next project.

### No.1 Unsplash

![unsplash](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/pexels-alternatives-1.jpg)

Unsplash is a stock photo-sharing website run by Getty Images. According to recent reports, the site hosts over 265,000 photographers contributing to a library of over 3.5 million photos. Initially, all photos were under a creative commons license zero, meaning you could distribute the photos without restriction. However, following lobbying from some creators, all photos are now under the Unsplash license.

This means you can still copy, modify, share, and download images for free. However, under the new licensing terms, you cannot use unedited copies of the images for commercial purposes such as T-Shirt printing or branding and using the photos on a similar or competing service.

Most Unsplash users praise it for the following features:

* The library contains tons of high-resolution photos.
* You can access the site through your web browser or the app available on Android and iOS devices.
* There are no download limits to the photos, and everything is free.
* Unsplash is a plugin for various content editing software such as Filmora 11, Adobe XD, and Figma.

Despite all the positives, here are a few improvements to make Unsplash even better.

* The website lacks a free HD video library, which would be a great addition for aspiring content creators.
* In addition, the search algorithm is not as accurate, and you may struggle to find suitable images for your subject matter.

### No.2 Shutterstock

Another Pexels alternative to consider is Shutterstock. It is an online resource where individuals and businesses can access high-quality, licensed photos, videos, illustrations, vectors, and music for their content creation.

![shutterstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/pexels-alternatives-2.jpg)

Unlike Unsplash above, you need to create an account to access Shutterstock services. In addition, the website offers different pricing models for each user, depending on your unique requirements. For example, you can subscribe to an image-only subscription that allows you ten image downloads monthly for $29\. Alternatively, you can purchase the Mix and Match subscription that offers you 25 credits monthly to download different media from the site.

Currently, the website boasts a collection of over 200 million royalty-free images and over 10 million video clips. In addition, the company also offers a percentage-based compensation model to contributors, with first-timers earning up to 15% of content sales. Furthermore, the site continues to populate its library through the acquisition of different companies in a similar space. Some of its notable acquisitions include Turbosquid, Bigstock, Rex Features, and BEImages.

### No.3 Filmstock \[Editor's Choices\]

![filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/pexels-alternatives-3.jpg)

Filmstock is an online library of different editing resources for filmmakers. Some of the resources you can obtain are effects, elements, titles, and audio. In addition, Filmstock is the most recent version of the formerly known Filmora Effects Store. Regardless of the close association with Filmora Video Editing Software, you can still use these resources in your creations on other programs.

Filmstock currently offers its services in three categories. They are:

* A Free package that allows you unlimited downloads of media effects and resources under a royalty-free license. However, any resource you download from the site comes with a Filmora tag.
* The Standard subscription will cost you $9.99 per month and includes free technical support as an additional feature to those available in the free package.
* Finally, the Premium subscription gives you access to the premium library that contains an exclusive selection of the contributors' commercial work. The package will cost you $32.99 monthly and also includes all the features in the previous subscription models.

Kindly note that you must register for a Filmstock or Wondershare account to use the service. In addition, you will need to purchase a separate license to use the service with Filmora Video Editing software.

### No.4 Getty Images

![getty images](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/pexels-alternatives-4.jpg)

Getty Images is an online supplier of media resources for media, creative, and corporate clients. It boasts a resource library of over 477 million entries. Access to the site requires you to create a user account. In addition, some of the prints you will find on the site will require you to make a purchase, depending on the size and quality.

### No.5 iStock

![istock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/pexels-alternatives-5.jpg)

iStock is an online library of creative resources, including music, videos, illustrations, and images. In addition, the site offers access to its exclusive stock-image library through different subscription models. Some of the platforms appealing features include the following:

* An AI-powered search engine that provides more accurate results than Pexels.
* Preset templates for easier creation of videos and social media posts.

### No.6 Flickr

![flickr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/pexels-alternatives-6.jpg)

Flickr is another alternative to Pexels worth considering. This is because it offers you free and paid access to one of the internet's largest creative libraries. In addition, you can select from several licenses, including creative commons and U.S. Government works licenses for your assets, something other similar sites lack in their offering.

### No.7 Pixabay

![pixabay](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/pexels-alternatives-7.jpg)

Pixabay gives you access to over 1 million creative assets in different categories, including videos, music, and sound effects. In addition, the site offers its content under the creative commons zero licenses, meaning you can use all stock photos without fear of backlash. Although the site's search function requires work on its accuracy, the numerous categories make it easier to pinpoint your desired image.

### No.8 Adobe Stock

![adobe stock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/pexels-alternatives-8.jpg)

Another site like Pexels is Adobe Stock, where you can access millions of creative assets for your content. Depending on your licensing options, the site offers free and paid access to its services. For example, you can increase your creativity by subscribing to the different Adobe design assets, including Adobe Stock Vector and Adobe Stock Illustrations.

### No.9 Vista Create

![vista create](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/pexels-alternatives-9.jpg)

Vista Create is an online free photo and image website like Pexels that also includes design tools to alter the images to your liking. In addition, you have plenty of templates to suit different platform requirements, including social media sites such as Facebook and Instagram. Furthermore, Vista Creare also boasts a wide collection of vectors, which you can customize in three easy steps.

### No.10 LibreStock

![librestock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/pexels-alternatives-10.jpg)

Unlike the ones above, LIbreStock is an aggregator site that combines stock photo databases in a single platform. As such, it is arguably the largest provider of royalty-free images on the web. In addition, it automatically filters out poor-quality images, guaranteeing you excellence each time.

Most LibreStock users name the website's search function as its best feature. This is because it also utilizes search tags when scanning through different databases. As such, you can easily find unique stock photos for your creation, regardless of how outrageous the search tag is. Finally, LibreStock provides its content under the creative commons zero licenses, meaning you can use the assets for personal and commercial work.

### No.11 StockSnap

![stocksnap](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/pexels-alternatives-11.jpg)

StockSnap operates similarly to Pexels, as it also offers a variety of free stock photos and images. However, a few tweaks to how you receive these creative assets make it slightly better. For example, StockSnap allows you to download ten free images from Shutterstock if what you need is unavailable in their library.

In addition, the platform also displays the most recent additions to their library in the top search results. As such, you are guaranteed to receive unique pictures without significant overuse.

## Part2: FAQs

### What is better than Pexels?

From the above information, Unsplash ranks as the best alternative to Pexels. This is because of its user-friendly interface, availability across web-based and smartphones, and compatibility with different video editing software such as Adobe XD and [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). As such, its versatility allows you to always create on the go.

### Can I use Pexels on YouTube?

Yes, you can use Pexels on YouTube, provided you apply the creative assets to your material. In addition, you will need to make alterations to Pexels images and videos before using them to avoid violating your license agreement.

## Turn Your Text Into a Podcast Made Possible

Being a content creator, either writing or generating videos, requires podcast text-to-speech knowledge. The impact of content depends on how many people see it. It means finding new ways to get it into real and virtual places where customers and users might be.

Depending on the context, podcasting can be a perfect alternative for sharing content.

This article will address your questions about the easiest way to turn a blog into a podcast. Let's begin with the reasons why you should do a podcast.

## Part 1\. Why You Should Podcast

Podcasts are one of the simplest and most cost-effective ways. It helps to advertise yourself and your products to a highly targeted audience. Podcasts are also excellent for engaging with potential clients interested in your content. In your field, you can achieve fame and expertise.

![effective podcast](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/podcast-text-to-speech-1.jpg)

### Repurposing of Content

Podcasters can maximize their potential for successful episodes and repurposing their podcast into multiple content pieces.

This podcasting strategy can help you reach more people by putting your podcasts on more channels and engaging more people who might be interested.

### More Fulfilling than Articles

Unlike music, news, TV, and social media, podcast listeners don't have to watch the screen like they do with YouTube videos or TV shows. This means they can listen while walking or driving home from work.

Podcasts are the best way to get people to pay attention and make fundamental societal changes. They can keep people interested for a long time, so you can go into detail and get personal without turning off your audience.

### Minimal Start-Up Costs

To start a podcast, you can spend a little money. Even some of the most famous podcasts use a microphone, a computer, and software for recording. But it's common to spend more money on advertising and better hosting.

Starting a podcast doesn't cost much, as you can get everything you need for about $145.

### Expansion of Search Potential

In the past few years, many big brands and small to medium-sized businesses have started using podcasts as a marketing strategy. This is because podcasts are becoming more and more popular and can help raise your company's profile.

Podcasting is another way to disseminate your study to a broader audience, whether that audience consists of policymakers or interested citizens.

### Potential to Monetize

Using an affiliate program podcast, you can earn money. Businesses can increase their income by offering paid advertising sponsorships to monetize podcasts. Suppose you accept an affiliate offer to sell ads. In that case, you become the company's voice and put recorded ads in your podcast episodes.

The most common way to make money from a podcast is through sponsorship. It's also the easiest way to make money because you don't have to make or sell anything. You just have to make a deal with a sponsor.

## Part 2\. Why Are Writers Hesitant to Start a Podcast?

Even after knowing all these benefits, writers are still hesitant to start a podcast. One of the main reasons a writer may be reluctant to launch a podcast is the cost of the necessary equipment. You will need at least $80 to $500 for this unpromissing business.

However, let me tell you a secret that many podcastors didn't buy any audio equipment for the launch of their podcast channel on Spotify.

Moreover, many writers don’t want to show their voice through recordings. This is because they couldn’t just make a recording and hand it off to a sound specialist. Besides, finding their voice through the stories they write is the routine.

But we all need to get the truth that many podcastors don't record a single word of the podcast with their own voice. Due to a solution: text-to-speech, technology like this has been around for a while and continues to improve.

The two important issues have been solved, so what are you waiting for? Platform building has always relied heavily on content marketing. With blog posts and social media, additional support was provided, and now podcasts are becoming more commonplace.

## Part 3\. How to Turn a Text Into a Podcast?

### Text To Speech

To turn your text into audible content, Text-to-speech (TTS) is an assistive technology. With a single click, TTS reads your written text aloud. Many people also use it for writing and editing to maintain audience concentration.

Text-to-speech technology is compatible with all digital devices, including computers, tablets, and smartphones. Increasing numbers of websites and products now have developed this function. For example, you can find it within the trusted video editing software like Filmora. With [Filmora's Text to Speech (TTS) feature](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you may add extra aspects to your video by turning your text files into voiceovers.

**Why we regard text to speech as a good**

For writers, imagination is the only tool to construct their stories. To bring our stories to life, all we need is a laptop. The same holds for text-to-speech technologies, which can significantly assist writing and editing by allowing the author to hear their words without using their voice.

* Text-to-speech applications can assist you in repurposing your material.

Your written work can be converted into spoken language or a podcast. A podcast can be converted into a YouTube video with a few alterations. All of these factors can help you reach new audiences.

Repurposing material permits your audience to consume it in a variety of ways. The audience can read, listen to, or view your content.

* Text-to-speech systems enable authors to create information that is accessible.

As per World Health Organization, there are almost 285 million visually impaired persons and 39 million blind people. We writers can create a more inclusive world by constantly keeping accessibility in mind.

**The limitations of text to speech**

Text-to-speech software is becoming increasingly lifelike thanks to technological advancements. However, it cannot still express genuine human emotions. However, this should allow you to utilize these tools. The positives significantly exceed the disadvantages, and technology is continually improving.
