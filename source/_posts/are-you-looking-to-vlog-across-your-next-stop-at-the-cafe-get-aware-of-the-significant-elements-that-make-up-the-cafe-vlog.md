## Do You Need to Make Your Video More Immersive? You Can Make It 60 FPS to Achieve That. And Here Are the 5 Best Tools that You Can Use

Is the video you have too fast-paced? Does it show an action sequence or an intense basketball game? All the movement could make the video blurry. Changing the video to 60 FPS makes it better and crisper. So how can you do that? You can **convert video to 60 FPS** using these 5 excellent tools.

## Why Convert Video to 60 FPS?

Perhaps you forgot to film your video in 60 FPS or 120 FPS. You can leave it at 30 FPS if you want to. But some videos look choppy when in that setting. By doubling the frames in the video, you make it a lot smoother. The motion will look so much more fluid. Consequently, that will let your viewers have a fantastic, immersive watching experience.

Do you plan to put the video in slow motion? That's another great reason to convert the video to 60 FPS. Again, this makes the motion more fluid. So when you add the slow-motion effect, it just gets better. Not doing so will lead to terrible video quality, which your viewers would surely not like.
