What makes it so popular is how it captures fast-moving scenes in better detail. Access to the slow-motion effect was not so common, but with apps like [**iMovie slow-mo**](https://www.apple.com/imovie/), the effect is accessible to everyone. You can use online video editors or desktop editing software to make slow-motion videos.
