### How to make OBS green screen settings better

Using green screens for filmmaking isn't the most complicated or difficult thing in the world but it certainly has its pitfalls. If you ask any experienced filmmaker what to look out for when using a green screen, chances are they're going to mention lighting about a billion times and that's for good reason.

### Tips on How to make OBS green screen settings better

* Evenly light your green screen so you can get a good key.
* Watch out for light flares. Use some a matte box or your trusty paw to block out any unwanted light.
* When lighting, try to create as much separation between your subject and the green screen as you can.
* Shutter speed: Minimize motion blur by raising your shutter speed to 1/80 or 1/100
* Aperture: Setting your aperture to f4 or f5.6 will give you slightly more depth of field, which will blur and smooth out your green screen.
* Format: Set your camera to the best recording format it has.
* ISO: Try to avoid high ISOs.

Apart from the videos shot by your digital devices, you can also directly import media files by recording video from your webcam, capturing the computer screen, or recording a voice-over.

Record computer screen:

Click the "Record" option, and choose "Record PC Screen" to get the built-in Wondershare Screen Recorder. Hit the red button to get started. If you want to stop the recording, you can hit F9.

Record videos from webcam:

Also, click the "Record" option, and choose "Record from Webcam". In the pop-up Video Recording window, click the red button to start recording and click it again to stop recording. Then click OK to save the recorded video file.

Record voice-over:

Choose "Record a voiceover" under the Record menu. It would be better to connect a microphone to your Mac for a better result. Hit the Record button, and it leaves you 3 seconds to get ready.

All the recorded media files will be saved into Media Library automatically and you can drag them to the Timeline for editing.

Pro tip:

You can follow the instructions above and live stream to multiple platforms at once with Restream. Multistreaming to platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Twitch, and LinkedIn allows you to drastically increase the audience reach and grow your followers.

### How to make OBS green screen settings better

Using green screens for filmmaking isn't the most complicated or difficult thing in the world but it certainly has its pitfalls. If you ask any experienced filmmaker what to look out for when using a green screen, chances are they're going to mention lighting about a billion times and that's for good reason.

### Tips on How to make OBS green screen settings better

* Evenly light your green screen so you can get a good key.
* Watch out for light flares. Use some a matte box or your trusty paw to block out any unwanted light.
* When lighting, try to create as much separation between your subject and the green screen as you can.
* Shutter speed: Minimize motion blur by raising your shutter speed to 1/80 or 1/100
* Aperture: Setting your aperture to f4 or f5.6 will give you slightly more depth of field, which will blur and smooth out your green screen.
* Format: Set your camera to the best recording format it has.
* ISO: Try to avoid high ISOs.
