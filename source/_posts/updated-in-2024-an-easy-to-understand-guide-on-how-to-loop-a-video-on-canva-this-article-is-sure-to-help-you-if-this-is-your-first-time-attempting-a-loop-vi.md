## Part 2: Alternative Way to Loop a Video

If you're using a [video editing software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) like Adobe Premiere or Final Cut Pro, it is likely that you have seen the generic technique of looping a video is by splitting it in two and pasting it together again. What if you need to put on repeat just one individual cut? This is where [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) steps in! It is a handy tool for trimming and adding clips into your recordings.

The Filmora software can be used to quickly create continual sequences of any duration, irrespective of how long the footage is. It makes possible to synchronize sound and video clips, splice them into one another, and even add titles and motion graphics for a special effect. If you utilize Filmora, you do not need to be an expert in video editing to make professional-looking results. Let us explore why Filmora is necessary for video editing.

Filmora is a video editing software that allows you to make professional-looking videos from your footage. It has a loop feature that lets you create seamless loops where each clip in the sequence plays over and over until you stop it. This can be useful for creating music videos, for example, or for creating small clips that loop seamlessly through the whole video.

The loop feature in Filmora software is a great way to put your video editing skills to the test. It allows you to edit a clip of any length and then play it back over and over again, which can be useful when you're looking for an ideal looping point or want to see how long a clip is before going back to find out why it didn't work.

## How to Use Zoom in Google

Zoom in and out is a feature in every presentation/editing tool, but we generally forget its importance until it is unavailable, and you will need alternatives. You imagine a situation where you will have to zoom in on the sheet in the presentation because your client is sitting far from the projector. After the presentation, you will have to zoom out, so the sheet becomes normal. **Zoom in google** is our daily activity on a computer.

Previously there were no such options in Google sheet to zoom or out. But, now Google has come up with this new feature. This article will explore the steps to zoom in and out of the whole page and the elements of Google Chrome. Now we will know about several ways of using the Zoom control. Let's start.

## Part 1: 6 Steps for using Zoom control in Google

##### Step1Using the keyboard to use the zoom control

The Easiest and quickest way of using Zoom control is keyboard shortcuts. You will have to press Ctrl and then “+” sign to zoom in; to zoom out, you will have to press Ctrl and – sign. If you want to return to the default size, click on Ctrl and press "0".

##### Step2Using Zoom control from the menu

Users can even use **Google Zoom to** control their main menu if you want to find the zoom control, tap or click on the Menu button of chrome.

##### Step3Using zoom control

In **the zoom-in Google** section, you will have to tap or click on the "+" option to zoom in and click on the – sign to zoom out. After completion, you can press the ESC key to hide the menu.

![how to use zoom in google](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/zoom-control-google.jpg)

##### Step4Making Zoom adjustments

Once you are done using **Google Zoom**, users can make adjustments using a magnifying glass, which appears in the address bar. Click on that and press "+" to zoom in and – to zoom out, or you can press the reset button to come back to default level.

![how to use zoom in google](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/make-zoom-adjustments.jpg)

##### Step5Changing the Zoom level

You can even set the custom zoom level so that each web page opens up with the text at a large size while launching. You can click on the menu button of chrome, then tap on the Settings option.

![how to use zoom in google](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/change-zoom-level-google.jpg)

##### Step6Set zoom level

You can type "Page Zoom" in the search box. You can even click on the appearance on the left side. Click on the drop-down menu and tap on default zoom.

![how to use zoom in google](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/set-page-zoom-level.jpg)

## Part 2: How to Use the Zoom Control on Google Docs

Step1Open the document.

Step2Click on the Zoom button.

Step3Select the zoom level.

This article will discuss the information on **Zoom into Google Docs.**

Several options are shared in all Google Apps. Users can share the Google files such as slideshows, spreadsheets, and documents from Google Drive or in-app. You can derive the zoom settings and many more in the app or drive.

Many productive applications we use on the PC will have a hundred percent zoom level which is the default. Depending upon the distance you sit from your monitor or the visual quality, the zoom level will be decided. If you find reading the word on the PC screen difficult, you must change the zoom level in your Google Docs.
