Editing time-lapse videos on a computer is not an easy task because it requires you to have the right software and know how to use it.

It can be quite time-consuming and tedious work, which is why we need a proper editing program that can help us through this process. It's just about learning the basics of editing and then adding a few effects to make your video more interesting. Here are some tips on how you can edit time-lapse videos on your computer:

* The first thing you need to do is download and install a video editor for your computer.
* Import the timelapse footage into the video editing program that you have downloaded and installed, such as Adobe Premiere Pro or Sony Vegas Pro, etc.
* Now you need to trim out any unwanted footage at the beginning or end of the clip so that what remains is just what you want to show in your final video.
* The next step is to add transitions between scenes, such as fades, wipes, dissolves, or cuts between shots - this will help transition between scenes smoothly and seamlessly without any abrupt jumps in time or space between them while also adding an extra level of polish.

Time-lapse videos can help you produce stunning results, no matter what your creative goals may be. If you want to create a time-lapse video, there are many things you need to consider. Time-lapse videos are not just a series of photos strung together. And the most important thing you need to consider is the format of the video you'll need to take.

Choosing the right editing software is also important if you're using a camera that shoots time-lapse videos. And if you're using a DSLR camera, there is a chance that your time-lapse videos are in MOV format. If that's the case, then you're in luck.
