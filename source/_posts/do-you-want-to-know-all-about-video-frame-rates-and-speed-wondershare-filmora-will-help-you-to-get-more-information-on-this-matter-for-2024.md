There are several professional video editing tools like Wondershare Filmora and others that can help you add effects, transitions, overlays, filters, and customize files as needed. Additional elements like graphs, charts, and more can also be added to the presentation.

There are several professional video editing tools like Wondershare Filmora and others that can help you add effects, transitions, overlays, filters, and customize files as needed. Additional elements like graphs, charts, and more can also be added to the presentation.

![how to use lumetri scope in after effects - evaluate tonal and brightness](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/lumetri-color-after-effects-8.jpg)

Click on the wrench icon to view the intensities, then pick the "Presets" option > “Waveform RBG.” A drop-down menu (RGB, YC, Luma, and YC no Chroma) will be displayed that allows you to do the readings.

![how to use lumetri scope in after effects - evaluate color and brigntess intensities](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/lumetri-color-after-effects-9.jpg)
