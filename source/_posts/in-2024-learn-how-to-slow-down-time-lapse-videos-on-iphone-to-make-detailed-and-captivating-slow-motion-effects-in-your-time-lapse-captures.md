02 [How to use Lumetri Color in Adobe After Effects](#part2)

03 [Is there a simple way to Unionise the Color of my Video?](#part3)

## Does After Effects have Lumetri Color?

Yes, there is lumetri color in After Effects. Lumetri Color allows you to adjust contrast, light, and color to your video based on your preference. With After Effects, you can carry out various color customizations in the Lumerti panel without exiting your current project.

Furthermore, the Lumetri color panel in Adobe After Effects allows you to export your settings to another different premiere pro project wholly. Usually, the file is exported as a .cube file – This relieves you from the wearisomeness of creating new grading features.

## How to use Lumetri Color in Adobe After Effects

You don't need to be a pro for you to use Lumetri Color in Adobe After Effects. The color workspace in Adobe After Effect is designed to be straightforward and user-friendly.

The Lumetri Color panel in Adobe contains the histogram, vectorscope, parade scope, and waveform monitor. The histogram, parade scope, and waveform monitor display image intensity, whereas the vectorscope display hue and color saturation.

Lumetri Color is considered an ultimate choice by most editors due to its wide range of functionalities. Some of the functionalities in the Lumetri panel include:

#### 1\. Vignettes

Vignette is an outstanding feature that effortlessly allows Lumetri users to adjust lightness and darkness using sliders.

Vignettes allow you to darken the borders and highlight certain parts. You will therefore create more emphasis on highlighted parts in your clip.

#### 2\. HSL Secondary

When you want to get exceptional footage controls, HSL Secondary (Hue, Saturation, and Luminance) is often the best functionality. HSL Secondary easily separates your footage and works on a selected piece.

With the functionality, you can easily manipulate the skin tones in your footage and refocus images.

![how to use lumetri color in after effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/lumetri-color-after-effects-1.jpg)

#### 3\. Curves

The Lumetri panel in Adobe After Effects renders its users the curves functionality. There are two curves in the Lumetri Panel, i.e., Hue Saturation curves and luminesce curves.

The Hue/Saturation curve uses the red, green, and blue (RBG) flagship, whereas the luminance curve helps manage the frame curve's tone.

![lumetri color in after effect - curves](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/lumetri-color-after-effects-2.jpg)

#### 4\. Fx Bypass

Fx Bypass is a new functionality feature in the Lumetri panel. It allows you to bypass and reset effects without switching to the controls panel.

### How to use Lumetri Color

With your Adobe After Effects, you can make quick and advanced color changes to your clips. Here are the simple steps on how to use Lumetri Color.

### Step 1\. Add your footage to the timeline

First, open your Adobe After Effect and add your video file to the software. Drag and drop to add it to the timeline.

![how to use lumetri color in after effects- add footage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/lumetri-color-after-effects-3.jpg)

### Step 2\. Open Lumetri Color

Here, you highlight your video in the timeline, then head over to the “Window” menu. From the drop-down menu, select “Effects & presets” > "Lumetri Color."

Alternatively, you can go to the "Effects" menu, which is at the left-hand side of your interface, then select "Color Correction"> "Lumetri Color."

![how to use lumetri color in after effects- open lumetri color](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/lumetri-color-after-effects-4.jpg)

### Step 3\. Carry out your Color Grading and Saturation

With the "Lumetri Color" functionality, you can carry out various adjustable settings such as tone, hue, saturation and color grading.

To carry out saturation:

Click on the " Hue/Saturation " from the drop-down menu in "Lumetri Color." You can change the color of the entire footage by adjusting the "Master Hue" from the Effects Control Panel.

Alternatively, you can opt to fine-tune the freshly selected color by using the "Master Saturation" and Master Lightness."

To carry out color grading:

* After opening the "Lumetri Color" panel as in step 2 above, click on the eyedropper to select the curve you want to use.
* Click the color in your footage that you wish to adjust. Usually, when you use the eyedropper, three points will be added to the graph. The two bottom points restrict color selection to a minimum range, whereas the first represents your selected color.

### How to Use Lumetri Scope

Besides the Lumetric Color, Lumetric Scope is another essential tool for post-film production in Adobe After Effects. The color correcting tool, Lumetric scope guarantees its users' accurate results when used correctly.

When carrying out color corrections in films, it is advisable to use quality monitor calibrators and paint your workspace walls neutral grey. Usually, it reduces lighting distraction and the external color effect, respectively.

However, not every editor can meet all the required basics, and that is where Lumetri scope comes in. Lumetri Scope allows one to get the best color results in their videos. Here are the steps on how to use Lumetri Scope:

![how to use lumetri scope in after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/lumetri-color-after-effects-6.jpg)

### Step 1\. Open Lumetric Scope

First, open your Adobe After Effect application and add your footage to the timeline. Go to the " Window " menu at the top-left-hand side of your interface.

In the drop-down menu, select "Lumetri Scopes" or "Workspaces," then click on the "Color" option.

The Lumetri Scope tab will be displayed adjacent to the timeline footage.

### Step 2\. Evaluate Hue and Saturation using Vectorscope

In the Lumetri Scope tab, click on the wrench icon, and a drop-down menu will be displayed. From the menu, select "Vectorscope YUV" and read the saturation. When reading saturation, begin from the center going outwards.

Hue, on the other hand, is read in a circular direction.

![how to use lumetri scope in after effects - evaluate hue and Saturation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/lumetri-color-after-effects-7.jpg)

### Step 3\. Evaluate the tonal values and Brightness using Histogram

The histogram in Lumetri Scope displays an image's tonal values and brightness levels.

To measure the brightness and tonal values, go back to the Lumetri Scope panel and click on the wrench icon. Click on "Presets" from the drop-down menu and select "Histogram."

The scale in the histogram starts from 0 (pure black) to 225 (pure white). You, therefore, need to view the number of pixels for every color horizontally when reading.
