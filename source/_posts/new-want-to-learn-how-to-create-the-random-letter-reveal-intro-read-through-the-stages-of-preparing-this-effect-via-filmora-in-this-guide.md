## Want to Learn How to Create the Random Letter Reveal Intro? Read Through the Stages of Preparing This Effect via Filmora in This Guide

The introductions in the video can create a major feel for the rest of the video in the viewers' minds. So, most film and video makers focus on developing different styles of appealing and visually vibrant intro title formats for their projects.

Currently, one of the unique types of title format that is popular today among Youtubers and filmmakers is the style of random letters appearing on screen until the main title forms.

![example of random letter reveal intro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-0.gif)

Wondering how to have the same effect for your video? This process will work easily with certain software tools, the most user-friendly and simple being the [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) software. Let's understand the steps that go into this process here.

## 1\. Launch Filmora on your Device

On Filmora's official website, you can get the latest software version when you click on the Download button at the top or in the description box. After you do so, the free software will download automatically into your device in an installer format.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

From the Downloads section of your browser, double-click on it and press the Install button when it appears. Give the necessary permissions that it prompts.

![click on the download button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-1.jpg)

Then, the software will start the installation instantly, likely taking a few seconds to complete.

## 2\. Add the Default Title and Edit its Font

After Filmora launches, click on the "Create New Project" button on the homepage of the editor. Then, click on the Title tab from the top toolbar and choose the default title available here. Drag it and drop it onto the editing timeline below on Track 1.

Double-click on the title on the timeline, which will open the text editing window. Under the Text's Preset tab, you will find the parameters for changing the main fault. Adjust the font style to the Impact style (or any bold title style you prefer), and click on the text field to add your custom title.

Following that, click on the text size option and change it to 15\. Scroll down the menu to the Text Spacing section. Change the value to 20 and tap on the OK button afterward.

![change the value here to 20](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-2.jpg)

## 3\. Split the title

On the editing timeline, tap on the Track 1 clip and click on the Snapshot icon at the far right side of the toolbar just above the timeline. This will automatically save in the media library section.

Then, take hold of the playhead on the timeline at the 3rd frame mark. Then, tap on the Scissor icon on the play head, which will split the clip into two portions. Click on the part following the 3rd frame mark and delete it.

![split the clip into two portions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-3.jpg)

## 4\. Copy the clipped section multiple times

Then, double-click on the amount still available on the timeline to open the title editor section again. Make changes to the title you added here, only keeping the first letter.

Click on this clipped section on the timeline and copy it. Next, keep copying this clip multiple times continuously until the length of the collection on Track 1 to the 5-second mark.

Following that, zoom in on the timeline for a better view of these clipped parts. Choose the last clip that you copied and drag it to expand its time duration to the 6:15 mark.

![zoom in on the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-4.jpg)

## 5\. Change the character of each clip

After making the previous edits, use your cursor to move to the first part of the timeline instead of zooming outward. Tap on the first clip that you had edited and double-click on it. In the text editing window, change the character to another random alphabet.

![change the character](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-5.jpg)

Repeat the same for all the split parts following the first one, changing the character to any random alphabet. At this time, ensure that you do not make two consecutive letters have the same alphabet, as that will put off the effect. However, keep the last elongated clip the same character as you originally put it.

## 6\. Export the first letter clip

Then, please tap on the Export button at the top of the screen and add a name, like the first letter of your title. Click on the Settings button on this page to adjust the resolution and quality of the clip to the highest resolution for the best results.

Press Export again to save it to your device.

## 7\. Edit the second letter clip and so on

After exporting the first file that will ultimately become the first letter of your random letter reveal intro title, you have to make the second letter-related clip.

For this, tap on the last clip on the timeline and double-click on it. Change the text in this clip to the second letter of your title. After doing this, go back to the first clip of your collection and double-click on it after selling it. Tap on the text field and give it another random letter.

![tap on the text field](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-6.jpg)

Like with the first clip, continue doing this step for all of the next clips, except for the final clip. Then, export it in the same manner as the first clip.

Now that you know how to edit the first and second letters in sequence, repeat this process for all of the letters of your title to create a full clip for all of the intro title letters. When you are done, please select these clips and press the Delete button to remove them from the timeline.

![select all of these clips and press delete](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-7.jpg)

## 8\. Add all clips back to Filmora

Now it's time to add all of the clips to Filmora and merge them into one cohesive intro title.

For this, click on My Media and go to Project Media. Right-click on the library section and press the Import button. This will take you to your device storage. Find the location where you saved all cut clips, and select them all. Press the Open button, and all of them will import into Filmora.

![press the open button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-8.jpg)

## 9\. Drag the Snapshot to Timeline

Tap on the Snapshot you saved earlier sitting on the media library and drag it onto the Track 1 of the editing timeline. Double-click on it to open the video editing window.

Click on the Opacity option in the Video editing section and change it to 20%. Press the OK button after that.

![click on the opacity option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-9.jpg)

## 10\. Drop the Clip into the Timeline

Select the first letter clip from the media library section and drag it onto the timeline. Drop it above the Snapshot in Track 2 part. Then, choose the first Snapshot clip and increase its duration to the 8-second mark.

Next, double-click on the first letter clip on the Track 2 section to open its editing window. Click on the Blending Mode option and choose Screen from the drop-down menu.

![click on blending mode and choose screen](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-10.jpg)

Then, right-click on the first letter clip in the timeline and choose the Copy Effects option from the next drop-down menu. Move the playhead to the ending position on the timeline and change the value on the relevant axis of Position until it matches its letter position on the original title.

See the preview playing on the side for a better reference while adjusting the position.

## 11\. Drop the next clips

Following this, click on the second letter clip and drag and drop it onto Track 3 on the timeline. Make sure to move the playhead to mark the starting position of this letter at the 5th frame mark.

Tap on this clip and move your playhead to the end position. Then, right-click on it and choose the Paste Effects option. Double-click on this clip on the timeline and change the position axis value until the letter aligns with its original position per the snapshot. Again, look at the Preview to ensure you align them correctly.

![look at the preview to align clips correctly](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-11.jpg)

Repeat this with all the other letters, making sure to change the starting position for each consecutive one-two frame forward.

## 12\. Hide and elongate each clip with snapshots

Then, click on the Snapshot clip on Track 1 and delete it. Following that, click the Hide icon on Track 3, Track 4, and onwards till the last one. Then, move the playhead to the end of the Track 2 clip and click on the Snapshot icon.

Choose the saved snapshot in the library window and drag-and-drop it behind Track 2 clip so it continues into it. Double-click on this Snapshot and choose Screen under Blending Mode. Then, right-click on this Snapshot and select "Copy Effects" from the menu.

![choose copy effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-12.jpg)

Then, hide the Track 2 clip, unhide the Track 3 and Track 4 clip, and take a snapshot of that. As you did with Track 1's screenshot, take this snapshot and place it beside Track 3 clip. Right-click on it and tap on "Paste Effects". Repeat this one by one for all the clips after unhiding them for their particular step.

## 13\. Finishing touches to Opacity

Finally, unhide all the clips and move the playhead to the 8-second mark. Click on the Scissor icon to Split them all at this position and remove the excess. Then, place the playhead at the beginning of Track 3 and double-click on it. Tap the Animation tab this time and adjust the Opacity to 0\. Then, move the playhead ten frames forward and increase the Opacity to 100\. Repeat this for all of the steps.

![adjust opacity to 0](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-random-letter-reveal-intro-13.jpg)

## 14\. Preview and Export

All video editors have been there. You edit and color-correct your video project only to find out that the final product is not what you expected. The contract and colors dramatically shift when viewed on a different device. In most cases, this is caused by improperly calibrated monitors, but it could also be your eyes playing tricks on you. **Video scopes** help in preventing this problem ensuring that the color in your video is consistent across devices. With video editing scope, you get the exact representation of the elements that make up your image, including lightness and color values. In this article, we explain what video scopes are and how you can use them in your editing projects.

**Color Correction Editor** An easy-to-use video editor helps you make color correction and color grading experience for videos!

## **Part 1\. Introduction to Video Scopes: What are They and Why You Should Use them**

When grading and color correcting your videos, it is important to accurately assess your video signal. This allows you to know whether you’re crushing the blacks in the night shot or clipping the whites in the clouds. You also get to know the exact saturation and hue your logo has. Video scopes are simply monitoring tools and measurements that are used during video editing to analyze and optimize the technical quality of video signals.

![video scopes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/take-your-video-editing-to-the-next-level-with-video-scopes-1.JPG)

Video scopes are important because your monitor may not be properly calibrated. It will likely give you inaccurate results and cannot be trusted with the video editing process. Since our eyes will naturally adapt to the image, they cannot be trusted either. However, video scopes never lie and will let you know the exact status of your video. In fact, the scope of video editing is beneficial in several ways:

* **Increased Accuracy**: Color correction and grading require accurate information that cannot be guaranteed by our eyes. Video scopes are highly accurate, confirming the true color and assuring you are making the correct adjustments
* **Reliability**: Video scopes provide reliable verification by ensuring you are not influenced by perception or what may appear as the right color grading.
* **Professional Editing**: The use of scopes in video editing is professional and allows you to make precise corrections of colors.
* **Matching Color Between Shots**: You can easily use video scopes to match your work and access various shots.

Video scopes are indeed useful in video editing. They give you the extra reassurance that your color grading and correction are accurate and representative of what you want. While they may sound intimidating for beginners, video scopes are a useful addition to video editing once you learn how to interpret them.

## **Part 2\. Essential Video Scopes for Beginners: A List of the Most Common Ones**

Scope in video editing can be a lifesaver, especially when you know what you are doing. Some are readily available for adjustment while recording, but the post-production ones are equally important. They ensure you are making the right adjustments without being interfered with by the appearance of your monitor. The scope of video editing ensures that our video will look the same across all devices. Here are the most commonly used video scopes:

* [Waveform Scopes](#scope1)
* [Histogram](#scope2)
* [RGB Parade](#scope3)
* [Vector Scopes](#scope4)

### **1\. Waveform Scopes**

Waveform video scope allows you to see how dark or light your image is. In other words, the waveform represents the luminance distribution across your image, allowing you to easily identify the bright and dark elements of your image. The lightness of the picture of the image is represented as a waveform. The rule of thumb is that black is 0 while white is 100 when you are editing HD. Levels below 0 at the bottom of the scope and those above 100 near the top of the scope will be clipped. So, you have to keep your levels within the 0-100 range, which is also the true Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) video. With Ultra-HD standard, the whites can go up to 10,000, which is the High Dynamic Range.

![waveform](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/take-your-video-editing-to-the-next-level-with-video-scopes-2.JPG)

### **2\. Histogram**

The histogram video scope allows you to see the tonal value of your clip. Most people associate histograms with still photography, but it is also useful for video work. Specifically, the histogram represents the highlights, shadows, and midtones of your image. For a standard 8-bit image, pure white has a value of 255 while dark black has a value of 0\. The histogram gives you the distribution of colored pixels in every value of lightness or darkness. Although other video scopes like the waveform and vectorscope will do much of the work, a histogram is still a useful measure in video editing.

![histogram](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/take-your-video-editing-to-the-next-level-with-video-scopes-3.JPG)

### **3\. RGB Parade**

This is one of the most common post-production video scopes. The RGB parade allows you to see all three colors in one scope. It shows the waveform of the three colors side by side, and not on top of each other. This way, the RGB parade measures the saturation of the colors red, green, and blue in an image. It becomes clear which colors are more saturated compared to others in different areas of the image. To achieve a well-balanced image, keep each color within the lower and upper limits of the video scope. This ensures that the colors are not under or over-saturated.

![rgb parade](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/take-your-video-editing-to-the-next-level-with-video-scopes-4.JPG)

### **4\. Vector Scopes**

This is another common visual post-production scope. It measures the color and color saturation of your image or video on a six-point color wheel. When working with vector scopes, you have two options to choose from: YUV and HLS vector scopes. The YUV vector scopes display the saturation and hue of the colors in the image on the circular graph. The colors in the graph include red, blue, magenta, yellow, and cyan-green. Color becomes more saturated the further it is from the center. On the other hand, the HLS vector scopes show saturation and hue, but in a more detailed picture of the number of pixels that fall into each area of the video scope.

## **Part 1\. Introduction to Video Scopes: What are They and Why You Should Use them**

When grading and color correcting your videos, it is important to accurately assess your video signal. This allows you to know whether you’re crushing the blacks in the night shot or clipping the whites in the clouds. You also get to know the exact saturation and hue your logo has. Video scopes are simply monitoring tools and measurements that are used during video editing to analyze and optimize the technical quality of video signals.

![video scopes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/take-your-video-editing-to-the-next-level-with-video-scopes-1.JPG)

Video scopes are important because your monitor may not be properly calibrated. It will likely give you inaccurate results and cannot be trusted with the video editing process. Since our eyes will naturally adapt to the image, they cannot be trusted either. However, video scopes never lie and will let you know the exact status of your video. In fact, the scope of video editing is beneficial in several ways:

* **Increased Accuracy**: Color correction and grading require accurate information that cannot be guaranteed by our eyes. Video scopes are highly accurate, confirming the true color and assuring you are making the correct adjustments
* **Reliability**: Video scopes provide reliable verification by ensuring you are not influenced by perception or what may appear as the right color grading.
* **Professional Editing**: The use of scopes in video editing is professional and allows you to make precise corrections of colors.
* **Matching Color Between Shots**: You can easily use video scopes to match your work and access various shots.

Video scopes are indeed useful in video editing. They give you the extra reassurance that your color grading and correction are accurate and representative of what you want. While they may sound intimidating for beginners, video scopes are a useful addition to video editing once you learn how to interpret them.

## **Part 2\. Essential Video Scopes for Beginners: A List of the Most Common Ones**

Scope in video editing can be a lifesaver, especially when you know what you are doing. Some are readily available for adjustment while recording, but the post-production ones are equally important. They ensure you are making the right adjustments without being interfered with by the appearance of your monitor. The scope of video editing ensures that our video will look the same across all devices. Here are the most commonly used video scopes:

* [Waveform Scopes](#scope1)
* [Histogram](#scope2)
* [RGB Parade](#scope3)
* [Vector Scopes](#scope4)

### **1\. Waveform Scopes**

Waveform video scope allows you to see how dark or light your image is. In other words, the waveform represents the luminance distribution across your image, allowing you to easily identify the bright and dark elements of your image. The lightness of the picture of the image is represented as a waveform. The rule of thumb is that black is 0 while white is 100 when you are editing HD. Levels below 0 at the bottom of the scope and those above 100 near the top of the scope will be clipped. So, you have to keep your levels within the 0-100 range, which is also the true Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) video. With Ultra-HD standard, the whites can go up to 10,000, which is the High Dynamic Range.

![waveform](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/take-your-video-editing-to-the-next-level-with-video-scopes-2.JPG)

### **2\. Histogram**

The histogram video scope allows you to see the tonal value of your clip. Most people associate histograms with still photography, but it is also useful for video work. Specifically, the histogram represents the highlights, shadows, and midtones of your image. For a standard 8-bit image, pure white has a value of 255 while dark black has a value of 0\. The histogram gives you the distribution of colored pixels in every value of lightness or darkness. Although other video scopes like the waveform and vectorscope will do much of the work, a histogram is still a useful measure in video editing.

![histogram](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/take-your-video-editing-to-the-next-level-with-video-scopes-3.JPG)

### **3\. RGB Parade**

This is one of the most common post-production video scopes. The RGB parade allows you to see all three colors in one scope. It shows the waveform of the three colors side by side, and not on top of each other. This way, the RGB parade measures the saturation of the colors red, green, and blue in an image. It becomes clear which colors are more saturated compared to others in different areas of the image. To achieve a well-balanced image, keep each color within the lower and upper limits of the video scope. This ensures that the colors are not under or over-saturated.

![rgb parade](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/take-your-video-editing-to-the-next-level-with-video-scopes-4.JPG)

### **4\. Vector Scopes**

This is another common visual post-production scope. It measures the color and color saturation of your image or video on a six-point color wheel. When working with vector scopes, you have two options to choose from: YUV and HLS vector scopes. The YUV vector scopes display the saturation and hue of the colors in the image on the circular graph. The colors in the graph include red, blue, magenta, yellow, and cyan-green. Color becomes more saturated the further it is from the center. On the other hand, the HLS vector scopes show saturation and hue, but in a more detailed picture of the number of pixels that fall into each area of the video scope.

## Step by Step to Crop a Video with CyberLink PowerDirector

Video Editing is an art form dependent on various elements and factors that are part of your video; this means people, items, or objects in the background can often make or break the viewing experience.

Can you imagine having shot a scene with impeccable attention to detail, but a small uncontrollable action leaves a portion of an unwanted cable or equipment in the frame? Bummer, right? But luckily, due to the power of video editing software, it is not hard to deal with such problems.

A way to work with such clips is to use the crop function while editing, as it can help emphasize or detract attention from a particular part of any video project.

**Author's Note:** While filming, try to capture footage in the highest resolution allowed by the available camera hardware; this will give you more room to play with while using the crop function.

To preface, CyberLink PowerDirector is a free video editing tool capable of accomplishing this and providing a professional touch to your video projects. And like other competing software, the program not only allows you to crop into clips but also uses keyframes to modify aspects like panning and zoom. So to help you perform this action, in this article, we list the steps you will need for cropping into video clips with PowerDirector. As an added bonus, we have also included the method to perform the same actions in WonderShare Filmora.

**_Note:_** _We documented the steps in this guide with PowerDirector 365 and WonderShare Filmora X._

## How to Crop Videos with CyberLink PowerDirector?

The idea of cropping into clips has always been an easy action to perform; once you have PowerDirector 365 open, follow the steps listed below.

_If you do not already have CyberLink PowerDirector 365, download the software by visiting_ [_Cyberlink's official website_](https://www.cyberlink.com/products/powerdirector-video-editing-software/features%5Fen%5FIN.html)_._

**Step 1:** Create a new video project in Cyberlink PowerDirector 365 by choosing Full Mode.

![crop-video-in-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-in-powerdirector-1.jpeg)

**Note:** Full Mode in Cyberlink PowerDirector 365 provides access to a full-featured video editing tool, similar to Wondershare Filmora. The other available options cater to distinct video types.

**Step 2:** Import media onto the Timeline from the Media Library; in this guide, we have gone ahead and used the pre-existing stock footage.

![crop-video-in-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-in-powerdirector-2.jpeg)

**Step 3:** Now, click on the video file on the Timeline; this will activate the video toolbar giving you access to the various controls built into PowerDirector 365\. Hover over the tools open, following which you need to click on the Crop, Zoom, and Pan option.

![crop-video-in-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-in-powerdirector-3.jpeg)

**Step 4:** Pick either corner of the frame visible around the video and set the area you want the clip to focus upon; following this, click Save.

![crop-video-in-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-in-powerdirector-4.jpeg)

This action will crop the video clip according to your desired size.

**Tip**:

The activation of Keyframes while cropping will allow you to create an effect that slowly zooms into the footage. To do this, set Keyframe Point 1 at a specific time (say the fifth second) and at one zoom level (say zero) and create Keyframe Point 2 at another time (fifteenth second) and a different zoom level (say fifty). So, between the fifth second and fifteenth second, the zoom will steadily increase and raise emphasis on an object. You can also add an element of position to this action if you want the focus to be on something not in the center of the screen.

**Definition:** Keyframes while Video Editing is a software-based feature that allows you to set In and Out Points, giving clips between the two positions different properties that change as the playhead continues to move. These properties can be increased zoom, rotation, different colors, or even a gradual pan.

We recommend experimenting with this feature if you want to bring a more dynamic feeling to your video project.

## **An Easier Way to Crop Video with Wondershare Filmora**

**Step 3:** Now, click on the video file on the Timeline; this will activate the video toolbar giving you access to the various controls built into PowerDirector 365\. Hover over the tools open, following which you need to click on the Crop, Zoom, and Pan option.

![crop-video-in-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-in-powerdirector-3.jpeg)

**Step 4:** Pick either corner of the frame visible around the video and set the area you want the clip to focus upon; following this, click Save.

![crop-video-in-powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-in-powerdirector-4.jpeg)

This action will crop the video clip according to your desired size.

**Tip**:

The activation of Keyframes while cropping will allow you to create an effect that slowly zooms into the footage. To do this, set Keyframe Point 1 at a specific time (say the fifth second) and at one zoom level (say zero) and create Keyframe Point 2 at another time (fifteenth second) and a different zoom level (say fifty). So, between the fifth second and fifteenth second, the zoom will steadily increase and raise emphasis on an object. You can also add an element of position to this action if you want the focus to be on something not in the center of the screen.

**Definition:** Keyframes while Video Editing is a software-based feature that allows you to set In and Out Points, giving clips between the two positions different properties that change as the playhead continues to move. These properties can be increased zoom, rotation, different colors, or even a gradual pan.

We recommend experimenting with this feature if you want to bring a more dynamic feeling to your video project.
