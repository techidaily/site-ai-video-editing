It is a process in which you can capture audio in your device using a microphone. Voice recordings can be any type of audio content, such as conversations, interviews, and much more. There are various settings for voice recording as well. It starts from studio recordings, outside and even home set-up recordings.

**Voiceover**

On the other hand, voiceover specifically refers to a recorded narration or video commentary. This includes documentaries, advertisements, films, television shows, and more. It provides information, explains visuals, or narrates a story to your audience. Mostly voiceover is scripted and well synchronized to convey the message to its audience successfully.

**Summary**

Wrapping up, the main difference between these two terms is the intent of audio content. In general, voice recording allows you to capture audio. In contrast, voiceover refers explicitly to the recording of some specific narrations.

The program enables users to apply effects to TikTok videos in order to facilitate this kind of production. TikTok offers a lot of features, making it simple to become lost inside the application.

Many people are hesitant to record a TikTok video with more than one filter effect applied. You've probably seen that a lot of well-known makers create videos that combine many different effects. Actually, the procedure is rather easy. You may apply as many filters as you'd like on the TikTok app while recording time stamps one at a time only!

## Part 4\. Add Filter on Video in TikTok

You may apply the filters after you film the movie, just as you do with the effects. You just need to visit visual. There is no way to identify the filter that your favorite TikToker used on his video on TikTok. Don't worry, they often include the effect they employ in the hashtag or description, so you are still welcome to utilize it. To hunt for filter effects on TikTok, you might request a search function.

## The Bottom Line

Filters on TikTok work similarly to filters on other social media applications. However, there is no option or function in the TikTok app that allows you to look for a filter effect under the Filters or Effects tab. However, since most TikTok users constantly upload videos with any filter and strive to put the filter's name and hashtags on the films, you may search for some videos with the identical filter. Your films will get flair and individuality thanks to this simple technique, which also gives certain filters a chance to catch on as trends.
