## Part 1 How Animation Works in Procreate

GIFs are known to be the top ranked and most intuitive trendsetters in the world of infotainment and media service tools. Be it for fun or a targeted market influence, you can depend on GIFs for a variety of information solutions. Moving to the creative aspect, the experimentation belt with creating GIFs is huge. From making simple static and animated GIFs to creating professionally sound market promotion tools; you can play with your editing skills to extract just anything from these quick snippets.

Having said that, let’s take a dive into creating animated **Procreate GIFs**. Being a relatively new dimension of GIF editing, a merge of the two produces matchless and classic results. Read through the further article to get a complete guide for working on GIF creation and editing with Procreate.

**●** **Underlying Concept**

Before you begin creating a **Procreate GIF**, let’s get a bit familiar with the concept behind this GIF creation utility. This one is an excellent and advanced means of exploring your skills in digital drawing and animations. It is one of the easiest GIF maker software that helps you to become a pro in animation creativity even if you are beginner and for the ones already into the skill, Procreate is simply heaven.

Procreate allows you to work with animation in its ‘Animation Assist’ tool, where you get a generous workspace with the perfect editing canvas to experiment with a plethora of tools, effects and filters to create exciting GIFs with basic and complex animation craft.

The software allows frame-by-frame animation that refers to working with different frames of a particular illustration, while making minimal changes in each frame. Once you finish, your final creation gets played in a motion loop.

## Part 1 How to Make Animated Gifs in Procreate

As is already stated, Procreate is among the most affordable GIF creator and editing software. Creating GIFs here is a few minute stuff within a span of counted steps. Let’s have a broader see through of the creation process. Take the following quick steps and get started to make your exclusive Procreate GIF:

**●** **Step 1: Select an Artwork**

Launch the software in your device to reach the Procreate welcome screen, where you need to select an existing static GIF to work on from your device. You can also create a fresh one if you like. Having done that, make a right swipe on the ‘Canvas’ icon and select ‘Duplicate’. This creates a copy of your artwork, preserving all of its layers, so that you are free to make changes or stick to the original one according to your preference.

If you want to use a specific section of your image to animate, you can use the crop tool to remove unwanted portions. Next, you need to put together the specific layers you wish to animate and also remove any unwanted layers you don’t want to use.

**●** **Step 2: Enable Animation Assist Tool**

From the Procreate tool gallery at the top, click on the ‘Wrench’ icon and select ‘Canvas’ from the ’Actions’ menu that drops down. In the interface that appears, enable the ‘Animation Assist’ tool with a right toggle. This will cause the ‘Animation Toolbar’ to appear at the bottom of the interface.

![Procreate- Animation Assist Tool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/Easy-ways-to-make-procreate-gifs-2.JPG)

**●** **Step 3: Add Frames and Make Image Adjustments**

At this instant, you need to make additional adjustments in your selected image and create a copy of the image frames. To get this done, navigate to the ‘Animation Assist Toolbar’ and long press the ‘Add Frame’ button. A duplicate frame will now appear on the screen. Within this frame, you need to move the image elements that you wish to animate. To do this, select an element and drag it to a convenient spot of your choice.

While you go through with object movement, the software simultaneously shows you a semi-transparent preview of your creation through its unique ‘Onion-skin’ feature. You can enjoy playing your animation at this very stage, or continue to create something more exciting.

**●** **Step 4: Enjoying? Let’s Continue.**

Repeat Step 3 to create long and smooth GIFs with additional frames. Take caution to create a copy of your latest frame (not the original one), in case you need to make any adjustments later on. Consider playing your GIF to see if you need to add extra frames or implement further changes.

**Step 5: Almost There.**

You may notice a jerky movement of your final image frames. This is on account of the ‘Default Play’ feature of the Procreate software that initiates a run of your creation from the beginning to end and loops on the same fashion.

To set this right, navigate to the ‘Settings’ tool of the ‘Animation Assist Toolbar’ and tap ‘Ping-Pong’ on the opening interface. Your animated Gif will now play in a forward to backward loop, resulting in a smooth frame movement.

**●** **Step 6: Time to Share.**

Once you are happy with your artwork, you can share it across different media platforms. To export your creation, navigate to the Procreate tool gallery and tap the ‘Wrench’ icon and select ‘Share’. In the ‘Sharing Options’ menu, you will be asked to make a format selection. You can share your creation in either of the GIF, PNG or MP4 formats.

You may even require a size modification in the created file with respect to specific sharing platforms. You can either select a web compatible resolution to shrink your file, or create a copy of the file to resize the same.

Once you get familiar with Procreate and its GIF creation basics, you have the liberty to explore the huge effects library offered by the software to give your animated GIFs the classy, professional touch. So why wait? Just get the software and start a never ending spree of Procreating GIFs.

Procreate is undoubtedly an excellent tool for creating animated GIFs, but if you are looking for alternatives, another software to rely on is **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** GIF creator.

It is one of the easiest GIF maker software that helps you to become a pro in animation creativity even if you are beginner and for the ones already into the skill, Procreate is simply heaven.

Procreate allows you to work with animation in its ‘Animation Assist’ tool, where you get a generous workspace with the perfect editing canvas to experiment with a plethora of tools, effects and filters to create exciting GIFs with basic and complex animation craft.

The software allows frame-by-frame animation that refers to working with different frames of a particular illustration, while making minimal changes in each frame. Once you finish, your final creation gets played in a motion loop.

## Part 1 How to Make Animated Gifs in Procreate

As is already stated, Procreate is among the most affordable GIF creator and editing software. Creating GIFs here is a few minute stuff within a span of counted steps. Let’s have a broader see through of the creation process. Take the following quick steps and get started to make your exclusive Procreate GIF:

**●** **Step 1: Select an Artwork**

Launch the software in your device to reach the Procreate welcome screen, where you need to select an existing static GIF to work on from your device. You can also create a fresh one if you like. Having done that, make a right swipe on the ‘Canvas’ icon and select ‘Duplicate’. This creates a copy of your artwork, preserving all of its layers, so that you are free to make changes or stick to the original one according to your preference.

If you want to use a specific section of your image to animate, you can use the crop tool to remove unwanted portions. Next, you need to put together the specific layers you wish to animate and also remove any unwanted layers you don’t want to use.

**●** **Step 2: Enable Animation Assist Tool**

From the Procreate tool gallery at the top, click on the ‘Wrench’ icon and select ‘Canvas’ from the ’Actions’ menu that drops down. In the interface that appears, enable the ‘Animation Assist’ tool with a right toggle. This will cause the ‘Animation Toolbar’ to appear at the bottom of the interface.

![Procreate- Animation Assist Tool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/Easy-ways-to-make-procreate-gifs-2.JPG)

**●** **Step 3: Add Frames and Make Image Adjustments**

At this instant, you need to make additional adjustments in your selected image and create a copy of the image frames. To get this done, navigate to the ‘Animation Assist Toolbar’ and long press the ‘Add Frame’ button. A duplicate frame will now appear on the screen. Within this frame, you need to move the image elements that you wish to animate. To do this, select an element and drag it to a convenient spot of your choice.

While you go through with object movement, the software simultaneously shows you a semi-transparent preview of your creation through its unique ‘Onion-skin’ feature. You can enjoy playing your animation at this very stage, or continue to create something more exciting.

**●** **Step 4: Enjoying? Let’s Continue.**

Repeat Step 3 to create long and smooth GIFs with additional frames. Take caution to create a copy of your latest frame (not the original one), in case you need to make any adjustments later on. Consider playing your GIF to see if you need to add extra frames or implement further changes.

**Step 5: Almost There.**

You may notice a jerky movement of your final image frames. This is on account of the ‘Default Play’ feature of the Procreate software that initiates a run of your creation from the beginning to end and loops on the same fashion.

To set this right, navigate to the ‘Settings’ tool of the ‘Animation Assist Toolbar’ and tap ‘Ping-Pong’ on the opening interface. Your animated Gif will now play in a forward to backward loop, resulting in a smooth frame movement.

**●** **Step 6: Time to Share.**

Once you are happy with your artwork, you can share it across different media platforms. To export your creation, navigate to the Procreate tool gallery and tap the ‘Wrench’ icon and select ‘Share’. In the ‘Sharing Options’ menu, you will be asked to make a format selection. You can share your creation in either of the GIF, PNG or MP4 formats.

You may even require a size modification in the created file with respect to specific sharing platforms. You can either select a web compatible resolution to shrink your file, or create a copy of the file to resize the same.

Once you get familiar with Procreate and its GIF creation basics, you have the liberty to explore the huge effects library offered by the software to give your animated GIFs the classy, professional touch. So why wait? Just get the software and start a never ending spree of Procreating GIFs.

01 [What is Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical?](#Part 1)

02 [Types of Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical](#Part 2)

03 [Tips to Create Phone Vertical Videos](#Part 3)

## Part 1 What is Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical?

The vertical phone aspect ratio is the “proportional” relationship between the screen's width and height. For example, if your image or video has an aspect ratio of 4:5, it simply means the width of the screen (photo or video) is four times the height of the image.

The vertical phone aspect ratio is the “proportional” relationship between the screen's width and height. For example, if your image or video has an aspect ratio of 4:5, it simply means the width of the screen (photo or video) is four times the height of the image.

Back in the television days, you might have seen certain old pictures with black padding on either side of the screen. It was just that they were shot in different aspect ratios and your television screen had different aspect ratios.

### Aspect Ratio Vs Resolution

Remember that aspect ratio does not refer to the physical size of an image or its dimensions in pixels (resolution). So aspect ratio 3:1 does not refer to the actual width and height of the image or video; it just describes their relationship.

You are wrong if you think aspect ratio is just another fancy name for resolution. Think again. Check out how it is calculated.

"

| |  Aspect Ratio | Resolution                                                     |                                                                                    |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Definition      | The Ratio of the width of an image to the height of the image. | Total number of pixels displayed on your screen (computer, cell phone, television) |
| Commonly Used   | ● 1:1 ● 3:1 ● 3:2 ● 4:3 ● 5:4 ● 9:1 ● 16:9                     | ● 640x480 ● 800x600 ● 1024x768                                                     |

### Aspect Ratio Calculator

To get the resolution, you need to multiply width times the height. To get aspect ratio, the formula is: Divide the width by the height or simply divide the long side by the short side.

There are multiple online aspect ratio calculators available. Check out the value for both the images and the videos generated through the photo ratio calculator for your ease.

| Common Aspect Ratio                   | AR Width | AR Height | Image Width | Image Height |
| ------------------------------------- | -------- | --------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| 1:1(square)                           | 1        | 1         | 1920        | 1920         |
| 5:4 (large and medium format cameras) | 5        | 4         | 1920        | 1536         |
| 4:3 Standard                          | 4        | 3         | 1920        | 1440         |
| 3:2 (35mm camera)                     | 3        | 2         | 1920        | 1280         |
| 16:9                                  | 16       | 9         | 1920        | 1080         |
| 3:1 Panoramic                         | 3        | 1         | 1920        | 640          |
| 9:16                                  | 9        | 16        | 1080        | 1920         |

For example, the aspect ratio of 3:1 may be an image of 3m wide and 1m high. At the same time it can be 3 feet wide and 1 foot high. For further simplification, consider dimensions in pixels: a 6000×4000 image has 3:2 aspect ratios.

Always remember this small but crucial point. The aspect ratio refers to the image or video you captured or recorded and the display (or screen) in which your video or image would be displayed.

### Why is the aspect ratio important?

In the age of web content, asking why aspect ratio is important? Some may consider it naïve. Images need to be uploaded at different aspect ratios for different uses (desktop vs. mobile or blog vs. social media). Incorrect aspect ratio affects your final image and end-user experience.

Choice of the wrong aspect ratio can eliminate the potential for editing (cropping and resizing). In addition, using the correct aspect ratios saves you from facing the trouble of distortion or clipping.

## Part 2 Types of Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical

### Image Aspect Ratios

The aspect ratio decides and changes the entire composition and how the audience perceives the image. First, let us see some common image aspect ratios.

If you have seen a square-shaped image, it had probably a 1:1 aspect ratio. It simply means both sides (width and height of the image) are equal. It was initially the aspect ratio of square television sets. However, this is commonly used for print photos, mobile screens, and social platforms.

● 3:2 Ratio

![3 to 2 ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-2.png)

### Video Aspect Ratios

Like the image aspect ratios, video aspect ratios would also profoundly affect its composition and thus how your directed viewers perceive it. Some common mobile vertical video size or video aspect ratios are given below.

● 16:9 Ratio

![16 to 9 ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-4.png)

If you have seen presentation slides, computer monitors, or widescreee seen this slimmer and more elongated rectangular-shaped 16:9 Ratio. This is the standardized widescreen aspect ratio that you see everywhere on the web. In terms of pixel common dimension for 16:9 is 1920×1080 pixels and 1280×720 pixels.

● 9:16 Ratio (Vertical)

![9:16 Ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-3.png)

When smartphones started coming with video capabilities, this Ratio became popular. Likewise, today this Ratio is trendy for social media platforms with video story capabilities.

The Instagram story typically consists of 1080x1920 pixels, which in terms of aspect ratio is 9:16\. Most phones, such as iPhone, have a feature that allows you to record footage in both (16:9 as well as 9:16).

### Phone aspect ratio vertical

Back in the day, taking aspect ratio vertical (portrait mode) footage was considered unprofessional and a sign of an amateur. But the digital revolution has changed that. Now from unforgivable sin, the vewayal mode has practically become a mainstream media sensation. Vertical style has now become the dominant format.

![phone aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-7.png)

Phone aspect ratio vertical simply means taller screen than wider. The most common type is 9:16 (1080x1920 pixels), a typical vertical videos aspect ratio. Although this phone aspect ratio vertical comes in a few more shapes and sizes such as 4:5, 2:3.

## Part 3 Tips to Create Phone Vertical Videos

Creating vertical videos is crucial for getting engagements and growing your brand. It is easy with a phone because most smartphones, by default, record in 9:16, which is the standard vertical aspect ratio. But with a camera, you have to manually edit to the correct aspect ratio before you shoot it.

You can also shoot horizontally and then change it to vertical, but it needs professional videographer expertise.

Who wants to rotate their phones watching videos? Well, as far as the trend, Let us see some tiny but handy tips for creating vertical phone videos.

### 1\. Choose the correct aspect ratio

Video taller than the 1:1 aspect ratio is commonly considered Vertical video. Types of these vertical aspects ratio include 4:5 (social), 2:3 and 9:16\. They are all taller than they are wide, thus vertical.

Choosing the correct aspect ratio for your vertical video, always think about why and where you intend to use the video. The second important thing you should consider is your plans for editing that video.

Cropping horizontal can be irritating and sometimes disappointing at the same time. Producing a 9:16 vertical frame at HD resolution from a horizontal HD frame may result in very pixelated and low-quality footage.

If, for some reason, you still want first to shoot it horizontal and then change it back to mobile vertical video size. You may need to shoot in 4K horizontally to get extra pixels to work with. It can later be cropped in the sides to 9:16 (Vertical phone aspect ratio). Plus, you won't need to scale it anymore.

### 2\. Direct your viewer's eyes

For hooking social media viewers, you need to put your most interesting visual upfront. These include GIFs, colourful stop-motion or looping animation. Always try to match your first couple of shots with your overall brand personality.

3\. Screen splitting into two or more

![screen splitting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-11.png)

A tall vertical screen can be styled with multiple horizontal clips on top of each other. These clips must relate to your relevant content and overall look. Natural lines or patterns can help display them in the most creative ways.

### 4\. Be close to your subject

For producing an intimate experience with the vertical frame, you should get closer to the subject. Most of the action will be positioned to the centre as your viewers scroll. Do not let cut off or cover up your main subject by any text and make sure you leave enough room for text, emojis and stickers.

### 5\. Filling the vertical space

First, make sure that your subject is vertical-friendly. Then get closer and fill the space within the vertical frame. The vertical frame can be filled through the following:

● Up-close shot (if the subject is personal).

● Raising the camera high and tilting it down (to film things like a long, empty road).

● Bird’s-eye view from above.

### 5\. Rule of Third

![rule of third](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-10.png)

This photography rule says not to place the main subject directly in the center of the frame. Create more dynamic composition by creating imaginary (Horizontal & Vertical) lines that divide your frame into thirds.

You have to place your subject either on the lines or where the lines meet up. And guess what? You don't need to draw imaginary nowadays. Most cameras and smartphones provide you with this option.

### 6\. Avoid Shaking

You do not want to distract your viewers with shaky camera moments. Normal pan and 360-degree rotation are acceptable or maybe even essential. But moving side to side too quickly will make it difficult for the camera to process that information. You better use a selfie stick or gimbal.

Now, check out the best vertical video ratios for various social platforms.

## Part 1 What is Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical?

The vertical phone aspect ratio is the “proportional” relationship between the screen's width and height. For example, if your image or video has an aspect ratio of 4:5, it simply means the width of the screen (photo or video) is four times the height of the image.

The vertical phone aspect ratio is the “proportional” relationship between the screen's width and height. For example, if your image or video has an aspect ratio of 4:5, it simply means the width of the screen (photo or video) is four times the height of the image.

Back in the television days, you might have seen certain old pictures with black padding on either side of the screen. It was just that they were shot in different aspect ratios and your television screen had different aspect ratios.

### Aspect Ratio Vs Resolution

Remember that aspect ratio does not refer to the physical size of an image or its dimensions in pixels (resolution). So aspect ratio 3:1 does not refer to the actual width and height of the image or video; it just describes their relationship.

You are wrong if you think aspect ratio is just another fancy name for resolution. Think again. Check out how it is calculated.

| |  Aspect Ratio | Resolution                                                     |                                                                                    |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Definition      | The Ratio of the width of an image to the height of the image. | Total number of pixels displayed on your screen (computer, cell phone, television) |
| Commonly Used   | ● 1:1 ● 3:1 ● 3:2 ● 4:3 ● 5:4 ● 9:1 ● 16:9                     | ● 640x480 ● 800x600 ● 1024x768                                                     |

### Aspect Ratio Calculator

To get the resolution, you need to multiply width times the height. To get aspect ratio, the formula is: Divide the width by the height or simply divide the long side by the short side.

There are multiple online aspect ratio calculators available. Check out the value for both the images and the videos generated through the photo ratio calculator for your ease.

| Common Aspect Ratio                   | AR Width | AR Height | Image Width | Image Height |
| ------------------------------------- | -------- | --------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| 1:1(square)                           | 1        | 1         | 1920        | 1920         |
| 5:4 (large and medium format cameras) | 5        | 4         | 1920        | 1536         |
| 4:3 Standard                          | 4        | 3         | 1920        | 1440         |
| 3:2 (35mm camera)                     | 3        | 2         | 1920        | 1280         |
| 16:9                                  | 16       | 9         | 1920        | 1080         |
| 3:1 Panoramic                         | 3        | 1         | 1920        | 640          |
| 9:16                                  | 9        | 16        | 1080        | 1920         |

For example, the aspect ratio of 3:1 may be an image of 3m wide and 1m high. At the same time it can be 3 feet wide and 1 foot high. For further simplification, consider dimensions in pixels: a 6000×4000 image has 3:2 aspect ratios.

Always remember this small but crucial point. The aspect ratio refers to the image or video you captured or recorded and the display (or screen) in which your video or image would be displayed.

### Why is the aspect ratio important?

In the age of web content, asking why aspect ratio is important? Some may consider it naïve. Images need to be uploaded at different aspect ratios for different uses (desktop vs. mobile or blog vs. social media). Incorrect aspect ratio affects your final image and end-user experience.

Choice of the wrong aspect ratio can eliminate the potential for editing (cropping and resizing). In addition, using the correct aspect ratios saves you from facing the trouble of distortion or clipping.

### Phone aspect ratio vertical

Now from unforgivable sin, the vewayal mode has practically become a mainstream media sensation. Vertical style has now become the dominant format.

![phone aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-7.png)

## Part 3 Tips to Create Phone Vertical Videos

Creating vertical videos is crucial for getting engagements and growing your brand. It is easy with a phone because most smartphones, by default, record in 9:16, which is the standard vertical aspect ratio. But with a camera, you have to manually edit to the correct aspect ratio before you shoot it.

You can also shoot horizontally and then change it to vertical, but it needs professional videographer expertise.

Who wants to rotate their phones watching videos? Well, as far as the trend, Let us see some tiny but handy tips for creating vertical phone videos.

### 1\. Choose the correct aspect ratio

Video taller than the 1:1 aspect ratio is commonly considered Vertical video. Types of these vertical aspects ratio include 4:5 (social), 2:3 and 9:16\. They are all taller than they are wide, thus vertical.

Choosing the correct aspect ratio for your vertical video, always think about why and where you intend to use the video. The second important thing you should consider is your plans for editing that video.

Cropping horizontal can be irritating and sometimes disappointing at the same time. Producing a 9:16 vertical frame at HD resolution from a horizontal HD frame may result in very pixelated and low-quality footage.

If, for some reason, you still want first to shoot it horizontal and then change it back to mobile vertical video size. You may need to shoot in 4K horizontally to get extra pixels to work with. It can later be cropped in the sides to 9:16 (Vertical phone aspect ratio). Plus, you won't need to scale it anymore.

### 2\. Direct your viewer's eyes

For hooking social media viewers, you need to put your most interesting visual upfront. These include GIFs, colourful stop-motion or looping animation. Always try to match your first couple of shots with your overall brand personality.

3\. Screen splitting into two or more

![screen splitting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-11.png)

A tall vertical screen can be styled with multiple horizontal clips on top of each other. These clips must relate to your relevant content and overall look. Natural lines or patterns can help display them in the most creative ways.

### 4\. Be close to your subject

For producing an intimate experience with the vertical frame, you should get closer to the subject. Most of the action will be positioned to the centre as your viewers scroll. Do not let cut off or cover up your main subject by any text and make sure you leave enough room for text, emojis and stickers.

### 5\. Filling the vertical space

First, make sure that your subject is vertical-friendly. Then get closer and fill the space within the vertical frame. The vertical frame can be filled through the following:

● Up-close shot (if the subject is personal).

● Raising the camera high and tilting it down (to film things like a long, empty road).

● Bird’s-eye view from above.

### 5\. Rule of Third

![rule of third](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-10.png)

This photography rule says not to place the main subject directly in the center of the frame. Create more dynamic composition by creating imaginary (Horizontal & Vertical) lines that divide your frame into thirds.

You have to place your subject either on the lines or where the lines meet up. And guess what? You don't need to draw imaginary nowadays. Most cameras and smartphones provide you with this option.

### 6\. Avoid Shaking

You do not want to distract your viewers with shaky camera moments. Normal pan and 360-degree rotation are acceptable or maybe even essential. But moving side to side too quickly will make it difficult for the camera to process that information. You better use a selfie stick or gimbal.

Now, check out the best vertical video ratios for various social platforms.

You have to place your subject either on the lines or where the lines meet up. And guess what? You don't need to draw imaginary nowadays. Most cameras and smartphones provide you with this option.

### 6\. Avoid Shaking

You do not want to distract your viewers with shaky camera moments. Normal pan and 360-degree rotation are acceptable or maybe even essential. But moving side to side too quickly will make it difficult for the camera to process that information. You better use a selfie stick or gimbal.

Now, check out the best vertical video ratios for various social platforms.

03 [Tips to Create Phone Vertical Videos](#Part 3)

## Part 1 What is Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical?

The vertical phone aspect ratio is the “proportional” relationship between the screen's width and height. For example, if your image or video has an aspect ratio of 4:5, it simply means the width of the screen (photo or video) is four times the height of the image.

The vertical phone aspect ratio is the “proportional” relationship between the screen's width and height. For example, if your image or video has an aspect ratio of 4:5, it simply means the width of the screen (photo or video) is four times the height of the image.

Back in the television days, you might have seen certain old pictures with black padding on either side of the screen. It was just that they were shot in different aspect ratios and your television screen had different aspect ratios.

### Aspect Ratio Vs Resolution

Remember that aspect ratio does not refer to the physical size of an image or its dimensions in pixels (resolution). So aspect ratio 3:1 does not refer to the actual width and height of the image or video; it just describes their relationship.

You are wrong if you think aspect ratio is just another fancy name for resolution. Think again. Check out how it is calculated.

"

| |  Aspect Ratio | Resolution                                                     |                                                                                    |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Definition      | The Ratio of the width of an image to the height of the image. | Total number of pixels displayed on your screen (computer, cell phone, television) |
| Commonly Used   | ● 1:1 ● 3:1 ● 3:2 ● 4:3 ● 5:4 ● 9:1 ● 16:9                     | ● 640x480 ● 800x600 ● 1024x768                                                     |

### Aspect Ratio Calculator

To get the resolution, you need to multiply width times the height. To get aspect ratio, the formula is: Divide the width by the height or simply divide the long side by the short side.

There are multiple online aspect ratio calculators available. Check out the value for both the images and the videos generated through the photo ratio calculator for your ease.

| Common Aspect Ratio                   | AR Width | AR Height | Image Width | Image Height |
| ------------------------------------- | -------- | --------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| 1:1(square)                           | 1        | 1         | 1920        | 1920         |
| 5:4 (large and medium format cameras) | 5        | 4         | 1920        | 1536         |
| 4:3 Standard                          | 4        | 3         | 1920        | 1440         |
| 3:2 (35mm camera)                     | 3        | 2         | 1920        | 1280         |
| 16:9                                  | 16       | 9         | 1920        | 1080         |
| 3:1 Panoramic                         | 3        | 1         | 1920        | 640          |
| 9:16                                  | 9        | 16        | 1080        | 1920         |

For example, the aspect ratio of 3:1 may be an image of 3m wide and 1m high. At the same time it can be 3 feet wide and 1 foot high. For further simplification, consider dimensions in pixels: a 6000×4000 image has 3:2 aspect ratios.

Always remember this small but crucial point. The aspect ratio refers to the image or video you captured or recorded and the display (or screen) in which your video or image would be displayed.

### Why is the aspect ratio important?

In the age of web content, asking why aspect ratio is important? Some may consider it naïve. Images need to be uploaded at different aspect ratios for different uses (desktop vs. mobile or blog vs. social media). Incorrect aspect ratio affects your final image and end-user experience.

Choice of the wrong aspect ratio can eliminate the potential for editing (cropping and resizing). In addition, using the correct aspect ratios saves you from facing the trouble of distortion or clipping.

## Part 2 Types of Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical

### Image Aspect Ratios

The aspect ratio decides and changes the entire composition and how the audience perceives the image. First, let us see some common image aspect ratios.

![image aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-6.jpg)

● 1:1 Ratio

![1 to 1 ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-1.png)

If you have seen a square-shaped image, it had probably a 1:1 aspect ratio. It simply means both sides (width and height of the image) are equal. It was initially the aspect ratio of square television sets. However, this is commonly used for print photos, mobile screens, and social platforms.

● 3:2 Ratio

![3 to 2 ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-2.png)

Initially used for classic 35 mm film and still photography, aspect ratio 3:5 is still used on some laptops, tablets, and handheld game consoles. The famous example of this aspect ratio Images framed at 1080×720 pixels or 6″x4″.

● 5:4 Ratio

![5 to 4 ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-14.png)

It was commonly used for photography and art prints. For Images having dimensions, 8″x10″ and 16x20 have the 5:4 aspect ratios.

### Video Aspect Ratios

![ video aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-13.png)

Like the image aspect ratios, video aspect ratios would also profoundly affect its composition and thus how your directed viewers perceive it. Some common mobile vertical video size or video aspect ratios are given below.

● 16:9 Ratio

![16 to 9 ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-4.png)

If you have seen presentation slides, computer monitors, or widescreee seen this slimmer and more elongated rectangular-shaped 16:9 Ratio. This is the standardized widescreen aspect ratio that you see everywhere on the web. In terms of pixel common dimension for 16:9 is 1920×1080 pixels and 1280×720 pixels.

● 9:16 Ratio (Vertical)

![9:16 Ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-3.png)

When smartphones started coming with video capabilities, this Ratio became popular. Likewise, today this Ratio is trendy for social media platforms with video story capabilities.

The Instagram story typically consists of 1080x1920 pixels, which in terms of aspect ratio is 9:16\. Most phones, such as iPhone, have a feature that allows you to record footage in both (16:9 as well as 9:16).

### Phone aspect ratio vertical

Back in the day, taking aspect ratio vertical (portrait mode) footage was considered unprofessional and a sign of an amateur. But the digital revolution has changed that. Now from unforgivable sin, the vewayal mode has practically become a mainstream media sensation. Vertical style has now become the dominant format.

![phone aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-7.png)

Phone aspect ratio vertical simply means taller screen than wider. The most common type is 9:16 (1080x1920 pixels), a typical vertical videos aspect ratio. Although this phone aspect ratio vertical comes in a few more shapes and sizes such as 4:5, 2:3.

## Part 3 Tips to Create Phone Vertical Videos

Creating vertical videos is crucial for getting engagements and growing your brand. It is easy with a phone because most smartphones, by default, record in 9:16, which is the standard vertical aspect ratio. But with a camera, you have to manually edit to the correct aspect ratio before you shoot it.

You can also shoot horizontally and then change it to vertical, but it needs professional videographer expertise.

Who wants to rotate their phones watching videos? Well, as far as the trend, Let us see some tiny but handy tips for creating vertical phone videos.

### 1\. Choose the correct aspect ratio

Video taller than the 1:1 aspect ratio is commonly considered Vertical video. Types of these vertical aspects ratio include 4:5 (social), 2:3 and 9:16\. They are all taller than they are wide, thus vertical.

Choosing the correct aspect ratio for your vertical video, always think about why and where you intend to use the video. The second important thing you should consider is your plans for editing that video.

Cropping horizontal can be irritating and sometimes disappointing at the same time. Producing a 9:16 vertical frame at HD resolution from a horizontal HD frame may result in very pixelated and low-quality footage.

If, for some reason, you still want first to shoot it horizontal and then change it back to mobile vertical video size. You may need to shoot in 4K horizontally to get extra pixels to work with. It can later be cropped in the sides to 9:16 (Vertical phone aspect ratio). Plus, you won't need to scale it anymore.

### 2\. Direct your viewer's eyes

For hooking social media viewers, you need to put your most interesting visual upfront. These include GIFs, colourful stop-motion or looping animation. Always try to match your first couple of shots with your overall brand personality.

3\. Screen splitting into two or more

![screen splitting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-11.png)

A tall vertical screen can be styled with multiple horizontal clips on top of each other. These clips must relate to your relevant content and overall look. Natural lines or patterns can help display them in the most creative ways.

### 4\. Be close to your subject

For producing an intimate experience with the vertical frame, you should get closer to the subject. Most of the action will be positioned to the centre as your viewers scroll. Do not let cut off or cover up your main subject by any text and make sure you leave enough room for text, emojis and stickers.

### 5\. Filling the vertical space

First, make sure that your subject is vertical-friendly. Then get closer and fill the space within the vertical frame. The vertical frame can be filled through the following:

● Up-close shot (if the subject is personal).

● Raising the camera high and tilting it down (to film things like a long, empty road).

● Bird’s-eye view from above.

### 5\. Rule of Third

![rule of third](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-10.png)

This photography rule says not to place the main subject directly in the center of the frame. Create more dynamic composition by creating imaginary (Horizontal & Vertical) lines that divide your frame into thirds.

You have to place your subject either on the lines or where the lines meet up. And guess what? You don't need to draw imaginary nowadays. Most cameras and smartphones provide you with this option.

### 6\. Avoid Shaking

You do not want to distract your viewers with shaky camera moments. Normal pan and 360-degree rotation are acceptable or maybe even essential. But moving side to side too quickly will make it difficult for the camera to process that information. You better use a selfie stick or gimbal.
