## 4 Solutions to Resize a WebM File

People resize videos for many reasons, the most common one being to reduce file size. Others might be to meet a specification, or for compatibility. When you resize a video file, you reduce its file size considerably- making it load faster on devices, reduce processing time, and save a lot of space. Most people prefer watching videos that are smaller in size compared to larger ones, that’s why some social media sites like Instagram, Tiktok, etc have preferred video resolutions, so if you are a user on these sites you might want to resize your video to fit.

The biggest concern most people have about resizing videos is whether it will retain its quality, another concern is that you don’t want to crop out your video while resizing. If the format of the video is mp4, wmv, avi, etc which usually have very large size, resizing it might be a bit of a problem because the video quality will reduce a lot, but if it’s a WebM video file, you can still achieve a good video quality even after multiple compression or changing its resolution, that’s because its codecs- VP8 and VP9 were designed specifically for that, and it’s supported by all browsers.

In the course of this article, we’re assuming you already have a WebM video and you want to resize it, and still maintain its quality so you can upload on your favourite websites without any hassles. We have handpicked some proven methods to help you with that, let’s see them:

## Method 1: Resize WebM file with Wondershare Filmora

Wondershare [Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is a great video editing software that comes with a lot of features. You can easily perform basic editing techniques in a few minutes. It also comes with lots of filters to make your videos pop.

For video resizing, Filmora offers you a couple of options: First you have an option of changing the resolution just before you export your video; you also have the option of cropping your videos to your preferred size and cutting out redundant parts of your videos to save space; but the third option is what we’ll show you in this guide, because we imagine you already have your video exported and you just want to resize. You can easily do that by changing the aspect ratio and we’ll show you in a few steps:

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For Win 7 or later (64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For macOS 10.14 or later

**Step 1**: Go to the official Wondershare Filmora website and download the software.

**Step 2**: Install Wondershare Filmora on your PC and double click to launch.

**Step 3**: Change your aspect ratio. When you launch Filmora, you’re allowed to choose your preferred aspect ratio on the start page.

![resize-webm](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/resize-webm-1.png)

Select your preferred aspect ratio from the list of options- 16:9 (widescreen), 4:3 (standard), 1:1 (Instagram), 9:16 (portrait). For example, if you import a 16:9 video file into Filmora, and set it to 1:1 aspect ratio then, the final output file will be 1:1, which is the perfect aspect ratio for Instagram posts.

You’ll see below that I selected 1:1 for instagram. After you are done selecting your preferred aspect ratio, hit ‘New Project’.

![resize-webm](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/resize-webm-2.png)

**Step 4**: Import your WebM video. After you must have selected your preferred aspect ratio, the next step is to import the video you want to resize; you can do this by clicking on the import icon shown below. Once done, drag the video to the timeline also shown below.

![resize-webm](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/resize-webm-3.png)

![resize-webm](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/resize-webm-4.png)

A floating window will appear and you’ll be asked to change project settings to match the media. Click on ‘Keep project settings’. Filmora will change the aspect ratio of the original video you imported to your preferred aspect ratio.

![resize-webm](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/resize-webm-6.png)

## Method 2: How to resize WebM file with VLC

VLC is a free and open source multimedia player. It is arguably the best media player out there and that’s for a reason- it can play almost everything without the need for any external codecs.

The playback feature is amazing but that’s not the only thing it can do. VLC outshines most other media players because of some extra features it possesses. It resizes and converts media files, downloads and adds subtitles, records screen, as well as is customizable in settings and expandable via plugins.

What we want to use in this guide is its media resizing feature, so let’s show you how you can use it in these steps:

**Step 1**: Download VLC Media player from the official VLC page and install it on your windows or Mac PC.

**Step 2**: Launch VLC after installing by double-clicking on the software.

**Step 3**: Click "Media" in the toolbar.

**Step 4**: Select "Convert / Save". You can also tap shortcut keys Ctrl + R to quickly open a new window.

![resize-webm](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/resize-webm-8.png)

**Step 5**: Click "Add". You can load one or more video files. Here, I'll choose a colour grading video on my desktop. You can see it has the extension ‘.webm’. After loading the video file you want to resize, click "Convert / Save" again.

![resize-webm](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/resize-webm-9.png)

![resize-webm](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/resize-webm-10.png)

**Step 6**: Choose your desired output profile type. With VLC, you can resize video to MP4, WebM, TS, and other formats.

**Step 8**: Click the settings icon to access the settings window and select the video codec where you can adjust parameters like frame rate, bitrate, resolution, etc to change video file size. I changed the frame rate of my video to 30fps which is ideal for high quality videos. Also click the resolution tab and set your desired resolution then click save.

![resize-webm](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/resize-webm-11.png)

## Method 2: How to resize WebM file with VLC

VLC is a free and open source multimedia player. It is arguably the best media player out there and that’s for a reason- it can play almost everything without the need for any external codecs.

The playback feature is amazing but that’s not the only thing it can do. VLC outshines most other media players because of some extra features it possesses. It resizes and converts media files, downloads and adds subtitles, records screen, as well as is customizable in settings and expandable via plugins.

What we want to use in this guide is its media resizing feature, so let’s show you how you can use it in these steps:

**Step 1**: Download VLC Media player from the official VLC page and install it on your windows or Mac PC.

**Step 2**: Launch VLC after installing by double-clicking on the software.

**Step 3**: Click "Media" in the toolbar.

**Step 4**: Select "Convert / Save". You can also tap shortcut keys Ctrl + R to quickly open a new window.

![resize-webm](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/resize-webm-8.png)

**Step 5**: Click "Add". You can load one or more video files. Here, I'll choose a colour grading video on my desktop. You can see it has the extension ‘.webm’. After loading the video file you want to resize, click "Convert / Save" again.

## How to Shoot Cinematic Footage From a Smartphone

Creating cinematic videos is easy if you have expensive equipment like a film set with high-quality cameras. But many of us can’t afford this, so read this article to get an alternative.

You can use smartphones to record cinematic shots if you don't have expensive lenses. You’ll learn about filming and editing those shots into Wondershare Filmora to get professional results in the below lines.

But before we get into the filming process, having a general idea about the topic can help a lot. So first, let’s understand what cinematic videos are!

## Part 1\. What Is a Cinematic Video?

The world of cinema has developed and has high recording quality. A cinematic video is a video that is recorded to look more like a movie. These shots excel in all aspects of a video, such as Color, aspect ratio, and lighting techniques.

Most of the cinematic footage required unique cameras, i.e., **IMAX** cameras for movies. But these cameras are really costly and only suitable for large-scale production.

With the understanding of cinematic videos, you can now use alternative ways to record a cinematic video without an expensive camera. You can also record a cinematic video using only a smartphone with a few requirements.

Scroll below to learn more about what you need to record a cinematic video!

## Part 2\. Requirements to Record a Cinematic Video

To record a professional video with cinematic effects, you must have the following equipment in your studio:

### 1\. A Gimbal Stabilizer

When you are recording footage from your smartphone, a significant issue that can disturb your video quality is the shaking of your phone. You may have to record while walking, or it could even be a static shot.

If the phone is held in your hands without support, you will end up with shaky footage. This will eventually ruin your video.

A gimbal stabilizer allows you to stabilize your footage with a handheld stand. Many gimbal stabilizers are available in the market, but for reference, we would be looking at the **Q3** Gimbal from **Zhiyun**.

![zhiyun q3 gimbal stabilizer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-1.png)

You can also connect the Gimbal from its app. Scroll below to learn more about the app!

**Zhiyun Cami App**

**Zhiyun Q3** stabilizer also connects with the Zhiyun cami app. This app will allow users to access the filming features more intuitively and comprehensively. You can connect your Gimbal with the app via Bluetooth.

![zhiyun cami app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-2.png)

**Zhiyun Stabilizer Shooting Modes**

There are many modes on different Gimbals, but the Locking and the POV mode are the most useful, which are illustrated as shown below:

* **The Locking mode:** This mode allows you to lock all three motors of the Gimbal and allows your phone to remain fixed at a certain angle. Due to this, you can shoot your footage from multiple positions while keeping the camera fixed at one angle.
* **The POV mode** will allow you to unlock all the axes. This mode will also adjust in all three axes when moving around. This feature gives you more freedom of movement.

![the different modes of zhiyun q3 stabilizer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-3.png)

**Extra Features of Zhiyun Q3 Stabilizer**

When you are shooting a video using the Gimbal stabilizer, you come across a point where you want extra light. Thus, the Q3 stabilizer comes with a built-in **flashlight.**

This flashlight will not only light up those small corners of a dark room but also make a huge difference. If you are recording to focus on an object, such as a product, this flashlight will greatly help you.

![zhiyun q3 gimbal flashlight](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-4.png)

You can also turn the flashlight towards yourself if you are recording a Vlog or taking a selfie. The light’s temperature is 4300K, giving a relatively warm light on the subject.

![spectrum of light indicating 4300k](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-5.png)

### 2\. A Good Smartphone

Most smartphones these days are equipped with cameras with varying powers of recording. Some smartphone cameras focus on **Mega Pixels,** while others focus on the capture sensor. You need a smartphone camera that balances out all these qualities to record cinematic footage.

The recently released iPhone 14 pro camera is an excellent example of a good quality camera you can use to record cinematic videos.

![smartphone attached to gimbal](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-6.png)

### 3\. Video Editing Software

There is no better software in the video editing field than the infamous Wondershare Filmora. It allows you to edit high-quality videos with creative features.

Wondershare Filmora allows access to the range of effects and filters you can apply to your videos to give them a more cinematic look. It also allows you to access the vast library of audio to utilize in your videos. Moreover, its engaging UI allows beginners to access to features of Wondershare Filmora easily.

![wondershare filmora website](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-7.png)

Now that we have learned about the requirements for recording a cinematic video. Let’s look at the different cinematic movements you can use to record from your Smartphone.

## Part 3\. Top 3 Cinematic Movements to Record From a Smartphone

You may have watched many movies or TV shows, but the general audience usually ignores the effort put into a shot. Only an experienced videographer can detect the difference between a great cinematic shot and a poor one.

Of the great cinematic shots, some are described in this article. These shots can easily record by using a smartphone. The cinematic movements explained below are the best choice. Here we will look at the three camera movements you can record on your smartphone.

* The Reveal Movement.
* The 180° Presentation Movement.
* The Following Movement.

First, let’s take a look at the Reveal movement.

### 1\. The Reveal Movement

This is the most popular movement used in cinematic shooting from your smartphone. With a Gimbal, the Reveal movement is one of the easiest shots to master. But for this, you will need to learn it first.

The Reveal Movement is a shot taken with an object as a perspective. The shot starts from a static object in the foreground. It could be focused at first, but as the camera moves, the focus will be diverted to reveal our target object. This is known as the Reveal Movement.

To shoot the reveal movement, follow the steps mentioned as shown:

* First, ensure your phone is connected properly to the **Gimbal**.
* **Align** your Smartphone camera behind the static object.
* Guide the target individual to be ready as you move the camera to reveal them.
* Slowly move the camera, focusing on the static object to change its focus on your main object.

![the reveal movement](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-8.gif)

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Make sure to practice and experiment a lot with the steps. Try to be more creative and innovative. With every video you shoot, you gain experience with the errors.

Another thing to remember is that when you are shooting a Reveal movement using the Gimbal, it is best to put it in **Locking mode**. This mode works the best as it allows the camera to stay fixed in one frame making your footage seem balanced and of quality.

![gimbal fixed in locking mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-9.png)

### 2\. The 180° Presentation Movement

The next movement we will be looking at will be the 180° presentation movement. The 180° presentation will move in a half-circle fashion. It will move from one side of the subject to the other side. This will allow you to cover the overall subject’s view.

Apart from that, it will allow you to capture the background with much clarity and detail to maintain a general sense of the ambiance. Making a 180° presentation shot is fairly easy to do so. With its multiple uses, you can use this method in any scenario.

As we will move from one side to the other in a circular manner, we need to fix the frame of our video to move along. Using the **POV** **mode** of the Zhiyun Gimbal stabilizer will be the best option in this sense.

![gimbal fixed in pov mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-10.png)

Setting the Gimbal in POV mode will allow you to shoot the video from more than one angle while keeping the video balanced. Follow the steps mentioned to shoot a 180° presentation video:

* First, start recording from one side of the subject while keeping the Gimbal in the POV mode.
* Slowly start moving in front of the subject in an arch.
* When you face the subject, do not stop and keep moving to complete the arch.
* When you reach the end of the arch, close the video.

![the 180° presentation movement](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-11.gif)

By following the steps mentioned, you can create the 180° presentation movement using a smartphone. Now, move forward to learn about “The Following movement.”

### 3\. The Following Movement

You can use “The following movement” when recording a scene in which the object moves in random directions. Or when there is a high degree of movement of your object in the video, and you want to fix the focus of your footage to that object.

The Following movement is not technically a movement, but a setting that will allow you to record the footage while keeping the object and the video frame focused. In this type of footage, we will use the Zhiyun Cami app to focus on our target object.

![drawing a square to focus the subject](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-12.png)

To focus on our subject in the video by Cami app, follow the steps mentioned below:

* When recording the video, make sure to put the Gimbal on a tripod stand.
* After that, open the **Cami** app and draw a square over the object you want to keep in focus.
* Now, the camera will shift its angle to its perspective wherever the object goes.

![the following movement](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-13.gif)

This is how you will create the following movement.

## Conclusion

Using expensive equipment to record a cinematic video can be a reliable step. But it is not in everyone’s budget. You can also use a smartphone to record a cinematic video by the steps mentioned above and give it a professional look by editing on Wondershare Filmora.

Although it might seem strange initially, but the time is close when everyone will create cinematic videos from their smartphones.

Another thing to remember is that when you are shooting a Reveal movement using the Gimbal, it is best to put it in **Locking mode**. This mode works the best as it allows the camera to stay fixed in one frame making your footage seem balanced and of quality.

![gimbal fixed in locking mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-9.png)

### 2\. The 180° Presentation Movement

The next movement we will be looking at will be the 180° presentation movement. The 180° presentation will move in a half-circle fashion. It will move from one side of the subject to the other side. This will allow you to cover the overall subject’s view.

Apart from that, it will allow you to capture the background with much clarity and detail to maintain a general sense of the ambiance. Making a 180° presentation shot is fairly easy to do so. With its multiple uses, you can use this method in any scenario.

As we will move from one side to the other in a circular manner, we need to fix the frame of our video to move along. Using the **POV** **mode** of the Zhiyun Gimbal stabilizer will be the best option in this sense.

![gimbal fixed in pov mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-10.png)

## Want to Add Subtitles to Netflix Videos in Your Preferred Language? Read This Article to Learn Two Different Methods for Uploading Custom Subtitles to Netflix

Netflix is the most popular streaming service in the world. It offers loads of movies and series that you can watch on smartphones, tablets, and computers. Over the years, Netflix has become a one-stop destination for watching movies and TV shows in different languages.

While the user base of Netflix is quite diverse, the platform offers subtitles in limited languages for most movies and series. Suppose you want to view a Korean Drama on Netflix with French subtitles. However, you found that French subtitles are unavailable for that Korean Drama. In such a case, you might wonder if adding custom subtitles to Netflix is possible.

Well, you can add subtitles to Netflix, and there are two different methods to do the same. This guide will help you learn both methods available for adding custom subtitles to Netflix. So, let's get started!

## Method 1\. Upload Your Custom Subtitle to Netflix

Before proceeding with this method, you must remember that it only works if you are a Netflix Premium user. Now, let's discuss how to add subtitles to Netflix with this method.

### Key Steps to Follow

Below are the steps for adding custom subtitles to Netflix.

Step 1 First of all, you need to install and add [Language Learning with Netflix & YouTube™](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/language-learning-with-ne/bekopgepchoeepdmokgkpkfhegkeohbl?hl=en-US) extension to your web browser (Chrome or Edge).

Step 2 Make sure the extension is activated.

Step 3 Download the .srt file that contains the subtitles in your preferred language for a particular movie or TV show.

Step 4 Open Netflix on a Chrome or Edge browser and sign into your account.

Step 5 Play the movie or TV show for which you have downloaded the subtitles.

Step 6 Within the Netflix player, you will see a settings icon left to the **Subtitles** icon. Click on it.

Step 7 Among the various setting options, you need to choose the screen and find the one with the label "Lower Subtitles (Mother Language)". You need to click on its field and select the "Upload Subtitle" option.

Step 8 You will see a pop-up window at the top of the screen where you need to click the "Choose File" button.

Step 9 You then need to navigate to the directory on your computer where you have downloaded the subtitles file, select it, and click the "Open" button.

Step 10 Click the "Okay" button to upload the subtitles to Netflix.

Step 11 Close the settings window and play the video. You can view the uploaded subtitles at the bottom of the player.

## Method 2\. Add Custom Subtitles to Netflix with Extensions

If you're not a Netflix Premium user, you can still add subtitles to Netflix with the help of certain browser extensions. We'll list them down and discuss the steps for using one of them; the basic steps for using all such extensions are pretty much the same.

### 1\. Substital

**Supported web browsers:** [C](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/substital-add-subtitles-t/kkkbiiikppgjdiebcabomlbidfodipjg?hl=en)[hrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/substital-add-subtitles-t/kkkbiiikppgjdiebcabomlbidfodipjg?hl=en) | [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/substital/) | [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/substital-add-subtitles-/dkkffblkjnedaekodhiblomkicklmjnp?source=sfwOPERA)

Substital is among the most popular extensions that allow you to add subtitles to several online on-demand video streaming platforms, including Netflix. It has more than 100K users on the Chome Web Store.

**Key Features**

* Offers a built-in subtitles search feature.
* Supports .srt files and .zip files containing subtitles in the .srt format.
* You can manually sync the subtitles with the video.
* It allows you to customize the appearance of subtitles.

**Steps to Add Custom Subtitles to Netflix with Substital**

Following are the key steps to add custom subtitles to Netflix using the Substital extension:

Step 1 The first thing you need to do is to download and install the Substital extension on your browser.

Step 2 Open Netflix on the same browser and log in to your account.

Step 3 Play the movie or episode from a TV series for which you want to add custom subtitles.

Step 4 Download the subtitles file for the same movie or episode in your preferred language from the web.

Step 5 Now open the extensions menu in your browser and click on the Substital icon.

Step 6 You will see the name of the movie or TV show that you are watching on Netflix. Click on it.

Step 7 In this step, you need to drag and drop the subtitle file from your system (that you downloaded earlier) to the browser window.

Step 8 Finally, you can notice that the subtitles are loaded in the Netflix player.

### 2\. Super Netflix

**Web browsers:** [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/super-netflix/iakpdiefpdniabbekcbofaanjcpjkloe)

Super Netflix is yet another reliable extension to add subtitles to Netflix. Apart from adding custom subtitles, this extension allows you to change the video playback speed. Like Substital, the Super Netflix extension on Chrome Web Store also has 100K+ users.

**Key Features**

* It can help you avoid spoilers by blurring images and episode descriptions.
* You can use the extension to skip intros automatically.
* Offers 5 different video modes.
* You get the option to change the Netflix streaming server.

### 3\. Netflix SubStyler: customize subtitles

**Web browsers:** [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/netflix-substyler-customi/ggfifegigcpgkkpnpfbglofhnjcjmidd#:~:text=Netflix%20SubStyler%20%3A%20customize%20subtitles&text=Extension%20to%20customize%20captions%20and,by%20customizing%20Netflix%20subtitle%20style.)

Unlike the other two extensions mentioned above, Netflix SubStyler only allows you to change the styling of subtitles on Netflix. However, the thing that makes this extension worthy of your attention is that it comes loaded with several customization options.

**Key Features**

* You can choose a custom text color for the subtitles either with the help of an in-built color picker or by entering the RGB value of the color.
* The extension lets you add text outlines and change the size of the text.
* You can even add a text background and change its color and opacity.

## Bonus Tip: How to Edit and Add Subtitles to Videos Available Offline

In certain cases, you may want to edit the subtitles of videos probably because either the subtitles are not available for a certain part of the video, or they are not correct. So, if you want to edit subtitles of videos that you have downloaded with ease, you can consider using [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

Step 5 To add the subtitle, you need to click on the "Titles" button that you can see at the top of the Filmora window. You can see several subtitle templates available there.
