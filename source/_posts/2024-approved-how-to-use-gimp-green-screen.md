## How to Use GIMP GREEN SCREEN

Chroma key with gimp green screen is the method by which photographers (and videographers) use a monochromatic backdrop, then replace the blue or green "screen" with a virtual background. This is the method employed during every evening weather broadcast: the newscaster is standing in front of a blank screen, but the viewers at home see a weather map.

Green screen Chroma key can also be used with photography. Subjects can be photographed in front of a monochromatic screen, and a virtual background can be put behind the subject once the screen is removed. For example, a duck can be photographed in front of a green or blue tarp, which is then replaced by a photograph of a river.

## How to use green screen in gimp

If you take a picture with a solid colored background (blue or green works best), then you can have a computer program pull out the blue or green pixels and replace them with another color or a transparent layer. This process is called "chroma key" and is used in weather forecasts and other special effects. The terms "green screen" and "blue screen" also refer to the chroma key process.

These directions outlined below describe how to use GIMP to add a transparent layer and remove blue or green pixels from an image. This allows you to layer images on different backgrounds or use pictures as Sprites in Scratch or Greenfoot.

Brief outline of process:

1. Start GIMP
2. Open the picture file.
3. Create an "Alpha Channel" (Transparent Pixels)
4. Select "Like Colored Pixels" (Click on the Green or Blue background)
5. Control->K to delete the pixels and reveal the Transparent background.
6. Save the picture as a .gif file. (Not .jpg!)

Detailed Directions:

1. Start GIMP: (The "Gnu Image Manipulation Program")
2. Click the "K" menu
3. Select "Graphics"
4. Select "GIMP Image Editor"

Note about the GIMP:

Most computer applications run in one window. GIMP will run different windows for each function or object you are working with. (Separate windows for paintbrush menus, images, backgrounds, etc . . .)

1. Select "File-> Open"
2. Navigate to your File Area and select a chroma key picture
3. Once your picture opens, add the "Alpha Channel"  
a. Select "Layer" from the picture menu bar  
b. Select “Transparency”  
c. Select "Add Alpha Channel"
4. Click the "Select Region by Color" icon.
5. Click once on the green or blue color in the background.
6. Press "Control -> K" on the keyboard to delete the colors. The background will appear as a gray checkerboard pattern.
7. Repeat the click and "Control-K" process to remove the background colors.
8. Once the background colors are removed, save the picture:  
a. Select "File-Save As" from the menu bar.  
b. Type "LastnamePicture.gif" as the filename.
9. Select "Convert to Indexed" - Click Export
10. Click “OK”
11. the picture should save.
12. You can now use this picture in Scratch for a sprite, or in other graphics projects to combine with backgrounds.

Krita provides filters that can be used directly, i.e. destructively on the pixels of a layer, when painting, or dynamically as a filter layer or filter mask.

### Paint.Net

Paint.net is a free and very capable image editing software for Windows. Great alternative to Photoshop for people that do not need all the stuff PS offers.

In order to handle multiple images easily, Paint.NET uses a tabbed document interface. The tabs display a live thumbnail of the image instead of a text description. This makes navigation very simple and fast. Extensive work has gone into making Paint.NET the fastest image editor available. Whether you have a netbook with a power-conscious Atom CPU, or a Dual Intel Xeon workstation with 16+ blazingly fast processing cores, you can expect Paint.NET to start up quickly and be responsive to every mouse click.

Key Features

* ****Performance**

Extensive work has gone into making Paint.NET the fastest image editor available. Whether you have a netbook with a power-conscious Atom CPU, or a Dual Intel Xeon workstation with 16+ blazingly fast processing cores, you can expect Paint.NET to start up quickly and be responsive to every mouse click.

* ****Layers**

Usually only found on expensive or complicated professional software, layers form the basis for a rich image composition experience. You may think of them as a stack of transparency slides that, when viewed together at the same time, form one image.

* ****Automatically Updated**

Updates are free, and contain new features, performance improvements, and bug fixes. Upgrading to the latest version is very simple, requiring only two clicks of the mouse.

* ****Special Effects**

Many special effects are included for enhancing and perfecting your images. Everything from blurring, sharpening, red-eye removal, distortion, noise, and embossing are included. Also included is our unique 3D Rotate/Zoom effect that makes it very easy to add perspective and tilting. Adjustments are also included which help you tweak an image's brightness, contrast, hue, saturation, curves, and levels. You can also convert an image to black and white, or sepia-toned.

* ****Powerful Tools**

Paint.NET includes simple tools for drawing shapes, including an easy-to-use curve tool for drawing splines or Bezier curves. The Gradient tool, new for 3.0, has been cited as an innovative improvement over similar tools provided by other software. The facilities for creating and working with selections is powerful, yet still simple enough to be picked up quickly. Other powerful tools include the Magic Wand for selecting regions of similar color, and the Clone Stamp for copying or erasing portions of an image. There is also a simple text editor, a tool for zooming, and a Recolor tool.

* ****Unlimited History**

Everybody makes mistakes, and everybody changes their mind. To accommodate this, __every_ action you perform on an image is recorded in the History window and may be undone. Once you've undone an action, you can also redo it. The length of the history is only limited by available disk space.

### Adobe Photoshop

Adobe Photoshop is the commercial image editor that set the standard in creative illustration and design work with a sophisticated, layer-based workflow and robust, professional feature set.

Over the years, Photoshop developed from a small photo editing tool to an Industry-leading software that dictates the global graphic designing and multimedia industries. With every new version, Adobe introduces in the Photoshop; the graphic designing communities wait to check out the next big leap where Photoshop can take them.

Key Features of Adobe Photoshop

* **Layers**

With Layers palette, you can draw or design various elements of your document independently in layers and stack them up as per the order of display. With this advantage, control over every single object is catered at the click of a mouse. Mistakes happen, but the effects of the mistake are limited to the part of the canvas; you can choose to work on the particular part and leave the rest of the canvas as it is. This benefit is lacking in the traditional painting method. Artists are not allowed to relax at any part of the drawing or painting once their concentration is diverted and a stroke of painting goes wrong! They are bound to change the whole canvas.

* **Selection Tools**

Photoshop’s selection tools are so handy to use that designers worldwide are addicted to the set of selection tools Photoshop offers. However, there are a bunch of competitive software and open-source software designed to give tough competition for Photoshop. Users are still stuck with Adobe’s torch bearer software due to the ease its tools provide.

* **Pen Tool**

Today, Photoshop cannot be imagined without a Pen tool. Though the pen tool, by nature, works for drawing paths along with the anchor points, the creative scope it provides is limitless. The tool is designed so flexibly that the designer can draw any shape or edit the existing shapes as good as he is using his bare hand. The amount of control we have through placing the anchor points in the right places is taken further with the three types of Anchor points that can allow you to draw and edit paths precisely.

* **Shapes**

The outlook of the shape layers in Photoshop may be limited, but the capabilities of the feature go a step further than what we assume about it. In the traditional marquee selection tools, the selection is limited to the raster process, and in many cases, the output will result in the sharp pixilated edges, which are never good looking. But the shape layers can act as an individual object within the document with its attribute to maintain the finest quality.

* **Vector Mask**

The layer masks create a masking portion of an object by using the grayscale color combination (Shades of Gray). Once the masking part is done, the area of the object under the layer mask disappears.

* **Retouching Tools**

Retouching tools are an accumulation of various tools such as Stamp tool, Pattern Stamp tool, Spot Healing tool, Healing tool, Patch tool, Redeye tool and much more. Though the numbers are more, every tool has its importance. The development of retouching tools did not happen overnight. Adobe was working hard identifying the problems of the photographers and finding the solutions for the problems from time to time.

### Affinity Photo

Affinity Photo is a professional, full-featured raster graphics editor. Working in Affinity Photo is always live and you can pan and zoom at 60fps, with live previews and non-destructive application.

Whatever your genre of choice, be it landscapes, portraits, macro or anything else, Affinity not only has an unbeatable set of tools to help you, but it’s also laid out in an intuitive way that is ideal for newcomers and those switching from other software alike. There are a series of modules, called Personas, that bring you dedicated interfaces, such as Tone Mapping, RAW Developing and even a powerful liquify interface that makes complex reshaping a breeze! Even better, you can take the full functionality of the desktop app on the road, thanks to the iPad version, which is the most powerful mobile editing solution available. With so much on offer for so little, it’s time that you incorporated Affinity Photo into your workflow and moved your photography to the next step. To get you started, we’re going to give you some great tips to get the most from this brilliant software and get you well on the way to creating your own Masterpieces.

* ****Develop RAW Files Like A Pro**

The first milestone in any photographer’s journey is unquestionably learning to shoot RAW. This image format captures even more data than JPEG and can be tweaked to create the perfect image or a solid base for further editing. To take advantage, all you need to do is open up your RAW file of choice into Affinity Photo and the Develop Persona will load up automatically. From here you can apply exposure adjustments, recover highlights and shadows and even craft a split toning effect. There’s a Curves adjustment for precision tweaks, a savvy noise reduction component and a lens correction module to combat distortion. It has everything you need for that all-important first step to brilliance.

* ****Professional Skin Retouching At The Click Of A Button**

If you shoot portraits, you’ll doubtless know about the power of frequency separation. This technique is favored by many pros to get that glossy high-end look that screams professional. While it may sound complicated, in Affinity Photo it’s as simple as going to the Photo Persona and clicking on Filters>Frequency Separation. Once you’ve done this, you can set your Gaussian Blur amount in real-time, click Apply and the software will split your shot into two layers, one with the color and one with the detail. From here, you can remove blemishes, add your own dodge and burn and tidy up colors – a game changer!

* ****Ramp Up Your Dynamic Range With Tone Mapping**

Amazingly, Affinity Photo has its very own Tone Mapping Persona with a full suite of tools to get your well on the way to high dynamic range images, whether you have a series of bracketed shots – identical photos taken at different exposures – or a single shot as we’ve used. Opening this Persona brings up a toolbar on the right-hand side with the usual exposure and enhancement tools, though also gives you access to Tone Compression, Local Contrast and detail sliders. There’s even a series of presets to get you started. Like most of Affinity, the effects can be seen in real-time and are completely reversible, meaning there’s no such thing as a permanent mistake. What we love most about the Tone Mapping Persona is the subtlety compared to others on offer, meaning you’re able to keep your shots looking natural while still getting the most from your work!

* ****Adjustments Are Plentiful And Powerful**

Adjustments refer to a series of functional layers that apply specific effects to your shots. These can be as simple as Exposure, Vibrance or Brightness and Contrast, which do what they say on the tin, all the way up to more powerful options like Gradient Maps, Channel Mixers and Color Balance for creative effects and color corrections. Because they’re layers, they can be altered at any time in your editing process and moved around as you see fit. They affect any layers below them in the Layer palette but can be set to cast an effect on only a single-pixel layer by using the brilliant Mask to Below feature. You can also stack as many Adjustments as you wish, giving you a huge amount of flexibility to fine-tune your work in any way possible.

* ****Layers Offer You The Ultimate Creative Freedom**

An editing software that doesn’t allow Layers will really set back your creative choices. Happily, Affinity Photo gives you full control over its layer system. This means that you can bring in additional elements into your scene. You can then take advantage of Affinity’s hugely powerful selection engine to select the parts you wish to cut out or scroll through the full list of Blending Modes for a more refined and creative look. To add the birds to our shot, we took one landscape and added in a shot of birds taken against a white sky. From here, it’s as easy as setting the Blending Mode to Multiply and voila, the white sky has gone. Of course, there’s no need to stop there, and you can find yourself creating in-depth composites that are truly only limited by your imagination - set yourself free!

### Pixlr

Pixlr makes it easy to transform everyday images into stunning works of art. Whether you’re applying a quick fix to your photos or adding your personal touch with effects, overlays, or borders, Pixlr has everything you need to make your moments beautiful.

For now, Pixlr is free for all users: individuals to the enterprise. There is no news yet if and when the platform is set to charge people from using it.

This makes your interaction with the app, over the net, is secure. Also, Pixlr does not store any copy of your images in their systems.

**Key Features**

* ****Free and Safe**

Pixlr, for now, is free. There is also no indication that the company will charge users soon. It is a legitimate site that does not engage in fraudulent activities or perpetuate any hidden charges. The images that you edit or make on Pixlr are also free for commercial use. For freelance artists and small businesses, this is the perfect starter app. For enterprises with content creators in the field, it is good to let employees know about Pixlr’s no-cost offer.

* ****Versatile and Lightweight**

Any browser can access Pixlr. Users can access the image editing suite regardless of device type and operating system. If you are on Mac, Windows, or Linux using Safari, Edge, Firefox, or Chrome, Pixlr is available at your disposal. All you need to have is a Flash plug-in.

* ****Quick Fix**

Pixlr is known for being the lightweight app that packs so many editing tools and functionalities at no cost. But, maybe, more importantly, it also includes many tools for quick fixes. This is something essential for people on the go or those that just need minor adjustments. Just open your browser on any device and apply touch-ups. You do not have to open your laptop or go to your desktop for simple needs.

* ****Spot heal**

Super useful, the spot heal tool can help remove scratches or blemishes by simply clicking on the area. Additional options: Besides size of brush, you have a choice of Pixlr choosing to blend the area with nearby area values or generate a pattern. Generally, you will only want to choose a pattern if you’re blending an area that has a pattern (e.g., a chain-link fence).

* ****Dodge**

Use the dodge tool to lighten specific areas. Note that this is a tool that deals with contrast (light vs. dark) and not color, although color may sometimes appear to change based on your lightening. Additional options: You can change brush size and exposure settings. You can also choose to focus your lightening on shadows, midtones, or highlights.

* ****Sponge**

The sponge tool enhances or sops up color, depending on your settings. It’s a great tool for saturating or desaturating specific areas of an image. Additional options: You can change the brush size and brush strength, but the most important setting is whether you want to saturate (increase) or desaturate (decrease) coloring.

## Conclusion

When choosing an object for use in chroma key, it is important to verify the background "screen" color does not exist on the object. For example, choosing a blue background for a blue butterfly would be a poor choice: portions of the butterfly would be deleted along with the background.In addition, it would be a good idea to become familiar with basic GIMP functions before attempting this tutorial: a basic knowledge of the Layers dialog and toolbox items is necessary prior to attempting this photo editing technique.

These can be as simple as Exposure, Vibrance or Brightness and Contrast, which do what they say on the tin, all the way up to more powerful options like Gradient Maps, Channel Mixers and Color Balance for creative effects and color corrections. Because they’re layers, they can be altered at any time in your editing process and moved around as you see fit. They affect any layers below them in the Layer palette but can be set to cast an effect on only a single-pixel layer by using the brilliant Mask to Below feature. You can also stack as many Adjustments as you wish, giving you a huge amount of flexibility to fine-tune your work in any way possible.

* ****Layers Offer You The Ultimate Creative Freedom**

An editing software that doesn’t allow Layers will really set back your creative choices. Happily, Affinity Photo gives you full control over its layer system. This means that you can bring in additional elements into your scene. You can then take advantage of Affinity’s hugely powerful selection engine to select the parts you wish to cut out or scroll through the full list of Blending Modes for a more refined and creative look. To add the birds to our shot, we took one landscape and added in a shot of birds taken against a white sky. From here, it’s as easy as setting the Blending Mode to Multiply and voila, the white sky has gone. Of course, there’s no need to stop there, and you can find yourself creating in-depth composites that are truly only limited by your imagination - set yourself free!

You do not have to open your laptop or go to your desktop for simple needs.

* ****Spot heal**

Super useful, the spot heal tool can help remove scratches or blemishes by simply clicking on the area. Additional options: Besides size of brush, you have a choice of Pixlr choosing to blend the area with nearby area values or generate a pattern. Generally, you will only want to choose a pattern if you’re blending an area that has a pattern (e.g., a chain-link fence).

* ****Dodge**

Use the dodge tool to lighten specific areas. Note that this is a tool that deals with contrast (light vs. dark) and not color, although color may sometimes appear to change based on your lightening. Additional options: You can change brush size and exposure settings. You can also choose to focus your lightening on shadows, midtones, or highlights.

* ****Sponge**

The sponge tool enhances or sops up color, depending on your settings. It’s a great tool for saturating or desaturating specific areas of an image. Additional options: You can change the brush size and brush strength, but the most important setting is whether you want to saturate (increase) or desaturate (decrease) coloring.

## Conclusion

When choosing an object for use in chroma key, it is important to verify the background "screen" color does not exist on the object. For example, choosing a blue background for a blue butterfly would be a poor choice: portions of the butterfly would be deleted along with the background.In addition, it would be a good idea to become familiar with basic GIMP functions before attempting this tutorial: a basic knowledge of the Layers dialog and toolbox items is necessary prior to attempting this photo editing technique.

## How to use green screen in gimp

If you take a picture with a solid colored background (blue or green works best), then you can have a computer program pull out the blue or green pixels and replace them with another color or a transparent layer. This process is called "chroma key" and is used in weather forecasts and other special effects. The terms "green screen" and "blue screen" also refer to the chroma key process.

These directions outlined below describe how to use GIMP to add a transparent layer and remove blue or green pixels from an image. This allows you to layer images on different backgrounds or use pictures as Sprites in Scratch or Greenfoot.

Brief outline of process:

1. Start GIMP
2. Open the picture file.
3. Create an "Alpha Channel" (Transparent Pixels)
4. Select "Like Colored Pixels" (Click on the Green or Blue background)
5. Control->K to delete the pixels and reveal the Transparent background.
6. Save the picture as a .gif file. (Not .jpg!)

c. Select "Add Alpha Channel"
4. Click the "Select Region by Color" icon.
5. Click once on the green or blue color in the background.
6. Press "Control -> K" on the keyboard to delete the colors. The background will appear as a gray checkerboard pattern.
7. Repeat the click and "Control-K" process to remove the background colors.
8. Once the background colors are removed, save the picture:  
a. Select "File-Save As" from the menu bar.  
b. Type "LastnamePicture.gif" as the filename.
9. Select "Convert to Indexed" - Click Export
10. Click “OK”

### Adobe Photoshop

Adobe Photoshop is the commercial image editor that set the standard in creative illustration and design work with a sophisticated, layer-based workflow and robust, professional feature set.

Over the years, Photoshop developed from a small photo editing tool to an Industry-leading software that dictates the global graphic designing and multimedia industries. With every new version, Adobe introduces in the Photoshop; the graphic designing communities wait to check out the next big leap where Photoshop can take them.

Key Features of Adobe Photoshop

* **Layers**

With Layers palette, you can draw or design various elements of your document independently in layers and stack them up as per the order of display. With this advantage, control over every single object is catered at the click of a mouse. Mistakes happen, but the effects of the mistake are limited to the part of the canvas; you can choose to work on the particular part and leave the rest of the canvas as it is. This benefit is lacking in the traditional painting method. Artists are not allowed to relax at any part of the drawing or painting once their concentration is diverted and a stroke of painting goes wrong! They are bound to change the whole canvas.

* **Selection Tools**

Photoshop’s selection tools are so handy to use that designers worldwide are addicted to the set of selection tools Photoshop offers. However, there are a bunch of competitive software and open-source software designed to give tough competition for Photoshop. Users are still stuck with Adobe’s torch bearer software due to the ease its tools provide.

* **Pen Tool**

Today, Photoshop cannot be imagined without a Pen tool. Though the pen tool, by nature, works for drawing paths along with the anchor points, the creative scope it provides is limitless. The tool is designed so flexibly that the designer can draw any shape or edit the existing shapes as good as he is using his bare hand. The amount of control we have through placing the anchor points in the right places is taken further with the three types of Anchor points that can allow you to draw and edit paths precisely.

* **Shapes**

The outlook of the shape layers in Photoshop may be limited, but the capabilities of the feature go a step further than what we assume about it. In the traditional marquee selection tools, the selection is limited to the raster process, and in many cases, the output will result in the sharp pixilated edges, which are never good looking. But the shape layers can act as an individual object within the document with its attribute to maintain the finest quality.

* **Vector Mask**

The layer masks create a masking portion of an object by using the grayscale color combination (Shades of Gray). Once the masking part is done, the area of the object under the layer mask disappears.

* **Retouching Tools**

Retouching tools are an accumulation of various tools such as Stamp tool, Pattern Stamp tool, Spot Healing tool, Healing tool, Patch tool, Redeye tool and much more. Though the numbers are more, every tool has its importance. The development of retouching tools did not happen overnight. Adobe was working hard identifying the problems of the photographers and finding the solutions for the problems from time to time.

### Affinity Photo

Affinity Photo is a professional, full-featured raster graphics editor. Working in Affinity Photo is always live and you can pan and zoom at 60fps, with live previews and non-destructive application.

Whatever your genre of choice, be it landscapes, portraits, macro or anything else, Affinity not only has an unbeatable set of tools to help you, but it’s also laid out in an intuitive way that is ideal for newcomers and those switching from other software alike. There are a series of modules, called Personas, that bring you dedicated interfaces, such as Tone Mapping, RAW Developing and even a powerful liquify interface that makes complex reshaping a breeze! Even better, you can take the full functionality of the desktop app on the road, thanks to the iPad version, which is the most powerful mobile editing solution available. With so much on offer for so little, it’s time that you incorporated Affinity Photo into your workflow and moved your photography to the next step. To get you started, we’re going to give you some great tips to get the most from this brilliant software and get you well on the way to creating your own Masterpieces.

* ****Develop RAW Files Like A Pro**

The first milestone in any photographer’s journey is unquestionably learning to shoot RAW. This image format captures even more data than JPEG and can be tweaked to create the perfect image or a solid base for further editing. To take advantage, all you need to do is open up your RAW file of choice into Affinity Photo and the Develop Persona will load up automatically. From here you can apply exposure adjustments, recover highlights and shadows and even craft a split toning effect. There’s a Curves adjustment for precision tweaks, a savvy noise reduction component and a lens correction module to combat distortion. It has everything you need for that all-important first step to brilliance.

* ****Professional Skin Retouching At The Click Of A Button**

If you shoot portraits, you’ll doubtless know about the power of frequency separation. This technique is favored by many pros to get that glossy high-end look that screams professional. While it may sound complicated, in Affinity Photo it’s as simple as going to the Photo Persona and clicking on Filters>Frequency Separation. Once you’ve done this, you can set your Gaussian Blur amount in real-time, click Apply and the software will split your shot into two layers, one with the color and one with the detail. From here, you can remove blemishes, add your own dodge and burn and tidy up colors – a game changer!

* ****Ramp Up Your Dynamic Range With Tone Mapping**

Amazingly, Affinity Photo has its very own Tone Mapping Persona with a full suite of tools to get your well on the way to high dynamic range images, whether you have a series of bracketed shots – identical photos taken at different exposures – or a single shot as we’ve used. Opening this Persona brings up a toolbar on the right-hand side with the usual exposure and enhancement tools, though also gives you access to Tone Compression, Local Contrast and detail sliders. There’s even a series of presets to get you started. Like most of Affinity, the effects can be seen in real-time and are completely reversible, meaning there’s no such thing as a permanent mistake. What we love most about the Tone Mapping Persona is the subtlety compared to others on offer, meaning you’re able to keep your shots looking natural while still getting the most from your work!

* ****Adjustments Are Plentiful And Powerful**

Adjustments refer to a series of functional layers that apply specific effects to your shots. These can be as simple as Exposure, Vibrance or Brightness and Contrast, which do what they say on the tin, all the way up to more powerful options like Gradient Maps, Channel Mixers and Color Balance for creative effects and color corrections. Because they’re layers, they can be altered at any time in your editing process and moved around as you see fit. They affect any layers below them in the Layer palette but can be set to cast an effect on only a single-pixel layer by using the brilliant Mask to Below feature. You can also stack as many Adjustments as you wish, giving you a huge amount of flexibility to fine-tune your work in any way possible.

* ****Layers Offer You The Ultimate Creative Freedom**

An editing software that doesn’t allow Layers will really set back your creative choices. Happily, Affinity Photo gives you full control over its layer system. This means that you can bring in additional elements into your scene. You can then take advantage of Affinity’s hugely powerful selection engine to select the parts you wish to cut out or scroll through the full list of Blending Modes for a more refined and creative look. To add the birds to our shot, we took one landscape and added in a shot of birds taken against a white sky. From here, it’s as easy as setting the Blending Mode to Multiply and voila, the white sky has gone. Of course, there’s no need to stop there, and you can find yourself creating in-depth composites that are truly only limited by your imagination - set yourself free!

Affinity Photo is a professional, full-featured raster graphics editor. Working in Affinity Photo is always live and you can pan and zoom at 60fps, with live previews and non-destructive application.

Whatever your genre of choice, be it landscapes, portraits, macro or anything else, Affinity not only has an unbeatable set of tools to help you, but it’s also laid out in an intuitive way that is ideal for newcomers and those switching from other software alike. There are a series of modules, called Personas, that bring you dedicated interfaces, such as Tone Mapping, RAW Developing and even a powerful liquify interface that makes complex reshaping a breeze! Even better, you can take the full functionality of the desktop app on the road, thanks to the iPad version, which is the most powerful mobile editing solution available. With so much on offer for so little, it’s time that you incorporated Affinity Photo into your workflow and moved your photography to the next step. To get you started, we’re going to give you some great tips to get the most from this brilliant software and get you well on the way to creating your own Masterpieces.

* ****Develop RAW Files Like A Pro**

The first milestone in any photographer’s journey is unquestionably learning to shoot RAW. This image format captures even more data than JPEG and can be tweaked to create the perfect image or a solid base for further editing. To take advantage, all you need to do is open up your RAW file of choice into Affinity Photo and the Develop Persona will load up automatically. From here you can apply exposure adjustments, recover highlights and shadows and even craft a split toning effect. There’s a Curves adjustment for precision tweaks, a savvy noise reduction component and a lens correction module to combat distortion. It has everything you need for that all-important first step to brilliance.

* ****Professional Skin Retouching At The Click Of A Button**

If you shoot portraits, you’ll doubtless know about the power of frequency separation. This technique is favored by many pros to get that glossy high-end look that screams professional. While it may sound complicated, in Affinity Photo it’s as simple as going to the Photo Persona and clicking on Filters>Frequency Separation. Once you’ve done this, you can set your Gaussian Blur amount in real-time, click Apply and the software will split your shot into two layers, one with the color and one with the detail. From here, you can remove blemishes, add your own dodge and burn and tidy up colors – a game changer!

* ****Ramp Up Your Dynamic Range With Tone Mapping**

Amazingly, Affinity Photo has its very own Tone Mapping Persona with a full suite of tools to get your well on the way to high dynamic range images, whether you have a series of bracketed shots – identical photos taken at different exposures – or a single shot as we’ve used. Opening this Persona brings up a toolbar on the right-hand side with the usual exposure and enhancement tools, though also gives you access to Tone Compression, Local Contrast and detail sliders. There’s even a series of presets to get you started. Like most of Affinity, the effects can be seen in real-time and are completely reversible, meaning there’s no such thing as a permanent mistake. What we love most about the Tone Mapping Persona is the subtlety compared to others on offer, meaning you’re able to keep your shots looking natural while still getting the most from your work!

* ****Adjustments Are Plentiful And Powerful**

Adjustments refer to a series of functional layers that apply specific effects to your shots. These can be as simple as Exposure, Vibrance or Brightness and Contrast, which do what they say on the tin, all the way up to more powerful options like Gradient Maps, Channel Mixers and Color Balance for creative effects and color corrections. Because they’re layers, they can be altered at any time in your editing process and moved around as you see fit. They affect any layers below them in the Layer palette but can be set to cast an effect on only a single-pixel layer by using the brilliant Mask to Below feature. You can also stack as many Adjustments as you wish, giving you a huge amount of flexibility to fine-tune your work in any way possible.

* ****Layers Offer You The Ultimate Creative Freedom**

An editing software that doesn’t allow Layers will really set back your creative choices. Happily, Affinity Photo gives you full control over its layer system. This means that you can bring in additional elements into your scene. You can then take advantage of Affinity’s hugely powerful selection engine to select the parts you wish to cut out or scroll through the full list of Blending Modes for a more refined and creative look. To add the birds to our shot, we took one landscape and added in a shot of birds taken against a white sky. From here, it’s as easy as setting the Blending Mode to Multiply and voila, the white sky has gone. Of course, there’s no need to stop there, and you can find yourself creating in-depth composites that are truly only limited by your imagination - set yourself free!

### Pixlr

Pixlr makes it easy to transform everyday images into stunning works of art. Whether you’re applying a quick fix to your photos or adding your personal touch with effects, overlays, or borders, Pixlr has everything you need to make your moments beautiful.

For now, Pixlr is free for all users: individuals to the enterprise. There is no news yet if and when the platform is set to charge people from using it. For content creators and artists on the go, Pixlr is a great app to use. It is free and available on the web. Regardless of your device, you only need an internet connection to get access to a free app but with serious functionalities. You just open your files from your device through the app like you would any popular image editing software and you are good to go. Furthermore, images edited on Pixlr are set to private. This makes your interaction with the app, over the net, is secure. Also, Pixlr does not store any copy of your images in their systems.

**Key Features**

* ****Free and Safe**

Pixlr, for now, is free. There is also no indication that the company will charge users soon. It is a legitimate site that does not engage in fraudulent activities or perpetuate any hidden charges. The images that you edit or make on Pixlr are also free for commercial use. For freelance artists and small businesses, this is the perfect starter app. For enterprises with content creators in the field, it is good to let employees know about Pixlr’s no-cost offer.

* ****Versatile and Lightweight**

Any browser can access Pixlr. Users can access the image editing suite regardless of device type and operating system. If you are on Mac, Windows, or Linux using Safari, Edge, Firefox, or Chrome, Pixlr is available at your disposal. All you need to have is a Flash plug-in.

If you are on mobile using iOS or Android, you can download the native apps. They do not take much of space and memory. It is a true lightweight app that packs a punch when it comes to functionality.

* ****Quick Fix**

Pixlr is known for being the lightweight app that packs so many editing tools and functionalities at no cost. But, maybe, more importantly, it also includes many tools for quick fixes. This is something essential for people on the go or those that just need minor adjustments. Just open your browser on any device and apply touch-ups. You do not have to open your laptop or go to your desktop for simple needs.

* ****Spot heal**

Super useful, the spot heal tool can help remove scratches or blemishes by simply clicking on the area. Additional options: Besides size of brush, you have a choice of Pixlr choosing to blend the area with nearby area values or generate a pattern. Generally, you will only want to choose a pattern if you’re blending an area that has a pattern (e.g., a chain-link fence).

* ****Dodge**

Use the dodge tool to lighten specific areas. Note that this is a tool that deals with contrast (light vs. dark) and not color, although color may sometimes appear to change based on your lightening. Additional options: You can change brush size and exposure settings. You can also choose to focus your lightening on shadows, midtones, or highlights.

* ****Sponge**

The sponge tool enhances or sops up color, depending on your settings. It’s a great tool for saturating or desaturating specific areas of an image. Additional options: You can change the brush size and brush strength, but the most important setting is whether you want to saturate (increase) or desaturate (decrease) coloring.

## Conclusion

When choosing an object for use in chroma key, it is important to verify the background "screen" color does not exist on the object. For example, choosing a blue background for a blue butterfly would be a poor choice: portions of the butterfly would be deleted along with the background.In addition, it would be a good idea to become familiar with basic GIMP functions before attempting this tutorial: a basic knowledge of the Layers dialog and toolbox items is necessary prior to attempting this photo editing technique.

![filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/features/text-speech-img1.png)

Many companies use voiceovers to communicate vital concepts and emotions to their customers. Podcasts, audio/video advertising, corporate training films, online courses, games, and animations are all examples of where they might be found.

Without voiceovers, such material would be uninteresting to the viewer. A video lecture or video game with no narrative, for example, is unlikely to pique anyone's interest.

Good voiceovers, on the other hand, are not inexpensive to make.

Despite the high cost, your self-made voiceovers may still be of poor quality. Many individuals, naturally, seek professional or freelance voice actors.

Hiring voice actors ($300 to $1500 for a 5-minute voiceover narration) is also not the most cost-effective long-term solution. Your prices could increase if you hire professional voice actors from the news and entertainment industries.

There are resources available. Voice over generators is available online. Most software products come in both free and premium versions, which you can pick from depending on your needs. These programs will swiftly help you reach your text to audio transformation goals, whether you're a YouTube content maker in need of an informative voiceover or a disabled person looking for a user-friendly text-to-speech converter.

Yes! That's correct. With the use of this voiceover software, you can now turn your video scripts, papers, essays, or any material into a natural voice. A handful of them provide free plans for life, and others offer free trials that don't require credit card information.

Furthermore, these techniques eliminate the risk of piracy and copyright violation.

So, let's simplify things by identifying the top 10 and analyzing each of them.

1. **ai (Supports Web)**

![voice-generators-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/voice-generators-1.jpg)

Resemble.ai operates in a variety of ways. It can not only help you make a speech out of the text, but it can also generate text for adverts with a single click. The platform can also produce a personalized voice that you can use as a voice assistant for Alexa, Google, and other services. The technique can also be used by call centres to clone their agents' voices and customize them.

Resemble gives you four alternative ways to create synthetic voices. You can use the API to generate voices, record up to 50 samples immediately on the online platform, choose from a large number of voice actors, or submit raw audio without a script.

Features

* The software allows you to Customize your brand's tone.
* It creates responsive IVR agents.
* Possible to do Advertisement text generation with AI with one click.
* Allows Instant language translation.

Cons

* The user interface could be enhanced.
* \- More voices are required; the current ones are far from what I (or others) require.

Price

The cheapest package is $30 per month.

For a personalized plan, contact a Resemble representative.

1. **ai ( Supports Web, Mobile**

![voice-generators-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/voice-generators-2.jpg)

Lovo.ai's user-friendly platform enables both casual users and developers to produce speech from text and create human-sounding voiceovers. Over 180 voice styles in 33 languages are available on the platform. The site is also regularly updated with new voices every day, giving consumers a wide range of options.

In just 15 minutes, the tool can generate personalized voices. On this platform, converting text to speech requires only three simple steps. Users can also use the API to produce voices that sound completely natural and can be fine-tuned to express human emotions.

Features

* Listening, conversion and sharing are all unlimited.
* A large voice library is available.
* Up to 15000 characters can be converted at once.
* Collection of unique voices. Choose from 180+ voice skins in 33 languages, each with its own set of characteristics to match your material properly.
* Genuine voices. Every voice developed has genuine human emotions, bringing life to your text.

Cons

* While the UI/UX is simple to use, it feels a little bland and dull."
* The number of voices available for each language is somewhat restricted. More voice samples are available."
* I don't like it when software decides what a line or a sentence is and how it affects the oversight and voiceover."

Pricing

Lovo.ai now offers two pricing options: (all pricing is for annual plans).

$34.99 per month for personal

$99.99 per month for Freelancer

The Personal plan gives access to all of the platform's features as well as 30 monthly voiceover downloads, which should be enough for most people.

Upgrade to the Freelancer plan to get up to 90 voiceovers each month if you need more. Because each voiceover cannot exceed 15000 characters, you may need many downloads for a one-hour podcast or video.

You will have to pay an additional $69.99 per month per voice for voice cloning. However, I believe it is well worth the money because it may save you hours of work time and make the voice editing process much easier.

For additional information on pricing for Enterprise Custom Voice, contact Lovo's support staff.

1. **Synthesia ( Supports Web, Mobile**

![voice-generators-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/voice-generators-3.jpg)

Synthesia is the fourth stage cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval

Synthesia stands apart from the rest of the software on this list. It's a video maker that also has an AI presenter.

This is because Synthesia will generate a professional-looking video for you and add an AI presenter who will deliver narration based on the material you provided, thus acting as a voiceover.

Features

* Avatars - Users can use this unique tool to add an AI presenter to their films. There are many pre-built avatars to pick from.

* Video with AI Presenter — Once you've chosen your avatar, all you have to do now is fill in your script. Synthesia allows you to make videos up to 2.5 hours long.
* From text to video For the first time, turn plain words into a professional-looking video.
* There are more than 60 languages available. We now support over 60 distinct languages.
* There are over 45 AI avatars. Synthesia comes with 40+ avatars right out of the box.

Pricing

Synthesia offers two pricing options.

$30 per month for personal use (monthly billing)

Enterprise – Individualized Pricing

However, you must pay for add-ons if you want the following features.

Synthesia API – beginning at $49 per month. Custom Avatar – $1000 one-time.

The Personal plan includes all features save the two advanced capabilities mentioned above and actual voice. As a result, you can make up to 10 minutes of video per month.

Assume you've exhausted your video credits. More credits can be purchased for $30 for ten credits. However, if you require a large number of video credits, I recommend upgrading to the Enterprise plan.

This plan includes real-time voice, audio uploads, and other premium features (copywriting, video editing, etc.)

Cons

* Only video producers can use it. If you're a podcaster, you'll be disappointed with the tool.
* Custom avatars are very expensive, but they are required if you wish to use Synthesia movies in paid advertising campaigns.

**4.Murf.ai ( Supports Web, Mobile)**

![voice-generators-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/voice-generators-4.jpg)

Murf.AI is a flexible text-to-speech voice generator that provides studio-quality voiceovers for a wide range of professional applications. The tool has a large voice library with over 115 distinct voices in 15 languages. Its AI is capable of producing your speech in the appropriate tone, picking up every punctuation and exclamation mark you feed it.

It also has a grammatical assistant, so you can create proofread scripts that will only improve your voiceover work. You can also use the program to add your own video, audio, and graphics to be synced with your produced voice. With its enterprise plan, the tool also has a powerful collaboration capability.

Pricing

* Murf now offers three paid pricing options: (all pricing is for yearly plans).
* Monthly Basic – $13
* \-$26 per month for Pro
* Enterprise – monthly fees start at $83

The Basic package includes full HD video quality and practically all capabilities (excluding voice editing). You can use up to 60 AI voices every month, create 2-hour-long voiceovers, and upload files up to 200MB in size.

For most users, I believe this plan is adequate. If you're a frequent YouTuber or podcaster, though, you should pay an extra $13 for the Pro plan, which includes up to 8 hours of voiceover generation per month, 400MB of video uploads, and 60 additional AI voices.

Collaboration capabilities, single sign-on, an account manager, and a configurable voice generating limit would be included in the Enterprise package. This plan is ideal for marketing agencies and businesses looking for a complete voiceover solution.

Cons

* Developers, according to several critics, should add more languages. Murf has many fewer AI voices in the library than his competitors.

**5.Play.ht**

![voice-generators-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/voice-generators-5.jpg)

Play. Ht is a web-based voice generator that allows you to generate high-quality text-to-speech. Because of its basic user interface, the platform is exceptionally simple to use. It has a text box on the home page where you may input your text, choose the language, gender, and voice style, and choose the conversion speed.

Features

* Customization — To fully customize the voiceover, highlight the words. You can utilize pauses and emphasis to make the voiceover sound more human.

* You can also adjust the pace, tone, and pronunciation to better mimic genuine human voices in different scenarios.
* Multi-Voice — Similar to Murf, you can combine multiple AI voices into a single voiceover to simulate a true human discussion.

* Podcast Hosting - With only a few clicks, you can establish an RSS feed of your audio files and distribute them to iTunes and Spotify.

* Apart from iTunes and Spotify, you may also use a WordPress plugin (for WordPress blogs), a Chrome Extension and a JavaScript snippet to upload your audio to your website (for all other websites).

* Sounds Analytics - Play. It will gather information on all audio. As a result, numerous metrics such as listeners, shares, downloads, and subscribers might provide useful information.

Pricing

Play. ht has four pricing tiers as of August 2021\. (all pricing below is for yearly plans).

$14.25 per month for personal use

$29.25 per month for professionals

$74.25 per month in Growth

$149.25 per month for business

Commercial rights, premium voice collecting, or podcast hosting are not included in the Personal plan, which severely limits the practical use of the voices. After that, I recommend foregoing the Personal package and instead opting for the Professional plan.

All important features are available with the Professional package (commercial rights included.) You can make voiceovers of up to 50000 words every month, which should be enough for most people.

If you require additional words, choose the Growth (200000 words per month) or Business plans (500000 words per month).

Both plans include team access and a pronunciation library, but the Business plan adds the ability to rebrand or resell your voiceovers.

Cons

* Other than English and European languages, voices made in other languages are not flawless.

Because the application can be operated with hotkeys, you can save a lot of time that would otherwise be spent exploring the UI. Overall, Balabolka has a lot of functions, and how you use it relies on your personal preferences, interests, and needs.

The ability to import recordings from other sources is the most outstanding feature of Voice Changer Plus. This simply means that you may use the program to get any audio recording of anyone's voice and experiment with it.

The Personal plan gives access to all of the platform's features as well as 30 monthly voiceover downloads, which should be enough for most people.

Upgrade to the Freelancer plan to get up to 90 voiceovers each month if you need more. Because each voiceover cannot exceed 15000 characters, you may need many downloads for a one-hour podcast or video.

You will have to pay an additional $69.99 per month per voice for voice cloning. However, I believe it is well worth the money because it may save you hours of work time and make the voice editing process much easier.

Synthesia stands apart from the rest of the software on this list. It's a video maker that also has an AI presenter.

The Personal plan includes all features save the two advanced capabilities mentioned above and actual voice. As a result, you can make up to 10 minutes of video per month.

Assume you've exhausted your video credits. More credits can be purchased for $30 for ten credits. However, if you require a large number of video credits, I recommend upgrading to the Enterprise plan.

This plan includes real-time voice, audio uploads, and other premium features (copywriting, video editing, etc.)

Cons

* Only video producers can use it. If you're a podcaster, you'll be disappointed with the tool.
* Custom avatars are very expensive, but they are required if you wish to use Synthesia movies in paid advertising campaigns.

The tool has a large voice library with over 115 distinct voices in 15 languages. Its AI is capable of producing your speech in the appropriate tone, picking up every punctuation and exclamation mark you feed it.

Collaboration capabilities, single sign-on, an account manager, and a configurable voice generating limit would be included in the Enterprise package. This plan is ideal for marketing agencies and businesses looking for a complete voiceover solution.

$74.25 per month in Growth

$149.25 per month for business

Commercial rights, premium voice collecting, or podcast hosting are not included in the Personal plan, which severely limits the practical use of the voices. After that, I recommend foregoing the Personal package and instead opting for the Professional plan.

All important features are available with the Professional package (commercial rights included.) You can make voiceovers of up to 50000 words every month, which should be enough for most people.

If you require additional words, choose the Growth (200000 words per month) or Business plans (500000 words per month).

Final Thoughts

As you can see, there are numerous free voiceover generators available online. Most software products come in both free and premium versions, which you can pick from depending on your needs. These programs will swiftly help you reach your text to audio transformation goals, whether you're a YouTube content maker in need of an informative voiceover or a disabled person looking for a user-friendly text-to-speech converter.

![filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/features/text-speech-img1.png)

Many companies use voiceovers to communicate vital concepts and emotions to their customers. Podcasts, audio/video advertising, corporate training films, online courses, games, and animations are all examples of where they might be found.

Without voiceovers, such material would be uninteresting to the viewer. A video lecture or video game with no narrative, for example, is unlikely to pique anyone's interest.

Good voiceovers, on the other hand, are not inexpensive to make.

Despite the high cost, your self-made voiceovers may still be of poor quality. Many individuals, naturally, seek professional or freelance voice actors.

Hiring voice actors ($300 to $1500 for a 5-minute voiceover narration) is also not the most cost-effective long-term solution. Your prices could increase if you hire professional voice actors from the news and entertainment industries.

There are resources available. Voice over generators is available online. Most software products come in both free and premium versions, which you can pick from depending on your needs. These programs will swiftly help you reach your text to audio transformation goals, whether you're a YouTube content maker in need of an informative voiceover or a disabled person looking for a user-friendly text-to-speech converter.

Yes! That's correct. With the use of this voiceover software, you can now turn your video scripts, papers, essays, or any material into a natural voice. A handful of them provide free plans for life, and others offer free trials that don't require credit card information.

Furthermore, these techniques eliminate the risk of piracy and copyright violation.

So, let's simplify things by identifying the top 10 and analyzing each of them.

Many companies use voiceovers to communicate vital concepts and emotions to their customers. Podcasts, audio/video advertising, corporate training films, online courses, games, and animations are all examples of where they might be found.

Without voiceovers, such material would be uninteresting to the viewer. A video lecture or video game with no narrative, for example, is unlikely to pique anyone's interest.

Good voiceovers, on the other hand, are not inexpensive to make.

Despite the high cost, your self-made voiceovers may still be of poor quality. Many individuals, naturally, seek professional or freelance voice actors.

Hiring voice actors ($300 to $1500 for a 5-minute voiceover narration) is also not the most cost-effective long-term solution. Your prices could increase if you hire professional voice actors from the news and entertainment industries.

There are resources available. Voice over generators is available online. Most software products come in both free and premium versions, which you can pick from depending on your needs. These programs will swiftly help you reach your text to audio transformation goals, whether you're a YouTube content maker in need of an informative voiceover or a disabled person looking for a user-friendly text-to-speech converter.

Yes! That's correct. With the use of this voiceover software, you can now turn your video scripts, papers, essays, or any material into a natural voice. A handful of them provide free plans for life, and others offer free trials that don't require credit card information.

Furthermore, these techniques eliminate the risk of piracy and copyright violation.

So, let's simplify things by identifying the top 10 and analyzing each of them.

1. **ai (Supports Web)**

![voice-generators-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/voice-generators-1.jpg)

Resemble.ai operates in a variety of ways. It can not only help you make a speech out of the text, but it can also generate text for adverts with a single click. The platform can also produce a personalized voice that you can use as a voice assistant for Alexa, Google, and other services. The technique can also be used by call centres to clone their agents' voices and customize them.

Resemble gives you four alternative ways to create synthetic voices. You can use the API to generate voices, record up to 50 samples immediately on the online platform, choose from a large number of voice actors, or submit raw audio without a script.

Features

Cons

* The user interface could be enhanced.
* \- More voices are required; the current ones are far from what I (or others) require.

Price

The cheapest package is $30 per month.

For a personalized plan, contact a Resemble representative.

1. **ai ( Supports Web, Mobile**

![voice-generators-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/voice-generators-2.jpg)

Lovo.ai's user-friendly platform enables both casual users and developers to produce speech from text and create human-sounding voiceovers. Over 180 voice styles in 33 languages are available on the platform. The site is also regularly updated with new voices every day, giving consumers a wide range of options.

In just 15 minutes, the tool can generate personalized voices. On this platform, converting text to speech requires only three simple steps. Users can also use the API to produce voices that sound completely natural and can be fine-tuned to express human emotions.

Features

* Listening, conversion and sharing are all unlimited.
* A large voice library is available.
* Up to 15000 characters can be converted at once.
* Collection of unique voices. Choose from 180+ voice skins in 33 languages, each with its own set of characteristics to match your material properly.
* Genuine voices. Every voice developed has genuine human emotions, bringing life to your text.

Cons

* While the UI/UX is simple to use, it feels a little bland and dull."
* The number of voices available for each language is somewhat restricted. More voice samples are available."
* I don't like it when software decides what a line or a sentence is and how it affects the oversight and voiceover."

Pricing

Lovo.ai now offers two pricing options: (all pricing is for annual plans).

$34.99 per month for personal

$99.99 per month for Freelancer

The Personal plan gives access to all of the platform's features as well as 30 monthly voiceover downloads, which should be enough for most people.

Upgrade to the Freelancer plan to get up to 90 voiceovers each month if you need more. Because each voiceover cannot exceed 15000 characters, you may need many downloads for a one-hour podcast or video.

You will have to pay an additional $69.99 per month per voice for voice cloning. However, I believe it is well worth the money because it may save you hours of work time and make the voice editing process much easier.

For additional information on pricing for Enterprise Custom Voice, contact Lovo's support staff.

1. **Synthesia ( Supports Web, Mobile**

![voice-generators-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/voice-generators-3.jpg)

Synthesia is the fourth stage cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval

Synthesia stands apart from the rest of the software on this list. It's a video maker that also has an AI presenter.

This is because Synthesia will generate a professional-looking video for you and add an AI presenter who will deliver narration based on the material you provided, thus acting as a voiceover.

Features

* Avatars - Users can use this unique tool to add an AI presenter to their films. There are many pre-built avatars to pick from.

However, you must pay for add-ons if you want the following features.

Synthesia API – beginning at $49 per month. Custom Avatar – $1000 one-time.

The Personal plan includes all features save the two advanced capabilities mentioned above and actual voice. As a result, you can make up to 10 minutes of video per month.

Assume you've exhausted your video credits. More credits can be purchased for $30 for ten credits. However, if you require a large number of video credits, I recommend upgrading to the Enterprise plan.

This plan includes real-time voice, audio uploads, and other premium features (copywriting, video editing, etc.)

Cons

* Only video producers can use it. If you're a podcaster, you'll be disappointed with the tool.
* Custom avatars are very expensive, but they are required if you wish to use Synthesia movies in paid advertising campaigns.

**4.Murf.ai ( Supports Web, Mobile)**

![voice-generators-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/voice-generators-4.jpg)

Murf.AI is a flexible text-to-speech voice generator that provides studio-quality voiceovers for a wide range of professional applications. The tool has a large voice library with over 115 distinct voices in 15 languages. Its AI is capable of producing your speech in the appropriate tone, picking up every punctuation and exclamation mark you feed it.

It also has a grammatical assistant, so you can create proofread scripts that will only improve your voiceover work. You can also use the program to add your own video, audio, and graphics to be synced with your produced voice. With its enterprise plan, the tool also has a powerful collaboration capability.

Pricing

* Murf now offers three paid pricing options: (all pricing is for yearly plans).
* Monthly Basic – $13
* \-$26 per month for Pro
* Enterprise – monthly fees start at $83

The Basic package includes full HD video quality and practically all capabilities (excluding voice editing). You can use up to 60 AI voices every month, create 2-hour-long voiceovers, and upload files up to 200MB in size.

For most users, I believe this plan is adequate. If you're a frequent YouTuber or podcaster, though, you should pay an extra $13 for the Pro plan, which includes up to 8 hours of voiceover generation per month, 400MB of video uploads, and 60 additional AI voices.

Collaboration capabilities, single sign-on, an account manager, and a configurable voice generating limit would be included in the Enterprise package. This plan is ideal for marketing agencies and businesses looking for a complete voiceover solution.

Cons

* Developers, according to several critics, should add more languages. Murf has many fewer AI voices in the library than his competitors.

**5.Play.ht**

![voice-generators-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/voice-generators-5.jpg)

Play. Ht is a web-based voice generator that allows you to generate high-quality text-to-speech. Because of its basic user interface, the platform is exceptionally simple to use.

Features

* Customization — To fully customize the voiceover, highlight the words. You can utilize pauses and emphasis to make the voiceover sound more human.

* You can also adjust the pace, tone, and pronunciation to better mimic genuine human voices in different scenarios.
* Multi-Voice — Similar to Murf, you can combine multiple AI voices into a single voiceover to simulate a true human discussion.

* Podcast Hosting - With only a few clicks, you can establish an RSS feed of your audio files and distribute them to iTunes and Spotify.

* Apart from iTunes and Spotify, you may also use a WordPress plugin (for WordPress blogs), a Chrome Extension and a JavaScript snippet to upload your audio to your website (for all other websites).

* Sounds Analytics - Play. It will gather information on all audio. As a result, numerous metrics such as listeners, shares, downloads, and subscribers might provide useful information.

Pricing

Play. ht has four pricing tiers as of August 2021\. (all pricing below is for yearly plans).

$14.25 per month for personal use

$29.25 per month for professionals

$74.25 per month in Growth

$149.25 per month for business

Commercial rights, premium voice collecting, or podcast hosting are not included in the Personal plan, which severely limits the practical use of the voices. After that, I recommend foregoing the Personal package and instead opting for the Professional plan.

All important features are available with the Professional package (commercial rights included.) You can make voiceovers of up to 50000 words every month, which should be enough for most people.

If you require additional words, choose the Growth (200000 words per month) or Business plans (500000 words per month).

Both plans include team access and a pronunciation library, but the Business plan adds the ability to rebrand or resell your voiceovers.

Cons

* Other than English and European languages, voices made in other languages are not flawless.

## **Part 1: What is a Video Background Changer?**

A video background changer is a tool that can swap the background of any video. These tools usually work in three simple steps.

* Analyze the footage,
* Separate the subject or “subjects” from the background,
* Switch backgrounds.

The process starts when a user uploads a video clip. The tool analyzes the footage and separates the subjects from the background. The user can select other available pre-made backgrounds or upload a preferred one to the platform. After this process, users can share the finished video or save it to their devices. Other kinds of background changers only merge a transparent clip with a background.
