### Step 1: Lauch the Photos App

![combine-videos-into-one](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/combine-videos-into-one-6.jpg)

* Select Edit & Create

![combine-videos-into-one](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/combine-videos-into-one-7.jpg)

Today's article will be fascinating for all those who want to shoot their films at home and become a filmmaker. As upon **M31, LUT (teal and orange)** is one of the most used LUTs in various films. It was first introduced in Hollywood, and there are many movies that use this style for color correction, such as the well-known _Transformers_, _Star Trek_, _Mad Max_, and _Wonder Woman_. The spectator can rapidly comprehend the information in the image and quickly tell the topic from the backdrop thanks to the two contrasting hues of teal and orange, which are more common in nature. These colors can also merge more smoothly with the rest of the image. In this article, we will discuss how to use it and other amazing LUTs in your videos. So let's begin!

## Part 1\. What is M31 LUT (Teal & Orange LUT)?

M31 LUT (Teal & Orange Lut) is one of the most used LUTs in Hollywood and other cinematic industries. This LUT help to get your video the cinematic colors of teal and orange. The contrast between the two colors teal and orange is clear, but there are also other colors present in nature. For example, human skin is mostly composed of the colors yellow, red, and brown. Because blue is the complement of these colors, teal is their contrast color.

Other quality features are Color Remapping, Skin Toning, Saturation, etc. In other words, it helps your videos look like popular Hollywood films as they also use this same LUT in their movies. Its popularity in Hollywood films may be due to a number of factors, but one of the most crucial ones is that it gives the scene a cohesive mood by allowing disparate aspects to mirror one another and emphasize the overall qualities of the scene.

## Best Practical Tips to Improve Your Lighting in the Sun

Shooting outdoors is a challenge in most situations. We have to deal with the sun being overexposed or the background is too dark.

In this article, we'll show you how to light with the sun the easiest way. These simple and effective tips can help you block the harsh sun and make it to your advantage!

## 1) Preparation

You may need those things to film under the harsh sun:

1. An ND filter for your lens
2. A flag to block the sun. It can be anything like a black poster.
3. A white poster to bounce the sunlight.
4. Artificial light equipment.

Now let's see when and how to use them against the strong sunlight!

## 2) Direct to the Sun

If we want a specific background for our shot but our talent has to face the sun, here are some tips you can do to undermine the unflattering light or the blindness.

**1\. Pick up an ND filter on your lens**

![pick up an nd filter on lens](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/len.jpg)

We use it outside so we can open our aperture to get nice blurry backgrounds without overexposing our footage.

**2\. Use a "flag" to block or shape the sunlight**

![black flag](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/black-flag.jpg)

Using a black piece of poster board works perfectly fine, hold it up to the sun. Also, remember to angle your "flag" to create harsh lines or fully shade your talent.

**3\. Adjust your camera to fit the environment**

For example, you can change the exposure of your camera to match the talent's face giving a more silhouette look.

## 3) Back to the Sun

Have you ever been filming outside only to see your talent dark in the frame with the background blown out with light? To fix the problem, the simplest way is to use a "bounce".

By using a "bounce", we can reflect the light from the sun to our talent. Make sure to lift the bounce and move it around to get the right amount of light on your talent.

This should give us a nice look with the sun backlighting our subject and the bounce filling in the shadows and giving us soft light on our talent's face!

## 4) Artificial lighting

If we want to control our lighting better, we will want to use artificial lights in combination with the sun.

For example, weather changes. As you shot, the sun will move and make lighting challenging to keep consistent.

In that case, we can use the **flag technique** that we used before to block the harsh sunlight and then use our lights on our talent's face, this keeps our lighting more consistent than if we relied on just the natural light.

Now, take a look at the comparison with all the lighting conditions we create:

1. Flag VS Flag & Light

![flag vs flag light](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/comparison-1.jpg)

1. Backlight VS Backlight & Bounce

![backlight vs backlight bounce](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/comparison-2.jpg)

## Summary

If you shoot or film outdoors, you must learn how to cope with the unsteady natural light. Hope this article helps you with that and kindly leave your thoughts below.
