## Learn How to Use Face Tracking in After Effects to Quickly Mask Out Faces, Animate Objects on Faces, and More

**Face Tracking** is a process of identifying or locating human faces in digital images and videos, and it is used for a variety of applications, such as to re-target tools and effects to specific areas of the face, to track face data for rotoscoping/motion stabilization, or to generate keyframes for facial expressions automatically.

In Adobe After Effects, there are two **Face Tracking** features, i.e., Outline Only and Detailed Feature. The former will help only to track the face, while the latter provides detailed data on different facial features to help you change the eye color, mouth movements, etc.

In this blog post, we will explore **Face Tracking,** its applications, how it works, and its challenges and drawbacks. We will also provide an easy-to-follow guide on using the Face Tracking feature in Adobe After Effects.

## Part 1\. What Is Face Tracking

Face Tracking is a process of identifying or detecting the areas of the face, such as the eyes, nose, and mouth, in a video or image. This effect can be used to track and animate face replacements, retouch footage, or add effects to a user's face in live footage.

Where It Is Applied

Face Tracking can be used for a variety of applications, such as:

* **Replacing One Face With Another:** This is helpful if you need to change the face of a character in video footage.
* **Adding Automatic Effects:** With this feature, you can apply effects to a face in live footage.
* **Retouching Footage**: Face Tracking can help you retouch a face in a video clip, for instance, you can smooth it or change the skin tone, etc.
* **Robotic Devices:** Certain robots use Face Tracking technology to perform human tasks.

## Part 2\. How Does Face Tracking Work?

Face Tracking algorithms usually begin by detecting facial landmarks, such as the eyes, nose, and mouth. Once detected, the AI algorithms use them to track the face as it moves. This information can be used to perform various tasks, such as identifying the person's emotions or estimating their head pose.

Face Tracking technology is constantly improving and is now being used in various new applications, such as to create 3D models of people's faces, control robotic devices, and create more realistic avatars for virtual reality systems.

## Part 3\. The Challenges And Drawbacks Of Face Tracking

Face Tracking is a technology that has been growing in popularity in recent years. This technology allows computers to detect and track human faces in real-time. While Face Tracking has many potential applications, some challenges and drawbacks also need to be considered:

One of the main challenges with Face Tracking is that it can be difficult to track faces in different lighting conditions. Faces can also be obstructed by objects such as hats or glasses. Another challenge is that things like photographs, makeup, or masks can fool face tracking.

Some privacy concerns need to be considered when using Face Tracking. This technology can be used to collect sensitive data about people without their consent.

Despite these challenges and drawbacks, Face Tracking remains a promising technology with many potential applications, and it can help with many tasks such as identifying a perpetrator, finding a missing person, better security measures in banks and airports, and many more.

## Part 4\. The Face Tracking In After Effects

Adobe After Effects is a useful and powerful tool that can be used for various purposes, including Face Tracking. This feature enables you to track the movement of a person's face and detect specific parts of a face, including eyes, nose, mouth, etc., to let you work with these facial features individually.

For instance, you can change the mouth movement or pupil color without frame-by-frame adjustments. Moreover, you can measure facial features to see the details, such as how open the eye or mouth is.

Features

Here's a simple and quick rundown of the features of Face Tracking in Adobe After Effects:

1. Help you detect faces and provide isolated data points to help you refine the content.
2. Retouch the face in a video without adjusting it frame by frame.
3. Let you export the tracking data to Character Animator for creating performance-based animations.

Function

There are two Face Tracking functions in the Tracker panel:

* **Face Tracking (Outline Only):** This feature will only help you to outline the face in a video clip.
* **Face Tracking (Detailed Features):** This option will help you if you want to detect the different facial features and parts, including the eye, pupil, eyebrow, mouth, and nose. You can also take exact measurements of the features.

## Part 5\. The Guidance Of Using Face Tracking In After Effects

Follow the guidelines below to use Face Tracking in After Effects:

Face Tracking To Outline A Face

Step1Launch the **After Effects** software and click **“File”** in the top **Toolbar.** Select **Import** and click **“File.”** Find the video footage and add it to the **Project panel.**

![adding the footage to the project panel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/adding-the-footage-to-the-project-panel.jpg)

Step2To add a new layer, drag and drop the video footage from the **Project Panel** to the **Composition.**

Step3Drag the blue **current-time indicator** in the **Timeline** to a frame showing the face's upright and front view.

![dragging the blue cti to a frame with the face in the upright and front position](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/dragging-the-blue-cti-to-a-frame-with-the-face-in-the-upright-and-front-position.jpg)

Step4Now, you have to draw a **closed mask loosely** around the face. This helps identify the region for locating the facial features. The top mask is used for **Face Tracking** if you have selected multiple masks.

![creating a closed mask loosely around the face](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/creating-a-closed-mask-loosely-around-the-face.jpg)

Step5Click the **“Window”** option from the top **Toolbar** and scroll down to **“Tracker.”** Select **“Face Tracking (Outline Only)” as** the tracking method in the **Tracker Panel.**

Step6To make sure the tracking is working correctly, track forward or backward one frame at a time and click the **“Start”** button to start the analysis process of the frames. Once finished, you can find the **Face Tracking data** within the Composition.

Tracking Detailed Features And Extracting Facial Measurements

For detailed face features tracking, do the following steps in sequence:

Step1Import your file and add it to the **Project** in the **After Effects**. Drop and drag the video clip into a **Composition** from the **Project Panel** to add a layer.

Step2Position the **CTI** to a frame showing the upright and front view of the face, and draw a **closed mask loosely** around the face to define the search region to find the facial features.

Step3Click the **“Window”** option, scroll down to **Tracker** and select it. Choose the **“Face Tracking (Detailed Features)**” option as the tracking method.

![selecting the face tracking option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/selecting-the-face-tracking-option.jpg)

Step4Track forward or backward to check the tracking process, and click the **“Start”** button to initiate the analysis process.

Step5Once the analysis is done, you can find the tracking data within a new effect, **“Face Track Point.”** To access the face tracking data, go to **“Window”** and select **“Effects Control”** to go to the **Effects Panel** or check within the **Composition.**

![face tracking data within the composition](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/face-tracking-data-within-the-composition.jpg)

Step6Move the **CTI** to a frame displaying **neutral facial expressions** or is in the rest pose. The measurements of a face on other frames are dependent on the rest pose frame. Now, click **“Set Rest Pose”** in the Tracker Panel and select **“Extract & Copy Face Measurements”** to add the Face Measurement layer.

Step7When the Face Measurements effect layer is added, **keyframes** are automatically generated based on the **Face Track Points keyframe data.** You can copy the data from the system clipboard for use in **Adobe Character Animator.**

## Best Way To Color Grading & Color Correction in Filmora

As a post-production analysis of the filmed video, you might have noticed how the color contrast in a real VS reel. The colors do not appear bright and robust on a screen as in real life.

While there are numerous reasons for the dull, uninviting look- a basic edit could fix it quickly. One of the vital, if not the first, steps in the process is color grading and color correction. However, what exactly are color grading and color correction? And how can they help fix the color ratios and balance in a video?

This article covers everything you need to know about color grading and correction and a complete guide to adjusting cinematic colors with the best video editor, Wondershare Filmora. So, without much ado, let's dig into it!

## Part 1\. Color Grading VS Color Correction

These terms have often been used interchangeably; people consider them synonymous. However, they are two different artistic phenomena to adjust the color scheme.

Since we will discuss them in detail later, here is a brief description. Put simply, color correcting is a corrective procedure, while color grading is a cinematic adjustment.

Color correction diverts the colors to a relatively neutral baseline achieving a unified look for all captured shots. On the other hand, color grading is inclined more toward a creative look aimed at balancing colors that reflect the emotion of the sequence.

![color correction vs color grading](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/color-correction-vs-color-grading.gif)

These two work hand in hand to dramatically uplift the overall look of the sequence. Let's delve deeper into these techniques and see how to use them.

## Part 2\. What Is Color Correction?

We will start with color correction- the first step in color editing. Even with a slight glance at the raw shots, you can notice how much the tones are messed up. The crude product is oversaturated with colors.

Color correction is about making the shots look as natural as possible. It brings the sequences to the neutral baseline to achieve a unified look.

For now, we need to ignore our creative and aesthetic preferences and focus entirely on exposure and white balance. The actual end goal is to keep the colors true to life.

However, color-correcting a video is challenging if you are a beginner. There needs to be more than just understanding the fundamentals; it requires cinematic and technical skills.

Here is the basic process for a clean, color-corrected shot, irrespective of the software you use.

### Essential Steps for Color Correcting a Shot

##### 1\. Set the color profile

Different video formats (HDR, LOG, RAW, HLG, etc.) have different exposure content. Therefore, select a color profile that matches your video format for the best results before starting.

##### 2\. Adjust the saturation

It is the primary step of color correction. Often the exposure of raw content is high. Next, equalize the saturation for a natural look.

##### 3\. Fix the contrast

Contrast is the difference between the light and dark areas of the image. Pictures with a higher contrast are sharper and more detailed.

However, adjust the contrast during color correcting so that the dark areas are not crushed, and you preserve the details maximally.

##### 4\. Set the white balance

It is time to adjust the white balance with the saturation and contrast fixed. The colors will shift to orange and blue hues if it is maladjusted.

Use the color curves to ensure pure whites so all colors fall correctly in place.

##### 5\. Double-check individual color tones

The final step is a secondary checking of the individual colors. Double-check the skin tones so they match in each shot.

Make sure the skin tones match their natural hues for an authentic, unfiltered look.

It is a basic walkthrough for color-correcting. More steps can vary according to the professional demands of the video. However, as a beginner, this is the best process to follow.

Once we've corrected the color, it is time to move to the next and primary step- color grading.

## Part 3\. What Is Color Grading?

After you set all the tones to the baseline, you can start with the creative process of color grading. In this case, you do not change the colors anymore. Instead, you make artistic choices to change the moods and emotions of that particular sequence. Color grading is about manipulating the colors and contrasts that intensify the visual tone and explain your story to the world.

Color correction can be enough if you want to keep the video realistic. However, color grading is essential if you want to imply emotions and feelings in your content. Following is an essential step-by-step guide to color grading.

### Basic Steps of Color Grading

If you are a beginner, the color grading process can be tricky without expertise. Hence here are the basic steps of color grading a video.

##### 1\. Color correcting

Correcting the colors and balance will always be the first step before you can color-grade footage. Next, the video must be normalized and should seem natural before you intensify the overall look.

##### 2\. Match the colors

In the next step, we balance the contours between color-corrected footage and color grading. Then, you can use LUTs (Look Up Tables) to match the individual colors to the scheme.

##### 3\. Shot-to-shot matching

The next integral step is to match the colors between all the shots so we can achieve a unified look. The contrasting appearance of shots can make them look unprofessional and poorly cinematic.

##### 4\. Adjust the mood and emotions

A well-executed color grading can potentiate the emotions in a shot. Use your artistic choices and tools from editing software to imply the director's feelings in the video.

##### 5\. Make the final adjustments

As the final opportunity, tweak hues and chroma to ensure the colors match your palette in each scene. But, again, do not overdo anything, and play with colors to nudge the moods in the shot.

If your footage is the cake, color grading is the cherry on top that enhances the final look. You can instantly evoke connotations and bring the audience to a different page with some professional color grading.

However, while color correcting and grading, there are a few things that you should take care of. Here is a list of some To-do's and Not To-do's in the post-production edit.

## Part 4\. Things To Consider About the Editing Environment

Before you begin color-grading or color-correcting, here are some essential things to consider that can dramatically improve the results.

##### 1\. Neutral editing environment

Funky neon lights or fluorescent lights in the background can dominate your vision. As compensation, you will be over-saturating your footage with colors.

Make sure to use only white, neutral light with a CRI (color rendering Index) of at least 90\. It will decrease inconsistencies as much as possible.

##### 2\. Using might shifts/orange screen

People often activate night shifts or orange screens to protect their eyes from excessive strain. Resultantly, the screen appears dull and orange-y.

Since this alters the actual colors of the video, the results are undermined. So make sure to turn off all technologies that can sabotage the grading.

##### 3\. Control the light

It is necessary to control the amount of light that enters your working space area. Excessive light alters your color perception and hence obstructs achieving a balanced contour.

Ensure that the light does not directly falls on the screen or your eyes. You must maintain an adequate distance from the screen to see nuances as you grade.

After completing all the fundamentals of color correcting and color grading, let's demonstrate how to do it in real-time.
