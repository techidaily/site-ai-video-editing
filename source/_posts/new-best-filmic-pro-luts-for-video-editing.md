A logo is a brand image of a company, it's the face of a company and it represents the company out there in the market. In today's world, the most famous companies are recognized worldwide via their brand image. Be it the "big M" of McDonald's or the "horses" of Ferrari, we very well know these brands by their respective logos. A company's logo is hence one of the most essential parts of branding and marketing. Moreover, a logo is one of the first steps towards brand building. Only after deciding on a specific logo can a company begin its commercial operations. Therefore, an attractive transparent logo is highly essential. Wondering what a transparent logo PNG is? Well, today we shall tell you everything about a transparent logo, for instance, the transparent WhatsApp logo!

#### In this article

01 [What Is a Transparent Format and Where to Use a Transparent Logo](#Part 1)

02 [When Should You Use the PNG or Vector Format?](#Part 2)

03 [7 Popular Transparent Logo Examples You Might Want to Learn](#Part 3)

04 [How to Create One transparent Logo](#Part 4)

05 [How to Insert Transparent Logo in Video](#Part 5)

## Part 1 What Is a Transparent Format and Where to Use a Transparent Logo

A transparent logo is just a format of logos. It is generally in PNG format or vector format. So what differentiates a normal logo from a transparent logo? Well, the key differentiator between a regular logo and a transparent logo is that in a transparent logo, the background of the image file is transparent i.e. you cannot see a white or any other background in a transparent logo. This makes the logo more prominent and attractive. Since a logo is a key part of branding, an attractive transparent becomes all the more important for your brand's success and prosperity!

## Part 2 When Should You Use the PNG or Vector Format?

What's the difference between a white background and a transparent background? Well, a white background tends to outshine the logo and reduces the fanciness of the logo. On the other hand, a transparent background logo goes well with any background. For instance, if the page behind the logo is black, if you were to place a white background logo on a black page, it'd look absurd. On the other hand, if your logo's background is transparent, the color of the page wouldn’t matter. Your logo would look good irrespective of the background's color.

## Part 1 How to Create GIF Animation from a Stack of JPGs

Sometimes it happens that we have some pictures from our favorite even or so, and we are looking forward to combining all of them in one file. Undoubtedly, this conversion is easy but only when you are aware of the right steps. Until and unless you have no clue about the steps, the **JPG to GIF** conversion seems to be impossible. Let's have a look at the steps you need to follow for it:

**Step 1:** Firstly, "choose the photos". Until and unless you do not have the selected photos, you cannot initiate the conversion process.

**Step 2:** Choose the right tool. A tool is important to choose because, without it, you cannot be a part of the process. In this case, we are discussing ADOBE Photoshop.

**Step 3:** Upload all the photos that you have selected and move them to the timeline panel by clicking on the Windows option. Here you need to select "Create Video Timeline."
