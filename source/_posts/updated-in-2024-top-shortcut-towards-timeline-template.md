## Discover the Best Video Frame Rate Converters for Smooth Playback, Including Online and Offline Options. Learn How to Convert Frame Rates for Free and Elevate Your Video Quality with These Top 8 Tools

One important aspect to consider when creating high-quality videos is the frame rate. The frame rate, measured in frames per second (fps), determines the smoothness and fluidity of your video. If the frame rate is too low, your video may appear choppy or stutter. On the other hand, a higher frame rate can provide a more cinematic experience.

However, not all cameras or devices record videos at the same frame rate. That's where frame rate video converters come in. These tools allow you to change the frame rate of your videos so they can be played back on different devices or platforms. With so many options available, it can be overwhelming to know which frame rate converters to use.

In this article, we'll look at 8 of the best frame rate video converters you must try. These tools will help you achieve the perfect frame rate for your videos, from free online options to paid software.

## Unknown Facts About Converting Frame Rates

When converting frame rates, there are a few things to keep in mind that you may need to be made aware of.

![facts about converting frame rates](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facts-convert-frame-rate.jpg)

### 1\. The Web Doesn't Care About Frame Rates

First, it's important to note that the web doesn't care about frame rates. Most online platforms, such as YouTube and Vimeo, automatically adjust the frame rate of videos to match the viewer's device or internet connection. This means that even if you have a video with a high frame rate, it may be automatically downgraded when it's uploaded to the web.

### 2\. Converting Frame Rates in Exact Multiples Is Easy

Another thing to remember is that converting frame rates in exact multiples is relatively easy.

For example, if you have a video recorded at 30 fps and want to convert it to 60 fps, it's a simple process as it is a 2x multiple. However, if you want to convert your video to a frame rate that is not a multiple of the original, such as 29.97 fps, the process can be more complex and may result in some loss of quality.

### 3\. Frame Rate Is Not "Cinematic"

Lastly, it's important to note that frame rate is not "cinematic" because a higher frame rate does not automatically make your video look more cinematic. While a higher frame rate can provide a more smooth and more fluid video, it's just one aspect of creating a cinematic experience. Other elements, such as lighting, composition, and sound design, also play a crucial role in creating a cinematic look.

## How to Use LUTs in Lumafusion  & Free LUTs Resource

LumaFusion is one of the most complex iPad and iPhone video editing apps. Many of its customers adore it, and it has some incredible capabilities that you'd find incompetent editing software. They've effectively opened up the realm of LUTs to iPhone and iPad users.

LumaFusion LUTs are individual files that act as containers in LumaFusion. This container file includes standard LUT data as well as LumaFusion-specific color preset data. A LumaFusion LUT Preset file is similar to a Super LUT. LumaFusion can only employ one standard LUT at a time; however, LumaFusion LUT presets enable simultaneous Color Grading and Color Corrections.

## How will LUTs help with color correction in Lumafusion

Colors in today's cameras are vibrant, but they may continuously be improved. Color correction corrects the color that's already there, whether it's boosting the exposure to brighten a darker photo or increasing the saturation to make the colors pop. Color correction in other NLEs can be difficult, but not in LumaFusion.

The Color Presets tab in the Color & Effects section is where you begin color correcting footage. There are various presets from which to pick. I wouldn't use these settings on my videos because they're too stylized, but they're there. You may alter any of the presets to your taste, so some of the more dramatic ones can be toned down. By picking the original setting, purists can color-fix their raw footage without using LumaFusion. Moving the sliders till the color seems perfect is all that's required from there.

Exposure, contrast, highlights, shadows, mid-tones, and saturation and hue are all controlled by sliders. The color sliders can be used for a more forceful approach. But proceed with caution. The sliders are delicate, and it's easy to overdo them. Play around with the sliders until you get the look you want. If you don't like it, toss it in the trashcan and start over.

Color grading and color correction are not interchangeable terms. Color correction is a technical requirement, but color grading is primarily creative. You'll have no command over the color grading process if you're working with film material where primary colors aren't even visible. Before diving into the creative LUTs, make sure you complete adequate color correcting.

Color grading, unlike color correction, adjusts the shot's color to modify the atmosphere or feel. The only way to do that in LumaFusion is to play around with the color sliders under the Color Presets tab, but that's not ideal. As previously stated, the three sliders are sensitive and limited. LumaFusion isn't designed for color grading, which is OK. Thankfully, LumaFusion allows you to use LUTs.

Always color correct your footage before utilizing any LUTS, which entails changing the White-balance, Highlights, Contrast, and Shadows. Do not apply the LUTS to your footage directly.

## How to use LUTs in Lumafusion?

Videographers, colorists, and editors use LUTs because they are efficient. Rather than starting from zero every time you work on a video editing project, you may speed up the color grading process using a LUT with predefined color profiles. It's elementary to import LUTs. Simply import the preset files into LumaFusion and add the preset to your footage like an Instagram filter.

The Import button in the Color & Effects editor is the easiest way to load LUTs.

1. Double click on any video/photo clip on the timeline to access the Clip Editors.
2. At the bottom of the Clip Editor UI, select the Color & Effects tab.
3. The import button is located directly below the effect preset library.
