## 4 Solutions to Crop a Video on Android Easily

Nowadays, we can use our mobile phones to create almost anything – they have become an indivisible part of our lives. Most of the people check their mobile phones every 2 minutes – did they receive a new message?

What about different kinds of notifications – reactions on social network, or the ones which inform us about breaking news, or, to-do lists? People are well-connected to Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and sometimes, we just want to update our accounts with just photos or new videos we took on the go. Sometimes, we have a perfect footage we took with our Android, but we have no idea, or just no time to edit our stunning video clips on the computer.

Yes, changing or adjusting a video shouldn’t be that hard – you shouldn’t be obligated to turn to Adobe Premiere Pro or other “heavy” software in order to have a video to your whole liking. Therefore, we have mobile applications just for editing our videos, in a simple, and fast way (thank you, mobile developers!).

In this article, we will be discussing how to crop a video on Android, but since most android devices don’t have this option, you will need to do it externally, by downloading and using different apps. So, more concretely, we will touch upon how to crop our video clips using following apps: Google Photos, Clideo, and Filmora.

## Using Google Photos

In case you have Android, the Google Photos app will be there – it’s free and in most cases, already installed and ready to serve you. If you can’t find Google Photos, just find it and download it from the Google Play Store.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-1.jpeg)

First off, you just open the application and allow it to access photos and media on your device. Tap the video you would like to crop. Then, click on Edit: it will launch the in-app video editor.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-2.jpeg)

At the bottom, you will see the Crop option and hit on it, which will result in appearing a cropping box around your video clip.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-3.jpeg)

Once you see little icons at the bottom, you need to choose the first one – it’s the Ratio button, through which you can choose the aspect you would like to apply. Your choice is between these several aspect ratios: Free, Original, Square, 5:4, 16:9, 4:3, and 3:2.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-4.jpeg)

Choosing Free ratio option gives you the freedom to adjust the cropping sliders manually, in order to resize the video to any aspect ratio; it is even possible to rotate the clip, pinch, and zoom in/out.

After you are done with adjusting your video, you need to click on the Save Copy button, which will save a new edited version of your footage. And, meanwhile, don’t worry! – this will not be overwritten on the original one, which will still stand intact.

## Using Clideo

Clideo is an interesting one… it doesn’t require you to download anything, because there is a way to crop your video online, through the web browser on Android.

First off, you need to click on [Clideo’s Android crop video tool](https://clideo.com/crop-video) from the browser on the smartphone. You will see a Choose File button and hit on it – this will take you to your gallery and let you find the clip you are about to crop.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-5.jpeg)

You can also upload your file from Cloud Storage. You need to click on the down-arrow on the right-hand side of the button and you’ll find the option to add a clip from your Dropbox or Google Drive account.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-6.jpeg)

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-7.jpeg)

After your file is uploaded, Clideo will take you to the editing page, where you can select the area you would like to be in the edited version, and crop the video. Here, you will be able to choose the aspect ratio, exact size of the video and the format.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-8.jpeg)

Once you have finished with the cropping and settings, you need to click on Export which will process your edited video clip.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-9.jpeg)

Once it is done, you proceed on the page which lets you do 3 things: Remove watermark (for it, though, you will have to sign in), Edit again, or/and Download!

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-10.jpeg)

## Using Filmora

Filmora is an android version of software Filmora and it also gives you the opportunity to crop videos and photos with no problem. First, of course, you have to download the application from Google Play Store, and open it;

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-11.jpeg)

then, after opening it, you’ll click on New Project. You can choose any photo/video from your albums or stock, you might even select multiple clips.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-12.jpeg)

Once you have chosen your file, you click on Next button and you proceed to the editor itself.

There, you will see different options at the bottom of your phone, such as Trim, Music, Text, Sticker, Effect, etc.

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-13.jpeg)

 It doesn’t show you the option Crop right away, but Crop is “hidden” behind the Trim button!

![crop-video-android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-android-14.jpeg)

So, you choose Trim, then find Crop and hit that, and then you are free to choose any aspect ratio: 1:1; 4:5; 16:9; 9:16; and 5:4\. You can crop the video manually, too, and you are able to adjust where your new “screen” might be wanted most.
