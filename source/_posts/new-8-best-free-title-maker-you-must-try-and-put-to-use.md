### Using Uniform Speed to Create a Slow-Motion Video in Filmora

Uniform Speed is the basic method of creating slow motion in Filmora. It simply modifies the playback speed of video with the help of a slider. The procedure of slomo creation, like **The Slow Mo Guys** in Filmora, is given below:

##### Step 1Import Media to Start Slomo Creation

After downloading Filmora on your device, click the "New Project" button to start. From the editing interface, click the "Ctrl + I" keys, choose the video, and bring it to the timeline after import. Select the clip in the timeline and use your cursor to reach the settings panel. Go to the "Uniform Speed" section under the "Speed" tab and change the speed slider settings.

![drag the slider to adjust speed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/secret-to-slomo-videos-with-the-slow-mo-guys-5.jpg)

##### Step 2Start AI Frame Interpolation Settings

This is the AI feature that increases the video frame rate for a smooth, slow-motion effect. You can access this option at the bottom of Uniform Speed settings. Expand it and select the “Optical Flow” option for your purpose.

##### Step 3Enable Render Preview to See Results

Once all is set and done, navigate towards the timeline panel to select this video again. With the help of your cursor, access the "File" tab at the top toolbar. Select the "Render Preview" option from the expanding menu. After rendering is complete, use the preview screen to observe the slo-mo and export it.

### Using Speed Ramping to Create a Slow-Motion Video in Filmora

The second method is also simple, but it has more precise options to create a slow-mo. It uses the velocity graph to rise or decline video speed at certain intervals. Gather the knowledge about how **The Slow Mo Guys** **YouTube** creates slow-mo here:

##### Step 1Access the Speed Ramping Feature

After importing and bringing media to the timeline, select it and reach the settings panel. Access the "Speed" > "Speed Ramping" option to start editing. There, you can find many custom speed presets for automated editing. However, you can also use the "Customize" preset to create from scratch. Then, reach the speed graph and move the slider downward to bring the slo-mo effect.

![start speed ramping](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/secret-to-slomo-videos-with-the-slow-mo-guys-8.jpg)

##### Step 2Enable the Optical Flow Option

![start the optical flow option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/secret-to-slomo-videos-with-the-slow-mo-guys-9.jpg)

##### Step 3Activate Render Preview for Confirmed Results

## Do You Want to Professionally Blur the Background in Your Video? Read This Article to Find Out the Easiest Way to Blur the Background in Videos Using Adobe After Effects

While capturing a video, it may be possible that the background of the video looks dull or tedious. Or, unwanted people in the background are ruining the overall presentation. To get rid of this, many people use Adobe **After Effects to blur the background** in the video. If you don’t know how to use After Effects, this article will provide you with accurate guidance. Moreover, we will also highlight an alternative to Adobe After Effects for additional help.

## Part 1: What Do You Need To Blur Background in Videos?

There are many scenarios in which blurring the video background becomes necessary. In this part of the article, we will discuss some common scenarios in which people feel it is mandatory to blur the video background.

### 1\. To Put Focus on Subject

If you want to keep the spotlight on the main subject of the video, blurring the background becomes essential. By doing so, you can highlight and grab viewers' attention to the subject of your video.

### 2\. Replacing Background

Sometimes choosing and capturing a vibrant background for your video is tough. So, if you have a dull background in your videos that does not look aesthetic, you can simply blur it. There are various blur effects that you can add to the background of your video to create an overall sophisticated presentation.

### 3\. Hiding Sensitive Information

There are some places, such as museums or private properties, where you cannot take a video without the owner's permission. The reason is that there might be sensitive information in such places that needs to be confidential. So, if you are making a vlog in such places, you can blur the video background to avoid copyright strikes on social media platforms.

### 4\. Ensuring Privacy

If you are making a tutorial video while sitting at home, you may concern about the privacy of your family members or house. Thus, in such cases, blurring the video background can be a safe idea to ensure the privacy of your home.

## Part 2: How to Blur the Video Background in After Effects?

Do you want to blur the background in the video where the subject is moving continuously? This may sound complicated to you; however, using Adobe After Effects can make this process quite simple and easy. [Adobe After Effects](https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html) is a professional software that many users utilize to execute professional editing. Using this efficient platform, you can smoothly make eye-catchy intros and outros for your videos.

Moreover, you can add transitions to your videos to generate compelling results. So, if you want to add stunning and appealing visual effects to your video, Adobe After Effects is the best choice. Furthermore, you can use Adobe After Effects for 2D animation and motion graphics. That’s why many content creators use this software in TV, films, and the web to manipulate videos proficiently.

Moreover, you can also merge tons of images and videos using this tool to display your creative editing skills. This part will guide you on efficiently using **Adobe After Effects Blur Background** feature.

### Steps to Blur Background in Adobe After Effects

Adobe After Effects is an amazing tool for applying aesthetic visual effects to your videos. To make **background blur in After Effects** easily, check the following steps:

Step1 Open Adobe After Effects and upload the video clip you want to edit. Once done, double-click the video you have added to the timeline to select the clip you want to blur.

Step2 Now head to the ROTO brush displayed on top and click on it. The green circle can be used to select the part you would need. In comparison, the red circle can be used to highlight the part that you don’t need. To shift between these two colors, you can press the Alt key. So, carefully use the green color to select the needed part. You can also zoom in to make selections effortlessly.

![use the roto brush](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/blur-background-with-after-effects-1.jpg)

Step3 Once you have made the selection, play the video to do the calculations. After giving some time to do calculations, copy the layer from the timeline. To blur the background in the video, search for “Gaussian Blur” in the effects tab. After applying this effect to the copied layer, increase the blur effect and wait for the calculations.

![increase gaussian blur value](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/blur-background-with-after-effects-2.jpg)

Step4 Now adjust the feather value from the left side to 20% on Layer 1\. Once done, you can see the results in the preview window.
