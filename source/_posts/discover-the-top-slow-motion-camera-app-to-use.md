Even though editing, as other innovative and creative actions, is limitless in its possibilities, sometimes we just need to make a little change in our project and it’s quite enough for us to be satisfied with our work and material. One of the things which is rather simple to do, but sometimes essential, when it comes to making our clips better and more picturesque for the audience, is cropping a video.

![crop-video-davinci](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-davinci-7.jpeg)

### Method 3: Make a Countdown Timer with a Graphic Design Platform

Today's graphic design platforms give designers more options than ever before, but many designers struggle to make the most of these resources. Let us share some tips and tricks on designing a countdown timer using the tools available through Canva, a graphic design platform.

#### [**Canva**](https://www.canva.com/)

![canva web interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/create-countdown-animation-for-videos-11.jpg)

**Key Features:**

* Drag and drop feature
* Free templates
* Background Removal Tool
* Canva Brand Kit
* Magic Resizing

**How to make a countdown animation with Canva**

Canva offers a range of great-looking countdown templates that'll help you create one in just a few minutes. And if you need a simple countdown animation, you can download one of their free templates. Let's make it from scratch:

##### Step1Select The Background

![select background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/create-countdown-animation-for-videos-12.jpg)

##### Step2Enter Your Text (Number)

Then select the text tab and choose any font style, color, and size.

![enter your number](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/create-countdown-animation-for-videos-13.jpg)

##### Step3Animate Text

Next, select the font again, and then, at the top, there's an option for Text Animation.

Adding text animation to your countdown timer will make it more realistic and match your background better than a straight-up countdown timer.

![animate text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/create-countdown-animation-for-videos-14.jpg)

##### Step4Edit The Page Timing

Next, click on the "Edit Timing" option. You can set the timer for each page as per your choice

![edit page timing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/create-countdown-animation-for-videos-15.jpg)

##### Step5Duplicate The Page

Now, select the duplicate page option and change the number of duplicate pages from 3 to 2,1, with the same design and formatting.

![duplicate the page](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/create-countdown-animation-for-videos-16.jpg)

##### Step6Export / Download Video

You're finally done! Click the Download button to export your design.

The background of this photo is not a static image, so you cannot select the JPG, PNG, or SVG. You must choose an MP4 video or a GIF when creating an animation.
