## What is After Effects?

[Adobe After Effects](https://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html) is an application that can be used to create videos and animation. It is a powerful tool that allows you to create custom animations, including motion graphics, visual effects, and titles.

## How to split video clips in After Effects manually

### Import your video into the After Effects timeline

To split your video clip using after effects, the first step is to get the clip into the program. To do this, open the file menu in the top left corner of the After Effects workspace. Select **“** **Import**” from the options on the drop-down menu displayed. This will open up the file explorer for you to select the clip you would like to import into your project. Once you find your video file, click “**OK**” to add it to the project files. Alternatively, you can simply drag your clip from the file explorer and drop it into the Adobe After Effects workspace.

### Create a new composition

To go ahead with splitting your video clip, you will need to create a new composition. This can be done in two ways. The first is to drag the clip from the project browser to the new composition icon on the layer panel. This automatically creates a new composition. An alternate method is to right-click the video and select “**New Comp**” on the menu.

Brighter videos always attract more attention. Indeed, a well-lit video can make your content shine and bring out the best in your story. But what if you forgot to turn on the lights or the camera just couldn't handle the situation? We’ve all been there: you’re shooting a video, but there aren't enough light sources. You end up with dark footage. It’s impossible to share this on your social media accounts or with your friends and family.

There are many reasons why people want to brighten a dark video. Maybe you recorded a video with your phone, but the lighting was too dim in the room. Or maybe you were outside, and the sun was behind you, casting shadows on your face while recording. In these cases, it can be helpful to know how to make a dark video brighter.

There is a way to apply simple corrections using Premiere Pro, no matter the reason. In this article, I'll show you how to brighten your video in Premiere Pro so you can keep all the details in the highlights. This can be very useful if you're working with a lot of footage that has been underexposed, and sometimes your shot might look too dark or even black.

#### In this article

## Can I Brighten A Dark Video?

This is a common question that comes up among video editors, so I thought I'd answer it here. The quick answer is yes. There are many online tools that can help you brighten a dark video or adjust the brightness of your video. A lot of times, you'll get a video file that was shot in low light, and it will make your subject look dark and underexposed. Video brightness is an important feature that is easy to adjust. However, if your video is too dark to start off with, it may be difficult to brighten it in a way that doesn't look unnatural.

There are several ways you can brighten a dark video. For example, you can use color correction or add more light to the scene before you film. If you already have a dark video, then you'll need to adjust the contrast and brightness of your video during post-production. You can easily do this by using video editing software but keep in mind that too much brightness or too much contrast can result in poor video quality. So, you have to keep everything in balance.

## How to Brighten Video in Adobe Premiere Pro?

Adobe Premiere Pro is your one-stop solution for editing videos, whether you're editing a film or a TV ad. It gives you the flexibility to edit videos of any format. Adobe Premium makes brightening videos easy. Follow the steps below.

### Step 1

Launch Adobe Premiere Pro, open a project, and then import the video file you want to brighten. Make sure that the video file has been imported into the media library before you start editing it.

### Step 2

Next, click on the brightness and contrast option in the Effects panel, located at the bottom left of the software to adjust the brightness and contrast of your video.

![how to brigthen a video in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/premiere-pro-brighten-video-1.png)

### Step 3

Bring the brightness and contrast option to the center area below the uploaded video. You can do this by simply dragging it and dropping it beneath the video.

### Step 4

You can now easily increase the brightness by changing the brightness number in the effects control panel located to the right of the uploaded video.

![brigthen a video in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/premiere-pro-brighten-video-2.png)

### Step 5

Adjust the brightness according to your needs and save the video with your preferred settings so you can watch it later or share it with your friends across different platforms.

## How To Lighten Up A Dark Video In Adobe Premiere Pro?

The first method that we used was quite simple. All you needed to do was to increase the brightness of the video, and you were good to go. But this method is a bit different. Although it is a little more complicated than the first method, it can do wonders for you. Suppose you have a video shot in very dim light, and it has a lot of dark sections. There is a chance that Increasing the brightness won't do much. So, you can use this method to brighten your video and improve its visibility. Just follow the steps mentioned below:

### Step 1

If you haven't already opened your video in Adobe Premiere Pro, launch the program and import your footage. Then drag it onto the timeline so that it appears at the top.

### Step 2

Effects tab can be found in the left-most panel of adobe premiere pro. Click the Effects tab and search for Lightning effects in the search bar and click on it.

![light up a dark video in premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/premiere-pro-brighten-video-3.png)

### Step 3

Use the drag-and-drop method to add the lighting effects to the clip. Once you have done that, you will feel like your video is having a distorted flash-like effect. But don't worry as we are not going for that.

### Step 4

Now go to the effects control tab present at the top of the screen, and from there, you have to click on the lighting effects.

![light up a dark video in premiere pro - go to effects control tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/premiere-pro-brighten-video-4.png)

### Step 5

Once you click on the lighting effects, you will see many options on your screen. Click on the "Light 1" button to open its dropdown menu. There you will see the spotlight selected by default.

![light up a dark video in premiere pro - click the lighting effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/premiere-pro-brighten-video-5.png)

### Step 6

Click on the dropdown icon adjacent to the spotlight to open up the menu. You need to select "Directional" instead of Spotlight, and you will notice that the dark sections have been brightened significantly.

![light up a dark video in premiere pro - choose directional](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/premiere-pro-brighten-video-6.png)

## How to Use Twixtor Effect to Create Super Slow-Motion Video?

Twixtor is a plug-in program for the After Effects software that allows you to [create slow-motion effects](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) from any video clip by adjusting the settings of the plug-in software. But what Twixtor is and why it is utilized are the topics we will cover in this article.

In addition, we will learn how to manipulate its characteristics to get the best possible outcome for our working composition in the Premiere Pro and After Effects plug-ins. Without any further ado, let's get straight to the business!

#### In this article

01 [What is Twixtor and How Does It Work?](#part1)

02 [How to Use Twixtor to Create Super Slow-Mo in Adobe Premiere Pro?](#part2)

03 [How to Create Super Slow Motion in After Effects with Twixtor?](#part3)

04 [How to Get the Twixtor Style Effect on iPhone?](#part4)

## Part 1: What is Twixtor and How Does It Work?

Twixtor is a plug-in developed by RevisionFX. It is available for purchase. The plug-in gives users the ability to speed up, slow down, or convert the frame rate of picture sequences, all with special effects. Twixtor can visually estimate what a video is meant to look like in a slow-motion setting using video analysis and interoperability.

Due to the need for unparalleled image quality, RE: Vision Effects developed unique tracking technology that determines every individual pixel's motion. This technology allows Twixtor to synthesize new innovative frames by warping and interpolating frames from the original sequence, resulting in unprecedented image quality.

Reset the clock to a single-speed setting. Always remember that you can customize the retiming on a frame-by-frame basis!

When items are crossing in the scene, Twixtor is more accurate and shows fewer artifacts than other rendering engines. This reduces the ripping and stretching of items when they cross the frame or exit it completely.

But how does Twixtor work is the million-dollar question! While Premiere includes the ability to slow down your film and has a newer, better-quality version dubbed Optical Flow, it cannot zoom in on your footage (called Pixel Motion in After Effects).

The slow-motion quality is undoubtedly superior to that of simple frame blending, but it is not the finest grade slow motion available. The TWIXTOR from Re: Vision Effects has long been the go-to solution for the most excellent post-slow motion. It is pricey, but it is well worth it.

The Pro edition provides you with the opportunity to fine-tune the pitch of the auto track, as well as the option to employ mattes and alphas to enrich your tracks and the ability to deal with motion vectors from a 3D system, among other features.

## Part 2: How to Use Twixtor to Create Super Slow-Mo in Adobe Premiere Pro?

As we've already mentioned, we will be analyzing how Twixtor makes slow mos; we will be starting with the Adobe Premiere Pro. The following are the steps you need to learn to perform it yourself.

**Step 1**: After importing the video to the timeline, do some basic editing such as trimming and removing audio from the video.

![nest sequence premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/nest-sequence-premiere-pro.jpg)

**Step 2:** Nest the sequence to convert the video into a new sequence automatically.

**Step 3:** Go to the Effects tab and search for Twixtor, and then drop the Twixtor Pro to the video clip in the timeline.

![twixtor pro effect premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twixtor-pro-effect-premiere-pro.jpg)

**Step 5:** Right-click the video in the timeline again and scroll down to **Show Clip Keyframes** to enable the **Speed** option under **Time Remapping**. You can now enable the GPU acceleration to fast rendering.

**Step 6**: Click the Keyframe icon to mark the points where you want to begin with the slow-motion effect, and then mark the end part of the slow-motion effect video.

![add keyframes to slow motion premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-keyframes-to-slow-motion-premiere-pro.jpg)

Step 7: Now, drag the line lower to add a slo-mo effect to video.

![drag line to slow motion twixtor premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/drag-line-to-slow-motion-twixtor-premiere-pro.jpg)

Remember that your video can sometimes lag if you set the video speed at a meager percentage. To avoid that, utilize settings in a better way to ensure your video works flawlessly.

## Part 3: How to Create Super Slow Motion in After Effects with Twixtor?

When working with After Effects software, Twixtor is a convenient plug-in since it allows us to create slow-motion effects from any video source.

We'll look at an example to better comprehend what we're talking about in this post. Before we begin our study of the Twixtor plug-in, let us get acquainted with the software's operating screen to quickly understand the content of this article as we go through our assessment of the Twixtor plug-in.

**Step 1:** When you launch **After Effects**, go to **File>Import>File** to import your footage. Here you can see the actual frame rate of your film. You may drag your film onto the timeline by right-clicking it and selecting **New Comp from Selection**.

**Step 2:** Select your video from the timeline in the composition, then go to Effects & Presets pane to search Twixtor, and you will find Twixtor or Twixtor Pro under RE: Vision plug-ins, depending on your version. Drag and drop it to the video in the timeline.

![after effects twixtor slow motion plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/after-effects-twixtor-slow-motion-plugin.jpg)

**Step 3**: In the Twixtor effect controls, enter the frame rate of the film you found previously. The faster and better your slowed footage will become, the higher the frame rate.

For organizational reasons, After Effects employs the "**tree-ing**" concept, sometimes known as drop-down menus. Click on the yellow number next to Input: Frame Rate under **Source Control**. It should be set to 29.97 by default. Please set it to the frame rate you discovered previously in the tutorial.

![adjust after effects twixtor pro settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-after-effects-twixtor-pro-settings.jpg)

You can then adjust the speed and time remap mode accordingly. For more information, you can watch the video tutorial below to find out how to create smooth Twixtor effects in Adobe After Effects.

## Part 4: How to Get the Twixtor Style Effect on iPhone?

It is possible to shoot videos in slow motion and then play them back at average speed using [SloPro](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/slopro/id507232505) – 1000fps Slow Motion Video from Sand Mountain Studios, a fantastic video editing effects tool.

Inserting slow motion cues and changing playback speeds without waiting is possible with renderless editing. It allows you to produce slow-motion films and enables you to insert extremely rapid sequences and cycle between various speeds.

SloPro even enables you to edit your films as they are being recorded, allowing you to choose between slow and fast motion while recording.

This program provides complete support for sharing through social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, allowing you to show off your impressive video creations to the rest of the world. It has already been established that SloPro is one of the few videos editing software that includes optical flow as a stand-alone effect.

![slopro slow motion app iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slopro-slow-motion-app-iphone.jpg)

**Step 1**: After you've imported your video, click on the **red Edit** button in the top-right corner of the screen to bring up the editing window.

**Step 2**: Trim the video down to the section that you wish to modify if required using the **Clip In** and **Clip Out** functions. It is divided into clips using the speed in and speeds out controls.

**Step 3**: Tap on the top-left box to bring up a list of fast and **slow speed** choices. **Drag the cursor** over the clip to bring up a fast and slow speed options list.

Step 4: If you want to use a slow speed, press the box in the upper right corner and choose **Optical Flow** from the menu.

This will render the clip with optical flow, resulting in the smooth Twixtor effect you are familiar with. There will be a watermark on your video if you use the program's free version, but you can easily crop it out.

**Conclusion**

Slow-Mo videos are undoubtedly watch-worthy. They allow us to observe the fine details and appreciate the video content. But creating one isn't child's play. So, we decided to compile this article to inform our worthy readers on how they can get started using Twixtor on Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects. We hope you had a fun time learning!

This program provides complete support for sharing through social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, allowing you to show off your impressive video creations to the rest of the world. It has already been established that SloPro is one of the few videos editing software that includes optical flow as a stand-alone effect.

**Step 1**: After you've imported your video, click on the **red Edit** button in the top-right corner of the screen to bring up the editing window.

**Step 2**: Trim the video down to the section that you wish to modify if required using the **Clip In** and **Clip Out** functions. It is divided into clips using the speed in and speeds out controls.

**Step 3**: Tap on the top-left box to bring up a list of fast and **slow speed** choices. **Drag the cursor** over the clip to bring up a fast and slow speed options list.

Step 4: If you want to use a slow speed, press the box in the upper right corner and choose **Optical Flow** from the menu.

This will render the clip with optical flow, resulting in the smooth Twixtor effect you are familiar with. There will be a watermark on your video if you use the program's free version, but you can easily crop it out.

**Conclusion**

Slow-Mo videos are undoubtedly watch-worthy. They allow us to observe the fine details and appreciate the video content. But creating one isn't child's play. So, we decided to compile this article to inform our worthy readers on how they can get started using Twixtor on Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects. We hope you had a fun time learning!

## Part 1: What is Twixtor and How Does It Work?

Twixtor is a plug-in developed by RevisionFX. It is available for purchase. The plug-in gives users the ability to speed up, slow down, or convert the frame rate of picture sequences, all with special effects. Twixtor can visually estimate what a video is meant to look like in a slow-motion setting using video analysis and interoperability.

Due to the need for unparalleled image quality, RE: Vision Effects developed unique tracking technology that determines every individual pixel's motion. This technology allows Twixtor to synthesize new innovative frames by warping and interpolating frames from the original sequence, resulting in unprecedented image quality.

Reset the clock to a single-speed setting. Always remember that you can customize the retiming on a frame-by-frame basis!

When items are crossing in the scene, Twixtor is more accurate and shows fewer artifacts than other rendering engines. This reduces the ripping and stretching of items when they cross the frame or exit it completely.

But how does Twixtor work is the million-dollar question! While Premiere includes the ability to slow down your film and has a newer, better-quality version dubbed Optical Flow, it cannot zoom in on your footage (called Pixel Motion in After Effects).

The slow-motion quality is undoubtedly superior to that of simple frame blending, but it is not the finest grade slow motion available. The TWIXTOR from Re: Vision Effects has long been the go-to solution for the most excellent post-slow motion. It is pricey, but it is well worth it.

The Pro edition provides you with the opportunity to fine-tune the pitch of the auto track, as well as the option to employ mattes and alphas to enrich your tracks and the ability to deal with motion vectors from a 3D system, among other features.

## Part 2: How to Use Twixtor to Create Super Slow-Mo in Adobe Premiere Pro?

As we've already mentioned, we will be analyzing how Twixtor makes slow mos; we will be starting with the Adobe Premiere Pro. The following are the steps you need to learn to perform it yourself.

**Step 1**: After importing the video to the timeline, do some basic editing such as trimming and removing audio from the video.

![nest sequence premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/nest-sequence-premiere-pro.jpg)

**Step 2:** Nest the sequence to convert the video into a new sequence automatically.

**Step 3:** Go to the Effects tab and search for Twixtor, and then drop the Twixtor Pro to the video clip in the timeline.

![twixtor pro effect premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/twixtor-pro-effect-premiere-pro.jpg)

**Step 5:** Right-click the video in the timeline again and scroll down to **Show Clip Keyframes** to enable the **Speed** option under **Time Remapping**. You can now enable the GPU acceleration to fast rendering.

**Step 6**: Click the Keyframe icon to mark the points where you want to begin with the slow-motion effect, and then mark the end part of the slow-motion effect video.

![add keyframes to slow motion premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-keyframes-to-slow-motion-premiere-pro.jpg)

Step 7: Now, drag the line lower to add a slo-mo effect to video.

![drag line to slow motion twixtor premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/drag-line-to-slow-motion-twixtor-premiere-pro.jpg)

Remember that your video can sometimes lag if you set the video speed at a meager percentage. To avoid that, utilize settings in a better way to ensure your video works flawlessly.

## Part 3: How to Create Super Slow Motion in After Effects with Twixtor?

When working with After Effects software, Twixtor is a convenient plug-in since it allows us to create slow-motion effects from any video source.

We'll look at an example to better comprehend what we're talking about in this post. Before we begin our study of the Twixtor plug-in, let us get acquainted with the software's operating screen to quickly understand the content of this article as we go through our assessment of the Twixtor plug-in.

**Step 1:** When you launch **After Effects**, go to **File>Import>File** to import your footage. Here you can see the actual frame rate of your film. You may drag your film onto the timeline by right-clicking it and selecting **New Comp from Selection**.

**Step 2:** Select your video from the timeline in the composition, then go to Effects & Presets pane to search Twixtor, and you will find Twixtor or Twixtor Pro under RE: Vision plug-ins, depending on your version. Drag and drop it to the video in the timeline.

![after effects twixtor slow motion plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/after-effects-twixtor-slow-motion-plugin.jpg)

**Step 3**: In the Twixtor effect controls, enter the frame rate of the film you found previously. The faster and better your slowed footage will become, the higher the frame rate.

For organizational reasons, After Effects employs the "**tree-ing**" concept, sometimes known as drop-down menus. Click on the yellow number next to Input: Frame Rate under **Source Control**. It should be set to 29.97 by default. Please set it to the frame rate you discovered previously in the tutorial.

![adjust after effects twixtor pro settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-after-effects-twixtor-pro-settings.jpg)

You can then adjust the speed and time remap mode accordingly. For more information, you can watch the video tutorial below to find out how to create smooth Twixtor effects in Adobe After Effects.
