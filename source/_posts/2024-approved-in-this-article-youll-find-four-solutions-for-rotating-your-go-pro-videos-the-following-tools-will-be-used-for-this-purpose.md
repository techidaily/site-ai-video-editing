## How to Add a Custom Transition to OBS

OBS Studio is an open-source video editor that is widely popular for live streaming on online platforms. Even though OBS is a completely free application, its features are comparable to any premium video editor. We always look for available transition effects in a video editor and OBS takes it to the next level by allowing users to add custom transitions.

Among custom transitions, Stinger transitions have gained a lot of traction from the users. Stinger transitions are made popular by sports channels who use Stinger frequently whenever there is a change in the scene. We will illustrate how to add custom transitions in OBS and apply Stinger transitions in your video.

## Part 1\. What is Stinger in OBS

Stinger is a special type of customized animated video transition effect that is available in the latest version of OBS Studio. It is a combination of a transparent video animation and a cut transition. Stinger begins with the transparent video animation that grows into full-screen overlay, and it is followed by the cut transition. After the cut transition, you place the next scene or video clip. You will notice Stinger transition whenever sports channels show an instant replay during a live match.

The transparent video animation starts on top of the current video you are editing. When the animation expands and covers up the entire screen, you place the cut transition, and thereafter, you place the next video clip or scene as per your requirement. Some customized stinger effect also includes audio effects along with video effect.

## Part 2\. How to add stinger transitions to OBS

The Stinger transition is available on OBS Studio and Streamlabs, and both of them are open-source and free applications. Before you add stinger transition, you should have a video animation ready that you will play on top of the current video followed by the cut transition effect. You can download several stinger video animations from the internet and include any of them in OBS while adding stinger transition. Here are the steps on how to add a custom transition to OBS.

Step1 Go to Scene Transitions section and click on Effects option to open the drop-down menu.

Step2 From the drop-down menu, click on “Add: Stinger” option.

![add stinger obs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/add-stinger-obs.jpg)

Step3 Give a name to the Stinger transition and click Ok button.

![name stinger transition obs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/name-stinger-transition-obs.jpg)

Step4 You will see Properties window now. Click on Browser button against Video file and select the transparent video animation file that you want to play on top of the current video before applying the cut transition effect.

![apply cut transition effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/apply-cut-transition-effects.jpg)

Step5 For Transition Point Type, select Time(milliseconds) option. In the Transition Point field, add the duration of the transparent video animation so that the transition to the next scene takes place immediately after the video animation gets completed.

![select transition point field](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/select-transition-point-field.jpg)

Step6 If your video animation has audio, go to Audio Monitoring and select Monitor and Output option from the dropdown. For Audio Fade Style, you can select Crossfade option for better output.

![audio monitor output obs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/audio-monitor-output-obs.jpg)

Step7 Scroll down and click on Preview Transition button to check if the stinger transition is taking place as expected. You can adjust the transition point and other parameters to get it perfect.

![preview stinger transition](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/preview-stinger-transition.jpg)

Step8 Finally, click on Ok button and play the video to check out the stinger transition on the big screen.

The steps on how to add a custom transition to Streamlabs OBS are almost similar, and therefore, you can add stinger transition using Streamlabs comfortably.

That is why most amateur video editors find OBS Studio difficult to learn quickly even though there is no dearth of features.

#### How to Create a Mask in Final Cut Pro X

With little effort, the Shape Mask tool allows you to make a mask in any shape on the continuum, ranging from an ellipse to a rectangle.

The Shape Mask is a simple mask that may be changed to editable control points in order to create complex bespoke masks (converting it into a Draw Mask).

* Open the Final Cut Pro project and select the clip you wish to mask.  
Note: You can't composite a clip over another one while using isolated clips. Final Cut Pro has this option, which you may find in the Comping window.
* To make a clip transparent, select it in the timeline and place the play head at a point within the video clip that shows the portion you wish to make transparent.
* Click the Effects button in the top-right corner of the timeline (or press Command-5) to display the Effects browser.
* Select the Shape Mask effect in the Effects Browser.

Tip: Type "shape" in the Effects browser search bar to quickly locate the Shape Mask effect.

To apply the masking effect to the clip in the timeline, choose one of the following options:

1. Drag the effect to the timeline clip.
2. Double-click the effect thumbnail in the Effects browser to apply it.
3. Use the on-screen controls to modify the shape mask if necessary.

The controls for the Shape Mask appear in the viewer, overlaid on top of the video image. In addition, the Effects area of the Video inspector displays the Shape Mask options. By default, the Shape Mask is set to a partially feathered ellipse shape in the center of the frame.

### 3\. Wondershare Filmora

Filmora 11 is an easy to use video editor with useful masking features. It provides various of masking presets to make masking easy for you. If you are looking for Green Screen, Filmora also covers you. Its Chroma Key allows you to remove the background of almost any color.

#### Masking in Filmora 11

Filmora 11 has been modified to allow for the masking of keyframes. First, double-click the clip on your timeline to open a settings window in the library. Then, in the videos area, select the "Mask" option. Multiple forms may be selected here.

We picked the ‘Star' form for this project. After selecting it, you may drag the shape to your clip in the preview area.

Scrolling down in the Windows category will take you to more options where you can change the scale, position, width, height, and radius of your chosen shape. You may also lessen the strength of the form and rotate it to make it blend in better with the other elements you're trying to hide in your window.

To add the keyframe, simply hit the "Add" button after completing it. You may then modify the mask's form to match the added frame.

![top video editor with useful masking - avid](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/masking-video-editing-6.jpg)

#### Masking in Avid Media Composer

In the Masking Effect window, you can choose to either create a new mask or use an existing one. First, select the "Create Mask" option and then click on the "Draw Mask" button to create a new mask.

This will open up the Draw Mask window, where you can draw your mask using the various tools provided. To apply the mask, simply click the "Apply" button.

If you want to use an existing mask, select the "Use Mask" option and then choose the mask you want to use from the drop-down menu.

### 5\. Sony Vegas Pro

Sony Vegas Pro is a professional video editing software with robust masking tools. The interface of the editor may looks complicated for beginners, yet once you get familiar with it, you will be amazed by what you can achieve with the Vegas Pro.

![top video editor with useful masking - sony vegas pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/masking-video-editing-7.jpg)

#### Masking in Sony Vegas Pro

Step 1: Drag the clip from the Explorer or Project Media windows and drop it on the timeline. Then, look for another video that is quite distinct from the first.

Step 2: Drag it to the timeline below the first video event. A new track will be created. Place the original event directly beneath the video occurrence.

The Video Preview window does not display the second video because it is covered by the first video, which resembles one photo sitting on top of another in a stack. So to view the lower clip, we'll need to add a mask.

### 6\. Magix Movie Edit Pro

Magix Movie Edit Pro is another video editor that is great for adding masks to your video. It is famous for its ease-of-learn and stable rendering. When it comes to masking, it is also quite powerful.

They let you apply special effects to only certain parts of a video. You may dramatically improve the aspect of your movies with this Magix Movie Edit Pro Plus feature.

When you apply color effects to the software's template, it appears that you can only use color effects.

To add additional effects to specific portions of the shot, simply import an image and apply the Alpha Mask property from the Chroma Key menu. Then you must duplicate the video section and place it on a lower track, while keeping the alpha mask picture in between the two videos (click the graphic above for a visual guide).

### 7\.  Studio

#### Masking in  Studio

Select the clip you want to overlay your media on, then click the ‘Mask' button on the editing toolbar. After that, open the mask creation window by clicking ‘Create Mask.

First, click "Create Panel" to create a video mask panel.

To make a panel, use the panel of tools on the left side of the preview window. They'll only be shown in your video when you add assets later if they're inside this panel. Keep in mind that you may modify the size and placement of your asset within the panel and the panel itself; therefore, you might need to.

To access the media selection possibilities, click on the ‘Asset' tab of the mask creation window. To discover the picture or video you want to include in your panel, go through your imported files by selecting ‘Select media.' After that, select the media to be included in your panel video mask and hit ‘Apply.'

Use the left-hand slider or the resizing box in the preview window on the right to change the size and placement of your media in your panel video mask.

To adjust the 3D position of your panel video mask, go to the ‘3D' tab of the mask creation window.

Then, go to the Quick Settings menu (press the Menu button at the bottom of your screen), select Cloud Print from the drop-down menu, and then select your photo. Then open up the design interface by selecting Mask Designer from the drop-down menu.

You may select from a variety of templates in the Mask Designer. If you want to make your own mask shape, the Mask Designer has three alternatives for you to create new mask types.

Create an image mask: You may use any picture or video, and it will be resized to fit the shape.

Create a text mask: Enter the text you'd like to appear in your photo. Then, go to the left side of the panel under Font/Paragraph on the left side for font style, size, and other options. To alter the text mask itself, go to the preview window and resize it on the left panel.
