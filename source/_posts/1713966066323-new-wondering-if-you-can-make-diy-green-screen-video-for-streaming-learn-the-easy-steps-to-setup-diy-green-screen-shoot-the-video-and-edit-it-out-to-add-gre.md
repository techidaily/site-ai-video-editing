## Wondering if You Can Make DIY Green Screen Video for Streaming? Learn the Easy Steps to Setup DIY Green Screen, Shoot the Video and Edit It Out to Add Green Screen Effects

No matter how big the budget of a Hollywood movie is, at the end of the day, it has to rely on the humble green screens for special video effects. The stunning studios from where your favorite YouTubers and gamers stream their videos are graphical video effects created through green screens. Even the studios that you see on TV channels are a graphical creation of green screens. You must be wondering how they could achieve such awesome graphics with a simple green screen.

All you need is a good-quality green fabric, a professional video editing software, and a camera. You may not believe it, but that is all you need for creating DIY green screen video effect. You do not have to be a professional video editor to edit the green screen on your videos and add any special video effect. In this article, you will learn how to create your own DIY green backdrop.

## What Is Green Screen Technique?

A green screen is nothing but a green fabric. In a video, a green screen is placed in the background behind the subject. In the editing phase of the video, the green screen is replaced with any background image or video effect that stays intact in the video as long as possible. In short, the green screen technique involves superimposing photos and videos on the green screen in a video.

Starting from the video game industry, movie industry to video streaming and TV channels, the green screen technique is used everywhere. The stunning graphical component of these industries is totally dependent on the green screen technique. In fact, DIY green screen for zoom meetings and video conferencing is widely used. Along with that, YouTubers and Twitch streamers use DIY green screen for streaming live.

Technically speaking, instead of a green screen, you can use any other color of screen. However, green screens are widely used, and it has become a norm. The main point to remember when using a green screen is that nothing else should have green color such as the dresses the subject is wearing. Therefore, in technical terms, the green screen is referred to as Chroma Key, and you will find Chroma Key option instead of green screen in most video editors.

## Why Use Green Screen Technique?

The main reason why the green screen technique is used in movie and video making is that the video editor can replace the entire background at once instead of replacing the background frame by frame. Once you replace a green screen with an image or video effect, it stays the same throughout the video as long as required.

Therefore, the video editor can save a lot of time in editing and the editing stays uniform throughout which gives a realistic effect. If the green screen technique is not used and editing is done frame by frame of a video, there could be a manual error, inconsistent, and graphical glitches.

You can replace green screens with anything you want. It could be a still image of a beautiful studio with 3D effect like you see in case of YouTubers and gamers. It could be a moving, real-life landscape on any place in the world instead of a beautiful background picture. Similarly, it could be replaced by video effects such as explosions, stadiums full of people, battlefields, and likewise. At times, it could be live animations as you see on TV channels.

## How To Create DIY Green Screen Stand Setup and Add Green Screen Effect?

If you want to have a green screen setup for your video, you need to have the following things ready.

* A green cloth that is large enough to cover the entire background.
* A video editing software to replace green screen in your video with anything.
* External light for more video clarity and a good camera with mic.

Step 1: Setup DIY Green Backdrop

Your green fabric should be soft and bright. If you are going to be the subject of the video, make sure you are not wearing anything green. Moreover, do not keep any object within the video frame that is green in color. If there are too many green objects, you can use a blue screen.

When it comes to hanging the green cloth in the background, people find it very difficult. If your video frame is going to be a close-up to the subject, you can use a green screen panel to hang green cloth. A green screen panel generally has a collapsible structure for easy storage and transportation.

Otherwise, you need to install hooks in the wall if you are planning to replace the green screen with a studio-like scene so that the entire background of the video frame stays covered with green screen. You should opt for multiple green screens and stitch them together to cover the background completely.

Step 2: Setup Camera and Light

Whether you are shooting with a DSLR camera or smartphone camera or webcam, make sure you are shooting at least HD video quality so that the editing could be great. Lights are important when you are using green screen though they are not a necessity. The video quality and brightness get enhanced with lights. Diffused lights work the best and the background should be well-lit.

Most importantly, you have to place the lights in such a way that your body arms should not be casting any shadow on the green screen. You can either stand very close to the green screen or away from the green screen so that your shadow does not go till the green screen. Instead of starting to shoot the video from the very beginning, you should capture for a few seconds and make sure everything is perfect including the camera angle.

Step 3: Get The Best Video Editor For Green Screen Effect

There are various video editors available, but not all of them are suitable for green screen effect. We recommend Wondershare Filmora as the best video editor to apply green screen effects on your video while editing. The reason behind the recommendation is that the steps to replace the green screen with any image or video are super simple and anyone can do it. There is no need to be a professional video editor.

### How to smooth out cuts

Adding cuts in the beats is one part of the job, not the whole job. After adding these cuts, you have to smoothen them. With it, the point of interest for the audience becomes clear.

To maintain the audience's attention on our video, we have to smoothen the cuts so that our audience quickly understands the ongoing story in our video. If sudden changes occur on the screen, watching it gets disconcerting.

Indeed, you would not want your audience to have this experience. Head to the following techniques to understand how to smooth out video cuts

##### Technique 1: Showing multiple perspectives

The focal person in the video must occupy the same spot in the previous shot as it maintains in the current shot.

Do you wonder how some pictures or videos look so stunning? As you keep reading you will discover the secrets of achieving similar quality for your content. You need a video or photo-editing software such as Adobe Premiere Pro and LUTS. Premier Pro luts are file types that you use to make color corrections to your content. They are available in different formats, each with varying capabilities. Below is everything you need to improve your editing skills using Adobe’s software and premiere luts.

![how to use luts in adobe primere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/premiere-luts-1.jpeg)

#### In this article

01 [How does Premiere Pro Classify LUTS?](#part1)

02 [How to use Luts in Adobe Premiere Pro?](#part2)

03 [How to save and export your LUTS?](#part3)

## How does Premiere Pro Classify LUTS?

A premiere pro lut can fall into two categories depending on its core function. These are:

#### • Looks

These are premiere luts you use to make changes to your video or photo’s appearance and color scheme. They are available as presets under the Lumetri Color Panel and offer quick fixes to your content.

#### • Input Lut

You use these premiere pro luts to interpret log footage. Additionally, they are the first step of your color correcting process and work best on DSLR footage. However, keep reading to discover how to use luts in Adobe Premiere Pro.

## How to use Luts in Adobe Premiere Pro?

Now that you are aware of how the program classifies the Luts, here is how you can correct your footage.

#### 1\. Get the latest version of the program

You can purchase and download the program from your region's Adobe Website. The program is available for both macOS and Windows. However, it is quite heavy on the system. According to reports, the below requirements are sufficient.

* You need a processer with 8 cores and clock speeds upwards of 3.2GHz.
* 16 GB of Ram is ideal for macOS. However, you do require upwards of 32GB if you are running Windows.
* Graphics cards from Nvidia and AMD are best if you also want to improve the program’s performance. You request one that can handle the Adobe Premiere Pro from your supplier.
* Furthermore, invest in a high-capacity storage device to save your projects since some outputs can be very large after color correction. The program allows you to render 4K files which are the largest.
* Finally, the above requirements are sufficient to run the following versions OF Adobe Premiere Pro:  
i. Adobe Premiere Pro 22.2  
ii. Adobe Premiere Pro 22.1.2  
iii. Adobe Premiere Pro 22.1.1  
iv. Adobe Premiere Pro 22.0

#### 2\. Select the video you want and put it on the timeline

![use luts in adobe primere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/premiere-luts-2.jpeg)

#### 3\. Premiere luts are accessible from two sections of the program

Input luts are available under the Basic Correction tab from the Lumetri Panel as above.

Alternatively, you can get them by accessing the Basic Correction tab from the Lumetri Section of the Effects Control Panel.

#### 4\. Then, open the Input LUT dropdown menu and choose the premiere lut you want

Adobe Premiere Pro has preset input LUTs. However, you can also add your own by clicking browse. Doing so opens your computer’s File Explorer and you can locate your custom premiere luts. The software applies the premiere lut, after which you can use the tools to make adjustments.

Additionally, Adobe Premiere Pro allows you to install custom LUT files to use. Below is the process for macOS users.

1. Create these target directories in your Adobe Premiere Installation files. • For shared devices  
/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Common/LUTs/Creative  
/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Common/LUTs/Technical  
• You need to create these files if you have administrator access.  
/Users//Library/Application Support/Adobe/Common/LUTs/Creative  
/Users//Library/Application Support/Adobe/Common/LUTs/Technical
2. Copy your custom LUT files to each of the folders.
3. These will be available in your Lumetri Panel next time you launch Adobe Premiere Pro.

The process is the same for Windows Users. However, the target directories are different.

* For shared devices:  
C:\\ Program Files\\ Adobe\\Common\\LUTs\\Creative  
C:\\ Program Files\\ Adobe\\Common\\LUTs\\Creative
* You need to create these files if you have administrator access.  
C:\\Users\\yourusername\\AppData\\Roaming\\Adobe\\Common\\LUTs\\Creative  
C:\\Users\\yourusername\\AppData\\Roaming\\Adobe\\Common\\LUTs\\Technical

Adobe Premiere Pro accepts .look and .cube file types, allowing you more creative freedom. Additionally, you can save and export any custom premiere luts to use in other projects. The next section offers a step-by-step guide on how to do that.

Finally, Looks allow you to make quick adjustments to your videos using the presets available on the Lumetri Panel. You can access these from the Effects Panel. Furthermore, it also allows you to preview the result. The intensity of the look can vary depending on where the slider is on the effects panel.

## How to save and export your LUTS?

Most filmmakers prefer to save their premier luts for later use. Here is how to do it:

1. Follow the above process through to step 5.
2. Once you finish your editing, click on the Lumetri Pop Up menu and choose Save Preset.
3. Fill the respective fields with your custom information and click OK. The program will then save the clip to the location you specify.
4. You can save custom luts in the following ways:  
Scale only applies the new lut to the video. As such, all other luts you use are deleted. Therefore, if your video is one hour, your custom settings will run through the clip’s entire length.  
Anchor To In Point only saves the section of the clip where your custom settings are active. Additionally, the software will add all pre-existing luts to the section without scaling.
5. Additionally, you can repeat the process and export your LUTs in the following formats:  
.look exports the LUT as an Adobe Premiere Pro file to a location on your device.  
.cube saves the Lumetri preset you can use on other color grading software. For example, you can use your .cube custom lut with Filmora.

## How does Premiere Pro Classify LUTS?

A premiere pro lut can fall into two categories depending on its core function. These are:

#### • Looks

These are premiere luts you use to make changes to your video or photo’s appearance and color scheme. They are available as presets under the Lumetri Color Panel and offer quick fixes to your content.

#### • Input Lut

You use these premiere pro luts to interpret log footage. Additionally, they are the first step of your color correcting process and work best on DSLR footage. However, keep reading to discover how to use luts in Adobe Premiere Pro.

## How to use Luts in Adobe Premiere Pro?

Now that you are aware of how the program classifies the Luts, here is how you can correct your footage.

#### 1\. Get the latest version of the program

You can purchase and download the program from your region's Adobe Website. The program is available for both macOS and Windows. However, it is quite heavy on the system. According to reports, the below requirements are sufficient.

* You need a processer with 8 cores and clock speeds upwards of 3.2GHz.
* 16 GB of Ram is ideal for macOS. However, you do require upwards of 32GB if you are running Windows.
* Graphics cards from Nvidia and AMD are best if you also want to improve the program’s performance. You request one that can handle the Adobe Premiere Pro from your supplier.
* Furthermore, invest in a high-capacity storage device to save your projects since some outputs can be very large after color correction. The program allows you to render 4K files which are the largest.
* Finally, the above requirements are sufficient to run the following versions OF Adobe Premiere Pro:  
i. Adobe Premiere Pro 22.2  
ii. Adobe Premiere Pro 22.1.2  
iii. Adobe Premiere Pro 22.1.1  
iv. Adobe Premiere Pro 22.0

#### 2\. Select the video you want and put it on the timeline

![use luts in adobe primere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/premiere-luts-2.jpeg)

#### 3\. Premiere luts are accessible from two sections of the program

Input luts are available under the Basic Correction tab from the Lumetri Panel as above.

Alternatively, you can get them by accessing the Basic Correction tab from the Lumetri Section of the Effects Control Panel.

#### 4\. Then, open the Input LUT dropdown menu and choose the premiere lut you want

Adobe Premiere Pro has preset input LUTs. However, you can also add your own by clicking browse. Doing so opens your computer’s File Explorer and you can locate your custom premiere luts. The software applies the premiere lut, after which you can use the tools to make adjustments.

Additionally, Adobe Premiere Pro allows you to install custom LUT files to use. Below is the process for macOS users.

1. Create these target directories in your Adobe Premiere Installation files. • For shared devices  
/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Common/LUTs/Creative  
/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Common/LUTs/Technical  
• You need to create these files if you have administrator access.  
/Users//Library/Application Support/Adobe/Common/LUTs/Creative  
/Users//Library/Application Support/Adobe/Common/LUTs/Technical
2. Copy your custom LUT files to each of the folders.
3. These will be available in your Lumetri Panel next time you launch Adobe Premiere Pro.

The process is the same for Windows Users. However, the target directories are different.

* For shared devices:  
C:\\ Program Files\\ Adobe\\Common\\LUTs\\Creative  
C:\\ Program Files\\ Adobe\\Common\\LUTs\\Creative
* You need to create these files if you have administrator access.  
C:\\Users\\yourusername\\AppData\\Roaming\\Adobe\\Common\\LUTs\\Creative  
C:\\Users\\yourusername\\AppData\\Roaming\\Adobe\\Common\\LUTs\\Technical

Adobe Premiere Pro accepts .look and .cube file types, allowing you more creative freedom. Additionally, you can save and export any custom premiere luts to use in other projects. The next section offers a step-by-step guide on how to do that.

Finally, Looks allow you to make quick adjustments to your videos using the presets available on the Lumetri Panel. You can access these from the Effects Panel. Furthermore, it also allows you to preview the result. The intensity of the look can vary depending on where the slider is on the effects panel.

## How to save and export your LUTS?

Most filmmakers prefer to save their premier luts for later use. Here is how to do it:

1. Follow the above process through to step 5.
2. Once you finish your editing, click on the Lumetri Pop Up menu and choose Save Preset.
3. Fill the respective fields with your custom information and click OK. The program will then save the clip to the location you specify.
4. You can save custom luts in the following ways:  
Scale only applies the new lut to the video. As such, all other luts you use are deleted. Therefore, if your video is one hour, your custom settings will run through the clip’s entire length.  
Anchor To In Point only saves the section of the clip where your custom settings are active. Additionally, the software will add all pre-existing luts to the section without scaling.
5. Additionally, you can repeat the process and export your LUTs in the following formats:  
.look exports the LUT as an Adobe Premiere Pro file to a location on your device.  
.cube saves the Lumetri preset you can use on other color grading software. For example, you can use your .cube custom lut with Filmora.
