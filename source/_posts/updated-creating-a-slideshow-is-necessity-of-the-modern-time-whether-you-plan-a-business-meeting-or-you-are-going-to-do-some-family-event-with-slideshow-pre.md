After editing, the project is rendered in real time with no waiting. You can also choose to render only part of the video by selecting the time range.

The design of the program makes it intuitive enough that you can start editing videos right away without having to go through tutorials. It is easy to create the desired effects and titles that you need for your video with just a few clicks. Its editing tools are powerful enough for professional use while still being easy to learn.
