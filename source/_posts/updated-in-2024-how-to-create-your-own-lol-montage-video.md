### What Are The Requirements For Creating the Print Effect In PhotoShop?

Before we discuss the complete process of creating the print effect while using Photoshop, here are the resources you have to arrange.

* **Picture of the object:** We will cut out the object from the original image using the Lasso tool and unsaturate it. However, you have to ensure that the object is clear and easily detectable within the picture.
* **A background image:** You will need a background image to add the object to. For this, you can use a solid background, capture scenery, etc.
* **Fonts**: You can also add fonts to the final image to add your ideas or thoughts, making your final project more eye-catching and engaging.
* **Photoshop latest version:** For this tutorial, we will use the Photoshop CC 2021 version, so make sure to download and install it to your computer immediately!

### **Step 3: Adjust the Speed with Filmora**

Filmora for Android offers two methods to edit the speed of your video. You can use the speed slider for direct editing or the Speed Ramping feature for a more creative approach.

##### Method 1Use the Uniform Speed Slider

Tap the video that you have imported. Then, select the speed slider at the bottom of the screen. Adjust the speed of the video by dragging the speed slider to the left or right. Once satisfied, tap the Check button and save your video.

![use uniform speed slider](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/easy-steps-to-slow-down-a-video-on-iphone-and-android-7.jpg)

##### Method 2Use the Speed Ramping Feature

With the Speed Ramping feature, adjust the speed of your Android video gradually in a more creative manner. You may slow it down at the beginning or the end while accelerating the middle. This makes the video fun and more engaging to your audience.

To use this feature on Filmora for Android, tap on the video clip and select the Speed Ramping icon at the bottom of the screen. Use the graph that appears to adjust how you want the video to slow down or speed up when playing it back. Tap on the Check button once done and save your video.
