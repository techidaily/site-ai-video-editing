### 03Steps to create a graduation slideshow with music using Wondershare Filmora

Step 1\. Download, install and launch the Wondershare Filmora software on your system from the official software page. Tap on the New Project button to start creating a new slideshow.

Step 2\. Next, import and add all the images, music, and other media files to the Media Library of the software. These files can be then moved to the timeline. The order of the files can be changed as needed.

The editing features can be used to crop and customize the images and other media files as needed.

Step 3\. Now transitions can be added to the slideshow. The software has multiple options available like cross merge, sweep clockwise, and many more to choose from. The duration of the transitions can also be adjusted as needed.

Step 4\. Next comes the adding and editing of the background music. You can either add a song of your choice or can also use a music file from the built-in audio library. Voice-over recordings can also be added to give that extra personal touch. The audio files can also be edited using the supported features of the software.
