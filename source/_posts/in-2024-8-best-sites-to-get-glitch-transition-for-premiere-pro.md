## Part 2\. Prerequisites to Make a Rotating Video Effect

You will need a few items to create a rotating transition video. First, look at the fundamental priorities for creating this feature.

### The Subject Matters

To record a successful rotating video, you need a person or a subject to perform in front of the camera. It can be a model hired by a brand, a social influencer, or maybe it's you. Keep in mind the following things before recording:

* The person should get two different costumes.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### Shotting Equipment

To record a professional video, you need a good camera. You can use a smartphone to record this footage. There is no need to have a tripod stand or any gear to hold the camera because the camera will be in a rotating position, the same as the subject's hand.

For this, you need a filmmaker or any person living with you. Just give instructions as shown below to him to record a perfect video for yourself:

* Record the whole video in just one direction.
* Don't **shake** the camera because it gives blurry footage.
* Ensure to **focus** on the subject during recording.
* Don't **zoom** in or out while recording the video.
* Keep the subject in the **middle** of the frame during the recording process.
* The **hand rotation** timing is the same as the camera's rotation.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Ensure to record one footage multiple times so that you can choose the perfect one later for editing.

![smartphone for filming](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/rotating-video-effect-3.png)

### Filming of the First Footage

To make the footage for the rotating video illusion, we have to record it at least twice to get crystal clear and high-resolution results. Therefore, ensure that we have camera movement in the same direction during all recording times.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You can film the video either in the vertical format of the camera or in horizontal format. It all depends upon your script!

Follow the below-mentioned steps to record the first footage for the video:

* Hold the camera in a perfect format, whatever you choose.
* Let the subject stand or sit in the middle of the frame.
* The filmmaker can rotate the camera when the subject's hand rotates.
* Try your best to rotate the camera 180 degrees.
* Ensure that the camera lens faces the ground at the end of the rotation.

![filming scenes of first footage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/rotating-video-effect-4.png)

After filming the first footage for the video, it's time to record the second footage to transition between the two.

### Filming of the Second Footage

To create a second shot, you have to remember that the costume and location of the filming are different from the first footage. Follow the below steps to record it:

* The first step is to hold the camera in the same direction as the first footage.
* When editing, make sure the subject's position matches the first footage.
* Make sure the subject's hand movement is in the opposite direction from the first shot.

![filming scenes of second footage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/rotating-video-effect-5.png)

* Find the section which needs to **speed** up, such as in the last half of each rotation.
* Right-click on the section of the clip in the timeline.
* Then, select the **Speed option** as shown in the icon of the timer present on the upper tab of the timeline.

### Filming of the First Footage

To make the footage for the rotating video illusion, we have to record it at least twice to get crystal clear and high-resolution results. Therefore, ensure that we have camera movement in the same direction during all recording times.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You can film the video either in the vertical format of the camera or in horizontal format. It all depends upon your script!

Follow the below-mentioned steps to record the first footage for the video:

* Hold the camera in a perfect format, whatever you choose.
* Let the subject stand or sit in the middle of the frame.
* The filmmaker can rotate the camera when the subject's hand rotates.
* Try your best to rotate the camera 180 degrees.
* Ensure that the camera lens faces the ground at the end of the rotation.

![filming scenes of first footage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/rotating-video-effect-4.png)

After filming the first footage for the video, it's time to record the second footage to transition between the two.

### Filming of the Second Footage

To create a second shot, you have to remember that the costume and location of the filming are different from the first footage. Follow the below steps to record it:

* The first step is to hold the camera in the same direction as the first footage.
* When editing, make sure the subject's position matches the first footage.
* Make sure the subject's hand movement is in the opposite direction from the first shot.

![filming scenes of second footage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/rotating-video-effect-5.png)

### 2\. Price - 4.7/5

This HDR photography program is compatible with Windows and macOS systems, which is a big plus. You can install it on Windows 7 or newer and macOS 10.12 or newer. Sorry, Linux users!

### 5\. Best for - Beginner HDRi editors

This program's simple approach makes it perfect for HDRi photographers without prior editing skills. Also, if you're a beginner on a tight budget, easyHDR is the best software for you.

**Our Verdict**

Up to this juncture, you might wonder if Easy HDR is worth the money or not. Well, that depends on what you want. If you have minimal HDR editing knowledge, then this is the best professional program for you.

The straightforward layout boasts automatic HDR editing tools to make your work effortless. In addition, it supports a wide array of image formats, including photos taken using your DSLR camera. And the $33/lifetime price should be manageable by many average Joes.

But on the flip side, Easy HDR lacks in-depth post-processing tools. Also, it lacks the all-important “undo” feature, which is vital in HDR image editing. Other than that, it's the perfect program to make dramatic and realistic HDR photos.

 Pros

* Simple layout.
* Make realistic HDR images with automatic tools.
* Easy HDRi Blender and Adobe Lightroom plugins.
* Standalone Easy HDR desktop program.
* Batch processing supported.
* Compatible with multiple image formats, including RAW.

 Cons

* It doesn't have advanced HDR post-processing tools.
* No HDR feature for editing.

## Part 2\. Detailed Review for Easy HDR

Before diving deeper into the detailed Easy HDR features, it's important to note that the program has a demo version. You can use this version to practice and study the vital components of easyHDR. But be guided that the demo version exports images with a watermark. In addition, users can't save HDRi in TIFF format. Let's get in!

### 1\. High-Quality Bracket Merging

A good quality HDRi software should easily merge different image exposures, making the photo look natural and spectacular. To start incorporating, drag the image brackets to easyHDR and press “Ok” on the pop-up screen. You can now try the different bracket merging effects until you find something that suits your preference.

### 2\. Editing features

EasyHDR goes a step further to provide its users with a comprehensive list of editing features. For example, the “Clone Stamp” tool can remove unwanted objects like cables without blurring the photo. You can also use the “Tone Curve” feature to adjust the brightness of shadows and highlights.

### 3\. Ghost removal

No, this is not the scary ghost that you know. Instead, these ghosting artefacts appear in misaligned photos due to moving objects like leaves, branches, cars, people, etc. With Easy HDR, you can eliminate the “ghosts” manually or automatically. Simply open the photo and turn on “Ghost Removal” to remove them automatically.

### 4\. HDR batch processing

As expected, you can find it pretty tedious to import and merge each HDR bracket individually. For this reason, easyHDR comes with a “Batch Processing” feature that allows users to combine a whole folder of brackets automatically.

### 5\. LDR enhancement

Although we've mainly focused on brackets and photos in this post, it's important to note that easyHDR also works with single images. Instead of having three separate bracketed exposures, LDR (Low Dynamic Range) enhancement allows you to generate exposures from a single JPEG or RAW photo.

## Bonus Tips: The Best Way to Edit HDR videos on your Desktop

Like HDR images, HDR videos offer more comprehensive displays in dark and bright surroundings. In short, these videos allow more colourful and detailed highlight representations. Unfortunately, not all HDR editing programs can merge bracketed exposures effortlessly to produce outstanding results. And those that do can cost you an arm and a leg.

With that in mind, we recommend [Wondershare Filmora 11](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for professional and semi-professional HDR editors. It's a simple but detailed program that allows users to edit HDR materials quickly and easily. It houses thousands of free effects you'll use with the Blending Mode to create nice HDR footage. Filmora 11 works with any video format, including RAW footage from your camcorder. And of course, there are many other editing features like color correction, color grading, image stabilization, chroma key/green screen, etc.

**Steps to add an HDR effect to a standard video on Filmora 11:**

##### Step1Open the video on Filmora 11

![easy hdr alternative load video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/easy-hdr-1.jpg)

Run Wondershare Filmora 11 on your Mac/Win computer and start a new project. After creating a project, click Import Media to upload the video to edit and move it to the storyboard.

##### Step2Add a blending mode effect

![easy hdr alternative add white sample color](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/easy-hdr-2.jpg)

Next, select the video and choose White as the color overlay. To do that, open the Sample color options and move the While color on the top timeline.

![easy hdr alternative add exclusion blending mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/easy-hdr-3.jpg)

After that, it's time to change the Blending Mode of the color overlay. To do that, right-click the color track and choose Edit Properties. Then tap Composition and then select Exclusion on the Blending Mode drop-down menu.

##### Step3Apply the B&W Film color effect

![easy hdr alternative add b and w film effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/easy-hdr-4.jpg)

Now tap the Effect tab and search for the B&W Film effect. This film effect should be free to use whether using a paid or free account. After downloading it, add the effect overlay to the video track and export the video.

##### Step4Import the uploaded video

![easy hdr alternative set overlay blending mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/easy-hdr-5.jpg)

After creating the video, import it on Filmora 11 and delete the white color overlay and W&B Film effects. Now add the imported video on the first track, then search and apply a Square Blur effect. Also, change the Blending Mode of the footage to Overlay. Meanwhile, click the Effect tab and adjust the Size slider accordingly. For example, you can choose 10.

![easy hdr alternative add luma sharp effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/easy-hdr-6.jpg)

Don't stop there. Open the Effects tab and add the Lomo effect to your video. Also, search and add the Luma Sharp effect. Remember that you can retouch these effects accordingly under the Effect tab. And lastly, export the new HDR video. That's it!

## Final Words

There you have it. Easy HDR is arguably the most-beginner friendly program to edit your photos on desktops. Although it doesn't feature much, the available editing features should be enough to help you create incredible HDR images. And don't forget to use [Wondershare Filmora 11](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to apply a cool HDR effect to your footage. Give it a try!

It's a simple but detailed program that allows users to edit HDR materials quickly and easily. It houses thousands of free effects you'll use with the Blending Mode to create nice HDR footage. Filmora 11 works with any video format, including RAW footage from your camcorder. And of course, there are many other editing features like color correction, color grading, image stabilization, chroma key/green screen, etc.

**Steps to add an HDR effect to a standard video on Filmora 11:**

##### Step1Open the video on Filmora 11

Also, change the Blending Mode of the footage to Overlay. Meanwhile, click the Effect tab and adjust the Size slider accordingly. For example, you can choose 10.
