## Part 1: Slowing Down Videos on Your GoPro: A Guide

[GoPro](https://gopro.com/en/us/) offers **Sony Vegas Pro Slow Motion** to record videos in slow motion. Does using such technical equipment seem challenging for you as a new user? Follow this step-by-step guide and set the camera before recording to make a perfect slow-mo shot.

##### Step 1

Set the resolution to 2.7k for a slow-motion video and a frame rate of 240fps. Afterward, keep the “Color” natural if you don’t want to color grade it. Moreover, adjust the “Sharping” low by using its respective options.

![set resolution and frame rate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/gopro-slow-motion-with-quality-1.jpg)

##### Step 2

Reset the “Hyper Smooth” to high and later turn ISO to a minimum of 100 and a maximum of 800\. Then, head to set the "Shutter Speed" and "White Balance" to auto.

##### Step 3

Moving ahead, choose Lens to “Linear” and keep the “Bitrate” high. Finally, select the “Exposure Value Compensation” to -0.5 using its slider. Your camera is ready to capture your desired and captivating slow-motion shots.

## Part 2: Slow Down Videos on GoPro Quik After Recording

After recording the required clip, post-editing is important to polish the digital content. GoPro also offers [GoPro Quik](https://gopro.com/en/us/shop/quik-app-video-photo-editor) to edit slow-motion videos to your desired extent. Unfortunately, not everyone can quickly discover **Go Pro slow motion** in their first use. That’s why it’s necessary to follow the given steps so you can easily discover and edit slow motion.

##### Step 1

Access the GoPro Quick on your device and launch it. Choose the "Media" icon in the bottom bar and select the video you want to edit. After importing the required media files, start working on a project.

![select media to import](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/gopro-slow-motion-with-quality-4.jpg)

##### Step 2

Select the "Pen" icon in the bottom bar and scroll the menu to the left side. Here, choose the "Speed" option and tap the “+” icon to drag the slider to the point where you want to apply the slow motion. Hit the end mark and get a preview of smooth speed ramping in slow motion.

## Part 3: Make Better Slow-Motion Videos with Wondershare Filmora

Making a slow motion means spending cognitive effort and time on a project. Thus, video editors seek a reliable platform like **GoPro Hero 11,** [**which is slow motion**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Unfortunately, this editing app is outdated, and other better platforms are being developed. In search of the latest and easy-to-use video editor, use [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

It is a video editing software with various powerful editing features compared with GoPro Quik. This platform can perform more tasks than trimming, merging, and splitting clips. Filmora is equipped with AI technology to provide maximum ease to users. You can use this tool to ensure a smooth workflow and boost your productivity.

### Why Filmora is Better Than GoPro Quik?

Filmora provides many features that GoPro Quik does not offer. Everyone needs solid arguments and valid reasons to reconsider their choices. Thus, here we have highlighted some proven and logical reasons to use Filmora instead of GoPro:

* The first and foremost thing you can see is Filmora’s intuitive interface. Anyone without any video editing background can use this tool effectively for their projects.
* Video editors need assistance while editing perfect shots. Filmora offers an [AI Copilot Editing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) system as your editing assistant, which GoPro does not provide. It directs users to create high-quality videos.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

* GoPro Quik allows you to edit up to 1-minute videos. In contrast, Filmora doesn't restrict you from editing videos of a certain length.
* With Filmora AI, you can generate a customized script and turn it into a video. AI integration for unique content makes this tool better than GoPro Quik.
* Unlike GoPro Quik, getting personalized music tracks is possible with Filmora. It can create soundtracks that align with your project’s needs.
* **Slow-motion GoPro** can assist in speed-ramping videos for a smooth transition. Conversely, Filmora also offers an optical flow option to automate the [speed ramping](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).
* Even GoPro Quik cannot remove vocals from the audio files. Using Filmora, this option is just a click away. It can automatically separate vocals from music tracks so you can dub high-quality videos.
* Using GoPro, users can share their videos on social media or export them anywhere. In comparison, Filmora allows you to adjust resolution, quality, project name, and destination.
* AI in Filmora can generate images with your prompts that will not claim legal rights. This service is unavailable in GoPro; it is just limited to video editing.
* Last but not least, Filmora can transform your text into engaging videos. By doing so, you can save the budget for actors, video editors, and other crew.

#### Step 2: Use the Optical Flow Option and Slow Down the Video Speed

Drag and drop the imported video in the timeline section. Place your cursor on that video and right-click on it. Hit the “Uniform Speed” option from the displayed list and direct toward the right-side editing panel. There, use the “Speed” slider and slow down the video as required. Move downward and extend the “AI Frame Interpolation” menu to pick the “Optical Flow.”

![reduce speed and set ai frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/gopro-slow-motion-with-quality-7.jpg)

Many users are unaware of the latest video editing software, Wondershare Filmora. It is an AI-powered platform that has proven to be better than **GoPro slow-motion**, as discussed above.
