## Part 2 How to Prepare Slideshows in PowerPoint

Learning **how to do a slideshow in PowerPoint** is a relatively simple process that anyone can accomplish.

Ready to make aslideshow? Let us get you started.

Step 1: Create New Presentation

To do so:

**●** Go to your browser and click on the PowerPoint icon.

**●** When PowerPoint opens, go to the upper left-hand corner and choose "File," then "New," listed under "File."

**●** Choose "New Presentation" from the drop-down menu, which will create a new slide show for you to begin uploading photos to.

![Create New Presentation ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/how-to-add-slideshow-in-powerpoint-6.jpg)

Step 2: Save PowerPoint

Go to the top right-hand side of the presentation screen and click on the flash drive icon. After that, you'll be able to name your presentation and pick where to save it.

Remember to save your presentation after something that will remind you of the images in the File. This act will make it easier for you to find them later.

![Save PowerPoint ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/how-to-add-slideshow-in-powerpoint-7.jpg)

Step 3: Name the Page

Consider a title and type it in the box. Your title page can include a name, date, or image.

Choose an image-friendly arrangement, such as a slide with a title box and an image box, a slide with only an image box, or even a blank slide.

![Name the Page](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/how-to-add-slideshow-in-powerpoint-8.jpg)

Step 4: Add Slides

You can choose from a variety of slide layouts and visuals. You can select "New Slide" from either "Home" or "Insert." You may also right-click any slide in the left-hand panel and select "New Slide." \[1\]
