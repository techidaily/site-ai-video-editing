This is great for those who are creating YouTube shorts or simply looking to play with the slow-motion effects in their content. Now while talking about such edits, Canva is one such name that comes to mind.

It is a popular video editor and graphic designer you probably have heard of. Canva has tons of built-in functions, accompanied by an intuitive layout that users can't get enough of. However, in terms of things like video speed-ups, it can get a bit complicated.

Unfortunately, at the time of writing, there are no known features in which you can speed up the video in Canva. However, there are some alternative methods for archiving sped-up videos.

### An Ultimate Guide to Speed Up a Canva Video

![how to speed up a video on canvas](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-speed-up-video-in-canva-2.jpg)

##### Step1Create a New Video Project with Canva

1) Head over to Canva's official webpage and open a new video project through the "**Create**" button in the top right corner.

![how to speed up canva video 1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-speed-up-video-in-canva-3.png)

##### Step2Upload Your Speed Up Canva Video on the Console

1) Now, you can either upload your video project into the console through the "**Upload**" tab or use the provided video templates from the "**Videos**" section.

![how to speed up canva video 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-speed-up-video-in-canva-4.png)

2) Once that's done, drag and drop your clip on the timeline and adjust it according to your requirements.

![how to speed up canva video 3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-speed-up-video-in-canva-5.png)

_Hit preview once you are comfortable with video positioning_

##### Step3Download the Non-speed Up Video in Canva

After previewing the clip, you will soon realize that your video is going too slow and needs to be adjusted. Unfortunately, no feature as of right now could directly fix the issue. It needs to be revamped in a third-party program requiring video download.

1) To download the original video in Canva, move your cursor to the top and select the "**share**" button.

![change video speed in canva 1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-speed-up-video-in-canva-6.png)

2) Before you download the file, make sure that you have the MP4 format selected.

![change video speed in canva 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-speed-up-video-in-canva-7.png)

##### Step4Use Third-Party Software (Eizgif) to Change Video Speed In Canva

1) Once you've downloaded your video file onto the system, open a new browser tab and search for [Eizgif](https://ezgif.com/video-speed) (or related speed-up video in the Canva tool). Now upload the same video on the given window.

![change video speed in canva 3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-speed-up-video-in-canva-8.png)

2) After the clip has been uploaded, a new tab will open up. Here you will find an option named "**multiplier**." Changing its value from greater than **one** will make your video move fast.

![change video speed in canva image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-speed-up-video-in-canva-9.png)

3) Adjustust the desired multiplier value and select "**change video speed**."

![change video speed in canva tool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-speed-up-video-in-canva-10.png)

_Eizgif also gives you the freedom to adjust sound, if your video has any_

##### Step5Re-upload the Speed-Up Video In Canva Editor

1) When you feel like your video has a perfect speed, save it in your system directory.

![canva video speed up](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-speed-up-video-in-canva-11.png)

2) Now re-upload your changed video speed in Canva and drag it onto the timeline through the "**Videos**" tab.

![video canva fast speed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-speed-up-video-in-canva-12.png)

3) Review the clip and notice the enhanced video speed from the Canva editor when it's done.

![filmora speed and duration](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-speed-up-video-in-canva-13.png)

_So technically, you can change video speed in Canva, but the process can be time-consuming, especially for starters._
