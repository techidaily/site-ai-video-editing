One of its many specifications is that it is an elite background remover and replacement. It enables a seamless addition of the sky in the background. We have mentioned the step-by-step procedure of **After Effects replace Sky** below:

### Procedure 1: Removing Video Background

**Step 1:** After bringing your video to the timeline, navigate towards the top search bar at the left. In the Effects Control option, search for the "Extractor" effect and add it. Then, change the "Channel" of this effect to your "Blue" or "Luminance." Change the position of both sliders there to remove and feather the background.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

**Step 2:** To avoid removing parts other than the sky, duplicate this video to the timeline. From the bottom video, eliminate the extractor effect. Navigate towards the top toolbar and select the "Mask" option. Create a mask around the ground at the bottom of the video. In the timeline, click the "Mask Path" option to create the mask throughout the video.

### Procedure 2: 3D Camera Tracking

**Step 1:** Now, duplicate the video again on the timeline and remove all its effects. Afterward, add a "3D Camera Tracker" in it. Then click "Analyze" and let the tracker analyze your video.

![activate 3d tracking for mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/replace-sky-background-in-after-effects-5.jpg)

### Procedure 3: Replacing the Sky

**Step 1:** Import the video of your sky and bring it to the timeline. Bring the sky in the back of your footage and change it to a 3D layer. Afterward, change the "Position" of your sky from the timeline. We recommend you set the values as far away as possible for realistic effect.

![adjust the position of sky](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/replace-sky-background-in-after-effects-7.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

**Step 2:** Once you have set the sky's position, navigate towards the timeline panel again. From there, change the "Scale" of the background to set according to your footage. Afterward, see if the sky needs any flipping. This is because you must align the bright parts of the sky with the bright parts of the ground.

![adjust the scale of sky](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/replace-sky-background-in-after-effects-8.jpg)

### Procedure 4: Color Matching

**Step 1:** Play with the color setting elements like "Saturation" or "Lightness." Change the position of their sliders to observe the changes in your footage.

![do basic color corrections](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/replace-sky-background-in-after-effects-9.jpg)

**Step 2:** Right-click on the timeline and add "New > Adjustment Layer" for settling colors. Afterward, see the preview of your video and export it.
