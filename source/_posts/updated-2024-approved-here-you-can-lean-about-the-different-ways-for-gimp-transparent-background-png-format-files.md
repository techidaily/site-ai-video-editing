## Part 3: Zoom In and Out on Discord Website

If you are using the web version of Discord, there are multiple ways to zoom in. On your native web browser, you can access the ellipses icon at the right and find the “Zoom” option. From here, you can simply click on the “+” icon to zoom in and the “-” icon to zoom out on the page you have opened at the moment.

If you prefer to change the Zoom settings using Discord’s native settings, you can easily do so in the web version using keyboard shortcuts. Here is an in-depth guide indicating **how to zoom out in Discord** for the online version.

**Step 1:** Launch the web browser on your computer and open the online version of the Discord software. You might be asked to sign in to your profile at this point.

![open discord on browser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/zoom-in-and-out-discord-10.jpg)

**Step 2:** Once you are at the homepage of your Discord profile, you can access the keyboard shortcuts to zoom in or out. To zoom in on Discord, simply hold the "CTRL" key on your keyboard and click the "+" icon key. Each click of the key will result in a 10% increase in the zoom level of the screen.
