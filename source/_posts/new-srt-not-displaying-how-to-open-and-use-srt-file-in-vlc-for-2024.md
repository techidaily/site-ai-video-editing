## Part 2: Possible Causes of SRT Subtitles Not Working Properly in VLC

While users can **add subtitles to VLC** since the player supports SRT extension files, some issues can cause them not to appear. Here are some potential causes of the error.

**SRT files corrupted or empty**

In case the SRT file you are trying to access is corrupted or does not contain any content, that will not open in the VLC media player.

**The subtitles setting in VLC Media Player is not turned on**

Sometimes, the SRT files are password protected or only work on video players that allow permission for it to play. So, if you have not enabled SRT access in the settings of the app, the SRT-formatted text will not appear.

**Doesn’t update VLC to the latest version**

In cases when the VLC Media Player itself is corrupted or outdated, it cannot allow access to some subtitle formats. You must upgrade it to the latest official version to allow video and SRT file support.

**Wrong encoding instead of UTF-8**

VLC player app only allows the SRT files that have UTF-8 encoding to play on the platform. Users can view the SRT files on videos if they are using the right encoded text, so make sure that you do not have the wrong encoded file.

**Other unknown bugs**

Other issues can cause the defect to the VLC player and, therefore, cannot open the **VLC SRT file.** These include certain unknown bugs and malware- make sure to check your system to find the errors.

## Best Way To Color Grading & Color Correction in Filmora

As a post-production analysis of the filmed video, you might have noticed how the color contrast in a real VS reel. The colors do not appear bright and robust on a screen as in real life.

While there are numerous reasons for the dull, uninviting look- a basic edit could fix it quickly. One of the vital, if not the first, steps in the process is color grading and color correction. However, what exactly are color grading and color correction? And how can they help fix the color ratios and balance in a video?

This article covers everything you need to know about color grading and correction and a complete guide to adjusting cinematic colors with the best video editor, Wondershare Filmora. So, without much ado, let's dig into it!

## Part 1\. Color Grading VS Color Correction

These terms have often been used interchangeably; people consider them synonymous. However, they are two different artistic phenomena to adjust the color scheme.

Since we will discuss them in detail later, here is a brief description. Put simply, color correcting is a corrective procedure, while color grading is a cinematic adjustment.

Color correction diverts the colors to a relatively neutral baseline achieving a unified look for all captured shots. On the other hand, color grading is inclined more toward a creative look aimed at balancing colors that reflect the emotion of the sequence.

![color correction vs color grading](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/color-correction-vs-color-grading.gif)

These two work hand in hand to dramatically uplift the overall look of the sequence. Let's delve deeper into these techniques and see how to use them.

## Part 2\. What Is Color Correction?

We will start with color correction- the first step in color editing. Even with a slight glance at the raw shots, you can notice how much the tones are messed up. The crude product is oversaturated with colors.

Color correction is about making the shots look as natural as possible. It brings the sequences to the neutral baseline to achieve a unified look.

For now, we need to ignore our creative and aesthetic preferences and focus entirely on exposure and white balance. The actual end goal is to keep the colors true to life.

However, color-correcting a video is challenging if you are a beginner. There needs to be more than just understanding the fundamentals; it requires cinematic and technical skills.

Here is the basic process for a clean, color-corrected shot, irrespective of the software you use.

### Essential Steps for Color Correcting a Shot

##### 1\. Set the color profile

Different video formats (HDR, LOG, RAW, HLG, etc.) have different exposure content. Therefore, select a color profile that matches your video format for the best results before starting.

##### 2\. Adjust the saturation

It is the primary step of color correction. Often the exposure of raw content is high. Next, equalize the saturation for a natural look.

##### 3\. Fix the contrast

Contrast is the difference between the light and dark areas of the image. Pictures with a higher contrast are sharper and more detailed.

However, adjust the contrast during color correcting so that the dark areas are not crushed, and you preserve the details maximally.

##### 4\. Set the white balance

It is time to adjust the white balance with the saturation and contrast fixed. The colors will shift to orange and blue hues if it is maladjusted.

Use the color curves to ensure pure whites so all colors fall correctly in place.

##### 5\. Double-check individual color tones

The final step is a secondary checking of the individual colors. Double-check the skin tones so they match in each shot.

Make sure the skin tones match their natural hues for an authentic, unfiltered look.

It is a basic walkthrough for color-correcting. More steps can vary according to the professional demands of the video. However, as a beginner, this is the best process to follow.

Once we've corrected the color, it is time to move to the next and primary step- color grading.

## Part 3\. What Is Color Grading?

After you set all the tones to the baseline, you can start with the creative process of color grading. In this case, you do not change the colors anymore. Instead, you make artistic choices to change the moods and emotions of that particular sequence. Color grading is about manipulating the colors and contrasts that intensify the visual tone and explain your story to the world.

Color correction can be enough if you want to keep the video realistic. However, color grading is essential if you want to imply emotions and feelings in your content. Following is an essential step-by-step guide to color grading.

### Basic Steps of Color Grading

If you are a beginner, the color grading process can be tricky without expertise. Hence here are the basic steps of color grading a video.

##### 1\. Color correcting

Correcting the colors and balance will always be the first step before you can color-grade footage. Next, the video must be normalized and should seem natural before you intensify the overall look.

##### 2\. Match the colors

In the next step, we balance the contours between color-corrected footage and color grading. Then, you can use LUTs (Look Up Tables) to match the individual colors to the scheme.

##### 3\. Shot-to-shot matching

The next integral step is to match the colors between all the shots so we can achieve a unified look. The contrasting appearance of shots can make them look unprofessional and poorly cinematic.

##### 4\. Adjust the mood and emotions

A well-executed color grading can potentiate the emotions in a shot. Use your artistic choices and tools from editing software to imply the director's feelings in the video.

##### 5\. Make the final adjustments

As the final opportunity, tweak hues and chroma to ensure the colors match your palette in each scene. But, again, do not overdo anything, and play with colors to nudge the moods in the shot.

If your footage is the cake, color grading is the cherry on top that enhances the final look. You can instantly evoke connotations and bring the audience to a different page with some professional color grading.

However, while color correcting and grading, there are a few things that you should take care of. Here is a list of some To-do's and Not To-do's in the post-production edit.

## Part 4\. Things To Consider About the Editing Environment

Before you begin color-grading or color-correcting, here are some essential things to consider that can dramatically improve the results.

##### 1\. Neutral editing environment

Funky neon lights or fluorescent lights in the background can dominate your vision. As compensation, you will be over-saturating your footage with colors.

Make sure to use only white, neutral light with a CRI (color rendering Index) of at least 90\. It will decrease inconsistencies as much as possible.

##### 2\. Using might shifts/orange screen

People often activate night shifts or orange screens to protect their eyes from excessive strain. Resultantly, the screen appears dull and orange-y.

Since this alters the actual colors of the video, the results are undermined. So make sure to turn off all technologies that can sabotage the grading.

##### 3\. Control the light

It is necessary to control the amount of light that enters your working space area. Excessive light alters your color perception and hence obstructs achieving a balanced contour.

Ensure that the light does not directly falls on the screen or your eyes. You must maintain an adequate distance from the screen to see nuances as you grade.

After completing all the fundamentals of color correcting and color grading, let's demonstrate how to do it in real-time.

The gaming world is ever-changing, with developers looking to create innovative ways to immerse players into their digital worlds. One such technology that has begun to sweep is **AI in the game industry**.

AI is a powerful tool in many ways to improve the gaming experience. It can make **artificial intelligence in computer games** more believable and add replayability and immersion to games, and we can expect to see even more impressive applications in the future.

01 [What Is AI in Gaming?](#Part 1)

02 [Why Does AI in Gaming Matter?](#Part 2)

03 [How AI Will Completely Change Video Games](#Part 3)

04 [8 Games with Incredible Artificial Intelligence](#Part 4)

05 [What AI Video Games Assets Do Filmora Have?](#Part 5)

## Part 1 **What Is AI in Gaming?**

In simple terms, AI is a set of algorithms that allow a computer to learn and improve from experience. Although you can apply it in many ways, **artificial intelligence in video games** is usually helpful to create more intelligent and more believable non-player characters (NPCs).

For example, an AI system might be helpful to determine how an NPC reacts to the player's actions. If the player tries to steal from an NPC, the AI might make the NPC angry and more likely to attack the player. Alternatively, if the player is friendly to an NPC, the **AI game playing** might make the NPC more likely to help the player in future interactions.

## Part 2 **Why Does AI in Gaming Matter?**

One of the most vital aspects of **AI in video games** is that it can make games more believable and immersive for players. When games can convincingly simulate human-like behavior, it can be a much more enjoyable experience for gamers. AI can make NPCs seem more lifelike and make the game world feel more believable.

AI is also becoming increasingly important for creating procedural content. This is where the game generates content on its own, rather than relying on pre-made assets. For example, a game might use procedural generation to create random dungeons or quests that the player can explore. This can add a lot of replayability to a game, as the player never knows what they will encounter next.

## Part 3 **How AI Will Completely Change Video Games**

It is not a secret that AI is changing the world as we know it. With its ability to enable computers to learn and improve from experience, AI is paving the way for a future where machines can handle more complex tasks. And nowhere is this more apparent than in the world of video gaming.

In the past, developers brought in AI primarily for simple things like making certain NPCs (non-player characters) move and act realistically. But now, **artificial intelligence in video games** is being used for much more complex tasks like generating procedural content and creating believable human-like behavior. This results in a new generation of **AI game playing** that are more immersive and playable.

If the player tries to steal from an NPC, the AI might make the NPC angry and more likely to attack the player. Alternatively, if the player is friendly to an NPC, the **AI game playing** might make the NPC more likely to help the player in future interactions.

## Part 2 **Why Does AI in Gaming Matter?**

One of the most vital aspects of **AI in video games** is that it can make games more believable and immersive for players. When games can convincingly simulate human-like behavior, it can be a much more enjoyable experience for gamers. AI can make NPCs seem more lifelike and make the game world feel more believable.

AI is also becoming increasingly important for creating procedural content. This is where the game generates content on its own, rather than relying on pre-made assets. For example, a game might use procedural generation to create random dungeons or quests that the player can explore. This can add a lot of replayability to a game, as the player never knows what they will encounter next.

## Part 3 **How AI Will Completely Change Video Games**

It is not a secret that AI is changing the world as we know it. With its ability to enable computers to learn and improve from experience, AI is paving the way for a future where machines can handle more complex tasks. And nowhere is this more apparent than in the world of video gaming.

In the past, developers brought in AI primarily for simple things like making certain NPCs (non-player characters) move and act realistically. But now, **artificial intelligence in video games** is being used for much more complex tasks like generating procedural content and creating believable human-like behavior. This results in a new generation of **AI game playing** that are more immersive and playable.

## Part 4   **Games with Incredible Artificial Intelligence**

Now, we will look into eight video games that signify why we need the **best ai in video games.**

### 01**Fallout 4**

One of the most attractive examples of **AI in video gaming** is Fallout 4\. This post-apocalyptic RPG features some of the most believable NPCs ever seen in a game. Each character is fully voiced, and they all have their unique personalities and backstories. The AI generates procedural content, meaning that the game world is always different each time you play.

### 04**Minecraft**

Minecraft is a game that heavily uses procedural generation to create its content.

### 06**Mirror’s Edge Catalyst**
