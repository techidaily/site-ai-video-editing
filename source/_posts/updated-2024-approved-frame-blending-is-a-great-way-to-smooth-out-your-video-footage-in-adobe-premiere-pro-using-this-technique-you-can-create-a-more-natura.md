**Frame blending** is a video editing technique used to create smooth transitions between two video frames. This process is often used to create special effects or transition between two different video clips. Frame blending can be done manually or with the help of software.

When **frame blending** is done manually, the editor will take two consecutive frames and blend them. This is done by using a process called cross-fading. Cross-fading is when the first frame gradually fades out while the second frame gradually fades in. The result is a seamless transition between the two frames.

Frame blending can also be done with the help of software. Many software programs offer frame blending capabilities Like Adobe Premiere Pro and more. These software programs typically have a user interface that allows the user to select the two frames that they want to blend. The software will then perform the cross-fading process automatically.

We've compiled easy steps on applying effects in Premiere Pro to be of assistance.

## Part 2\. How to Add Effects in Premier Pro

### Add Transition Effects

There are several transition effects in Adobe Premiere Pro, and there are countless ways to customize them to fit your film. It is quite easy to locate transitions and add them. The Effects panel, which is accessible from the very top options bar, contains all the transition options. A panel will show up on the right when you choose this. To include a transition, adhere to these procedures.

* Navigate to the Video Transitions area of the Effects panel.

![transition effects in pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/transition-effects-in-pr.jpg)

* Select the desired transition type from any of the available ones When you wish to employ a transition, press and hold it before dragging it to the start or finish of the clip. Alternately, insert it in between two clips to serve as a transition between the start and finish of each.

![drag and apply transitions pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/drag-and-apply-transitions-pr.jpg)

* In Premiere, there are several possible transitions, and some can be more suitable for your project than others.

### Add Visual Effects

The Essential Graphics panel was added by Adobe to Premiere Pro. Users now have a much different workflow than they had with the few prior title panels. Now that everything is in one panel, you can easily create, animate, and use VFX. Some of the VFX shots were just building miniature towns and adding pieces, while others involved the standard green screen removal and backdrop replacement.

* Simply importing and uploading your video and audio files into Premiere Pro is the first step. The procedure of clicking through is fairly simple. Choose "New Project." Press the Media Browser panel button and find the Ultra Key tool by opening the Effects panel.

![press meida browser](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/press-meida-browser.jpg)

* The film clip with the green screen should have the Ultra Key added. Utilizing the matte creation and matte cleaning tools, remove the green screen using the ultra key effect. When softening, be cautious to eliminate any sharp edges. All of this can be adjusted under the Effects Control panel.

![ultra key effect pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/ultra-key-effect-pr.jpg)

* Put your backdrop material behind your green screen clip after you have a clear key. You should now be able to view your backdrop behind the keyed layer.

### Add Text Effects

There are many justifications for include text in your video. It has the ability to reach a bigger audience and is a fantastic example of cross-media integration. We must be able to write text since it is such a crucial component of video production. Learning how to add text in Adobe Premiere is quite simple; here's an example:

* Select the type tool from the tool window. To add text, click the backdrop and then type. The segment includes a music titled visuals.

![click the backdrop and type](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/click-the-backdrop-and-type.jpg)

* Head over to the Effect controls panel. under the Text Tab. The text's font and color can be changed. Decide on a place. Use the Effect Controls panel if you want to add some simple motion to your text. Motion may be added here. You can make rolling credits at the conclusion of your movie or add a rotating effect to your titles using the Properties window as shown below.

![effects control panel pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/effects-control-panel-pr.jpg)

* To Fine-Tune the Text Effects, go to Window > Effect Controls You can see all of the effects I changed in the Essential Graphics panel using this panel. A graphic layer will instantly reflect and be highlighted in the Effect Controls panel when clicked on in the Essential Graphics panel, and vice versa.

### Add Audio Effects

It's simple to work with audio with Premiere Pro. By selecting Clip > Audio Options > Audio Gain (or by hitting "G" on your keyboard), you may fast change audio levels. By adding keyframes to the audio clips in your sequence, you can also get greater audio control.

* First, equalize the audio. You have thus eliminated your stutters and the buzz from the audio track of your speaker. You may use the Parametric Equalizer effect under Effects > Audio Effects to give your voices a last boost of clarity and flow.

![audio effects panel pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/audio-effects-panel-pr.jpg)

* Click on your clip and choose Effect Controls > Custom Setup > Edit to make more customizations.

![new sequence standard](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/new-sequence-standard.jpg)

* Make use of the vocal enhancer. In the dropdown menu of your parametric equalizer, choose vocal enhancement. Next, adjust your frequencies upward and downward until everything sounds good.

![vocal enhancer pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/vocal-enhancer-pr.jpg)

* In Adobe Premiere Pro, a crossfade is used as the audio transition by default. Use them to join audio files together, provide a smooth transition from opening to closing credits, or add and remove sounds as required. Select Audio Transitions > Crossfade from the Effects menu.

![crossfade audio transitions pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/crossfade-audio-transitions-pr.jpg)

* For fine-tuning your audio, go to Preferences > Timeline > Audio Transition Default to finish. To polish your audio, use duration.

### Presets Effects

Presets for Adobe Premiere Pro CC can be a useful tool while editing videos. They eliminate the need for constant manual adjustment by enabling the user to rapidly and simply apply effects, transitions, and other intricate settings. You may utilize effect presets to give your video clips effects. This is a fantastic way to give your project some flare and originality!

* After adjusting the effect to your liking, right-click the name and choose Save Preset. Your own effects are kept by default by Premiere Pro CC in the Presets folder of your Effects Window.

![save preset from color balance](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/save-preset-from-color-balance.jpg)

* Right-click the effect preset and choose "Preset Properties..." to alter the Name, Type, or Description of the preset. This option can also be found in the pop-up menu for the Effects panel.

![preset properities pr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/preset-properities-pr.jpg)

* Editors using Premiere Pro may export and share effect presets. This includes changes to the speed, opacity, and motion!

## Using Montage In Movies | Learn to Use Montage With Movies

As with many new things in life, Montage isn't your best friend right off the bat. So, if you want to learn to use montages with movies, they need to be the right ones. If you don't know what Montage is, it is a way of compressing an action or series of actions into a short amount of time. We look at movies because they are a common type of entertainment everyone has seen before, which makes them easier to understand as a concept.

Using Montage is a great way to create engaging video content. There are many people interested in the topic of Montage, so if you get that video out there, you can easily find an audience. When used in conjunction with YouTube advertising, creating videos about Montage could be an excellent business idea for you.

Learning how to use Montage properly can be challenging. The process isn't intuitive, and using it can feel like hiding random pieces around your page. But, when you watch the right movies, they can help you understand how to use this tool effectively. So, take some time, check out these movies, and learn how to get the most out of Montage!

## What Is A Montage?

The definition of a montage is a "series of short scenes or episodes forming a unified whole." That definition can lead to different interpretations of a montage and can be applied to any art medium. A "montage" isn't just for movies. Music artists use montages to tell stories that often describe their emotions and experiences; writers create poetry and prose contained in such an artistic form, and painters often use this art form. However, many people are most familiar with the term associated with movies: a montage is essentially a collection of images or scenes that populate a movie with music.

If you've seen any blockbuster Hollywood films in the last ten years, you've probably seen some Montage. The Montage is a sequence that takes place over a set period and shows us how the lead character goes from being an ordinary person to an extraordinary one. The difference between these two states is dramatic, so we see so many montages in movies. They are meant to grab your attention and excitingly introduce a character.

## Purpose of Montage

Montage movies are made up of a compilation of short yet powerful scenes put together to make one movie or project. Even though these types of movies have become a common genre, there's a list of reasons why this is popular in movies today.

* Montage has several uses in movies. Of course, Montage can be used to show events such as battles or dancing. It can also describe emotions, including sadness, happiness, and sarcasm. These different uses of Montage do come with their styles, but they all share a few common traits.
* They're often used to condense periods of storytime into much smaller but more entertaining segments. The word montage is French for "to construct from many parts ."Montages can now be seen everywhere in film and television, from silent films to blockbuster action movies.
* This is frequently used in narratives when the story needs to advance quickly. The characters are going somewhere or doing something else not within the context of the moment in time that represents them. A great example of a montage was used in Rocky when Rocky was training for his fight with Apollo Creed.
* A montage allows filmmakers to explore a theme using several sequential shots that can't be covered in a single shot.

## Learn To Use Montage With These Movies
