## Tips for Choosing Location & Scheduling Music Video

Making viral music videos is everyone's dream; what if you get exact tips to follow before shooting your music video to make it high-ranked? Obviously, it'll be a treat for you!

Planning and preparing before the shoot is the key to making a music video successful. You can only achieve this after location scouting and emerging with the best one. And scheduling for big projects before the day is more important. Let's directly move towards the things to consider before shooting!

## Location scouting

The pleasant and eye-catchy location always makes your music video trending or flopping. You should first go with your budget and then come up with location ideas. In the upcoming tip, we will use 3lau's song "Tokyo" as an example.

If you are going with large projects, you need to consider the following requirements!

### 1\. Availability of electricity

You need rig lights and a large lighting setup to make your video more glow and give them aesthetic vibes. For this, make sure you choose a location where light is readily available.

### 2\. Separate room

During shooting for big projects, you need room to store all gear and sensitive equipment in one place for many days.

### 3\. Check the size

The foremost thing in choosing the location is to check the Height and Width of the studio. They should be enough to rig the lights in the studio easily and place every required thing in a decided space.

For Example, while shooting a 3lau song, there is a need for a bus to come into the studio easily, but there is an issue in entering the bus due to height issues of the door. Due to this, the director changed the location at the spot to sort out this issue.

The weather is also a major factor when shooting a video, which you must check before the shoot days. After selecting and scouting the location, now it's time to make a schedule which you'll get in hand in the below lines!

## Scheduling for the Music Video

If you have a big project and more scenes to shoot, it's better to make a whole plan about each and everything. You have to make a schedule of using even a single light at a specific time and space. The following are the main considerations you should take care of!

### 1\. Pre-Rig Day

You need to come to the setup before the filming day to check the main things like electricity, measure exact spaces, check the lightning setup, loaded everything such as the bus, crew, and gears.

### 2\. A Call Sheet

A call sheet is a daily shot list given to the cast and crew to follow the timelines, and it contains the phone number of everyone, their location, and the time to arrive on set. It also includes the nearest hospital, sunset, and sun-rising timing.

![call sheet of tokyo song](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/call-sheet-of-tokyo-song.jpg)

It consists of one to two pages according to shoot days and has a plan of everything that happens after the Pre-Rig day.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** When you wrap up for day 1, you have another call sheet for day 2, day 3, and so on!

### 3\. Do Planning

You need to work efficiently and smartly to maintain everything according to the plan. You can cut the filming into halves to have a better lighting setup and character availability. On the shot day, you must change the lighting and rigging setup as little as possible.

**Examples**

On day 1 of the Tokyo song, the filming is done in two halves; the first half day goes towards filming everything in the bus, and the other half day, there is a shoot of everything outside the bus.

While in day 2, there is a filming of every memory. For this, there are setups of rooms and homes for making perfect shots according to the requirements of a music video.

### 4\. Take No Stress

You should not blow up and take stress during shoot day because it'll obviously cause chaos in every little scene and give a bad impression to the music video. You just should work hard and get all done.

## Conclusion

After checking and following the above tips for location scouting and scheduling, you'll obviously come up with an amazing filming setup and music video. There is no need to worry, just get the whole planning and then do all scenes one after the other patiently.

Filming with people is not always bulky and flopping, but if you have a cooperative team and follow all the timelines of shooting. Then you'll rock the music video!

## Vintage Film Effect 1990S - How to Make

In the 90s, movie production technology improved a lot. This decade saw horror movies become much more fun and immersive than in the 80s and 50s because they were more psychological. In fact, we can say that the horror movies of the 90s laid the foundation for current horror movies. So, without wasting time, let's create a 1990s horror movie similar to The Blair Witch Project.

## Preparation

![1990s vintage scene](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/1990s-vintage-scene.gif)

The preparation for this horror film production is relatively self-explanatory if you've watched The Blair Witch Project. Simply shoot footage inside a dark room and apply some light to your face. It's even better if you can shoot the video inside the woods. Just add some drama and a few screaming scenes to evoke emotions.

## Part II. Tips for Speeding Up Video in Final Cut Pro

You have to keep a few points in mind when you speed up videos in Final Cut Pro. This ensures that the video does not get distorted while speeding up a section. Here are some tips to follow to speed up the video in FCP.

**Adjust The Pitch of Sped-Up Clips -**

By default, Final Cut Pro preserves the pitch of the audio even when you change the speed of the video. However, you may want to change the pitch per the video's speed. This is because you might want to make the audio sound funny. You need to turn off the Preserve Pitch option from Retime menu. Once you do that, the pitch of the sped-up clip adjusts itself as per the change in speed.

**Speeding Up Video by Adjusting Frame Rate -**

You can shoot at a low frame rate for the scene you want to speed up. The frame rate should be lower than the overall video project's frame rate.

You can add the scene to your video project on the timeline. Then you need to choose Automatic Speed from Retime menu. This will increase the frame rate from the scene to the video project frame rate. Once the frame rate increases, the video will speed up automatically.

**Smoothen Out the Sped-Up Video -**

Sometimes, the overall video may look old when you speed up a particular portion. That is why there are two options available on Final Cut Pro. The first option is frame blending which is more suitable for the slow-motion clip.

The second option is the optical flow that smoothens out the sped-up clip. It adds in-between frames by analyzing the directional movement of pixels. You can find the option from Video Quality present in the Retime menu.

### Method 1\. The Simplest Way - Click "2x-100x" Speed Options

Just like Final Cut Pro, you can choose from preset speed options to change video speed. This is undoubtedly the easiest way to change video speed instantly. While Final Cut Pro offers 2X to 20X speed options, Filmora has 2X to 100X speed presets. Here are the steps to speed up video by choosing a preset speed option.

Step1 Download, install and simply Launch Filmora. Tap Create New Project option.

![install and simply launch filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-up-video-with-final-cut-pro-8.jpg)

Step2 Go to File> Import Media> Import Media Files and choose the video file. The selected video will be imported into the Project Media folder. Alternatively, you can also use the drag/drop function.

![the project media folder](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-up-video-with-final-cut-pro-9.jpg)

Step3 Drag and drop the video file onto the timeline. Select the video clip from the timeline and click on the Speed (timer icon) option at the top of the timeline. If you want to speed up a portion of the video, you need to split the video clip.

![split the video clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-up-video-with-final-cut-pro-10.jpg)

Step4 From the menu, go to Fast and select any speed option as per your requirements. Thereafter, play the video to see the changes.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Method 2\. Use Uniform Speed to Change Speed

If you want to customize the video speed uniformly, there is a dedicated option called Uniform Speed in Filmora. This means you do not want to choose from the preset speed options. You may want to set the speed of the video to 3X, but it is not available in the preset options.

That is where Uniform Speed comes in handy, and you can set any speed from 0.01X to 100X. Here are the steps to follow.

Step1 Once you have dropped the video file onto the timeline, click on the Speed(timer) icon.

Step2 Click on the Uniform Speed option. This will open the Uniform Speed tab above the timeline.

![uniform speed option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-up-video-with-final-cut-pro-12.jpg)

Step3 Adjust the speed slider to set the desired speed as per your requirements. The duration will change as per the speed you set, and you can set the duration below the speed slider. Just like Final Cut Pro, you can turn on Ripple and Audio Pitch as per your preference.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-up-video-with-final-cut-pro-13.jpg)

Step4 Once you are satisfied with the speed, click on the Ok button. Thereafter, tap Export to save the edited video file.

### Method 3\. Use Speed Ramping to Change Speed

There is a unique way to change your video speed called speed ramping. You can speed up some parts and slow down the other parts, like crests and troughs in a graph.

The speed ramping feature comes with several graphical presets. You can choose from the presets and customize the speed as per your requirements. Check the steps to use speed ramping to change your video speed.

Step1 Drag and drop the video file onto the timeline. Click on the Speed(timer) icon at the top of the timeline.

Step2 Click on Speed Ramping option. This will open Speed Ramping above the timeline.

![click on speed ramping option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-up-video-with-final-cut-pro-14.jpg)

Step3 Select from the available preset as per your requirements. Otherwise, you can select Customize option and edit the nodes as needed.
