## What is Masking?

Masks are a feature of editing software that allows you to choose a particular portion of the video or utilize video overlays to hide, duplicate, reveal, or change your footage.

The mask then becomes isolated, and you may modify it as desired to produce your intended effect.

Masks may be used to do some fantastic things with your videos. You can clone people or objects, overlay several pictures, create glitch effects, blur faces out, etc. Masks add a lot of excitement and color to videos, making them more dynamic, enjoyable to watch, and professional. It can draw attention - and keep it!

### Different types of masking

Rotoscoping: Rotoscoping is the process of manually tracing an object in a video frame by frame to create a mask. This can be a time-consuming process, but it allows for very precise control over the masked area.

Chroma-keying: Chroma-keying is a type of masking that makes use of color to isolate a particular area of the frame. For example, this is often used to remove a green or blue screen from the footage, but can also be used to isolate other colors.

Motion tracking: Motion tracking is a masking technique that allows you to track the movement of an object in a video clip. This is often used to add special effects, such as explosions, to a video.

### 03**Premiere Pro**

Here is a step-by-step guide on how to Freeze-frame in Premiere Pro using a video frame for the duration of a clip:

Step 1: Download Premiere Pro
