## Wondering How to Add Custom Transitions in OBS Studio? Here Are the Steps to Add Stinger Transitions to OBS. Get a Better OBS Alternative to Add Transitions

OBS Studio is an open-source video editor that is widely popular for live streaming on online platforms. Even though OBS is a completely free application, its features are comparable to any premium video editor. We always look for available transition effects in a video editor and OBS takes it to the next level by allowing users to add custom transitions.

Among custom transitions, Stinger transitions have gained a lot of traction from the users. Stinger transitions are made popular by sports channels who use Stinger frequently whenever there is a change in the scene. We will illustrate how to add custom transitions in OBS and apply Stinger transitions in your video.

## Part 1\. What is Stinger in OBS

Stinger is a special type of customized animated video transition effect that is available in the latest version of OBS Studio. It is a combination of a transparent video animation and a cut transition. Stinger begins with the transparent video animation that grows into full-screen overlay, and it is followed by the cut transition. After the cut transition, you place the next scene or video clip. You will notice Stinger transition whenever sports channels show an instant replay during a live match.

The transparent video animation starts on top of the current video you are editing. When the animation expands and covers up the entire screen, you place the cut transition, and thereafter, you place the next video clip or scene as per your requirement. Some customized stinger effect also includes audio effects along with video effect.

## Part 2\. How to add stinger transitions to OBS

The Stinger transition is available on OBS Studio and Streamlabs, and both of them are open-source and free applications. Before you add stinger transition, you should have a video animation ready that you will play on top of the current video followed by the cut transition effect. You can download several stinger video animations from the internet and include any of them in OBS while adding stinger transition. Here are the steps on how to add a custom transition to OBS.

Step1 Go to Scene Transitions section and click on Effects option to open the drop-down menu.

Step2 From the drop-down menu, click on “Add: Stinger” option.

![add stinger obs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/add-stinger-obs.jpg)

Step3 Give a name to the Stinger transition and click Ok button.

![name stinger transition obs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/name-stinger-transition-obs.jpg)

Step4 You will see Properties window now. Click on Browser button against Video file and select the transparent video animation file that you want to play on top of the current video before applying the cut transition effect.

![apply cut transition effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/apply-cut-transition-effects.jpg)

Step5 For Transition Point Type, select Time(milliseconds) option. In the Transition Point field, add the duration of the transparent video animation so that the transition to the next scene takes place immediately after the video animation gets completed.

![select transition point field](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/select-transition-point-field.jpg)

Step6 If your video animation has audio, go to Audio Monitoring and select Monitor and Output option from the dropdown. For Audio Fade Style, you can select Crossfade option for better output.

![audio monitor output obs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/audio-monitor-output-obs.jpg)

Step7 Scroll down and click on Preview Transition button to check if the stinger transition is taking place as expected. You can adjust the transition point and other parameters to get it perfect.

## Part 2: Setting Up The Green Screen

Filming with the green screen is getting easier and easier. Anyone can do it, but before you get started, we will share some do's and don'ts to help you get the best results.

In fact, there are many ways to set up a green screen, but the most cost-efficient way is with a green screen fabric. If you are using a green fabric as a DIY green screen, make sure you steam or iron it out, whether taping it to a wall or hanging it off the rack. Keep in mind the green screen should not leave any wrinkles.

It is because wrinkles will make lighting the green screen a nightmare, and uneven lighting will leave you with shadows and disappointing results. It would help if you also pulled the green screen tight to get a seamless background. The better you do with the setup, the easier it will be the key it out later

## Part 3: Lighting a Green Screen

It doesn't matter how nice your green screen is. You won't get good results if you don't light it properly. When you light a green screen, be aware of these things.

* Make sure there are at least six feet of space between you and your green screen; therefore, you're not casting a shadow that cannot be keyed out later.
* Remember, any shadow on the green screen is bad. The lighting on the screen should be flat, even, and one-dimensional meaning. Please don't place the screen leaning at an angle since they'll make it harder to light evenly.
* Do light yourself and your background separately. It will ensure your subject wouldn't bleed into the green, which will create a halo around them.
* After you key out the green screen and lighting, your subjects should emulate the lighting from your final footage. For example, if you know sunlight is coming from the left light, your subject is from the left direction as well.

## Part 4\. Keying out your green screen

Once your footage is good, go into [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and import it into your timeline, then double-click it to find the chroma key menu. However, don't stop there. Clicking the chroma key button is not enough to guarantee perfectly keyed footage, so play around with the offset tolerance edge thickness and edge feather. Lastly, adjust it to make sure your edit looks as good as possible.
