## How to Add Selective Color Effect to Your Videos

Selective color is an effect that lets you desaturate all the colors in a photo or video while preserving one or more colors of your choice. It is done by isolating a specific color of your choice in the frame while all other colors turn into black and white, just like this.

## Tutorial 2 on make color isolation using eyedropper tool

You might ask how do we use the eyedropper tool here. It can sample colors from anywhere in a video or an image and add them to your swatch panel. The steps to use the eyedropper tool to add a selective color to your video are below.

Step1 As same as the first one, launching Wondershare Filmora is the first priority. And drag your clip to the timeline.

## Steps To Fade Audio In Premier Pro

Audio is a very big part of any video project and it can make or break the video project. This is why it is very important to not just choose a video editor that also offers audio editing, but one that is easy to use and offers a lot of editing options. This way, you can edit the audio in your project to suit your video's production and end up with a great professional final product.

One of the video editing tools that offer features that can accomplish all that is Adobe Premier Pro. In this article, we will look at how you can use Premier Pro to fade audio in or out.

## Steps to Fade Audio in Premier Pro

Premier Pro gives you two different options to fade audio in or out. Let's look at both options and then you can choose the one that suits you best;

### Fade Audio using Crossfade Audio Transition

Step1To begin, open Premier Pro on your computer and then open the audio that you want to edit.

Step2Once it is open, select the audio clip in the timeline and then click on “Sequence” at the top menu and select “Apply Audio Transition.”

![apply audio transition](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/apply-audio-transition.jpg)

You can also use the keyboard shortcut Shift + Command + D (macOS) or Shift+ Ctrl + D (PC). This will add the “Constant Power Cross Fade” effect at the beginning and the end of the clip.

Step3You can then just change the duration of the effect by simply dragging the end of the transition.

![add transitions premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/add-transitions-premiere.jpg)

### Fade Audio using Clip Keyframes

Step1Adobe Premier Pro has two volume keyframes; Track and Clip. Make the audio larger so you can see the volume line and then under the audio name, click on the volume keyframes option to make sure “Clip Keyframes” is enabled.

![clip keyframes premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/clip-keyframes-premiere.jpg)

Step2You can then press down on the Command Key (macOS) or the Control Key (PC) and drag the volume line down to add a fade-in or fade-out effect.

## Adobe Premiere Alternative Way to Fade Audio

If you are like most people and you find Adobe Premier Pro to be very difficult you use, we have a tool that is just as effective but also simplifies the process. This is the very simple to use [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

Just like Premier Pro, Filmora gives you two options to fade audio in and out. Let's look at both options;

**Adding Fade in and Out in Audio Pane**

Step1Download and install Wondershare Filmora onto your computer, open the program and then import the audio clip that you want to edit.

Step2Once the video has been added to the timeline, double-click on it to access the “Audio” editing panel.

Step3Here, you can very simply add the fade-in and fade-out effects by simply dragging the sliders to the desired duration or by manually entering the duration in seconds.

![add fade in or out effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/add-audio-fade-in-fade-out.jpg)

**Using the Audio Waveform**

You can also use the fade icons on the left and right edges of the audio waveform to quickly add a fade in and out.

To add a fade-in effect, drag the fade-in maker to the right. Then go to the end of the clip to drag the fade-out maker to the left to add a fade-out effect.

## Related FAQs about Audio Fade

### 1\. How Do I Fade to Black in Adobe Premiere Pro?

You can easily add the Fade to Black transition in Adobe Premiere Pro using the “Effects” tab. Just open the two clips in Premiere Pro and go to “Effects.” Type in “dip to black” in the search box and when you find the effect, drag it between the two clips in the timeline. The effect will appear on the right side of the project.

You also have several customization options that you can apply to the effect to get it just right. To see these options, go to Effect Controls and you should be able to change the alignment of the effect to “Center at Cut” so that the first video fades out to black before the second video appears.

### 2\. Premiere Pro Audio Fade Not Working?

Sometimes you can complete all the editing steps we have described above but you are unable to tell if the fade-in and fade-out effects are working because you can't play the audio in Premiere. This is a very common problem that can easily be fixed using the following troubleshooting steps;

Check the master volume on your computer to see if this is the problem

Then check the volume in Premiere to see if the audio meter is moving as you play the clip. It is the green bar usually in the lower right corner.

If your volume is fine but you still can't hear the audio, you may need to adjust several settings. Go to Edit > Preferences (on PC) or Preferences menu under the main Premiere Pro CC menu (macOS) and select “Audio Hardware” in the options that appear. You can then change the “Default Output” device to something else.

### 3\. How Do You do Audio Transitions in Premiere Pro

Adding audio transitions in Premiere Pro is very easy; just open the audio that you want to edit and then Right-click (PC) or Control- Click (macOS) on either the “Constant Gain” or “Constant Power” effect from the Effects panel. Then choose “Set Selected as Default Transition” from the options in the menu.

To add a duration for the audio transitions, go to Edit > Preferences > Timeline (PC) or Premiere Pro Menu > Preferences (macOS) and enter the duration value under “Audio Transition Default Duration.”

## How to Add a Spooky Shadow Effect

Whether you're a horror content creator or simply living the Halloween vibe 24/7, continue reading to know how to use its latest masking feature to create a cool shadow effect for your next mind-blowing social media video.

## How to Use The Masking Effect

[Wondershare Filmora's](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) latest Masking feature allows its users to select a specific clip that they can overlay on other parts of the video or other clips.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

The feature allows you to insert the mask in any shape, such as a rectangle, circle, or triangle. You can also import any shapes you like if you can't find them in the presets library. You can also adjust the mask placement, width, height, and feather effect.

Without further ado, let's see the detailed step-by-step guide for this effect.

### a. Preparation

You will need at least three shots of the same frame to get the shadow effect to work. The first is the main video, the second is the shadow clip, and the last would be a clip portraying just a plain background.

Make sure that your camera stays at the same point and angle. You can use a tripod for assurance.

Take the first main video and don't forget to mark the positioning of the object for the next take. Then, you can shoot the shadow clip following the marking of the object to match its position in the main clip.

Finally, shoot the final clip without the object on the frame.

The feature allows you to insert the mask in any shape, such as a rectangle, circle, or triangle. You can also import any shapes you like if you can't find them in the presets library. You can also adjust the mask placement, width, height, and feather effect.

Without further ado, let's see the detailed step-by-step guide for this effect.

### a. Preparation

You will need at least three shots of the same frame to get the shadow effect to work. The first is the main video, the second is the shadow clip, and the last would be a clip portraying just a plain background.

Make sure that your camera stays at the same point and angle. You can use a tripod for assurance.

Take the first main video and don't forget to mark the positioning of the object for the next take. Then, you can shoot the shadow clip following the marking of the object to match its position in the main clip.

Finally, shoot the final clip without the object on the frame.

### b. Steps to add the shadow effect to your videos using Masking

Step 1: Place the main clip on the timeline and find the start of the segment that you want to use. Press M on the keyboard to set a marker.

![placing a marker on the main clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/spooky-shadow-tricks-2.jpg)

Step 2: Place the shadow clip on top of the main clip on the timeline. Trim and adjust until the shadow clip ends right at the marker of the main clip.

![adjust the length of the shadow clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/spooky-shadow-tricks-3.gif)

Step 3: Move the play head to the start of the shadow clip. Trim the main clip right on that mark so both clips have the same start by clicking the scissor icon and deleting the unused part.

## Additional Video Splice Apps for Android

You can’t run out of options when it comes to splicing video. Here are some useful video splice apps for Android at your reach.

### • Filmora

Filmora is suitable for mobile phone editing. It is rich in editing features to record, select a theme, apply effects, and easily share your video on other platforms. With this app, you can add animated text, adjust video color and brightness, customize watermarks, and much more. It is, however, slow and often crashes when dealing with larger files. Follow these steps to splice Android.

Step 1\. Once successfully downloaded and installed, launch the app on your Android phone and select a built-in template to use.

Step 2\. Then go to your Android gallery and choose the videos you wish to splice. Remember, you can add several clips for merging. Remember to load your videos in the order you wish them to appear in the spliced video.

Step 4\. The final step is to click on the "Export" tab to save your spliced video and share it on social media platforms. You can directly share your videos on YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter, among others.

### • Vimeo Create

Vimeo supports mobile applications and can be used to splice Android. Sign up for the app on your Android, and launch it. Then follow these steps to merge the video.

Step 2\. Head on over to the "Style" area and choose one to use, then click on the "Next" button.  
Step 3\. Additionally, you can easily add background music to make it more engaging. Vimeo doesn’t allow you to add music from other sites. However, it brings you a rich catalog from which to choose any kind of music.
