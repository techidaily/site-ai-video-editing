## How to Be a YouTube Vlogger

Being a vlogger is a lot of fun specially making videos but is not also very easy, there are times you feel giving up specially when no one in the family supports you, there are also times when you get tired because you think no one is interested in your videos, but very fulfilling at the same time being able to do what you love. As you all know making video on YouTube is making also money that is through google AdSense, but if you are into money without the passion of being a vlogger, you will definitely get tired immediately, because being a vlogger requires more effort, patience, love of work, creativity and most specially passion.
