## How to Convert SRT to DOCX

**SRT to Word: How to Convert an SRT File to Docx file?**

The SubRip Text (SRT) format is a popular subtitle format used in many videos. While SRT files are simple text files that can be edited with any text editor, they are not as convenient to work with as MS Word documents.

For one thing, it cannot be easy to format text in a way that is easy to read. In addition, SRT files do not support features such as spell checking and grammar checking.

As a result, converting SRT to Word can be a useful way to improve the quality of subtitles. In addition, it can also make it easier to translate subtitles into other languages.

Other than that, you might need to convert an SRT to a Word document when you need to edit the subtitles for a video you're working on or you want to create a transcript of a recorded conversation.

You might think that converting a speech to text is difficult or impossible. But it's not!

Here's how you can easily convert SRT to DOCX files. Let's begin.

## What is an SRT file?

SRT files are used for subtitles. Subtitles are the audio track of a video or movie. Subtitles are displayed alongside a video or movie on your TV or computer screen. They allow the viewer to understand what is being said in the language they speak.

People have recently begun using online streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Video, and Hulu to watch movies and television shows. While streaming services offer thousands of movies and shows, there are still many that only exist in a form that can be viewed in their entirety. This requires the user to download the entire file (usually in a format known as a .srt file).

## Why do we need to convert SRT files into Word?

Subtitles are a great way to enjoy movies and TV shows in different languages. They provide text on the screen that tells you what the characters are saying, so you can follow along even if you don't speak the language. However, SRT files can be difficult to work with because they are incompatible with all software programs**.** So, they need to be converted into Word. Some other reasons include:

* It allows your content to be viewed within a web browser or mobile device without downloading .srt file.
* If you need to embed the video into another site, you can do so easily with the.docx file.
* Learning a new language by downloading SRT subtitles from video.

Open the SRT file in a text editor (such as Notepad++ or Sublime Text) and delete all the lines that begin with numbers. These lines will typically look something like "00:00:01,000 --> 00:00: 02,000." Once you have removed the time codes, save the file and open it in Microsoft Word.

The text from the SRT file will now be visible in the Word document. You can then format the text as desired and save the document.

Keep in mind that this manual method will not retain any formatting from the original SRT file, so you may need to do some additional editing to get the final results you want.
