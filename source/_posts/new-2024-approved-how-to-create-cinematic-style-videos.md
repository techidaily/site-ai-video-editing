For macOS 10.12 or later

Step 1: Launch [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to begin. Import the targeted music in the program and drag it to the timeline.

Step 2: Moving on, add markers to the music. Use "M" from the keyboard to mark the specific part of the track. After you are done, drag the first track onto the timeline. Trim the video to match it to the first marker.

![add markers and adjust video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/create-cinematic-style-videos-2.jpg)

Step 3: Perform a similar process for the rest of the video clips and trim them according to the markers. The user is directed to create a 2.35:1 widescreen cinemascope bar opener. To do so, drag two black mattes onto the timeline on top of each other.

Step 6: Perform the same process for the rest of the tracks. Time the titles to match the clip’s ending. Now, add a dissolve transition at the end of the clip. Trim the clip into two parts and apply square blur by navigating to the "Effects" tab to blur the video clips.

![add dissolve transition and effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/create-cinematic-style-videos-6.jpg)

![match note with the music](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/create-cinematic-style-videos-1.jpg)

Step 2: Moving on, add markers to the music. Use "M" from the keyboard to mark the specific part of the track. After you are done, drag the first track onto the timeline. Trim the video to match it to the first marker.

![add markers and adjust video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/create-cinematic-style-videos-2.jpg)

Step 3: Perform a similar process for the rest of the video clips and trim them according to the markers. The user is directed to create a 2.35:1 widescreen cinemascope bar opener. To do so, drag two black mattes onto the timeline on top of each other.

![create widescreen cinemascope bar opener](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/create-cinematic-style-videos-3.jpg)

Step 4: Drag the end of both clips to match the length of the whole video. Now, it is time to animate it. Insert 240° in the y-axis for the first keyframe. Similarly, use 422.2° for the second keyframe. For the bottom y-axis, use -240° for the first keyframe and -422.2° for the second keyframe.

![match length of whole video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/create-cinematic-style-videos-4.jpg)

![adjust title of the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/create-cinematic-style-videos-5.jpg)

Step 6: Perform the same process for the rest of the tracks. Time the titles to match the clip’s ending. Now, add a dissolve transition at the end of the clip. Trim the clip into two parts and apply square blur by navigating to the "Effects" tab to blur the video clips.

![add dissolve transition and effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/create-cinematic-style-videos-6.jpg)

Step 7: Moving on, adjust the alpha for blur intensity. Add a dissolve transition between the cuts. In the final step, go to the "Animation" and then "Customize." Reframe the last clip and animate a zoom-out effect. Reduce the "Scale" percent to do so. A creative cinematic intro is ready!

This makes the logo more prominent and attractive. Since a logo is a key part of branding, an attractive transparent becomes all the more important for your brand's success and prosperity!

## Part 2 When Should You Use the PNG or Vector Format?

What's the difference between a white background and a transparent background? Well, a white background tends to outshine the logo and reduces the fanciness of the logo. On the other hand, a transparent background logo goes well with any background. For instance, if the page behind the logo is black, if you were to place a white background logo on a black page, it'd look absurd. On the other hand, if your logo's background is transparent, the color of the page wouldn’t matter. Your logo would look good irrespective of the background's color. Since you will use your logo on not just one but multiple platforms, it becomes highly important to have a transparent background for your logo. For instance, if you use your logo on a website with an off white background, a transparent logo would suit much better than a generic white background logo. Using a white background logo would make it look clumsy and would leave a disregarding first impression.

Using PNG files helps you in multiple ways. Firstly, because PNG format files are generally compressed. They occupy very little space on your website. Moreover, a PNG format file supports lossless compression unlike other counterparts such as JPG and JPEG file formats. PNG files facilitate very high quality and occupy minimum space on your disk.

## Part 1 How to Use a GIF as Your Desktop Background on Windows?

Although Windows doesn't have native support to keep animated gif backgrounds, you can use third-party services to keep gifs as background images.

Using Plastuer or BioniX wallpaper changer as a 3rd party software is the best way to use animated gifs for your desktop.

As a starting point, we'll cover plastuer, which uses WebGL and chromium-browser to make gifs as your background.

![plastuer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/some-facts-about-gif-background-you-didnt-know-1.jpg)

The software includes selecting different screens where you want the wallpaper to appear, making it possible to apply it to different screens at once.

To select the gif you want:

**●** You can paste the URL of the gif you want to use.

**●** You can also use the "create playlist" field to add multiple gifs as your background.

**●** You can select a file from your device using the "select file" option.

**●** Or you can choose from hundreds of gifs present in the plastuer library.

**●** You can disable the wallpaper whenever you wish by clicking on the "disable wallpaper" option.

You will need to download the software and once it is installed, launch it on your PC to apply cool gif backgrounds. To choose files from the device itself, you will have to use the shortcut command "CTRL+F", or you can also choose to insert the URL of the gif you want to use as your background.

Once your image gets uploaded into the software, double click on it to set it as your windows wallpaper. You can also choose a launch of gifs, create a playlist, and select the timer to change wallpaper regularly.
