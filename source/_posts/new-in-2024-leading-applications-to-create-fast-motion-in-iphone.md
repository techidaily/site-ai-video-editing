## 3 Best Effects to Appear on Camera Made with Filmora

We all want to improve our video editing skills and give them more of a wow factor. A fantastic method of achieving this is using different effects and tricks on [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

Appearance effects are optical illusions used to replicate imagined occurrences in a narrative or made-up universe. These effects can be effective narrative devices. As a result, they are widely employed in the theater, film, television, and video game industries. Here is what you need to do to add appearance effects to your videos:

## Part 1: Why are Appearance Effects Important?

A good branding and advertising strategy must include video. You can raise the caliber of clients who utilize your product by improving the image you provide.

How can video help you build your brand? How well do you look? Although there is no quick fix to seem nice on-screen instantly, you can employ several appearance effects to enhance the general flow of your videos. Appearance effects are significant because they add a slight twist to your videos. They can help you stand out, add some humor and draw attention from your audience. These simple tricks could add extra fun and Spark to your videos.

## Part 2: How to Make Cloth Appearance

Let's start with the first one. Before you start, make sure you put the camera on a tripod or a steady surface, so it doesn't move while filming.

Step1 For the first shot, you must throw a jacket on a stool. Make sure it lands on the stool or wherever your talent is going to sit.

![throw a jacket on a stool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_1.jpg)

Step2 Make a shot of your talent appearing from where the jacket landed. You can add some acting skills to make this shot more realistic.

![make a shot of your talent appearing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_2.jpg)

Step3 Download Filmora to edit your footage. You can get started by going to their official website.

![download filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_3.jpg)

Step4 Now split the first clip on the frame where your jacket lands on the stool. Place it on the first track.

![split the first clip on the frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_4.jpg)

Step5 Trim the second shot until the talents start acting and place it on the second track to match the first clip.

![trim the second shot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_5.jpg)

## Part 3: How to Make an Explosion Appearance

Step1 This effect is the easiest. You need to film the empty plate with just a background. Then let the talent enter the frame and jump into the place.

![let the talent enter the frame](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_6.jpg)

Step2 Now import the clip into Filmora and place it onto the first video track.

Step3 Freeze the frame of the empty plate with just the background and extend it as necessary. Place the clip onto the second video track and trim it until the action of the talent jump starts.

![freeze the frame of the empty plate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_7.jpg)

Step4 Delete the rest on the left. The trick is to use some explosion or smoke effect to hide the transition.

Step5 Use the green screen sample in the default menu here. Add some smoke effects available in film stock. Place it on the third video track and move it to hide the transition.

![use the green screen sample](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_8.jpg)

## Part 4: How to Make Roof Appearance

The last trick here is combining the techniques from the two previous effects.

Step1 First, record the empty plate with just a background. Let the talent jump in the frame and set up a green screen for the talent to jump in front of it. It will look like they're falling from the ceiling.

![record the empty plate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_9.jpg)

Step2 Now import the clip into Filmora again. Follow the steps from the second example so we have the subject appearing on the screen like this.

![import the clip into filmora again](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_10.jpg)

Step3 Add the green screenshot onto the third video track.

![add the green screenshot onto the third video track](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_11.jpg)

Step4 Double-click on it, activate the setting window and then key out the background using the chroma key feature.

![activate the setting window](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_12.jpg)

Step5 Move the clip until it covers only the first frame of the appearing clip. Now keyframe the following subject from the outer frame to the final position.

![move the clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_13.jpg)

Step6 Now search for some smoke effects and put it upside down. So it looks like the ceiling is broken when the subject falls. Then add some camera shake to the fall.

![search for some smoke effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_14.jpg)

Step7 Drag the camera shake effect back to the top track and shorten it to an ideal length. You can also add some sound effects if you want to this video.

![drag the camera shake effect back to the top track](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/appearance_15.jpg)

## Part 5: Tips to Look Good in Your Next Video

**1\. Be Clear About the Topic**

Intellectuals frequently complain that everyone has attention deficit disorder due to the Internet. According to studies, we only have an attention span of 8 seconds today. You need a punchy, concise message to keep viewers watching your video.

**2\. Don't Forget to Smile**

Individuals who smile frequently are perceived to be more confident and successful. Therefore, showing your audience that you are confident in your company and services is the best method to gain their trust.

**3\. Look into the Camera**

Direct eye contact with the camera lens is essential. Although it may seem enticing, your sole audience is the person directly in front of you when you're speaking.

Be mindful of the camera's confined area. Bring it up to eye level and keep your gaze there rather than elsewhere.

## Summary

There are several fantastic camera effects that you can experiment with in your videos. While some are well-known, others are less well-known and often used. We have mentioned the three fun ways to appear on camera above. We suggest using video editing software like Filmora to use these effects more effectively. You can use these appearance effects to create an atmosphere, make your story more understandable, or spice up the video.

## Wedding Videography Checklist

### 1\. Get to know the couple

As a wedding videographer, it's important to get to know the couple you're working with. This will help you better capture the essence of their wedding day. Spend time talking to them, learn about their relationship, and find out what is important to them. By doing this, you'll be able to create a video that truly reflects who they are as a couple.

### 2\. Understand your videography style and skill level

Wedding videography can be done in a variety of styles, depending on your skill level and interests. Some videographers prefer to stay in the background and capture everything as it happens, while others like to get more involved, interviewing the couple and capturing special moments. It's important to understand what style you feel comfortable working in, and what the couple is looking for in a video.

If you're just starting out, it might be a good idea to stick to a more traditional style of videography. This will help you get the hang of things and build your skills before trying something more adventurous. However, if you have a lot of experience and are confident in your abilities, you may want to try something more creative. Be sure to discuss your ideas with the couple beforehand and make sure they're on board with what you want to do.

### 3\. Check with the venue to see where you can set up equipment

Check with the venue to see where you can set up equipment. Some venues may have restrictions on where you can set up your gear. If this is the case, be sure to work out a plan with the venue beforehand so that there are no surprises on the day of the wedding.

### 4\. Find out what equipment is needed

To be a successful wedding videographer, you'll need some basic equipment. This includes a good-quality video camera, tripod, microphone, and lighting. It's also a good idea to have some editing software on hand in case you need to do any post-production work. Be sure to discuss your needs with the couple ahead of time and make sure they're comfortable with what you plan on bringing along to the wedding.

### 5\. Get insurance for yourself and your gear

If you're going to be a wedding videographer, it's important to have insurance for yourself and your gear. This will help protect you in the event of an accident or damage to your equipment. There are a number of companies that offer insurance specifically for photographers and videographers, so be sure to shop around and find the best deal for you.

### 6\. Ask for a shot list from the couple in advance

This will help you know what specific shots they are hoping to get on their wedding day. Be sure to discuss the shot list with the couple and make sure you're both on the same page.

### 7\. Alert guests of their wedding video presence

Some couples may want to keep their wedding video a surprise, while others will want to let their guests know in advance that they'll be filmed. If the latter is the case, it's important to alert guests of your presence so that they're not caught off guard by the cameras. Be sure to discuss this with the couple beforehand and come up with a plan that everyone is comfortable with.

### 8\. Recruit an assistant videographer if you need one

If you're going to be filming the wedding by yourself, it's important to make sure you have all the necessary gear. However, if you're not comfortable doing this or feel like you might need some help, consider recruiting an assistant videographer. This person can help carry gear, set up equipment, and make sure everything is running smoothly on the day of the wedding.

### 9\. Have some backups on hand, just in case

Wedding videography is a big responsibility, and things can sometimes go wrong. Be sure to have some backups on hand, just in case. This includes extra batteries, memory cards, and cables. It's better to be safe than sorry, and having these backups will give you peace of mind knowing that you're prepared for anything.

### 10\. Arrive early to set up and test your equipment

This will help ensure that everything is working properly and that you're familiar with your surroundings. It's also a good idea to do a sound check to make sure the audio is coming through clearly. Be sure to allow yourself plenty of time to set up and test your equipment before the wedding begins.

### 11\. Capture both the big and small moments

While it's important to capture the big moments, such as the ceremony and speeches, don't forget about the smaller ones as well. These can often be just as special, if not more so. Be sure to keep your camera rolling throughout the entire event so that you don't miss a thing.

### 12\. Have fun

Wedding videography can be a lot of work, but it's also a lot of fun. Be sure to enjoy yourself and have a good time while you're working. This will come through in your final product and the couple will be sure to appreciate it.
