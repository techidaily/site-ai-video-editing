## Part 4: Pro Tips to Create Stunning Retro Video

You can make your video look retro with a few simple tips:

* Use several vintage apps like Retro VHS, 8mm Camcorder, and others.
* Keep low highlights and low contrasts.
* Keep low saturation and control the hue, saturation, and luminance of your video.
* Film Overlays. With this, you can bring the mood just right. If you add a soft light overall to start with, it will instantly look slightly more vintage.
* By decreasing contrast, you are darkening your videos and giving them a grainier old look.
* If you bring up the black levels, you will leave more space for other tones to shine and turn the mood around your videos.
* In contrast, if you bring down the whites in your videos, making even the brightest colors turn grey.

## We Can Say that the Horror Movies of the 90S Laid the Foundation for Current Horror Movies. So, without Wasting Time, Let’s Create a 1990S Horror Movie Similar to The Blair Witch Project

In the 90s, movie production technology improved a lot. This decade saw horror movies become much more fun and immersive than in the 80s and 50s because they were more psychological.

## Preparation

![1990s vintage scene](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/1990s-vintage-scene.gif)

The preparation for this horror film production is relatively self-explanatory if you've watched The Blair Witch Project. Simply shoot footage inside a dark room and apply some light to your face. It's even better if you can shoot the video inside the woods. Just add some drama and a few screaming scenes to evoke emotions.

##### Step1 Add the horror video to the timeline

![add the horror video to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1990s-1.jpg)

Open Wondershare Filmora on your computer, then load the video you want to edit. After adding the video, drag it to the editing timeline, then move it a few keyframes to the right. The idea is to apply some black screen to add drama and fear before the film starts playing.

##### Step2 Apply color grading

![apply color grading](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1990s-2.jpg)

Next, double-click the horror clip and go to the **Color** menu. Then, click the **Tone** arrow before lowering the **Saturation** to -50%. This will give us a less saturated look popularly used in horror films.

![double-click the horror clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/vintage-film-effect-1990s-3.jpg)
