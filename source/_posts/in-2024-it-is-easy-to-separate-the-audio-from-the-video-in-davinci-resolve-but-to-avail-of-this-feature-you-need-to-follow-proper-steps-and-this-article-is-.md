Discord was a great alternative to voice chat systems such as TeamSpeak, Mumble, and Ventrilo for online gamers. Gamers **make discord accounts** for these services to play together rather than the voice communication facilities integrated into games, which are frequently of poor quality and lack functionality.

Founded in 2015, discord allowed individuals to talk while playing PC games seamlessly. Users may utilize the service to establish servers that can include many text and audio channels. A typical **discord account** server may feature chat rooms dedicated to specific themes (such as "gaming" and "anime x manga"), as well as voice channels devoted to specific games or activities. The service's high-quality, low-latency audio chat is a popular tool for Twitch broadcasters and podcasters. It has also expanded to accommodate massive video conversations to compete with Zoom.

![final preview of rotating video illusion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/rotating-video-effect-1.gif)

It helps to indulge the audience with your content and show the after and before transitions. You can try this with any object or any character. But first, let's figure out the requirements for rotating effects.

## Part 2\. Prerequisites to Make a Rotating Video Effect

You will need a few items to create a rotating transition video. First, look at the fundamental priorities for creating this feature.

### The Subject Matters

To record a successful rotating video, you need a person or a subject to perform in front of the camera. It can be a model hired by a brand, a social influencer, or maybe it's you. Keep in mind the following things before recording:

* The person should get two different costumes.
* All the actions need to be rehearsed before shooting
* Show affinity and control of the camera.

![character of the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/rotating-video-effect-2.png)

### Shotting Equipment

To record a professional video, you need a good camera. You can use a smartphone to record this footage. There is no need to have a tripod stand or any gear to hold the camera because the camera will be in a rotating position, the same as the subject's hand.

For this, you need a filmmaker or any person living with you. Just give instructions as shown below to him to record a perfect video for yourself:

* Record the whole video in just one direction.
* Don't **shake** the camera because it gives blurry footage.
* Ensure to **focus** on the subject during recording.
* Don't **zoom** in or out while recording the video.
* Keep the subject in the **middle** of the frame during the recording process.
* The **hand rotation** timing is the same as the camera's rotation.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Ensure to record one footage multiple times so that you can choose the perfect one later for editing.

![smartphone for filming](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/rotating-video-effect-3.png)

### Filming of the First Footage

To make the footage for the rotating video illusion, we have to record it at least twice to get crystal clear and high-resolution results. Therefore, ensure that we have camera movement in the same direction during all recording times.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You can film the video either in the vertical format of the camera or in horizontal format. It all depends upon your script!

Follow the below-mentioned steps to record the first footage for the video:

* Hold the camera in a perfect format, whatever you choose.
* Let the subject stand or sit in the middle of the frame.
* The filmmaker can rotate the camera when the subject's hand rotates.
* Try your best to rotate the camera 180 degrees.
* Ensure that the camera lens faces the ground at the end of the rotation.

![filming scenes of first footage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/rotating-video-effect-4.png)

After filming the first footage for the video, it's time to record the second footage to transition between the two.

### Filming of the Second Footage

To create a second shot, you have to remember that the costume and location of the filming are different from the first footage. Follow the below steps to record it:

* The first step is to hold the camera in the same direction as the first footage.
* When editing, make sure the subject's position matches the first footage.
* Make sure the subject's hand movement is in the opposite direction from the first shot.

![filming scenes of second footage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/rotating-video-effect-5.png)

The gaming world is ever-changing, with developers looking to create innovative ways to immerse players into their digital worlds. One such technology that has begun to sweep is **AI in the game industry**.

AI is a powerful tool in many ways to improve the gaming experience. It can make **artificial intelligence in computer games** more believable and add replayability and immersion to games, and we can expect to see even more impressive applications in the future.

#### In this article

01 [What Is AI in Gaming?](#Part 1)

02 [Why Does AI in Gaming Matter?](#Part 2)

03 [How AI Will Completely Change Video Games](#Part 3)

04 [8 Games with Incredible Artificial Intelligence](#Part 4)

05 [What AI Video Games Assets Do Filmora Have?](#Part 5)

## Part 1 **What Is AI in Gaming?**

In simple terms, AI is a set of algorithms that allow a computer to learn and improve from experience. Although you can apply it in many ways, **artificial intelligence in video games** is usually helpful to create more intelligent and more believable non-player characters (NPCs).

For example, an AI system might be helpful to determine how an NPC reacts to the player's actions. If the player tries to steal from an NPC, the AI might make the NPC angry and more likely to attack the player. Alternatively, if the player is friendly to an NPC, the **AI game playing** might make the NPC more likely to help the player in future interactions.

## Part 2 **Why Does AI in Gaming Matter?**

One of the most vital aspects of **AI in video games** is that it can make games more believable and immersive for players. When games can convincingly simulate human-like behavior, it can be a much more enjoyable experience for gamers. AI can make NPCs seem more lifelike and make the game world feel more believable.

AI is also becoming increasingly important for creating procedural content. This is where the game generates content on its own, rather than relying on pre-made assets. For example, a game might use procedural generation to create random dungeons or quests that the player can explore. This can add a lot of replayability to a game, as the player never knows what they will encounter next.

## Part 3 **How AI Will Completely Change Video Games**

It is not a secret that AI is changing the world as we know it. With its ability to enable computers to learn and improve from experience, AI is paving the way for a future where machines can handle more complex tasks. And nowhere is this more apparent than in the world of video gaming.

In the past, developers brought in AI primarily for simple things like making certain NPCs (non-player characters) move and act realistically. But now, **artificial intelligence in video games** is being used for much more complex tasks like generating procedural content and creating believable human-like behavior. This results in a new generation of **AI game playing** that are more immersive and playable.

## Part 1 **What Is AI in Gaming?**

In simple terms, AI is a set of algorithms that allow a computer to learn and improve from experience. Although you can apply it in many ways, **artificial intelligence in video games** is usually helpful to create more intelligent and more believable non-player characters (NPCs).

For example, an AI system might be helpful to determine how an NPC reacts to the player's actions. If the player tries to steal from an NPC, the AI might make the NPC angry and more likely to attack the player. Alternatively, if the player is friendly to an NPC, the **AI game playing** might make the NPC more likely to help the player in future interactions.

## Part 2 **Why Does AI in Gaming Matter?**

One of the most vital aspects of **AI in video games** is that it can make games more believable and immersive for players. When games can convincingly simulate human-like behavior, it can be a much more enjoyable experience for gamers. AI can make NPCs seem more lifelike and make the game world feel more believable.

AI is also becoming increasingly important for creating procedural content. This is where the game generates content on its own, rather than relying on pre-made assets. For example, a game might use procedural generation to create random dungeons or quests that the player can explore. This can add a lot of replayability to a game, as the player never knows what they will encounter next.
