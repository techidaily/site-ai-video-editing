![wondershare filmora interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-keyframe-video-4.png)

##### Step2 Import your Photos and Videos

* When you open Wondershare Filmora, you will notice the main import window in the top left corner.
* Click in the center of the import window upon the import icon.
* After clicking, Wondershare Filmora will automatically direct you to your PC library.
* **Browse** to where your target Clips or Images are stored.
* Select all the objects you want to import.
* Click on **Open,** and you will have imported files.

![importing clips to filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-keyframe-video-5.png)

##### Step3 Add your Photos and Videos to the Timeline

Your next step will be to add the imported videos and images to the timeline. When you have many videos and photos imported into the timeline, you can add them simultaneously.

Or you can also add them one by one wherever you need. To add an item to your timeline, follow the steps mentioned.

* **Right-click** on the photo or video you want to add to the timeline.
* Keep holding the right-click and drag it down to the timeline.

![adding shots to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-keyframe-video-6.png)

##### Step4 Adding Movement to your Shots

The next step would be to use the movement option in Keyframing, where you can pan and zoom a shot over a specified time. To do this, follow the bullet points below.

* After importing your clips to the timeline, double-click the clip to open the Editing Menu.

![clip editing menu](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-keyframe-video-7.png)

* Once opened, the editing menu will have a Basic tab; click it.
* **Check** the key-shaped button in front of the Transform button. It will create a Keyframe in the default form of your clip.

![first keyframe created](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-keyframe-video-8.png)

* You need to add a second keyframe at the end of the clip to create movement. First, move the timeline cursor to the end of the clip. Then, check the key-shaped button in front of the Transform button again for a second Keyframe.
* Now change the scale of the clip from the slider options in the **Custom Animation**

![adding keyframes and varying clip scale](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-keyframe-video-9.png)

* Now **play** your clip, and you'll see it zooms in and pans automatically to the state of the second keyframe over that timeline.

![final result of added movement](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-keyframe-video-10.gif)

##### Step5 Adding Motion to your Shots

Keyframing can add motion to your project's objects, clips, or images. To perform this in Filmora, follow these instructions:

* Go to the Stock Media tab on the top left ribbon in Filmora and download some motion elements (videos/GIFs) from accessible outlets like the **Flora GIF** used here.
* After importing elements to the timeline, **double-click** the element to open the Editing Menu.

![opening the editing menu](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-keyframe-video-11.png)

* Once opened, the **editing menu** will have a Basic tab; **click**
* **Check** the key-shaped button in the Basic Tab. It will create a Keyframe in the default form of your motion element.

![adding keyframes from the transform option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-keyframe-video-12.png)

* Next, move it to the end of the clip, check the key-shaped button in front of the Transform button, and add another keyframe there, but this time, change its scale and rotation attributes as you like.

![changing scale and rotation of clip at the second keyframe](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-keyframe-video-13.png)

* Enter **OK** and play your clip to see the fantastic effect.

![final result of added motion](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-keyframe-video-14.gif)

##### Step6 Keyframing Opacity

Keyframing allows creators to integrate variable opacity in their shots to instill a dramatic feel. This technique also helps create perfect fade-in and fade-out shots for your videos. Additionally, it is for theatrically dissolving shots too.  
For an illustrated guide to keyframing opacity, keep on reading the following instructions:

* Add a Keyframe to a clip on your timeline. For it, double-click the clip to open the Editing Menu, Then go to Basic Tab.
* Check the key-shaped button in front of the Transform button. It will create a Keyframe in the default form of your motion element.

![creating an initial keyframe](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-keyframe-video-15.png)

* **Move** the red cursor to the end of the clip.

![moving the keyframe to the end of the clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-keyframe-video-16.png)

* Next, add another keyframe, scroll down in the editing menu, and remove the **opacity** from the slider below the Bend Mode option.

![decreasing the opacity at the second keyframe](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-keyframe-video-17.png)

* That's it; you have a theatrical variation of the clip's visible opacity throughout the timeline.

![keyframing opacity final result](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-keyframe-video-18.gif)
