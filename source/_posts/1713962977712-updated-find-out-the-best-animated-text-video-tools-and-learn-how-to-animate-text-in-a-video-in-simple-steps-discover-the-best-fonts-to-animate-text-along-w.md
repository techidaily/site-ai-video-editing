If you want more creative slow-motion videos, then keep reading. Here, you will find the easiest way to slow down videos in Filmora:

##### Step 1Install Filmora and Import Your Project in the Timeline

Launch the Filmora 13 in your system within simple steps. Access its main interface and hit the "New Project" button. Enter the editing window and import your project. Press the "Ctrl + I" keys from your keyboard to import the video. Browse the video and click "Open" to bring the video to Filmora. Then, drag and drop the video in the timeline section.

##### Step 2Explore Speed Ramping to Make Videos Super Slow

Place your cursor on the video and right-click on it. From the list, choose “Speed Ramping” and navigate toward the right-side panel. There, tap on “Customize” to open the further settings. Look for the “AI Frame Interpolation” and expand it to choose the “Optical Flow” option. You can adjust the speed manually from the graphical section on the right.

##### Step 3Get Render Review and Look for Export Button

## Conclusion

To conclude, speed ramping is a unique way to slow down video scenes. In this regard, professional video editors prefer **Adobe Premiere Pro Slow Motion**. On the contrary, this software is not a good choice for beginners and non-tech persons. That's where Wondershare Filmora can make the process easier for all users. The plus point is it ensures quality with dedicated customization.
