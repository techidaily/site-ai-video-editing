## Don't Confuse Color Grading With Color Correction

The first way to fully appreciate color grading is by differentiating it from its closest term—color correction. Many people use both of them interchangeably, and that's wrong. Although color grading and color correction are post-production processes that enhance image colors, they perform different roles.

Here's how to differentiate color grading from color correction:

| Differentiating Factor          | Color Grading ;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Color Correction                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Definition                      | Color grading is a process that enhances an image's color by stylizing or giving it a cinematic appearance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Color correction is a process that adjusts color mistakes in an image by giving it a consistent appearance. This process balances colors by adjusting whites and blacks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Purpose                         | The primary aim of color grading an image is to evoke specific emotions in the viewers. Color grading leverages the emotional and psychological effects of colors to manipulate the viewers' moods. You can use color grading to give your images different tones or themes like fear, femininity, youthfulness, passion, anger, sadness, etc.                                                               | Unlike color grading, the color correction does very little in setting the tone or mood that an image carries. Instead, it corrects specific mistakes in the image to make it look as natural to the human eyes as possible. Generally, camera lenses and the human eyes view pictures differently. Color correction changes a photo's look to make it more appealing to humans than the camera. It makes black colors appear darker and adds more white to whites to create the desired effect. |
| Stage in the production process | Color grading typically comes after color correction in the post-production process. That's because the effects of color grading are more appealing on a color-corrected picture.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Color correction comes before color grading. This process does the major work of balancing colors and correcting errors. Color grading only fine-tunes what color correction has done, giving it a professional finish.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Example                         | One of the most obvious examples of color grading is in motion pictures. For example, Sci-Fi movies typically have a very saturated blue color. However, you will notice a little redder in romantic movies. Note that filmmakers can use different color grades in movies to draw attention to specific details or represent changes in the storyline. Color grading produces the same effects in pictures. | Color correction is most prominent in documentaries to make pictures and videos look more real to the human eye. Other times, color corrections just adjust one color to merge the rest of the image or video.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

## Terms and Tools Used In Color Grading

These are the most common terminologies photo editors use when color grading an image:

#### ● Hue

Hue is the general name for describing pure color. That means it defines color without alluding to its brightness, vividness, etc. It describes a color's position in the color wheel.

#### ● Saturation

When a photo editor talks about saturation, they refer to the hue concentration that defines a specific color. Saturation describes color shades and focuses on how colorful they are. Examples of colors with zero saturation are white, black, and grey.

![color grading photography - saturation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/color-grading-photography-2.jpg)

#### ● Luminance

Luminous describes how bright, well-lighted or dark a color is. Highlights, mids, and shadows can influence luminance.

![color grading photography - luminance](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/color-grading-photography-3.jpg)

#### ● Additive Color

Additive colors are non-primary colors. However, they typically result from mixing primary colors (blue, red, green).

#### ● Color Cast

Color cast means that the image's coloring doesn't look as natural as it should be. This usually happens when different light sources get mixed.

#### ● Temperature

Temperature defines how cool or warm a color is. Cool temperatures typically describe blues and purples, while orange and red represent the warmth.

### The essential tools for color grading include

#### ● White Balance

White balance helps to make your photos look more natural by correcting color cast issues. After using white balance, the result is that the whites in your pictures would look exactly like the human eye will perceive it. White balance adjusts your image's color cast to make them look warmer or cooler.

#### ● Brightness and Contrast

Brightness and contrast are essential in color grading and are among the most used photo editing tools. Different sliders control brightness and contrast during editing. It's important to note that your image's brightness will affect the contrast and vice-versa. That's why they usually appear together, even if they refer to different tools.

#### ● The Three-Way Color Corrector

Many photographers refer to the three-way corrector as the color correction's workhorse. That's because this tool adjusts hue, saturation, brightness, and contrast in a single interface. The three-way corrector performs the job of three tools in one interface. Using the three-way corrector ensures that you work faster than usual.

#### ● The Fast Color Corrector

The fast color corrector is like the three-way corrector. However, there are many limitations with the number of potential looks you can achieve with this tool. The fast color corrector primarily focuses on adjusting tint and saturation. Its major advantage over the three-way corrector is its user-friendliness and simplicity.

#### ● Curves

While using curves is pretty complicated, the tool offers impressive functionality that you can't refuse. Curves are very powerful and precise. Their main function is to overhaul or remove your image's brightness altogether to give it a distinctive look.

#### ● The Unsharp Mask and Sharpening Tools

With the unsharp mask and sharpening tools, you can give your picture's edges a sharp illusion by modifying the contrast. This is typically useful for images that you shoot in dark conditions.

Sharp pictures are always a lovely sight. However, these tools can't correct pictures taken out of focus. To get the best results from these tools. Then you can start moving them back till you get your desired sharpness.

#### ● Color Match

As the make implies, color match tools modify a target picture's colors to fit the reference image. This is an automatic process and helps to save time.

## Common Steps To Color Grade a Photo

These are the essential stages for color grading your images:

● Step 1:  
The first step in color grading is deciding how warm or cool you want your image to look. Then, modify the white balance to suit your desired warmth or coolness.

● Step 2:  
After adjusting the white balance, the next step is to adjust saturation or hue.

● Step 3:  
The next step is to focus on the histogram. A histogram is a common feature in many photo editing software that informs you of your image's tonal values. The goal in this stage is to ensure equal color distribution. Keep adjusting your image till the colors are even.

● Step 4:  
Work on your highlights and shadows by modifying the green, red, and blue curves. Also, adjust your vibrancy setting for a good effect.

● Step 5:  
Explore split toning. Split toning is a process that involves adding colors to highlight and shadows independently. Learning how to split tone can make a difference in your photo editing.

## Tips For Color Grading Photography

The following best practices will enhance your color grading:

* About oversaturation or under-saturation. Your saturation should be just right to produce the perfect result. So, always be sure to pay maximum attention to this process. This tip is particularly useful when working with portraits.
* Remember that color grading doesn't fix a bad shot. So, be sure to improve your photography skills and take the best shots for excellent color grading results.
* Shoot your images in RAW. Doing this guarantees more control over your pictures' colors.
* Always experiment with different looks until you get your precise effect. Lightroom is one of the best color grading apps to use.
* Exercise maximum caution when manipulating backgrounds. Don't do too much, especially when you're taking an indoor shot. That's because manipulating indoor backgrounds too much can mismatch the foreground and background, making your portrait look weird.

Other times, color corrections just adjust one color to merge the rest of the image or video.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

## Terms and Tools Used In Color Grading

These are the most common terminologies photo editors use when color grading an image:

#### ● Hue

Hue is the general name for describing pure color. That means it defines color without alluding to its brightness, vividness, etc. It describes a color's position in the color wheel.

#### ● Saturation

When a photo editor talks about saturation, they refer to the hue concentration that defines a specific color. Saturation describes color shades and focuses on how colorful they are. Examples of colors with zero saturation are white, black, and grey.

#### ● Additive Color

Additive colors are non-primary colors. However, they typically result from mixing primary colors (blue, red, green).

#### ● Color Cast

Color cast means that the image's coloring doesn't look as natural as it should be. This usually happens when different light sources get mixed.

Brightness and contrast are essential in color grading and are among the most used photo editing tools. Different sliders control brightness and contrast during editing. It's important to note that your image's brightness will affect the contrast and vice-versa. That's why they usually appear together, even if they refer to different tools.

#### ● The Three-Way Color Corrector

Many photographers refer to the three-way corrector as the color correction's workhorse. That's because this tool adjusts hue, saturation, brightness, and contrast in a single interface. The three-way corrector performs the job of three tools in one interface. Using the three-way corrector ensures that you work faster than usual.

#### ● The Fast Color Corrector

The fast color corrector is like the three-way corrector. However, there are many limitations with the number of potential looks you can achieve with this tool. The fast color corrector primarily focuses on adjusting tint and saturation. Its major advantage over the three-way corrector is its user-friendliness and simplicity.

#### ● Curves

While using curves is pretty complicated, the tool offers impressive functionality that you can't refuse. Curves are very powerful and precise. Their main function is to overhaul or remove your image's brightness altogether to give it a distinctive look.

#### ● The Unsharp Mask and Sharpening Tools

## Don't Confuse Color Grading With Color Correction

The first way to fully appreciate color grading is by differentiating it from its closest term—color correction. Many people use both of them interchangeably, and that's wrong. Although color grading and color correction are post-production processes that enhance image colors, they perform different roles.

Here's how to differentiate color grading from color correction:

| Differentiating Factor          | Color Grading ;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Color Correction                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Definition                      | Color grading is a process that enhances an image's color by stylizing or giving it a cinematic appearance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Color correction is a process that adjusts color mistakes in an image by giving it a consistent appearance. This process balances colors by adjusting whites and blacks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Purpose                         | The primary aim of color grading an image is to evoke specific emotions in the viewers. Color grading leverages the emotional and psychological effects of colors to manipulate the viewers' moods. You can use color grading to give your images different tones or themes like fear, femininity, youthfulness, passion, anger, sadness, etc.                                                               | Unlike color grading, the color correction does very little in setting the tone or mood that an image carries. Instead, it corrects specific mistakes in the image to make it look as natural to the human eyes as possible. Generally, camera lenses and the human eyes view pictures differently. Color correction changes a photo's look to make it more appealing to humans than the camera. It makes black colors appear darker and adds more white to whites to create the desired effect. |
| Stage in the production process | Color grading typically comes after color correction in the post-production process. That's because the effects of color grading are more appealing on a color-corrected picture.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Color correction comes before color grading. This process does the major work of balancing colors and correcting errors. Color grading only fine-tunes what color correction has done, giving it a professional finish.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Example                         | One of the most obvious examples of color grading is in motion pictures. For example, Sci-Fi movies typically have a very saturated blue color. However, you will notice a little redder in romantic movies. Note that filmmakers can use different color grades in movies to draw attention to specific details or represent changes in the storyline.

| Definition                      | Color grading is a process that enhances an image's color by stylizing or giving it a cinematic appearance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Color correction is a process that adjusts color mistakes in an image by giving it a consistent appearance. This process balances colors by adjusting whites and blacks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Purpose                         | The primary aim of color grading an image is to evoke specific emotions in the viewers. Color grading leverages the emotional and psychological effects of colors to manipulate the viewers' moods. You can use color grading to give your images different tones or themes like fear, femininity, youthfulness, passion, anger, sadness, etc.                                                               | Unlike color grading, the color correction does very little in setting the tone or mood that an image carries. Instead, it corrects specific mistakes in the image to make it look as natural to the human eyes as possible. Generally, camera lenses and the human eyes view pictures differently. Color correction changes a photo's look to make it more appealing to humans than the camera. It makes black colors appear darker and adds more white to whites to create the desired effect. |
| Stage in the production process | Color grading typically comes after color correction in the post-production process. That's because the effects of color grading are more appealing on a color-corrected picture.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Color correction comes before color grading. This process does the major work of balancing colors and correcting errors. Color grading only fine-tunes what color correction has done, giving it a professional finish.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Example                         | One of the most obvious examples of color grading is in motion pictures. For example, Sci-Fi movies typically have a very saturated blue color. However, you will notice a little redder in romantic movies. Note that filmmakers can use different color grades in movies to draw attention to specific details or represent changes in the storyline. Color grading produces the same effects in pictures. | Color correction is most prominent in documentaries to make pictures and videos look more real to the human eye. Other times, color corrections just adjust one color to merge the rest of the image or video.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

## Terms and Tools Used In Color Grading

These are the most common terminologies photo editors use when color grading an image:

#### ● Hue

Hue is the general name for describing pure color. That means it defines color without alluding to its brightness, vividness, etc. It describes a color's position in the color wheel.

#### ● Saturation

When a photo editor talks about saturation, they refer to the hue concentration that defines a specific color. Saturation describes color shades and focuses on how colorful they are. Examples of colors with zero saturation are white, black, and grey.

![color grading photography - saturation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/color-grading-photography-2.jpg)

#### ● Luminance

Luminous describes how bright, well-lighted or dark a color is. Highlights, mids, and shadows can influence luminance.

![color grading photography - luminance](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/color-grading-photography-3.jpg)

#### ● Additive Color

Additive colors are non-primary colors. However, they typically result from mixing primary colors (blue, red, green).

#### ● Color Cast

Color cast means that the image's coloring doesn't look as natural as it should be. This usually happens when different light sources get mixed.

#### ● Temperature

Temperature defines how cool or warm a color is. Cool temperatures typically describe blues and purples, while orange and red represent the warmth.

### The essential tools for color grading include

#### ● White Balance

White balance helps to make your photos look more natural by correcting color cast issues. After using white balance, the result is that the whites in your pictures would look exactly like the human eye will perceive it. White balance adjusts your image's color cast to make them look warmer or cooler.

#### ● Brightness and Contrast

Brightness and contrast are essential in color grading and are among the most used photo editing tools. Different sliders control brightness and contrast during editing. It's important to note that your image's brightness will affect the contrast and vice-versa. That's why they usually appear together, even if they refer to different tools.

#### ● The Three-Way Color Corrector

Many photographers refer to the three-way corrector as the color correction's workhorse. That's because this tool adjusts hue, saturation, brightness, and contrast in a single interface. The three-way corrector performs the job of three tools in one interface. Using the three-way corrector ensures that you work faster than usual.

#### ● The Fast Color Corrector

The fast color corrector is like the three-way corrector. However, there are many limitations with the number of potential looks you can achieve with this tool. The fast color corrector primarily focuses on adjusting tint and saturation. Its major advantage over the three-way corrector is its user-friendliness and simplicity.

#### ● Curves

While using curves is pretty complicated, the tool offers impressive functionality that you can't refuse. Curves are very powerful and precise. Their main function is to overhaul or remove your image's brightness altogether to give it a distinctive look.

#### ● The Unsharp Mask and Sharpening Tools

With the unsharp mask and sharpening tools, you can give your picture's edges a sharp illusion by modifying the contrast. This is typically useful for images that you shoot in dark conditions.

Sharp pictures are always a lovely sight. However, these tools can't correct pictures taken out of focus. To get the best results from these tools. Then you can start moving them back till you get your desired sharpness.

#### ● Color Match

As the make implies, color match tools modify a target picture's colors to fit the reference image. This is an automatic process and helps to save time.

## Common Steps To Color Grade a Photo

These are the essential stages for color grading your images:

● Step 1:  
The first step in color grading is deciding how warm or cool you want your image to look. Then, modify the white balance to suit your desired warmth or coolness.

● Step 2:  
After adjusting the white balance, the next step is to adjust saturation or hue.

● Step 3:  
The next step is to focus on the histogram. A histogram is a common feature in many photo editing software that informs you of your image's tonal values. The goal in this stage is to ensure equal color distribution. Keep adjusting your image till the colors are even.

● Step 4:  
Work on your highlights and shadows by modifying the green, red, and blue curves. Also, adjust your vibrancy setting for a good effect.

● Step 5:  
Explore split toning. Split toning is a process that involves adding colors to highlight and shadows independently. Learning how to split tone can make a difference in your photo editing.

## Tips For Color Grading Photography

The following best practices will enhance your color grading:

* About oversaturation or under-saturation. Your saturation should be just right to produce the perfect result. So, always be sure to pay maximum attention to this process. This tip is particularly useful when working with portraits.
* Remember that color grading doesn't fix a bad shot. So, be sure to improve your photography skills and take the best shots for excellent color grading results.
* Shoot your images in RAW. Doing this guarantees more control over your pictures' colors.
* Always experiment with different looks until you get your precise effect. Lightroom is one of the best color grading apps to use.
* Exercise maximum caution when manipulating backgrounds. Don't do too much, especially when you're taking an indoor shot. That's because manipulating indoor backgrounds too much can mismatch the foreground and background, making your portrait look weird.

## Conclusion

● While your photography skills are essential in influencing your image's outcome; your color grading skills will take it to another level. It's one of the fastest ways to make a budding photo editor look like a pro.

● After reading this article, you can be sure that you have the basic information you need to achieve your editing goals. However, you mustn't stop here.

## How to Add Expression in After Effects

Although After Effects (AE) is a fantastic tool for creating UI animation prototypes, we're constantly searching for methods to make our process go more quickly. Expressions are supported by AE and allow the designer to animate layers without manually specifying each keyframe by establishing connections between layer parameters or keyframes. We'll go through the fundamentals of using and defining expressions as well as how to adapt them to your own need.

1. [thisComp](#part2-1)
2. [loopOut](#part2-2)
3. [random](#part2-3)
4. [Wiggle](#part2-4)
5. [Time](#part2-5)

* [How to Add Expressions in After Effects](#part3)
* [How to Edit Expressions in After Effects](#part4)

## Part 1\. What is After Effects Expression

Expressions are sections of code created in the JavaScript programming languages with the sole objective of changing the layer attributes in After Effects. They can create adaptable rigs and automate repetitive processes. Because of this, developing and modifying the code should be a breeze. There are many phrases that already exist and have for many years, but finding them might be challenging if you aren't sure what you're searching for. They may be as small as a single word or integer, or very complicated, including chapters and paragraphs of code.

You may begin forming connections between a property and other layers when you write an expression on that property. By connecting the expressions to the numerical parameters, the expression controllers in the Effects & Presets panel may assist you in better controlling the expressions. Although they are by no means necessary, expressions come in quite handy when attempting to replicate effects like inertia or bouncing without having to specify a ton of extra keyframes. They not only provide many creative possibilities, but they may also streamline your motion design process.

## Part 2\. Common Expressions in After Effects

An expression is a brief piece of JavaScript code that can be plugged into animated properties in After Effects applications. Expressions evaluate to a single value for a single layer property at a particular instant in time. Below are a few popular expressions.

### 1\. ‘thisComp’

Expressions in After Effects revolve entirely on manipulating values inside an object hierarchy. Objects in this context include the composition, specific layers, and even effects. Values or other things may be contained by an object.

Use thisComp together with some fundamental arithmetic to precisely place things on the screen. This comes in quite helpful when exporting several versions for social media sites and reusing content. To have the logo scale in accordance with the size of the comp, you could even add a similar statement to the Scale option.

### 2\. ‘loopOut’

You can always simply copy and paste keyframes throughout the timeline if you want an animation to repeat. But if you wanted to make adjustments, you'd have to go back and deal with all of those keyframes again. Again, you'd never see Batman using After Effects accomplishing this. You should use the loopOut expression in these circumstances. Even four options may be used to modify how the animation loops.

Again, cycle is the default setting; however, you may also choose from continue, offset, and ping pong. It just requires animating an Ellipse's Scale and Opacity properties, then adding loopOut to each of them. The two keyframes are immediately cycled; it is plug and play. There are really just four keyframes in total, however the animation lasts the full length of the timeline. Use two keyframes per parameter to keep things simple, or specify which keyframes you want to loop to make things more complicated.

### 3\. ‘random’

As implied by the name, each frame's value is generated randomly by this expression based on the argument you provide. It will automatically randomize between 0 and 1 if you leave it empty. The parameter will generate a value at random between 0 and the value you provide between the parentheses. It will generate random numbers between the two values you enter.

Another excellent expression for rapidly producing an animation is this one. We often use it to make opacity transitions that flicker. It just takes a few clicks to do this by adding the phrase below to Opacity and keyframing it in and out from 100% Opacity.

### 4\. ‘Wiggle’

One of the few expressions that may be used without keyframes is the Wiggle expression. Watch your shape begin to wiggle by simply adding the phrase to any Transform attribute. It will jiggle between keyframes if you decide to add them.

You will simultaneously move in two dimensions while using this phrase. You may sometimes just need to jiggle one dimension. The After Effects Wiggle expression (also known as AE Wiggle) is an excellent tool for creating erratic item movement, idle character movement, unpredictable camera motion, shaky lettering, and flashing lights.

### 5\. ‘Time’

The greater the value next to "time" below, the quicker your animation will be. Time expression is useful for continuous animation. Utilizing time is one of the fastest and simplest methods to create an animation. Time just creates each second's numerical value in the timeline. Remember that regardless of the timecode settings, this number begins at zero at the beginning of the comp.

Again, combine this with some simple arithmetic for excellent outcomes. To find a multiplier value that works for the parameter you are animating, play around and explore. Use it to gradually modify a layer's position or rotation. Time is also very useful for driving animated textures like the Fractal or Turbulent Noise effects. The evolution parameter is increased by a factor of 100 throughout time.

## Part 3\. How to Add Expressions in After Effects

In Adobe AE, expressions may be added to any kind of layer and any form of layer attribute. Don't give up; one of the best things about expressions is that you don't have to be an expert programmer or coder to use them. A variety of transform effects may have expressions applied to them to generate fascinating animation, which might take hours to create from scratch.

While some idioms are brief, simple, and easy to use and comprehend, others are wordy and complex. Even though they can appear difficult, sticking them in their designated spot should work. The process of adding expressions is always the same; the code varies based on your goals. Learning how to apply an Expression effect to your layer is the first step.

Step1 Include your form or image in the timeline. When viewing the layer's properties, click on the stopwatch of the property you wish to apply the phrase to while holding "Alt" (PC) or "Option" (Mac).

![click stopwatch property](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/click-stopwatch-property.jpg)

Step2 Make two keyframes for the transformation you've selected; in our case, we’ve point it Beginning and the End frames as shown below:

![make 2 key frames](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/make-2-key-frames.jpg)

Step3 Go to the Animation menu and choose the Transform option you keyframed in the timeline. We are choosing Scale since it is what we keyframed. Multiple Transform settings may have expressions added to them, but you should do it sequentially.

![choose transform animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/choose-transform-animation.jpg)

Step4 A box will show up on the timeline after choosing Add Expression from the menu. In the box, paste your expression. The numerical parameters will become red and a text box will show up in the timeline below the layer. The Expressions will be typed or copied here. By adjusting the values in the code, you may fine-tune the expression; experiment with each to find what works for you.

![paste expression to box](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/paste-expression-to-box.jpg)

## Part 4\. How to Edit Expressions in After Effects

To edit the Expressions in AE, you do need some programming skills to make the most of expressions since they employ JavaScript. However, there are many of excellent starter and expert expression examples, so you can still get a lot done with Premiere Pro without them. When you click the keyframe symbol on the property you wish to apply an expression to, hold down the Alt key to utilize expressions. There will appear an expression box where you may type and amend expressions.

Step1Select the property in the Timeline panel, then choose Animation > Add Expression to add and reveal an expression. To search Expressions and other parts of a property, use the search box in the Timeline panel.

![select property from timeline ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/select-property-from-timeline-ae.jpg)

Step2In the Timeline panel or the Effect Controls panel, click the stopwatch button next to the property name using the keyboard shortcut Alt + click for the Windows or Option + click for the MacOS. Four icons are shown under the property while the expression is active, and the value becomes red.

![select effects control ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/select-effects-control-ae.jpg)

Step3To open the Expression Editor, click within the text box on the Timeline panel. Wherever you wish to alter the phrase, position the cursor. The pick whip may be moved to the name or cost of a property. The resultant expression shows all the values as one if you drag to the name of a property.

![open the expreesion editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/open-the-expreesion-editor.jpg)

Step4Press Enter on the numeric keyboard to end text editing and start the expression.

![press enter start expression](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/press-enter-start-expression.jpg)

## Conclusion

One of the most popular pieces of software for the post-production of movies is called After Effects. The tools and expressions in AE are used by many video editors and motion graphics creators to produce stunning works of art, animated films, video advertising, distinctive video effects, and many other useful things. Expressions are JavaScript lines of code that let you manipulate data in Adobe After Effects. Even though they don't have the same flashy name as a kryptonite spear, they may be just as powerful in the proper hands. The fact that they'll save you a ton of time applies to all of them, regardless of size.

A variety of transform effects may have expressions applied to them to generate fascinating animation, which might take hours to create from scratch.

While some idioms are brief, simple, and easy to use and comprehend, others are wordy and complex. Even though they can appear difficult, sticking them in their designated spot should work. The process of adding expressions is always the same; the code varies based on your goals. Learning how to apply an Expression effect to your layer is the first step.

Step1 Include your form or image in the timeline. When viewing the layer's properties, click on the stopwatch of the property you wish to apply the phrase to while holding "Alt" (PC) or "Option" (Mac).

![click stopwatch property](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/click-stopwatch-property.jpg)

Step2 Make two keyframes for the transformation you've selected; in our case, we’ve point it Beginning and the End frames as shown below:

![make 2 key frames](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/make-2-key-frames.jpg)

Step3 Go to the Animation menu and choose the Transform option you keyframed in the timeline. We are choosing Scale since it is what we keyframed. Multiple Transform settings may have expressions added to them, but you should do it sequentially.

![choose transform animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/choose-transform-animation.jpg)

Step4 A box will show up on the timeline after choosing Add Expression from the menu. In the box, paste your expression. The numerical parameters will become red and a text box will show up in the timeline below the layer. The Expressions will be typed or copied here. By adjusting the values in the code, you may fine-tune the expression; experiment with each to find what works for you.

![paste expression to box](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/paste-expression-to-box.jpg)

## Part 4\. How to Edit Expressions in After Effects

To edit the Expressions in AE, you do need some programming skills to make the most of expressions since they employ JavaScript. However, there are many of excellent starter and expert expression examples, so you can still get a lot done with Premiere Pro without them. When you click the keyframe symbol on the property you wish to apply an expression to, hold down the Alt key to utilize expressions. There will appear an expression box where you may type and amend expressions.

Step1Select the property in the Timeline panel, then choose Animation > Add Expression to add and reveal an expression. To search Expressions and other parts of a property, use the search box in the Timeline panel.

![select property from timeline ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/select-property-from-timeline-ae.jpg)

Step2In the Timeline panel or the Effect Controls panel, click the stopwatch button next to the property name using the keyboard shortcut Alt + click for the Windows or Option + click for the MacOS. Four icons are shown under the property while the expression is active, and the value becomes red.

![select effects control ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/select-effects-control-ae.jpg)

Step3To open the Expression Editor, click within the text box on the Timeline panel. Wherever you wish to alter the phrase, position the cursor. The pick whip may be moved to the name or cost of a property. The resultant expression shows all the values as one if you drag to the name of a property.

![open the expreesion editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/open-the-expreesion-editor.jpg)

Step4Press Enter on the numeric keyboard to end text editing and start the expression.

## Conclusion

One of the most popular pieces of software for the post-production of movies is called After Effects. The tools and expressions in AE are used by many video editors and motion graphics creators to produce stunning works of art, animated films, video advertising, distinctive video effects, and many other useful things. Expressions are JavaScript lines of code that let you manipulate data in Adobe After Effects. Even though they don't have the same flashy name as a kryptonite spear, they may be just as powerful in the proper hands. The fact that they'll save you a ton of time applies to all of them, regardless of size.

## Part 1 **How to Freeze-frame in After Effects**

This part explains how to **hold a frame in After Effects** and the working of the freeze-frame button. After Effects requires ample resources, and the layers need to be solo for the editing process to speed up. However, sometimes you may need to see other objects in the scene, and that is where the freeze-frame button will be helpful. This freeze-frame Effect temporarily freezes the selected layers while you continue editing the video and does not overload the After Effects editor. In addition, you can press the button again to remove the freeze. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use **Adobe After Effects to freeze-frame**:

**Step 1: Add Video Clip to Adobe After Effects**

First, make sure you have the AE composition open, and the video clip added. Next is to find the point where you want the video to "pause" or freeze by moving the time position indicator on the timeline.

**Step 2: Choose Layer for Freezing Frame**

Next, select the layer and then right-click on the layer to find Time in the menu that appears, and under Time find Freeze-frame and click it. Once done, the entire layer will get stuck on that frame.

![how to freeze-frame in After Effect 01](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/tips-to%20freeze-frame-in%20after-effect-2.jpg)

Start the same way before and repeat it several times by splitting the layer, which means that After Effects will take the layer at the time position indicator and cut it into two layers. To achieve this, use the keyboard shortcut Command+Shift+D if you are using a Mac or Control+Shift+D if you are using a Windows operating system.

**Step 4: Zoom in**

Next, hit the plus (+) sign a few times to zoom into the timeline, move forward one frame, select the new layer, the one on top, and split the layer again using the keyboard shortcut, and now have three layers.

## Part 1 **How to Freeze-frame in After Effects**

This part explains how to **hold a frame in After Effects** and the working of the freeze-frame button. After Effects requires ample resources, and the layers need to be solo for the editing process to speed up.

In addition, you can press the button again to remove the freeze. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use **Adobe After Effects to freeze-frame**:

**Step 1: Add Video Clip to Adobe After Effects**
