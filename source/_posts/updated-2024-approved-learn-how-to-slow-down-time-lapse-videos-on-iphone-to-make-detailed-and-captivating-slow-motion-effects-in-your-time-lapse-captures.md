[Create AI Captions](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

### Step 1: Download Filmora and Find the AI Copywriting Feature

Filmora, widely recognized for its video editing prowess, has now integrated an AI-powered copywriting feature. After downloading Filmora, navigate to the **'Tools'** menu. Among the list, you’ll find the **"AI Copywriting"** option. It's user-friendly and intuitive, making it perfect for both beginners and seasoned TikTokers.

### Step 2: Enter Your Video Information

Filmora's AI requires a bit of information to generate a caption that resonates with your content and audience:

* **Select the Type of Headlines and Language:** Whether you want something witty, poignant, or a mix of both, there's an option for every mood. Plus, with multi-language support, you can cater to global audiences.
* **Enter Your Video Content Topic:** Give the AI a brief description of your video. It could be as simple as "a dog chasing its tail" or more abstract like "the feeling of nostalgia at a childhood park."

After inputting the required details, Filmora's AI will churn out multiple caption suggestions. Choose the one that best fits or use them as inspiration to craft your unique spin.

## Part 4: Summary

TikTok has transformed the world of short video content, and behind each viral video is a captivating caption that perfectly captures the moment's essence. While understanding the importance of catchy titles is crucial, having the tools and insights to generate them consistently can set you apart from the crowd.

Whether you're brainstorming creatively or seeking assistance from innovative tools like Filmora's AI Copywriting feature, remember that your caption is the gateway to engagement. Harness its power, and watch your TikTok presence soar!
