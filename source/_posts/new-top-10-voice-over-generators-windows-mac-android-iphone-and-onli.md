Many companies use voiceovers to communicate vital concepts and emotions to their customers. Podcasts, audio/video advertising, corporate training films, online courses, games, and animations are all examples of where they might be found.

Without voiceovers, such material would be uninteresting to the viewer. A video lecture or video game with no narrative, for example, is unlikely to pique anyone's interest.

Good voiceovers, on the other hand, are not inexpensive to make.

Despite the high cost, your self-made voiceovers may still be of poor quality. Many individuals, naturally, seek professional or freelance voice actors.

Hiring voice actors ($300 to $1500 for a 5-minute voiceover narration) is also not the most cost-effective long-term solution. Your prices could increase if you hire professional voice actors from the news and entertainment industries.

There are resources available. Voice over generators is available online. Most software products come in both free and premium versions, which you can pick from depending on your needs. These programs will swiftly help you reach your text to audio transformation goals, whether you're a YouTube content maker in need of an informative voiceover or a disabled person looking for a user-friendly text-to-speech converter.

Yes! That's correct. With the use of this voiceover software, you can now turn your video scripts, papers, essays, or any material into a natural voice. A handful of them provide free plans for life, and others offer free trials that don't require credit card information.

Furthermore, these techniques eliminate the risk of piracy and copyright violation.

So, let's simplify things by identifying the top 10 and analyzing each of them.

1. **ai (Supports Web)**

![voice-generators-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/voice-generators-1.jpg)

Resemble.ai operates in a variety of ways. It can not only help you make a speech out of the text, but it can also generate text for adverts with a single click. The platform can also produce a personalized voice that you can use as a voice assistant for Alexa, Google, and other services. The technique can also be used by call centres to clone their agents' voices and customize them.

Resemble gives you four alternative ways to create synthetic voices. You can use the API to generate voices, record up to 50 samples immediately on the online platform, choose from a large number of voice actors, or submit raw audio without a script.

Features

* The software allows you to Customize your brand's tone.
* It creates responsive IVR agents.
* Possible to do Advertisement text generation with AI with one click.
* Allows Instant language translation.

Cons

* The user interface could be enhanced.
* \- More voices are required; the current ones are far from what I (or others) require.

Price

The cheapest package is $30 per month.

For a personalized plan, contact a Resemble representative.

1. **ai ( Supports Web, Mobile**

![voice-generators-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/voice-generators-2.jpg)

Lovo.ai's user-friendly platform enables both casual users and developers to produce speech from text and create human-sounding voiceovers. Over 180 voice styles in 33 languages are available on the platform. The site is also regularly updated with new voices every day, giving consumers a wide range of options.

In just 15 minutes, the tool can generate personalized voices. On this platform, converting text to speech requires only three simple steps. Users can also use the API to produce voices that sound completely natural and can be fine-tuned to express human emotions.

Features

* Listening, conversion and sharing are all unlimited.
* A large voice library is available.
* Up to 15000 characters can be converted at once.
* Collection of unique voices. Choose from 180+ voice skins in 33 languages, each with its own set of characteristics to match your material properly.
* Genuine voices. Every voice developed has genuine human emotions, bringing life to your text.

Cons

* While the UI/UX is simple to use, it feels a little bland and dull."
* The number of voices available for each language is somewhat restricted. More voice samples are available."
* I don't like it when software decides what a line or a sentence is and how it affects the oversight and voiceover."

Pricing

Lovo.ai now offers two pricing options: (all pricing is for annual plans).

$34.99 per month for personal

$99.99 per month for Freelancer

The Personal plan gives access to all of the platform's features as well as 30 monthly voiceover downloads, which should be enough for most people.

Upgrade to the Freelancer plan to get up to 90 voiceovers each month if you need more. Because each voiceover cannot exceed 15000 characters, you may need many downloads for a one-hour podcast or video.

You will have to pay an additional $69.99 per month per voice for voice cloning. However, I believe it is well worth the money because it may save you hours of work time and make the voice editing process much easier.

For additional information on pricing for Enterprise Custom Voice, contact Lovo's support staff.

1. **Synthesia ( Supports Web, Mobile**

![voice-generators-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/voice-generators-3.jpg)

Synthesia is the fourth stage cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval

Synthesia stands apart from the rest of the software on this list. It's a video maker that also has an AI presenter.

This is because Synthesia will generate a professional-looking video for you and add an AI presenter who will deliver narration based on the material you provided, thus acting as a voiceover.

Features

* Avatars - Users can use this unique tool to add an AI presenter to their films. There are many pre-built avatars to pick from.

* Video with AI Presenter — Once you've chosen your avatar, all you have to do now is fill in your script. Synthesia allows you to make videos up to 2.5 hours long.

However, you must pay for add-ons if you want the following features.

Synthesia API – beginning at $49 per month. Custom Avatar – $1000 one-time.

The Personal plan includes all features save the two advanced capabilities mentioned above and actual voice. As a result, you can make up to 10 minutes of video per month.

Assume you've exhausted your video credits. More credits can be purchased for $30 for ten credits. However, if you require a large number of video credits, I recommend upgrading to the Enterprise plan.

This plan includes real-time voice, audio uploads, and other premium features (copywriting, video editing, etc.)

Cons

* Only video producers can use it. If you're a podcaster, you'll be disappointed with the tool.
* Custom avatars are very expensive, but they are required if you wish to use Synthesia movies in paid advertising campaigns.

**4.Murf.ai ( Supports Web, Mobile)**

![voice-generators-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/voice-generators-4.jpg)

Murf.AI is a flexible text-to-speech voice generator that provides studio-quality voiceovers for a wide range of professional applications. The tool has a large voice library with over 115 distinct voices in 15 languages. Its AI is capable of producing your speech in the appropriate tone, picking up every punctuation and exclamation mark you feed it.

It also has a grammatical assistant, so you can create proofread scripts that will only improve your voiceover work. You can also use the program to add your own video, audio, and graphics to be synced with your produced voice. With its enterprise plan, the tool also has a powerful collaboration capability.

Pricing

* Murf now offers three paid pricing options: (all pricing is for yearly plans).
* Monthly Basic – $13
* \-$26 per month for Pro
* Enterprise – monthly fees start at $83

The Basic package includes full HD video quality and practically all capabilities (excluding voice editing). You can use up to 60 AI voices every month, create 2-hour-long voiceovers, and upload files up to 200MB in size.

For most users, I believe this plan is adequate. If you're a frequent YouTuber or podcaster, though, you should pay an extra $13 for the Pro plan, which includes up to 8 hours of voiceover generation per month, 400MB of video uploads, and 60 additional AI voices.

Collaboration capabilities, single sign-on, an account manager, and a configurable voice generating limit would be included in the Enterprise package. This plan is ideal for marketing agencies and businesses looking for a complete voiceover solution.

Cons

* Developers, according to several critics, should add more languages. Murf has many fewer AI voices in the library than his competitors.

**5.Play.ht**

![voice-generators-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/voice-generators-5.jpg)

Features

* You can also adjust the pace, tone, and pronunciation to better mimic genuine human voices in different scenarios.
* Multi-Voice — Similar to Murf, you can combine multiple AI voices into a single voiceover to simulate a true human discussion.

* Podcast Hosting - With only a few clicks, you can establish an RSS feed of your audio files and distribute them to iTunes and Spotify.

* Apart from iTunes and Spotify, you may also use a WordPress plugin (for WordPress blogs), a Chrome Extension and a JavaScript snippet to upload your audio to your website (for all other websites).

* Sounds Analytics - Play. It will gather information on all audio. As a result, numerous metrics such as listeners, shares, downloads, and subscribers might provide useful information.

Pricing

Play. ht has four pricing tiers as of August 2021\. (all pricing below is for yearly plans).

$14.25 per month for personal use

$29.25 per month for professionals

$74.25 per month in Growth

$149.25 per month for business

Commercial rights, premium voice collecting, or podcast hosting are not included in the Personal plan, which severely limits the practical use of the voices. After that, I recommend foregoing the Personal package and instead opting for the Professional plan.

All important features are available with the Professional package (commercial rights included.) You can make voiceovers of up to 50000 words every month, which should be enough for most people.

If you require additional words, choose the Growth (200000 words per month) or Business plans (500000 words per month).

Cons

* Other than English and European languages, voices made in other languages are not flawless.

Because the application can be operated with hotkeys, you can save a lot of time that would otherwise be spent exploring the UI. Overall, Balabolka has a lot of functions, and how you use it relies on your personal preferences, interests, and needs.

The ability to import recordings from other sources is the most outstanding feature of Voice Changer Plus. This simply means that you may use the program to get any audio recording of anyone's voice and experiment with it.

Final Thoughts

As you can see, there are numerous free voiceover generators available online. Most software products come in both free and premium versions, which you can pick from depending on your needs. These programs will swiftly help you reach your text to audio transformation goals, whether you're a YouTube content maker in need of an informative voiceover or a disabled person looking for a user-friendly text-to-speech converter.

![filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/features/text-speech-img1.png)

Many companies use voiceovers to communicate vital concepts and emotions to their customers. Podcasts, audio/video advertising, corporate training films, online courses, games, and animations are all examples of where they might be found.

Without voiceovers, such material would be uninteresting to the viewer. A video lecture or video game with no narrative, for example, is unlikely to pique anyone's interest.

Good voiceovers, on the other hand, are not inexpensive to make.

Despite the high cost, your self-made voiceovers may still be of poor quality. Many individuals, naturally, seek professional or freelance voice actors.

Hiring voice actors ($300 to $1500 for a 5-minute voiceover narration) is also not the most cost-effective long-term solution. Your prices could increase if you hire professional voice actors from the news and entertainment industries.

There are resources available. Voice over generators is available online. Most software products come in both free and premium versions, which you can pick from depending on your needs. These programs will swiftly help you reach your text to audio transformation goals, whether you're a YouTube content maker in need of an informative voiceover or a disabled person looking for a user-friendly text-to-speech converter.

Yes! That's correct. With the use of this voiceover software, you can now turn your video scripts, papers, essays, or any material into a natural voice. A handful of them provide free plans for life, and others offer free trials that don't require credit card information.

Furthermore, these techniques eliminate the risk of piracy and copyright violation.

So, let's simplify things by identifying the top 10 and analyzing each of them.

1. **ai (Supports Web)**

Resemble.ai operates in a variety of ways. It can not only help you make a speech out of the text, but it can also generate text for adverts with a single click.

Price

The cheapest package is $30 per month.

For a personalized plan, contact a Resemble representative.

1. **ai ( Supports Web, Mobile**

![voice-generators-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/voice-generators-2.jpg)

Lovo.ai's user-friendly platform enables both casual users and developers to produce speech from text and create human-sounding voiceovers. Over 180 voice styles in 33 languages are available on the platform. The site is also regularly updated with new voices every day, giving consumers a wide range of options.

In just 15 minutes, the tool can generate personalized voices. On this platform, converting text to speech requires only three simple steps. Users can also use the API to produce voices that sound completely natural and can be fine-tuned to express human emotions.

Features

* Listening, conversion and sharing are all unlimited.
* A large voice library is available.
* Up to 15000 characters can be converted at once.
* Collection of unique voices. Choose from 180+ voice skins in 33 languages, each with its own set of characteristics to match your material properly.
* Genuine voices. Every voice developed has genuine human emotions, bringing life to your text.

Cons

* While the UI/UX is simple to use, it feels a little bland and dull."
* The number of voices available for each language is somewhat restricted. More voice samples are available."
* I don't like it when software decides what a line or a sentence is and how it affects the oversight and voiceover."

Pricing

Lovo.ai now offers two pricing options: (all pricing is for annual plans).

$34.99 per month for personal

$99.99 per month for Freelancer

The Personal plan gives access to all of the platform's features as well as 30 monthly voiceover downloads, which should be enough for most people.

Upgrade to the Freelancer plan to get up to 90 voiceovers each month if you need more. Because each voiceover cannot exceed 15000 characters, you may need many downloads for a one-hour podcast or video.

You will have to pay an additional $69.99 per month per voice for voice cloning. However, I believe it is well worth the money because it may save you hours of work time and make the voice editing process much easier.

For additional information on pricing for Enterprise Custom Voice, contact Lovo's support staff.

1. **Synthesia ( Supports Web, Mobile**

![voice-generators-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/voice-generators-3.jpg)

Synthesia is the fourth stage cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval

Synthesia stands apart from the rest of the software on this list. It's a video maker that also has an AI presenter.

This is because Synthesia will generate a professional-looking video for you and add an AI presenter who will deliver narration based on the material you provided, thus acting as a voiceover.

Features

* Avatars - Users can use this unique tool to add an AI presenter to their films. There are many pre-built avatars to pick from.

* Video with AI Presenter — Once you've chosen your avatar, all you have to do now is fill in your script. Synthesia allows you to make videos up to 2.5 hours long.

Pricing

Enterprise – Individualized Pricing

However, you must pay for add-ons if you want the following features.

Synthesia API – beginning at $49 per month. Custom Avatar – $1000 one-time.

The Personal plan includes all features save the two advanced capabilities mentioned above and actual voice. As a result, you can make up to 10 minutes of video per month.

Assume you've exhausted your video credits. More credits can be purchased for $30 for ten credits. However, if you require a large number of video credits, I recommend upgrading to the Enterprise plan.

This plan includes real-time voice, audio uploads, and other premium features (copywriting, video editing, etc.)

Cons

* Only video producers can use it. If you're a podcaster, you'll be disappointed with the tool.
* Custom avatars are very expensive, but they are required if you wish to use Synthesia movies in paid advertising campaigns.

**4.Murf.ai ( Supports Web, Mobile)**

![voice-generators-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/voice-generators-4.jpg)

Murf.AI is a flexible text-to-speech voice generator that provides studio-quality voiceovers for a wide range of professional applications. The tool has a large voice library with over 115 distinct voices in 15 languages. Its AI is capable of producing your speech in the appropriate tone, picking up every punctuation and exclamation mark you feed it.

It also has a grammatical assistant, so you can create proofread scripts that will only improve your voiceover work. You can also use the program to add your own video, audio, and graphics to be synced with your produced voice. With its enterprise plan, the tool also has a powerful collaboration capability.

Pricing

* Murf now offers three paid pricing options: (all pricing is for yearly plans).
* Monthly Basic – $13
* \-$26 per month for Pro
* Enterprise – monthly fees start at $83

The Basic package includes full HD video quality and practically all capabilities (excluding voice editing). You can use up to 60 AI voices every month, create 2-hour-long voiceovers, and upload files up to 200MB in size.

For most users, I believe this plan is adequate. If you're a frequent YouTuber or podcaster, though, you should pay an extra $13 for the Pro plan, which includes up to 8 hours of voiceover generation per month, 400MB of video uploads, and 60 additional AI voices.

Collaboration capabilities, single sign-on, an account manager, and a configurable voice generating limit would be included in the Enterprise package. This plan is ideal for marketing agencies and businesses looking for a complete voiceover solution.

Cons

* Developers, according to several critics, should add more languages. Murf has many fewer AI voices in the library than his competitors.

**5.Play.ht**

![voice-generators-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/voice-generators-5.jpg)

Play. Ht is a web-based voice generator that allows you to generate high-quality text-to-speech. Because of its basic user interface, the platform is exceptionally simple to use.

Features

* Customization — To fully customize the voiceover, highlight the words. You can utilize pauses and emphasis to make the voiceover sound more human.

* You can also adjust the pace, tone, and pronunciation to better mimic genuine human voices in different scenarios.
* Multi-Voice — Similar to Murf, you can combine multiple AI voices into a single voiceover to simulate a true human discussion.

* Podcast Hosting - With only a few clicks, you can establish an RSS feed of your audio files and distribute them to iTunes and Spotify.

* Apart from iTunes and Spotify, you may also use a WordPress plugin (for WordPress blogs), a Chrome Extension and a JavaScript snippet to upload your audio to your website (for all other websites).

* Sounds Analytics - Play. It will gather information on all audio. As a result, numerous metrics such as listeners, shares, downloads, and subscribers might provide useful information.

Pricing

Play. ht has four pricing tiers as of August 2021\. (all pricing below is for yearly plans).

$14.25 per month for personal use

$29.25 per month for professionals

$74.25 per month in Growth

$149.25 per month for business

Commercial rights, premium voice collecting, or podcast hosting are not included in the Personal plan, which severely limits the practical use of the voices. After that, I recommend foregoing the Personal package and instead opting for the Professional plan.

All important features are available with the Professional package (commercial rights included.) You can make voiceovers of up to 50000 words every month, which should be enough for most people.

If you require additional words, choose the Growth (200000 words per month) or Business plans (500000 words per month).

Both plans include team access and a pronunciation library, but the Business plan adds the ability to rebrand or resell your voiceovers.

Cons

* Other than English and European languages, voices made in other languages are not flawless.
* There isn't a built-in video editor for adding voiceovers to videos.

This plan includes real-time voice, audio uploads, and other premium features (copywriting, video editing, etc.)

Cons

* Only video producers can use it. If you're a podcaster, you'll be disappointed with the tool.
* Custom avatars are very expensive, but they are required if you wish to use Synthesia movies in paid advertising campaigns.

**4.Murf.ai ( Supports Web, Mobile)**

![voice-generators-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/voice-generators-4.jpg)

Murf.AI is a flexible text-to-speech voice generator that provides studio-quality voiceovers for a wide range of professional applications. The tool has a large voice library with over 115 distinct voices in 15 languages. Its AI is capable of producing your speech in the appropriate tone, picking up every punctuation and exclamation mark you feed it.

It also has a grammatical assistant, so you can create proofread scripts that will only improve your voiceover work. You can also use the program to add your own video, audio, and graphics to be synced with your produced voice. With its enterprise plan, the tool also has a powerful collaboration capability.

Pricing

* Murf now offers three paid pricing options: (all pricing is for yearly plans).
* Monthly Basic – $13
* \-$26 per month for Pro
* Enterprise – monthly fees start at $83

The Basic package includes full HD video quality and practically all capabilities (excluding voice editing). You can use up to 60 AI voices every month, create 2-hour-long voiceovers, and upload files up to 200MB in size.

For most users, I believe this plan is adequate. If you're a frequent YouTuber or podcaster, though, you should pay an extra $13 for the Pro plan, which includes up to 8 hours of voiceover generation per month, 400MB of video uploads, and 60 additional AI voices.

Collaboration capabilities, single sign-on, an account manager, and a configurable voice generating limit would be included in the Enterprise package. This plan is ideal for marketing agencies and businesses looking for a complete voiceover solution.

Cons

* Developers, according to several critics, should add more languages. Murf has many fewer AI voices in the library than his competitors.

**5.Play.ht**

![voice-generators-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/voice-generators-5.jpg)

Play. Ht is a web-based voice generator that allows you to generate high-quality text-to-speech. Because of its basic user interface, the platform is exceptionally simple to use. It has a text box on the home page where you may input your text, choose the language, gender, and voice style, and choose the conversion speed.

Features

* Customization — To fully customize the voiceover, highlight the words. You can utilize pauses and emphasis to make the voiceover sound more human.

* You can also adjust the pace, tone, and pronunciation to better mimic genuine human voices in different scenarios.
* Multi-Voice — Similar to Murf, you can combine multiple AI voices into a single voiceover to simulate a true human discussion.

* Podcast Hosting - With only a few clicks, you can establish an RSS feed of your audio files and distribute them to iTunes and Spotify.

* Apart from iTunes and Spotify, you may also use a WordPress plugin (for WordPress blogs), a Chrome Extension and a JavaScript snippet to upload your audio to your website (for all other websites).

* Sounds Analytics - Play. It will gather information on all audio. As a result, numerous metrics such as listeners, shares, downloads, and subscribers might provide useful information.

Pricing

Play. ht has four pricing tiers as of August 2021\. (all pricing below is for yearly plans).

$14.25 per month for personal use

$29.25 per month for professionals

$74.25 per month in Growth

$149.25 per month for business

Commercial rights, premium voice collecting, or podcast hosting are not included in the Personal plan, which severely limits the practical use of the voices. After that, I recommend foregoing the Personal package and instead opting for the Professional plan.

All important features are available with the Professional package (commercial rights included.) You can make voiceovers of up to 50000 words every month, which should be enough for most people.

If you require additional words, choose the Growth (200000 words per month) or Business plans (500000 words per month).

Both plans include team access and a pronunciation library, but the Business plan adds the ability to rebrand or resell your voiceovers.

Cons

* Other than English and European languages, voices made in other languages are not flawless.
* There isn't a built-in video editor for adding voiceovers to videos.

**●** **Is this concept is going to work? -** A storyboard lets you know whether the concept is going to work out or not. A storyboard helps the client to confirm whether the concept will work or not.

**●** **Arranging Shots -** A Storyboard lets you to tell you story in a limited time frame in the best way. In commercials we don’t have much time. It is like you have 60 seconds, 30 seconds, or sometimes it is just 15 seconds. So, it is the best way to make every shot count.

**●** **Saving Money -** Before making the final product, it is better to have an accepted storyboard from your client.

For example: Panel\_7\_New\_New\_New. It will be very difficult to figure out and also time consuming. The correct way to do is this: Project name\_ Script#\_Scene\_Frame\_01.JPG

### 05Do Storyboards have Dialogues?

### 03Why do you need a Storyboard?

A Storyboard is a process of pre- production. It lets you know how your story is going to flow. You will get to know the mistakes in the early stages if you make a storyboard and this will help you to save your money and time. Here are some essentials because of which you need to have a storyboard.

**●** **Is this concept is going to work? -** A storyboard lets you know whether the concept is going to work out or not. A storyboard helps the client to confirm whether the concept will work or not.

**●** **Arranging Shots -** A Storyboard lets you to tell you story in a limited time frame in the best way. In commercials we don’t have much time. It is like you have 60 seconds, 30 seconds, or sometimes it is just 15 seconds. So, it is the best way to make every shot count.

**●** **Saving Money -** Before making the final product, it is better to have an accepted storyboard from your client. In complex animations, it takes a lot of time and money so it is better to have an approved storyboard. This will let you know how the final product would look like.

### 04How to Label Storyboards?

If you are using numerous storyboards for the same shot, keeping the shots labeled is important so that everything is arranged in an order and your team can stay focused and organized. If you will use any software it will name the panel numbers automatically. In case you are not using any software and your client wants to delete, add or move a panel then you can’t name that panel.

For example: Panel\_7\_New\_New\_New. It will be very difficult to figure out and also time consuming. The correct way to do is this: Project name\_ Script#\_Scene\_Frame\_01.JPG

### 05Do Storyboards have Dialogues?

Storyboards have dialogues and you can include dialogues which will flow underneath the panels for each and every scene. If you want, you can save it on your drawing. You can name the angles and just specify them "OTS 1" and "OTS 2" with the corresponding dialogues.
