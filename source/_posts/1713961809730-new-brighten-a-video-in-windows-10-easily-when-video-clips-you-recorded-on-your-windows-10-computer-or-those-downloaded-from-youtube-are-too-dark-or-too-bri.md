## Does Windows 10 have built-in video editing software?

The answer is yes. Windows 10 has an easy-to-use video editing app. This is handy for simple home video editing, but it doesn't work well for professional movie making. Windows Movie Maker was how we edited video in the old days of Windows XP and Vista. Today, Movie Maker is still available on Windows 10, but the new video editor is built-in to the operating system.

You can use it to trim videos or create your own home movies and slideshows. You can even have it create videos automatically by taking photos as you go. Forget about buying expensive editing software. With Windows 10, you have a free video editor built into the operating system where you can trim videos, create home movies, and even create automatic montages.

## How to Zoom Video in VLC Media Player

Even though VLC Media Player is not the default video player in any operating system, most users install VLC Player separately on their computers. This is because VLC Media Player offers several useful and advanced features that the default media player like Windows Media Player lacks. There are situations when users need to zoom into certain parts of a video, and that is where VLC zoom in video feature comes in handy.

You may need to zoom into videos to pay attention to details and focus on parts around the subject that others are missing out. For example, you have recorded a video, and you have played it on VLC to zoom in and ensure that there is nothing distracting before you publish the video. Now, we will illustrate all the different ways on how to zoom in VLC Media Player. We will also suggest a better alternative to zoom into videos easily.

## Part 1: Zoom VLC Video Using Interactive Zoom

VLC Media Player comes with Interactive Zoom feature that lets you zoom into a section of a video irrespective of its resolution. You can use Interactive Zoom feature to zoom nearly eight times the original size of the video. While you zoom your video with Interactive Zoom option, VLC Media Player zooms the video digitally, and if the video resolution is not high, you can see some deterioration in video quality as you zoom in. Here are the steps on how to VLC zoom with Interactive Zoom.

Step1First, you have to enable Interactive Zoom feature. Launch VLC Player and go to Tools menu option.

Step2Select Effects and Filters and you will see Adjustments and Effects window open.

Step3Go to Video Effects tab and then go to Geometry tab.

Step4Turn on Interactive Zoom option. Click on Save and Close buttons.

![zoom in vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/vlc-adjustments-and-effects.jpg)

Step5Play a video and you will see a Picture in Picture window in the top-left corner where you can see live preview of the video. You will notice a rectangular box that you can drag around the PiP window to zoom that section of the video.

![zoom in vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/vlc-pic-in-pic.jpg)

Step6Wherever you place the rectangular box in PiP window, that part will be zoomed and shown outside the PiP window. You can increase or decrease the level of magnification from the vertical slider present below PiP window.

## Part 2: Zoom Video Using VLC Video Menu

Apart from Interactive Zoom, there is also an inbuilt Zoom option available under Video Menu. While Interactive Zoom is for detailed zooming, Zoom through Video menu on VLC is for instant zooming. Moreover, Zoom through Video menu is effective only when you view the video on VLC Player. If you are watching the video on full screen, the zooming effect will not be easily noticeable. Here are the steps on how to zoom in VLC player using VLC Video menu.

Step1Open VLC Media player in windowed mode and play the desired video.

Step2Go to Video menu and select Zoom option.

Step3You will come across several options such as 1:4 quarter, 1:2 half, 1:1 original, and 2:1 double. You can select from one of them as per your requirements.

![zoom in vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/choose-vlc-zoom-options.jpg)

Otherwise, you can press Shift + Z keys together to try out different zoom options.

## Part 3: Zoom VLC Video Using Magnifier

If you are using VLC Media Player on your Windows desktop computer, you can use the inbuilt Magnifier tool to zoom into a video that you are playing on VLC. You can zoom into videos to read any text in the background but this leads to low resolution and distortion. You can zoom in by 16 times which is the highest among all the three methods. Here are the steps on how to VLC zoom video using Magnifier tool.

Step1Open VLC Player and play the desired video.

Step2Go to Start menu on Windows and search for “Magnifier”.

![zoom in vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/zoom-vlc-video-magnifier.jpg)

Step3Click on Magnifier App. Once it opens, place the mouse pointer on the video and you will see its magnified version.

Step4Press Windows and “+” keys to zoom in while press Windows and “-“ keys to zoom out.

![zoom in vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/adjust-magnifier-windows.jpg)

## Part 4: VLC Alternative to Zoom in Videos

If you are not satisfied with VLC Player zoom feature, you can use a video editor to zoom into your video conveniently so that you can check any focused section on your video. You can also read any text on the video comfortably. We recommend [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) as an alternative to VLC Media Player for zooming into videos.

Move the Playhead to 5 seconds. Click on “**+Add**” to add a keyframe to the clip. Then, move the Playhead to the next-to-last frame and increase the **Opacity** to **100%.** Click **OK.**

![increase opacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/keyframe.png)

Step 10

Set the Playhead to the second frame and drop the first Snapshot we took earlier at that starting point. Drag the clip to be 6 seconds long. Then, double-click on the clip and adjust the settings exactly as you see in this image here. Don’t click on **OK** yet.

![adjust clip settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/settings.png)

Step 11

Move the Playhead at the 17th frame → increase the **Opacity** to **6%.** Move the Playhead to 5 seconds and 23rd frame → change the **X-axis** value to **“1973”.** Click **OK.**

![edit snapshot settings filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/edit-snapshot.png)

Step 12

Drag the same Snapshot file to Track 4, directly on top of the clip in Track 3\. Make its duration the same too. Now, double-click on this clip and apply the exact same settings as in the image here. Don’t click on **OK** yet.

![edit snapshot animation settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/apply-settings.png)

Step 13

Move the Playhead to the 17th frame → increase the **Opacity** to **6%.** Now, move the Playhead to 5 seconds and 23rd frame → change **X-axis value** to **“-1944”** and the **Opacity** to **0%.** Click **OK.**

![apply snapshot settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/more-settings.png)

Step 14

Go to **Sample Color** and drag the **White** color on Track 6 in the Timeline. Place this clip at the same starting point as the snapshots below it. Set its duration the same as the clips below too. Then, move the Playhead at its starting point.

![sample color](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/white.png)

Step 15

Double-click on the Sample Color clip → go to **Video** → **Mask** → **Import.** Here, select the first Snapshot we created earlier in this tutorial.

![import mask filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/mask.png)

Step 16

Now, go straight to the **Animation** tab and click the “**+Add**” button to add a keyframe. Then, compress the text in the preview screen until it's not visible anymore on the screen.

![compress text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/compress.png)

Step 17

Add keyframes at the 1-second position and at the 5-second position. Then, move the Playhead once more to the 5-second and 22nd frame. Reduce the **Opacity** to **1%.** Click **OK.**

![reduce opacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/one-percent.png)

Step 18

Drag another White Sample Color to Track 5 this time. Adjust its duration and starting point to be the same as the clip above it. Double-click on it → go to **Video** → **Mask** → **Import.** Here, select the flipped text Snapshot we created earlier.

Step 19

Now, go to **Animation** and add a keyframe at the starting point. Then, compress the text on the preview screen exactly as we did before with the other one. Then, add a keyframe at the 1-second position of the clip. Then, adjust the **Y-axis** position to create a reflection effect, just like this.

![reflection effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/reflection.png)

Step 20

Move the Playhead to the 5-second position and add a keyframe. Now, move the Playhead directly to 5-seconds and 22 frames. Here, reduce the **Opacity** to **0%.**

Step 21

Go back to the **Video** tab from the upper-left corner of the panel. Now, move the Playhead to the clip’s starting point. Select the **Mask** tab. Add a keyframe. Move the Playhead to 1 second and set the **Blur Strength** to **6%.**

![blur strength](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/blur.png)

Step 22

Move the Playhead to 3 seconds. Scroll down and set **Vertical** to **259%.** Set **Y-axis** to **“-157”.** Then, increase **Blur Strength** to **25%.** Click **OK.**

![blur effect settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/y-axis.png)

Step 23

Click on the Sample Color in Track 5 and change the **Opacity** to **40%** for the second and third keyframes. You can move between the keyframes on the arrows highlighted below. Click **OK.**

![move keyframes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/keyframes.png)

Step 24

Go to **Sample Color** and drag the **“Gradient 4”** color to Track 7 on the Timeline. Allow this clip to start from the very beginning and adjust its end time to be the same as all the other clips.

Step 25

Double-click on the Gradient 4 clip → go to **Video** → **Basic.** Change the **Blending Mode** to **“Soft Light”**. Reduce the **Opacity** to **42%.** Click **OK.**

![sample color settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/gradient.png)

Step 26

Go to **Project Media** and drag the white smoke clip on Track 8\. Place the Playhead at the starting point and double-click on the clip.

![project media filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/project-media.png)

Step 27

Change its **Blending Mode** to **“Screen”.** Go to the **Animation** tab and decrease the **Opacity** to **0%.** Move the Playhead to frame 10 → increase **Opacity** to **12%.** Move the Playhead to the 5-second position → add a keyframe. Then, move the Playhead at 5 seconds and 23rd frame → increase the **Opacity** back to **100%.** Click **OK.**

Step 28

Go to **Effects** and drag the **Cinema** effect to Track 9\. Adjust its duration to match all the other clips. Double-click on the clip and increase its **Border Height** to **“0.10”.** Click **OK.**

![border height](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/border.png)

Step 29

Finally, Render the video and watch the final result. You’re done! Congratulations on resting a foggy text reflection effect in Filmora.
