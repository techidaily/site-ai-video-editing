## Magic Effects Video Making [How To]

Magic inspires and fascinates everyone. Editors often rely on it to create suspense and attraction in their films. With an all-in-one video editor, Filmora, you can get creative and use ample stupefying effects to amuse your viewers. Before delving into the details of step-by-step guides of some magic effects, let's examine these effects.

## Part 1\. What Are Magic Effects?

In terms of video editing, visual effects which imply the presence of supernatural forces (the ones having power over natural forces) are called magic effects. They could belong to any of the effects of charm, i.e., sudden appearance, vanishing, transposition, transformation, etc. For example, in Harry Potter's classic scene, everyone waves a lit magic wand. To make this kinetic effect ourselves at home, read on.

![importing clips to filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-3.png)

##### Step3 Add Your Photos and Videos to the Timeline

Your next step will be to add the imported videos and images to the timeline. When you have many videos and photos imported into the timeline, you can add them simultaneously.

Or you can also add them one by one wherever you need. To add an item to your timeline, follow the steps mentioned.

* **Right-click** on the photo or video you want to add to the timeline.
* Keep holding the right-click and drag it down to the timeline.

![adding shots to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-4.png)

##### Step4 Adding the Magic Imitating Effect

After these initial setups, you must add the effects from filmstock to our clips. These are pre-made presets of different clipart and graphics, executing unique movements and effects. For their introduction in the video, read along with the following procedure:

* After dragging and dropping the clip onto the first track on the timeline, go to the stickers tab on the top left ribbon, click it, and scroll down to the filmstock dropdown.

![finding the magic effects from filmstock](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-5.png)

* From there, open the Bling Bling Effect Pack and choose the bling light effect of your liking. Then, drag and drop that effect onto the second video track on the timeline.

![adding the effect to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-6.png)

* Adjust the element's scale according to your required size from the editing menu after double-clicking the element.

![adding the effect to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-7.png)

* Move the **playhead** to locate the brightest moment of the element. Now, right-click and select **Add Freeze Frame.** It will freeze the element at that exact frame

![adding freeze frame to the element](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-8.png)

* Find the spot on the base clip's timeline where the corresponding LED used while shooting turns on. Then, bring the element to the second track and adjust its position.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** ensure the element's freeze frame starts when the anticipated magic wand light is glowing.

![adjusting the start of effect on the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-9.png)

* Adjust the duration to match the end of the two clips on the timeline.

![bringing the ends of the two frames together](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-10.png)

##### Step5 Adding Keyframe Movement to the Element

It is time to add some keyframes. Once you have successfully added the effect element onto your editing workspace, you have to make it do the magic. Attaching the magic effect bling to the base (background) video is like painting your canvas for the magic to occur. It is a crucial step for bringing out those Harry Potter-like magical feats. Continue scrolling for step-by-step instructions.

* Double-click the effect element and open the Editing Menu.

![opening the editing menu](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-11.png)

* In the basic tab, as visible above, **Check** the key-shaped button in front of the Transform button. It will create a Keyframe in the default form of your motion element. Then **adjust** the element's position at the wand's tip on the preview window.

![positioning the element at the desired location](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-12.png)

##### Step6 Detailing the Effect Through Keyframing

This part of the procedure is iterative. You will see how keyframing can open several doors of creative freedom in front of you and how many motion effects are possible through it.

* Move the playhead further right and stop where the element is not on top of the magic wand's tip. Then, add another keyframe following the same procedure and adjust the element's position onto the wand's tip.

![eeadjusting the elements position](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/magic-effects-13.png)

Repeat the above step for as long as the wand is in motion in the clip. Feel free to spend more time on this step. The more keyframes you add, the more seamless your stunt will look.

Finally, it is time to look at the results. Witness how you have curated a magical masterpiece.

## How To Make Flying Objects in Wondershare Filmora

Let us be honest here, you want to create fly objects in the air but don't want to get into the witchcraft school. In that case, we have got your back!

In this article, you can learn how to make objects fly in the air! Technically you will not do that in real-time, but with the latest technology and editing tools at your disposal, you will exactly do that.

Use [**Wondershare Filmora**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to create the flying object effect. Scroll below to get the guide to the whole process of creation.

## Part 1\. What will you need to make a flying object?

This is not witchcraft, so we will abstain from using potions and herbs. Instead, to fly objects in our videos, we will use simple techniques that you may also be familiar with.

### [Video Cameras](https://www.usa.canon.com/shop/cameras/dslr-cameras)

The camera, in this scenario, will be the essential accessory as it will capture your video with the proper aspect ratio. This video camera can now be from a mobile phone or a high-quality DSLR. It will all depend upon your preference for quality and frame rate.

![dslr camera](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/dslr-camera.jpg)

### [Tri-Pod](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Lightweight-Camera-Mount-Tripod/dp/B00XI87KV8/ref=sr%5F1%5F1%5Fsspa?keywords=tripod&qid=1670223756&sr=8-1-spons&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyRU5FQjJKUk1JR0FJJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwODkzMjE0M1ZJVDY4M0FZVU5PVSZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMDU3NTY1MklFS1FJWjBDNlNITiZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU&th=1)or camera stands

Selecting the Tri-Pod is also crucial to your quality of video taking as it will ensure stability while capturing the video from the camera.

![tri pod stand](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/tri-pod-stand.jpg)

Stability is the key here, as the captured videos will be masked and combined in the later stages of the steps. To do so, consistently capturing the video in the same ratio is necessary. You can stabilize the video with a simple gorilla pod that you can get of good quality or a simple tripod.

### The prop

The prop will be the object that we will be flying in the video. It could be a fluffy toy, a ball, a box, or anything you desire to be flying in your video.

![note](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** In this article, we are going to use a ball as a prop.

![the prop ball](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/the-prop-ball.jpg)

### [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Now that we have all the physical requirements for the video, our next goal is to ensure that we have the correct video editing software. And what's best than Wondershare Filmora? Obviously, there's nothing!

[Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) allows you to edit your videos with ease and comfort. With its interactive UI, even a beginner feels easy to edit a video. With skills on hand, an expert can edit videos ranging from green screen effects to flying objects.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

![wondershare filmora logo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/wondershare-filmora-logo.jpg)

### Good presentation

Now, if you want your video to shine like the good ones, you will need to know how to present it. In this section, the requirement will be yourself. As you are not flying an object, you must act the part.

A good presentation will allow you to make the video more natural. Because no matter how skilled you are with video editing, a video with props will only be of quality until the subject acts their part with quality.

## Part 2\. How to capture the footage?

Before we get into how we edit our footage, we need to know how to shoot the video to edit. Follow the steps mentioned below:

* **Set up** your camera on a tripod or a gorilla pod.
* After setting up the camera, **record** an empty frame.

![note](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** An empty frame video will be the one you will use to mask the original clip.

### Reference video

Start recording a five-second clip of the sofa where you will be sitting without yourself or the prop. Here you don't need to add anything except the reference. Follow the guidelines below when making the reference video:

* The video should be plain.
* It should be simple.
* There should be no moving object or subject.

![reference video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/reference-video.gif)

### Main video

After shooting the empty frame video, move on to shooting the video with yourself in it. Follow the below to achieve something unique:

* Your focus should be on the prop.
* Use a thread or a rope to attach the prop to it. (In this case, we are using a ball.)
* Attach the ball to the thread and hand it on the roof.
* Record yourself now with the prop with your desired content or script.

![main video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/main-video.gif)

After completing the video, simply stop recording. Now you will end up with two video clips.

Adding these two clips in the [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you can easily create the flying object effect. To do so, follow the steps explained in the section ahead.

## Part 3\. Stepwise guide to making flying objects in Wondershare Filmora

Now that we have looked into our requirements, let us dive into how we will apply our skills to achieve an object to fly in [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

Of course, without the software, our editing will not be possible, so download Wondershare Filmora from the steps explained below.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

##### Step1Open the Wondershare Filmora software

* Open the Wondershare Filmora software and Click on the New Project icon on the window.
* After you have clicked on the New Project icon, our main workplace will be launched.
* Here you can see various options.
* To get started, we need to import our video clips to edit them.

![steps explaining how to import media](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/steps-explaining-how-to-import-media.jpg)

* Here, you can see two ways to import your clips in Wondershare Filmora.

1. Shows you how to import by Right-Clicking on File and selecting the import media option.
2. Shows you to drag and drop the file from your main directory simply.

You can choose whatever suits you the best!

##### Step2Add your clips to your timeline

Now that we have imported our videos into the timeline, our next step will be to add our videos to the timeline.

* Simply click on the imported clips on the import window.
* Then drag it to the timeline below.
* Doing so will create a working timeline you can view and edit as you go along the editing process.

![dragging video clips to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/dragging-video-clips-to-the-timeline.jpg)

##### Step3Size the reference video to the original video

Now, remember that we recorded a five-second clip that we will use to create the masking effect. You will need to size it to the original video for that to work. Doing so is simple and will require you to take some easy steps.

* First, click on the clip.
* Then, when it is selected, move on to the tab above to choose the speed option from the bar.
* Here, you will also see options such as cropping, Green screen, and color.
* Choose the option of speed.
* Then, a drop-down tile will pop up. Here you can see different options available to speed up your video.

![adjust the speed of the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/adjust-the-speed-of-the-video.jpg)

* You can speed up your video and slow it down.
* For now, we will have to slow it down.

![note](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Slowing it down will increase the time of the video clip and allow you to match it with the original video clip.

Don't worry about the speed, as the video is already empty, and there will be no distractions to disturb our editing.

##### Step4Add the masking effect

Now that we have our video aligned with the reference video we are using. Let's move to the next step.

This step will try to remove the thread attached to the ball; otherwise, it will show in the video, and our effect will be ruined. However, before we do that, we will need to know what **masking** is.

##### What is the Masking effect in Wondershare Filmora?

Have you ever seen the behind-the-scenes of those big-budget movies? Then you might have seen the actors and the stunt workers hanging from big ropes performing stunts in front of green screens.

Well, the directors capture the video in real-time. But they can do those big stunts on TV with editing and CGI, and one of the effects is "**Masking**."

The masking effect allows you to mask the object on the screen with a reference video. So that's how the ropes attached to the stuntmen get removed in the original videos.

##### How to add a masking effect?

Although there are numerous ways to do that, the one we will use in this video is to remove the thread. For this, follow the below steps:

* Simply go to the **effect icon** that you can see in the bar above.
* In the effects bar, move to the utility tab.
* You will see a window showing you the many effects Wondershare Filmora provides you from default.
* Select the shape mask tile.
* Now drag and drop it on the timeline below.

![adding the shape mask effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/adding-the-shape-mask-effect.gif)

![note](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You must ensure the effect is applied to the main video, not the reference video.

* When you drag the effect into the main video, you will notice a transparent shape added to the video. This is your **Mask**.

##### Step5Edit the masking effect

You must hide the thread attached to the ball with the masking effect. To do this, follow the below guidelines:

* Double-click on the effect added to the main video.
* You will notice another window pop up on the import library.

![note](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** In the pop-up window, you will see the multiple options and edits you can apply to the masking effect, such as Transform, Compositing, Motion tracking, and stabilization.

![wondershare filmora effect editing panel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/wondershare-filmora-effect-editing-panel.jpg)

* Scroll down on the window and notice a video **effect tab**.

In the effect tab, you will have multiple options, such as the shape mask, X, Y, and scale and blur strength options, as shown below.

* Now adjust the mask to hide the string. It may be easy to invert the mask.

![note](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** That the borders of the mask are blurred. But you can also change them by inverting the mask, which turns the borders and the space between them.

**Remember** the invisibility cloak from Harry Potter? It works just like that, only with a solid shape.

* Now use the **X** and **Y options** to move the mask anywhere in the video.

![inverting the mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/inverting-the-mask.gif)

##### Step6Hide the sharp borders

You may notice the shape of borders that do not blend with the background. To blend the borders with the background, follow the steps below:

* Simply **Double-click** on the effect in the timeline.
* Then, in the editing tab, find out the blur strength option.

![blending or fading the border of the mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/blending-or-fading-the-border-of-the-mask.gif)

* Simply **drag** the bar to increase the blur strength.

![note](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Please keep looking in the window on the right. Check and increase the blur strength until you are satisfied with the result.

* Lastly, click on **OK** when you are done.

##### Step7Creating the popup effect

Now, if you want your object to appear out of thin air, you must create that pop-up effect. You can create the pop-up effect in simple and easy steps, as shown below:

* First, drag the timeline dragger to the point where you want the prop or the ball to pop up.

**Your presentation should be accurate and precise!**

Imagine you were doing a "**swoosh**" action, similar to swinging a wand. Now you want your object to appear at that time.

**Split the Video:**

* **Drag** the timeline dragger to that point.
* Now press **Ctrl+B** to split both videos.

**Add Popup Effect:**

The masking effect will be applied from the start. Our goal is to hide the masking effect before the ball pop-ups. For this, follow the below steps:

* Go into the setting by **Double-Clicking** the masking effect on the original video.
* Then **move** the mask over the ball instead of on the thread. Doing so would make the ball disappear.

![moving the mask to hide the ball](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/moving-the-mask-to-hide-the-ball.gif)

### Good presentation

Now, if you want your video to shine like the good ones, you will need to know how to present it. In this section, the requirement will be yourself. As you are not flying an object, you must act the part.

A good presentation will allow you to make the video more natural. Because no matter how skilled you are with video editing, a video with props will only be of quality until the subject acts their part with quality.

## Part 2\. How to capture the footage?

Before we get into how we edit our footage, we need to know how to shoot the video to edit. Follow the steps mentioned below:

* **Set up** your camera on a tripod or a gorilla pod.
* After setting up the camera, **record** an empty frame.

![note](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** An empty frame video will be the one you will use to mask the original clip.

### Reference video

Start recording a five-second clip of the sofa where you will be sitting without yourself or the prop. Here you don't need to add anything except the reference. Follow the guidelines below when making the reference video:

* The video should be plain.
* It should be simple.
* There should be no moving object or subject.

![reference video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/reference-video.gif)

### Main video

After shooting the empty frame video, move on to shooting the video with yourself in it. Follow the below to achieve something unique:

* Your focus should be on the prop.
* Use a thread or a rope to attach the prop to it. (In this case, we are using a ball.)
* Attach the ball to the thread and hand it on the roof.
* Record yourself now with the prop with your desired content or script.

![main video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/main-video.gif)

After completing the video, simply stop recording. Now you will end up with two video clips.

Adding these two clips in the [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you can easily create the flying object effect. To do so, follow the steps explained in the section ahead.

## Part 3\. Stepwise guide to making flying objects in Wondershare Filmora

Now that we have looked into our requirements, let us dive into how we will apply our skills to achieve an object to fly in [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

Of course, without the software, our editing will not be possible, so download Wondershare Filmora from the steps explained below.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

##### Step1Open the Wondershare Filmora software

* Open the Wondershare Filmora software and Click on the New Project icon on the window.
* After you have clicked on the New Project icon, our main workplace will be launched.
* Here you can see various options.
* To get started, we need to import our video clips to edit them.

![steps explaining how to import media](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/steps-explaining-how-to-import-media.jpg)

* Here, you can see two ways to import your clips in Wondershare Filmora.

1. Shows you how to import by Right-Clicking on File and selecting the import media option.
2. Shows you to drag and drop the file from your main directory simply.

You can choose whatever suits you the best!

##### Step2Add your clips to your timeline

Now that we have imported our videos into the timeline, our next step will be to add our videos to the timeline.

* Simply click on the imported clips on the import window.
* Then drag it to the timeline below.
* Doing so will create a working timeline you can view and edit as you go along the editing process.

![dragging video clips to the timeline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/dragging-video-clips-to-the-timeline.jpg)

##### Step3Size the reference video to the original video

Now, remember that we recorded a five-second clip that we will use to create the masking effect. You will need to size it to the original video for that to work. Doing so is simple and will require you to take some easy steps.

* First, click on the clip.
* Then, when it is selected, move on to the tab above to choose the speed option from the bar.
* Here, you will also see options such as cropping, Green screen, and color.
* Choose the option of speed.
* Then, a drop-down tile will pop up. Here you can see different options available to speed up your video.

![adjust the speed of the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/adjust-the-speed-of-the-video.jpg)

* You can speed up your video and slow it down.
* For now, we will have to slow it down.

![note](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Slowing it down will increase the time of the video clip and allow you to match it with the original video clip.

Don't worry about the speed, as the video is already empty, and there will be no distractions to disturb our editing.

##### Step4Add the masking effect

Now that we have our video aligned with the reference video we are using. Let's move to the next step.

This step will try to remove the thread attached to the ball; otherwise, it will show in the video, and our effect will be ruined. However, before we do that, we will need to know what **masking** is.

##### What is the Masking effect in Wondershare Filmora?

Have you ever seen the behind-the-scenes of those big-budget movies? Then you might have seen the actors and the stunt workers hanging from big ropes performing stunts in front of green screens.

Well, the directors capture the video in real-time. But they can do those big stunts on TV with editing and CGI, and one of the effects is "**Masking**."

The masking effect allows you to mask the object on the screen with a reference video. So that's how the ropes attached to the stuntmen get removed in the original videos.

##### How to add a masking effect?

Although there are numerous ways to do that, the one we will use in this video is to remove the thread. For this, follow the below steps:

* Simply go to the **effect icon** that you can see in the bar above.
* In the effects bar, move to the utility tab.
* You will see a window showing you the many effects Wondershare Filmora provides you from default.
* Select the shape mask tile.
* Now drag and drop it on the timeline below.

![adding the shape mask effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/adding-the-shape-mask-effect.gif)

![note](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** You must ensure the effect is applied to the main video, not the reference video.

* When you drag the effect into the main video, you will notice a transparent shape added to the video. This is your **Mask**.

##### Step5Edit the masking effect

You must hide the thread attached to the ball with the masking effect. To do this, follow the below guidelines:

* Double-click on the effect added to the main video.
* You will notice another window pop up on the import library.

![note](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** In the pop-up window, you will see the multiple options and edits you can apply to the masking effect, such as Transform, Compositing, Motion tracking, and stabilization.

![wondershare filmora effect editing panel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/wondershare-filmora-effect-editing-panel.jpg)

* Scroll down on the window and notice a video **effect tab**.

In the effect tab, you will have multiple options, such as the shape mask, X, Y, and scale and blur strength options, as shown below.

* Now adjust the mask to hide the string. It may be easy to invert the mask.

![note](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** That the borders of the mask are blurred. But you can also change them by inverting the mask, which turns the borders and the space between them.

**Remember** the invisibility cloak from Harry Potter? It works just like that, only with a solid shape.

* Now use the **X** and **Y options** to move the mask anywhere in the video.

![inverting the mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/inverting-the-mask.gif)

##### Step6Hide the sharp borders

You may notice the shape of borders that do not blend with the background. To blend the borders with the background, follow the steps below:

* Simply **Double-click** on the effect in the timeline.
* Then, in the editing tab, find out the blur strength option.

![blending or fading the border of the mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/blending-or-fading-the-border-of-the-mask.gif)

* Simply **drag** the bar to increase the blur strength.

![note](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Please keep looking in the window on the right. Check and increase the blur strength until you are satisfied with the result.

* Lastly, click on **OK** when you are done.

##### Step7Creating the popup effect

Now, if you want your object to appear out of thin air, you must create that pop-up effect. You can create the pop-up effect in simple and easy steps, as shown below:

* First, drag the timeline dragger to the point where you want the prop or the ball to pop up.

**Your presentation should be accurate and precise!**

Imagine you were doing a "**swoosh**" action, similar to swinging a wand. Now you want your object to appear at that time.

**Split the Video:**

* **Drag** the timeline dragger to that point.
* Now press **Ctrl+B** to split both videos.

**Add Popup Effect:**

The masking effect will be applied from the start. Our goal is to hide the masking effect before the ball pop-ups. For this, follow the below steps:

* Go into the setting by **Double-Clicking** the masking effect on the original video.
* Then **move** the mask over the ball instead of on the thread. Doing so would make the ball disappear.

![moving the mask to hide the ball](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/moving-the-mask-to-hide-the-ball.gif)

**Final Results:**

* Lastly, click on **Ok** when done.

Play the clip from the start, and you will notice the ball popping up according to your action.

![final preview](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/final-preview.gif)

## What You Should Know About Speech-to-Text Technology

Speech-to-text technology (**STT**) improves communication, especially in a multi-language setting. One of the ways we practice multilingualism is via **speech-to-text technology:** speakers input a language, and viewers read another language. Other advantages include converting oral speech into a document, real-time compatibility, and offline usage. This article explains how you can utilize **speech-to-text assistance** technology for optimal productivity.

![speech to text technology](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/speech-to-text-technology.jpg)

## Part 1: What is speech-to-text technology?

Speech-to-text technology (STT) identifies oral pronunciation and converts them into computer codes: electronic words. The computer electro-communication requires a medium of conversion: receiver and interpreter. Therefore, speech-to-text technology contains both the receiver and interpreter, which exist electronically. The medium or receiver can be software installed on a device; it must have a receiver and a screen. The computer serves a good purpose, although other devices can receive words without displaying them.

A speech-to-text technology does not necessarily have to contain displaying screen: a sound interpreter may replace the screen. Thus, speech-to-text can be oral words - electronic recognition - word encoding - display, or recitation. Oral wordings are the human's contribution to speech-to-text technology, although all communication (especially speech) may be generated from a computer. Inter-device communication is another advancement of speech-to-text technology. For example, combining one or more devices allow you to use speech-to-text assistance technology in different languages.

Communication is the paramount importance in speech-to-text technology. Still, some advantages include easy data conversion, documentation, workflow flexibility, and easy access to data. For example, documentation is incomplete if every human cannot access the file. All humans cannot read; improvising data into oral documents reduces the percentage of people who cannot access the file. Speech-to-text increases the channel for less privileged individuals. For instance, the deaf who cannot listen to a recorded file can read the file via speech-to-text technology.

Speech-to-text technology incorporates many advantages. Learning to use the technology is the first step in familiarizing and getting yourself equipped.

## Part 2: What are the stages for the technology?

STT gives so many stages and applications for a daily and smooth organization. Some include:

### 1\. Education

Education and the love to study other languages increase with speech-to-text technology. The educative application is not limited to four corners of the room; it extends to all daily learning activities. Communication is educative if you learn new things via communication.

STT improves all processes associated with less privileged education. For example, everyone easily pours their mind into a computer screen page when they speak, especially in the language they understand using STT. Time and submission date are important factors in the educational system; STT improves time, submission, accuracy, and authentication.

### 2\. Video Subtitles

Videography and filmmaking carry a large percentage of today's media. Data input and integration in the video-making process weigh a lot, and the concept of STT reduces the load on the data specialist. Instead of long hours of typing, oral communication is applicable. Processing time is a factor of productivity; STTs do not only affect the time of production but also maintain accuracy.

### 3\. Chatbots

Chatbots are available on websites. Users have different preferences: some can type while others like to communicate via speech. The chatbots attend to users' needs; you can do more with STT if installed on the website. STT promotes freedom of communication and increases user interaction on your website. STT may be incorporated into mobile applications too. There is more to STT, and the advantage is unlimited if you add it to your chatbots.

![chatbots](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/speech-to-text-technology-2.jpg)

### 4\. Translation

Translation is the interconversion of languages. The main reason translation is important is because communication is essential; without communication, production will be static. STT is among the tool that elevates productivity via communication. For example, STT improves communication in a situation where more than one language combines as one.

## Part 3: What are the best STT Technology provider

### 1\. Amazon web services

STT is one of the services in the Amazon web services. The STT is available for all users who subscribe to one or more Amazon services. Some features include unlimited conversion, easy download, and availability in multiple formats. To get started, you need to sign up for a free AWS account and begin to enjoy the offer. Although the services are available for all users, limitations, and upgrades come a few times when you must pay for certain premium services.

![amazon web services](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/speech-to-text-technology-3.jpg)

### 2\. Google docs voice typing

Google docs voice typing is available for all Google users. You can access the Google docs voice typing provided you are on a service by Google. The service is available on the Google docs application - one of the services created by Google. Google docs are free for download and available for desktop and mobile users.

![google docs voice typing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/speech-to-text-technology-4.jpg)

### 3\. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Wondershare Filmora STT is quite different with other STT service providers. Other STT platforms/stages require you to use the application to convert speech-to-text, save, and export into other third-party software. However, Wondershare Filmora allows you to directly convert your speech-to-text on an ongoing production. For example, you can convert speech into subtitles during a video production on Wondershare Filmora.

![wondershare filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/speech-to-text-technology-5.jpg)

### 4\. Microsoft dictate

The Microsoft dictate shows to have the same build-up as the Microsoft Cortana Virtual Assistant. It gives free access to all users who convert speech-to-text without subscribing to any platform. The Microsoft dictate is a default option for many Microsoft devices and partners' software. Microsoft dictates accuracy is appreciable; it is likewise easy to use.

![microsoft dictate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/speech-to-text-technology-6.jpg)

## Part 1: How to Slow Down Videos in YouTube?

If you watch YouTube videos often, you must have been aware of the **YouTube slow-down** feature. The playback adjustment option on YouTube helps with that. By enabling that option, the whole YouTube video slows down. For adding slow-motion effects at specific durations, you can use [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). In this part, we’ll explore both methods of slowing down a YouTube video:

* [Method 1\. Direct Method](#method1)
* [Method 2\. Using Wondershare Filmora](#method2)

### Method 1\. Direct Method

If you have the YouTube application, you can commence this action straight. If not, you can also open YouTube on your browser. Given below are the steps to **play YouTube in slow motion**:

##### Step 1

Once you play a YouTube video, navigate towards the bottom of this video. Afterward, click on the "Settings" option and select the "Playback speed" option.

![access playback speed settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/guide-to-slow-motion-youtube-videos-1.jpg)

##### Step 2

From the expansion menu, select a playback speed option as per preferences. You can select a speed between 0.75, 0.5, and 0.25\. Afterward, play your video and see if the speed is right. This is the simplest method for **YouTube video slow motion**.

![change speed on youtube directly](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/guide-to-slow-motion-youtube-videos-2.jpg)

### Method 2\. Using Wondershare Filmora

In Wondershare Filmora, there are two methods to **slow down YouTube videos**. You can either use the Uniform Speed option or the Speed Ramping option. Moreover, you can add the Optical Flow effect to ensure a smooth, slow motion. In this section, we will first familiarize you with downloading a YouTube video. Here are the three major steps to create slow-motion in Filmora:

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

#### Step 1Downloading a YouTube Video

YouTube doesn't allow users to download a YouTube video on their devices. Hence, you will need third-party support to do so. Many sites offer YouTube video download services. We are using the [y2mate.com](https://www.y2mate.com/en870), and here are the steps for it:

**1\. Copy the YouTube Video Link**

First, access the respective video that you want to download from YouTube. Locate the "Share" option at the bottom of this video and select it. Then click the "Copy" option to copy your video's link.

![copy link of youtube video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/guide-to-slow-motion-youtube-videos-3.jpg)

**2\. Access the Site**

After copying the video's link, access the site using your web browser. In the "Search or paste link here" box, paste the video link and click "Start." From the download options appearing at the bottom, select a suitable option. Click on the "Download" button adjacent to your option.

![open and download youtube video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/guide-to-slow-motion-youtube-videos-4.jpg)

#### Step 2Slow Down YouTube Video in Filmora

Once you have downloaded the video on your device, it is time to **slow down the YouTube video**. Filmora offers a plain and simple method to slow down a video. Here is a step-by-step guide to help you create video slow-mo in Filmora:

**1\. Import the YouTube Video**

Since Wondershare Filmora is a desktop tool, you must download it first. Initiate it and click the "New Project" option to reach its editing interface. Click on the "Import" option to import the video you downloaded. Afterward, bring this video to the timeline using the drag-and-drop technique.

![import video to filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/guide-to-slow-motion-youtube-videos-5.jpg)

**2\. Access Uniform Speed**

Select the video in the timeline and direct it toward the settings panel appearing on the right side. From the given tabs, go to the “Speed” tab and select “Uniform Speed.” Further, adjust the “Speed” slider or its value in the given box. This will slow down your video, and you can preview it to adjust further.

![access speed settings and change](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/guide-to-slow-motion-youtube-videos-6.jpg)

#### Step 3Smoothing Out the YouTube Slow-Mo

Upon previewing the YouTube slo-mo, you might notice some roughness in it. For creating a smooth slow-mo, use the Optical Flow option. Here are the steps to enable this option in Filmora:

**1\. Enable the Optical Flow Option**

Navigate toward the "AI Frame Interpolation" section. You can find it at the bottom of the Uniform Speed tab. Afterward, expand this section and select the "Optical Flow" option.

![look out for ai frame interpolation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/guide-to-slow-motion-youtube-videos-7.jpg)

**2\. Render the YouTube Slow-Mo**

Once you have enabled optical flow, direct it toward the timeline tool panel. Select the "Render Preview" option from there and see your video afterward. You'll have a professional-level slow **YouTube slow-motion** video.
