## How To Add Text In After Effects

In almost every video you come across, you will see text added to the video in different parts. There are various reasons why adding text to videos becomes a necessity. First of all, you can highlight the underlying message or key points in your video. Along with audio and video, the viewers will have another cue point in the form of text that they can retain in their memory for longer. You add animated texts to video to make the video interesting to watch and break the monotony of visual cues only.

Besides, you may have to want credits and add intro as well as outro to your video where adding text is almost a necessity. Text can help your viewer get the context of your video and make sense of the content. After Effects is a popular video editor thanks to its visual effects, text animation animations, and instant video enhancement tools. We will illustrate the different ways of adding text in After Effects in simple steps.

## Part 1\. Add Text in After Effects with Horizontal Type Tool

Once you have imported your video clip into the Timeline, there are several ways you can add text to your video. First of all, you can right-click on the Timeline and select New> Text to create an empty text layer and add any text you want. Similarly, you can go to Layer> New> Text option to do the same. But the easiest way of adding text in After Effects is by using Horizontal Type Tool. Here are the steps on how you can add text in AE with the type tool.

Step1Once you have imported your video into the Timeline, click on Horizontal Type Tool located in the top bar to add any text. You can press Ctrl+T(Windows) or Command+H(Mac) to get it instantly.

![horizontal type tool ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/horizontal-type-tool-ae.jpg)

Step2Click on the video where you want to place the text and type your desired text there. After you are done adding your text, press Enter key in Num pad to exit out of the text field in the video.

![add text field ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/add-text-field-ae.jpg)

Step3This will automatically create a text layer on Timeline. You can now move the text and place it anywhere you want. You can also modify the text style and add animation which we will illustrate in the next section.

## Part 2\. Use the Character Panel to Edit Text in AE

When you select Type tool and add your desired text, you get a default style for the text. It is most likely that you have to modify the text style such as changing color, font, and size to fit in your video seamlessly. That is when you have to visit the Character Panel. Character Panel is where you get to edit the font of the text you have typed, increase or decrease the font size, change the font color, and much more. Apart from that, you can increase the spacing between lines when your text is a paragraph instead of a few words. Here are the steps to use Character Panel to edit text in AE.

Step1Once you have typed your text using Horizontal Type tool on the video, click on the text.

Step2Go to Character panel located in the right side of the screen. If it is minimized, click on the panel to expand it.

![character panel after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/character-panel-after-effects.jpg)

Step3The first option in the panel is the font of the text. By the side of the font is the text color. You can use the color picker tool to choose any color as per your preference.

![choose font color ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/choose-font-color-ae.jpg)

Step4Below the font, you can select the font style such as regular, bold, italics, and likewise. The subsequent part is to change the font size and adjust vertical spacing between lines and horizontal spacing between characters.

![select font style ae](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/select-font-style-ae.jpg)

Step5The next section deals with Stroke option as well as fill the text option. You can fill the background of the text with any desired color.

## Part 3\. Add Animated Text to Video with Animation Presets

Now that you have added a static text and set the text format as per your preference, it is time to animate the text. A static text in a video does not look appealing, and animated texts make the video eye-catching instantly. You can use text animation presets in After Effects to add animated text to video. Here are the steps to add animated text to video with animation presets and effects.

Step1Click on the text on your video that you want to animate. Go to Effects and Presets panel located on the right side.

![effects and presets after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/effects-and-presets-after-effects.jpg)

## How to Convert SRT to DOCX

**SRT to Word: How to Convert an SRT File to Docx file?**

The SubRip Text (SRT) format is a popular subtitle format used in many videos. While SRT files are simple text files that can be edited with any text editor, they are not as convenient to work with as MS Word documents.

For one thing, it cannot be easy to format text in a way that is easy to read. In addition, SRT files do not support features such as spell checking and grammar checking.

As a result, converting SRT to Word can be a useful way to improve the quality of subtitles. In addition, it can also make it easier to translate subtitles into other languages.

Other than that, you might need to convert an SRT to a Word document when you need to edit the subtitles for a video you're working on or you want to create a transcript of a recorded conversation.

You might think that converting a speech to text is difficult or impossible. But it's not!

Here's how you can easily convert SRT to DOCX files. Let's begin.

## What is an SRT file?

SRT files are used for subtitles. Subtitles are the audio track of a video or movie. Subtitles are displayed alongside a video or movie on your TV or computer screen. They allow the viewer to understand what is being said in the language they speak.

People have recently begun using online streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Video, and Hulu to watch movies and television shows. While streaming services offer thousands of movies and shows, there are still many that only exist in a form that can be viewed in their entirety. This requires the user to download the entire file (usually in a format known as a .srt file).

## Why do we need to convert SRT files into Word?

Subtitles are a great way to enjoy movies and TV shows in different languages. They provide text on the screen that tells you what the characters are saying, so you can follow along even if you don't speak the language. However, SRT files can be difficult to work with because they are incompatible with all software programs**.** So, they need to be converted into Word. Some other reasons include:

* It allows your content to be viewed within a web browser or mobile device without downloading .srt file.
* If you need to embed the video into another site, you can do so easily with the.docx file.
* Learning a new language by downloading SRT subtitles from video.
