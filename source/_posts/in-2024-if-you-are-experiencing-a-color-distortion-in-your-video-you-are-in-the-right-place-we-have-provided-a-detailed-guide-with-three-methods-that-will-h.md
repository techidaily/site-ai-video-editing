Nothing is more satisfying than seeing the final cut of a video and realizing that everything we filmed is crystal clear, with vibrant colors and balanced light. Unfortunately, whether you are editing on your own or collaborating with a team, this can be difficult to achieve because color problems often occur. Unlike photo editors, where one photo can easily be fixed without affecting the rest of an album, video editing requires adjusting to fix one problem. We'll look at three different methods to correct color distortion in videos.

## What Is Color Distortion

Color distortion, also called chromatic aberration (CA), happens when the camera's lens cannot resolve the wavelengths of light that it is recording. It occurs due to dispersion, which is when the lens elements' refractive index varies with the light wavelength.

The refractive index of transparent materials often reduces with increasing wavelength. Because a lens' focal length depends on the index of refraction, this variation in refraction index affects focusing.

There are two types of CA: transverse (lateral) and axial (longitudinal). Axial aberration happens when different wavelengths of light focus at different distances from a lens (focus shift). Essentially, longitudinal aberration is often at long focal lengths.

On the other hand, transverse aberration happens when different wavelengths focus at different places in the focal plane due to the magnification or distortion of the lens varying with wavelength. Ideally, transverse aberration is often at short focal lengths.

The two types of CA have different characteristics, and they may occur together. Axial chromatic aberration occurs throughout an image, and you can reduce it by stopping down, hence increasing the depth of the field so that although the different wavelengths are focusing at different distances, they're still in acceptable focus.

When it comes to transverse chromatic aberration, it doesn't occur in the middle of the image, and it increases towards the edge. What's more? Stopping down does not affect it.

## How will Color Distortion Affect Your Videos?

Colour distortion displays itself as "fringes" of color on the boundaries separating bright and dark parts of the image in a video. Color distortion can also occur when adding effects to a video, such as the use of a green screen. By using the green screen to replace the real thing, the colors in the video can appear a little off.

## Different Methods to Correct Color Distortion in Videos

There are several methods to correct color distortion in your video. They include.

### Method 1: Correct Color Distortion in Videos Using Filmora

Filmora is user-friendly software with powerful tools that allow users to tweak the color settings and correct color distortion. Follow the steps below to learn how to correct color distortion in videos using Filmora.

Nothing is more satisfying than seeing the final cut of a video and realizing that everything we filmed is crystal clear, with vibrant colors and balanced light. Unfortunately, whether you are editing on your own or collaborating with a team, this can be difficult to achieve because color problems often occur. Unlike photo editors, where one photo can easily be fixed without affecting the rest of an album, video editing requires adjusting to fix one problem. We'll look at three different methods to correct color distortion in videos.

## What Is Color Distortion

Color distortion, also called chromatic aberration (CA), happens when the camera's lens cannot resolve the wavelengths of light that it is recording. It occurs due to dispersion, which is when the lens elements' refractive index varies with the light wavelength.

The refractive index of transparent materials often reduces with increasing wavelength. Because a lens' focal length depends on the index of refraction, this variation in refraction index affects focusing.

There are two types of CA: transverse (lateral) and axial (longitudinal). Axial aberration happens when different wavelengths of light focus at different distances from a lens (focus shift). Essentially, longitudinal aberration is often at long focal lengths.

On the other hand, transverse aberration happens when different wavelengths focus at different places in the focal plane due to the magnification or distortion of the lens varying with wavelength. Ideally, transverse aberration is often at short focal lengths.

The two types of CA have different characteristics, and they may occur together. Axial chromatic aberration occurs throughout an image, and you can reduce it by stopping down, hence increasing the depth of the field so that although the different wavelengths are focusing at different distances, they're still in acceptable focus.

When it comes to transverse chromatic aberration, it doesn't occur in the middle of the image, and it increases towards the edge. What's more? Stopping down does not affect it.

## How will Color Distortion Affect Your Videos?

Colour distortion displays itself as "fringes" of color on the boundaries separating bright and dark parts of the image in a video. Color distortion can also occur when adding effects to a video, such as the use of a green screen. By using the green screen to replace the real thing, the colors in the video can appear a little off.

## Different Methods to Correct Color Distortion in Videos

There are several methods to correct color distortion in your video. They include.

The present-day high-end smartphones, like iPhone, Samsung, and Huawei, come packed in with advanced camera features that can let you capture interesting and bright images having depth. To get this done, you first need to check if your smartphone has an HDR mode and if it does, how to use the same.

So, we are here to help you to learn in detail about HDR Android photography and how to use the HDR mode on your smartphone. Keep reading till the read and we assure you that you will be able to capture some breath-taking images with your phone.

## Part 1: What is HDR photography?

First things first. Before using the HDR feature on your smartphone, let’s learn what actually is the function of HDR.

Standing for High Dynamic Range, HDR is an image capturing method where the dynamic range of an image is high. When we talk about dynamic range, it refers to the difference between the lightest and the darkest elements of a picture. Thus, in HDR images the range dynamic range of the image is greater than the actual capture and thus making the image look more real with higher contrast, colors, and saturation.

While using the HDR image capturing method, the subject is captured in multiple shots having different exposures. These multiple captured shots are then combined into a single picture thus making it look detailed and saturated.

Though HDR enhances the overall looks of an image it is not suitable only in certain situations and subjects like landscape, subjects captured in sunlight or bright background, low or dim light conditions, and more.

![hdr mode vs non hdr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/hdr-photography-how-to-use-hdr-mode-on-your-android-devices-4.jpg)

## Part 2: How to tell if I can shoot HDR images on my Android devices or not?

HDR images can be captured using DSLR cameras, but you need to have a thorough knowledge of the camera and the process of capturing the HDR images. A simpler alternative to this is using an Android device. The principle of capturing HDR images using an Android phone is simpler in comparison to a professional DSLR camera and also quick. Using an Android device, the imbalance in the exposure is corrected and the details of the image background, as well as the foreground, are enhanced.

**How-to steps to check the HDR camera Android feature**

So now that you know that HDR images can be easily captured using your Android device, the next important thing is to check if your phone supports the HDR feature or not as not all Android devices have the HDR mode.

* In the devices like HTC One X, Desire X, and others with custom Camera apps, the feature can be found under the Camera Scenes section.
* In case you cannot locate the HDR option in both the above methods then try looking for it under the Settings menu of Camera. Devices like Sony Xperia T and Xperia V have the option here.
* For the Nexus 4 device that runs on Android 4.2 OS, the option of HDR mode can be turned on by simply long-tapping the viewfinder and then tapping on the HDR icon.
* You may also find the option of HDR mode under the labels like Backlight HDR or Backlight Correction HDR. On the Samsung Galaxy devices, HDR is labeled as Rich Tone and can be located under the Smart Modes menu.

## Part 3: How to Take an HDR Shot with Your Android devices?
