GIFs are known to be the top ranked and most intuitive trendsetters in the world of infotainment and media service tools.

From making simple static and animated GIFs to creating professionally sound market promotion tools; you can play with your editing skills to extract just anything from these quick snippets.

Having said that, let’s take a dive into creating animated **Procreate GIFs**. Being a relatively new dimension of GIF editing, a merge of the two produces matchless and classic results. Read through the further article to get a complete guide for working on GIF creation and editing with Procreate.

**●** **Underlying Concept**

Before you begin creating a **Procreate GIF**, let’s get a bit familiar with the concept behind this GIF creation utility. This one is an excellent and advanced means of exploring your skills in digital drawing and animations. It is one of the easiest GIF maker software that helps you to become a pro in animation creativity even if you are beginner and for the ones already into the skill, Procreate is simply heaven.

Procreate allows you to work with animation in its ‘Animation Assist’ tool, where you get a generous workspace with the perfect editing canvas to experiment with a plethora of tools, effects and filters to create exciting GIFs with basic and complex animation craft.

The software allows frame-by-frame animation that refers to working with different frames of a particular illustration, while making minimal changes in each frame. Once you finish, your final creation gets played in a motion loop.

## Part 1 How to Make Animated Gifs in Procreate

As is already stated, Procreate is among the most affordable GIF creator and editing software. Creating GIFs here is a few minute stuff within a span of counted steps. Let’s have a broader see through of the creation process. Take the following quick steps and get started to make your exclusive Procreate GIF:

**●** **Step 1: Select an Artwork**

Launch the software in your device to reach the Procreate welcome screen, where you need to select an existing static GIF to work on from your device. You can also create a fresh one if you like. Having done that, make a right swipe on the ‘Canvas’ icon and select ‘Duplicate’. This creates a copy of your artwork, preserving all of its layers, so that you are free to make changes or stick to the original one according to your preference.

If you want to use a specific section of your image to animate, you can use the crop tool to remove unwanted portions. Next, you need to put together the specific layers you wish to animate and also remove any unwanted layers you don’t want to use.

![Procreate Animated GIF Creator](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/Easy-ways-to-make-procreate-gifs-1.JPG)

**●** **Step 2: Enable Animation Assist Tool**

From the Procreate tool gallery at the top, click on the ‘Wrench’ icon and select ‘Canvas’ from the ’Actions’ menu that drops down. In the interface that appears, enable the ‘Animation Assist’ tool with a right toggle. This will cause the ‘Animation Toolbar’ to appear at the bottom of the interface.

![Procreate- Animation Assist Tool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/Easy-ways-to-make-procreate-gifs-2.JPG)

**●** **Step 3: Add Frames and Make Image Adjustments**

At this instant, you need to make additional adjustments in your selected image and create a copy of the image frames. To get this done, navigate to the ‘Animation Assist Toolbar’ and long press the ‘Add Frame’ button. A duplicate frame will now appear on the screen. Within this frame, you need to move the image elements that you wish to animate. To do this, select an element and drag it to a convenient spot of your choice.

While you go through with object movement, the software simultaneously shows you a semi-transparent preview of your creation through its unique ‘Onion-skin’ feature. You can enjoy playing your animation at this very stage, or continue to create something more exciting.

**●** **Step 4: Enjoying? Let’s Continue.**

Repeat Step 3 to create long and smooth GIFs with additional frames. Take caution to create a copy of your latest frame (not the original one), in case you need to make any adjustments later on. Consider playing your GIF to see if you need to add extra frames or implement further changes.

**Step 5: Almost There.**

You may notice a jerky movement of your final image frames. This is on account of the ‘Default Play’ feature of the Procreate software that initiates a run of your creation from the beginning to end and loops on the same fashion.

To set this right, navigate to the ‘Settings’ tool of the ‘Animation Assist Toolbar’ and tap ‘Ping-Pong’ on the opening interface. Your animated Gif will now play in a forward to backward loop, resulting in a smooth frame movement.

**●** **Step 6: Time to Share.**

Once you are happy with your artwork, you can share it across different media platforms. To export your creation, navigate to the Procreate tool gallery and tap the ‘Wrench’ icon and select ‘Share’. In the ‘Sharing Options’ menu, you will be asked to make a format selection. You can share your creation in either of the GIF, PNG or MP4 formats.

You may even require a size modification in the created file with respect to specific sharing platforms. You can either select a web compatible resolution to shrink your file, or create a copy of the file to resize the same.

Once you get familiar with Procreate and its GIF creation basics, you have the liberty to explore the huge effects library offered by the software to give your animated GIFs the classy, professional touch. So why wait? Just get the software and start a never ending spree of Procreating GIFs.

Procreate is undoubtedly an excellent tool for creating animated GIFs, but if you are looking for alternatives, another software to rely on is **[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** GIF creator.

In the ‘Sharing Options’ menu, you will be asked to make a format selection. You can share your creation in either of the GIF, PNG or MP4 formats.

You may even require a size modification in the created file with respect to specific sharing platforms. You can either select a web compatible resolution to shrink your file, or create a copy of the file to resize the same.

**Frame blending** is a video editing technique used to create smooth transitions between two video frames. This process is often used to create special effects or transition between two different video clips. Frame blending can be done manually or with the help of software.

When **frame blending** is done manually, the editor will take two consecutive frames and blend them. This is done by using a process called cross-fading. Cross-fading is when the first frame gradually fades out while the second frame gradually fades in. The result is a seamless transition between the two frames.

Frame blending can also be done with the help of software. Many software programs offer frame blending capabilities Like Adobe Premiere Pro and more. These software programs typically have a user interface that allows the user to select the two frames that they want to blend. The software will then perform the cross-fading process automatically.

**Frame blending** is a video editing technique used to create smooth transitions between two video frames. This process is often used to create special effects or transition between two different video clips. Frame blending can be done manually or with the help of software.

When **frame blending** is done manually, the editor will take two consecutive frames and blend them. This is done by using a process called cross-fading. Cross-fading is when the first frame gradually fades out while the second frame gradually fades in. The result is a seamless transition between the two frames.

Frame blending can also be done with the help of software. Many software programs offer frame blending capabilities Like Adobe Premiere Pro and more. These software programs typically have a user interface that allows the user to select the two frames that they want to blend. The software will then perform the cross-fading process automatically.

## How to Choose from Frame Blending/ Frame Sampling/ Optical Flow

The different types of frame blending are:

* **Frame Sampling:** best for smooth movements, no image distortion.
* **Optical Flow:** smoother results but can cause image distortion.
* **Frame Blending:** a mix of the two, some image distortion but smoother results.

So, choosing which type of frame blending to use depends on the footage and the desired results. If you want smooth results with no image distortion, frame sampling is the best option. However, if you don't mind some image distortion in exchange for smoother results, optical flow or frame blending would be better choices.

How to decide which option is the best for your use? Let's explain more, and It depends on the footage and the desired results. If you want smooth results with no image distortion, frame sampling is the best option. However, if you don't mind some image distortion in exchange for smoother results, optical flow or frame blending would be better choices.
