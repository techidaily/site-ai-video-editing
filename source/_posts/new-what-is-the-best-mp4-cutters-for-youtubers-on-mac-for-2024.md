YouTubers upload over 300 hours of video content to the platform every second. These videos cut across every niche and topic. There’s scarcely a topic you’re looking for that you won’t find a video or two discussing on YouTube. So as a YouTuber, you have to find ways to keep up and stand out from the crowd. You’ll need engaging videos that will hold your target audience’s attention so much that they will subscribe for more.

However, if the video is too long or your car doesn’t hit the right frame, it will disengage your audience. Additionally, you want a video seamlessly woven together to form a polished video. This makes MP4 cutting an essential part of the YouTube video creation process. There’s no need to purchase pricey editing equipment anymore; you can simply cut your MP4 videos from the comfort of your home. This article explores the best MP4 cutters for YouTubers on Mac; let’s take a look.

## Which Should I Choose, Free or Paid MP4 Cutter?

You need to consider several factors when you’re choosing the right MP4 cutter. First, you have to consider the type of video you would be editing. For YouTube, you need an MP4 cutter that also offers several video editing features you can use to enhance your video. There’s also a need to consider the available formats and quality you can export in and if the MP4 cutter allows you to add visual effects to make your video stand out on YouTube.

Another factor to consider when choosing between a paid or free MP4 cutter for YouTubers on Mac is your experience level. Are you a professional, or you’re looking for some basic app to simply cut your video? Some paid options take you step-by-step through the process of cutting your MP4 file. This type of MP4 cutter helps you advance your skill. This feature is essential because the more you know, the more you’re willing to learn.

Note that most free MP4 cutters offer limited features. Alternatively, some paid MP4 cutters are only suitable for professionals or have a steep subscription to consider. Consider your budget and if any of the editors offer you the tools you need while being affordable. You need to carefully consider if a free tool is what you’re looking for or if you don’t mind paying for more functionality.
