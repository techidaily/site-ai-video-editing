## Part 1 **What's Video Ideas Generator and How to Use This Tool to Get More Views**

It's not enough to create a YouTube channel and post some video that does not have informative content.

Along with good content, we also need new and creative ideas to get more viewers. Thus, we have some tools to provide unique and innovative ideas based on the niche you choose.

Videos Idea Generator is a tool that gives ideas for YouTube videos, and it works based on AI technology (Neural Networks). This tool will be more beneficial for the content creators to get more **AI video ideas**. Naturally, you might be out of ideas for your channel, or sometimes it takes more time to get an idea, or it could be a routine idea that does not sound interesting to the viewers. In such cases, **an AI video idea generator** is more helpful in suggesting new and innovative ideas for the content creators based on their interesting topics.

Some of the advantages of a video idea generator are:

**●** Time-saving – as one can utilize the time in other work, such as editing the video/ adding subtitles, etc., instead of thinking of an idea.

## Part 2 **12 Great AI Video Ideas to Bring More Traffic**

Now, let us know 12 **AI video ideas** that can become viral and get more likes and views :

### 01Idea 1: Know your Interest

Before starting a YouTube channel or posting a video, know your area of interest first. Once you get clarity on the area of interest, it's easy to pick a topic from that and create an innovative video. Try to be more specific in the topic you choose. Also, have clarity on the section of audience you want to target.

For example, if your topic is more related to children, add more animations of animals/ cartoons that interest children. If you choose a related topic, do not add more animations that might confuse the audience. Add more reference links so that they can refer to those and be more particular on the specific topic you are trying to explain through the video. Similarly, if you choose a gaming-related topic, do not be more general about gaming.

Be specific towards a particular section of games like mobile gaming/ desktop/ virtual to reach more audience, and it does not seem boring to the audience.

As many students graduate every year, the competition for jobs has increased.

Using **the YouTube video idea generator AI** tool, you can generate more unique videos related to education.

## Detailed Tutorial to Merge Videos in VLC Media Player

Sometimes, when working on a project, we really need to combine several videos - this way some content needs to be conveyed, there are shots that, when neatly sorted and merged together, really create visual and content value which we aspire to make; The process becomes more enjoyable if we work on the videos produced by ourselves, or if the work is to be done for our side project. People always take special care of their own work, and the same can be emphasized freely about the editing as well - about the packaging with which we have to deliver our videos to the audience. Even in the absence of an audience, maybe we want to make a kind of video collage for ourselves, our children, or in general, for the family to make delightful memories?

Of course, not everyone who has taken a camera or a mobile phone to take videos at least one time, even so, for family and friends, has the experience of editing and making various manipulations. However, the function of merging videos in various editing programs or on online platforms is so simple that it can be learned in just a few minutes, without the help of other people, and with a kind of small, though very useful result at the same time.

One of the programs where videos can be uploaded is VLC Media Player, which is a free-to-use, robust, and feature-packed software that plays a wide range of audio, image, and video files. It can play multimedia files directly from extractable devices or the PC. The program is unique, as it can stream from popular websites like Disney +, Hulu, Gaia, and Netflix. VLC Multimedia Player also accepts live video from PlayStation Live, Xbox Live, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. While most competing programs display advertisements, VLC Player does not, as it receives support from a non-profit organization.

![merge videos in vlc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/merge-videos-in-vlc-1.jpg)

Interestingly, we can, as though with the help of a magic wand, turn this particular video player into video editing software. When one computer program delivers too many functions, it might make us think of the situation where one person claims to serve ten professions at the same time - there is a mood that they will not be good in any of them. It's not true with VLC Player, which, from experience, seems to be both a good "player" as well as a fairly user-friendly editing software with many interesting features and functions.

Before we move on to video streaming, let's look at two features that we can use in VLC player:

* [Rotate a video in VLC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MxR2MnLomw)

In the player, right when our video clip starts to play, we may find that the footage is taken vertically instead of horizontally! This is not a nightmare just for video enthusiasts. If you don't know how to rotate the video, then you have to rotate your head 90 degrees, and at this time you can not even get pleasure from watching, not to mention that it can even cause your neck to lock up. VLC Player took care of that - in the top panel, just click on Tools, then select Effects & Filters. In the opened window, we find Video Effects, select Geometry and check the Rotate option - so, the whole 360 degrees are at our disposal!

* [Cut/trim video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtxpVJ5sX9M)

Sometimes it happens that we watch the video, we are crazy about one part of it, and the other part of it seems to spoil everything! Even if we are ready to publish the raw material on social media or just save it for ourselves, we just don't want some parts of the video to be there. So, it can be said - we are not satisfied with the full version and we wish to cut our clip and/or reduce its timeframe. VLC Player solves this problem "without any problem" - we find the View in the top panel, then we demand the cursor to aim for Advanced Controls button. As a result, a sort of video editor will appear, with its red record button on which we will click and the video will play until we reach the point where we want to split the footage. The cut video will be automatically saved in My Computer's My Video folder.

## How to Merge Multiple Videos in VLC Media Player

That's it! In this article, we have tried to teach you how to use VLC Media Player as a video editor software, what features we can use and, most importantly, how to merge multiple videos in this dual program; We also learned an alternative way of how we can combine different video clips with the help of Wondershare Filmora. The choice is yours, the main thing is to know all the alternatives and find the most time and energy saving, preferable option for you personally!

Interestingly, we can, as though with the help of a magic wand, turn this particular video player into video editing software. When one computer program delivers too many functions, it might make us think of the situation where one person claims to serve ten professions at the same time - there is a mood that they will not be good in any of them. It's not true with VLC Player, which, from experience, seems to be both a good "player" as well as a fairly user-friendly editing software with many interesting features and functions.

Before we move on to video streaming, let's look at two features that we can use in VLC player:

* [Rotate a video in VLC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MxR2MnLomw)

In the player, right when our video clip starts to play, we may find that the footage is taken vertically instead of horizontally! This is not a nightmare just for video enthusiasts. If you don't know how to rotate the video, then you have to rotate your head 90 degrees, and at this time you can not even get pleasure from watching, not to mention that it can even cause your neck to lock up. VLC Player took care of that - in the top panel, just click on Tools, then select Effects & Filters. In the opened window, we find Video Effects, select Geometry and check the Rotate option - so, the whole 360 degrees are at our disposal!

* [Cut/trim video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtxpVJ5sX9M)

Sometimes it happens that we watch the video, we are crazy about one part of it, and the other part of it seems to spoil everything! Even if we are ready to publish the raw material on social media or just save it for ourselves, we just don't want some parts of the video to be there. So, it can be said - we are not satisfied with the full version and we wish to cut our clip and/or reduce its timeframe. VLC Player solves this problem "without any problem" - we find the View in the top panel, then we demand the cursor to aim for Advanced Controls button. As a result, a sort of video editor will appear, with its red record button on which we will click and the video will play until we reach the point where we want to split the footage. The cut video will be automatically saved in My Computer's My Video folder.

## How to Merge Multiple Videos in VLC Media Player

That's it! In this article, we have tried to teach you how to use VLC Media Player as a video editor software, what features we can use and, most importantly, how to merge multiple videos in this dual program; We also learned an alternative way of how we can combine different video clips with the help of Wondershare Filmora. The choice is yours, the main thing is to know all the alternatives and find the most time and energy saving, preferable option for you personally!

Interestingly, we can, as though with the help of a magic wand, turn this particular video player into video editing software. When one computer program delivers too many functions, it might make us think of the situation where one person claims to serve ten professions at the same time - there is a mood that they will not be good in any of them. It's not true with VLC Player, which, from experience, seems to be both a good "player" as well as a fairly user-friendly editing software with many interesting features and functions.

Before we move on to video streaming, let's look at two features that we can use in VLC player:

* [Rotate a video in VLC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MxR2MnLomw)

In the player, right when our video clip starts to play, we may find that the footage is taken vertically instead of horizontally! This is not a nightmare just for video enthusiasts. If you don't know how to rotate the video, then you have to rotate your head 90 degrees, and at this time you can not even get pleasure from watching, not to mention that it can even cause your neck to lock up. VLC Player took care of that - in the top panel, just click on Tools, then select Effects & Filters. In the opened window, we find Video Effects, select Geometry and check the Rotate option - so, the whole 360 degrees are at our disposal!

* [Cut/trim video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtxpVJ5sX9M)

Sometimes it happens that we watch the video, we are crazy about one part of it, and the other part of it seems to spoil everything! Even if we are ready to publish the raw material on social media or just save it for ourselves, we just don't want some parts of the video to be there. So, it can be said - we are not satisfied with the full version and we wish to cut our clip and/or reduce its timeframe. VLC Player solves this problem "without any problem" - we find the View in the top panel, then we demand the cursor to aim for Advanced Controls button. As a result, a sort of video editor will appear, with its red record button on which we will click and the video will play until we reach the point where we want to split the footage. The cut video will be automatically saved in My Computer's My Video folder.

## How to Merge Multiple Videos in VLC Media Player

Here we are, now the main topic of interest of this article - how to put together several videos so that they become one? This case, unlike other possibilities we discussed above, is more complicated, so we will study this feature [step by step](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VioOE6tCg1g&t=1s).

## Steps to Remove Background Noise From Video Sony Vegas

The most popular activity you'll get from video creators is to remove unpleasant noises like rumble or buzz from a final film, whether a promotional video, a short story, a short advertisement, or something else entirely. When mixing and capturing sound effects or even other multimedia design elements, it's typical to have to remove background noises.

Thankfully, there are some techniques for eliminating these background noises. In this guide, I will illustrate how to eliminate background noise on Windows, Mac, and Online.

## **How to Remove Background Noise from Video Sony Vegas?**

Nothing is more frustrating than watching your film's current video footage and hearing excessive background noise. Well, if you're unfamiliar with Vegas Pro, don't worry; we'll show you how to reduce noise with these simple steps.

Here's a quick guide on reducing background noise in Sony Vegas. Follow these techniques to minimize background noise quickly and effectively, leaving you with clear audio:

### **Method #1: Lower the Volume**

Consider lowering the volume of your video. Low-level noise is frequently seen in audio at the lowest volume settings. Simply decrease the general volume levels to fight this, and it may clean any mild, below-the-floor background noise.

Slide down the volume lever in the track to the left to lower the level of all audio occurrences within the track. To equalize the course, press the top of the track and drag the gain level down.

![remove-noise-sony-vegas-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/remove-noise-sony-vegas-1.jpg)

### **Method #2: Utilize the Noise Gate Feature**

Reducing the volume and implementing the first method does not always eliminate background noise, so you must explore further.

There may be circumstances where the background noise is louder than the speaker, and decreasing the total volume makes it incomprehensible.

I suggest that you consider the Noise Gate if the background noise is a constant hiss. Noise Gate effectively suppresses sound below a specific volume, and background noise volume is lesser than the audio you want to include in your edit. As a result, using the Noise Gate is the best option.

To use the Noise Gate, go to the Track FX section of the interface and click the Audio FX button. Now select "Noise Gate." The choices for this are now visible. Raise the threshold level; this establishes the total volume quality threshold. The Noise Gate will remove all audio below the threshold.

![remove-noise-sony-vegas-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/remove-noise-sony-vegas-2.jpg)

## **Alternative Ways to Remove Background Noise from Video**

The learning curve of Sony Vegas may be a bit too complicated for you; then, there is nothing to worry about because you are in the right place. In this article, I also prepared a few alternative ways that you can use to remove background noises from your video. Let's skip the talk and start learning:

### **#1:** [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) **– Overall Best**

**It is available on Windows and Mac.**

Although there are many applications available for removing background noise, experts recommend Wondershare Filmora Video Editor. Let's get right to the point.

Aside from the standard audio editing tools, Filmora now includes better wavelengths, volume keyframing, peak detection, and audio fades, resulting in a higher-quality audio editing interface. Here are some of the trump cards of using Filmora to remove background audio noise:

* Waveform audio editing with adjustable track height
* Remove background noise with ONE click using the Denoise function.
* Adjust the Denoise level to Weak, Mid, or Strong for improved noise reduction outcomes.

Here's a guide on how to use Filmora to improve video footage, including how to eliminate background noise:

1. In the Wondershare Filmora timeline panel, upload your clip. Trim and erase the video sections that you don't wish to keep.
2. Hover over the Audio option after right-clicking the clip in the timeline. The four choices available are silence detection, modification audio, removal audio, and mute. Select the "Audio Detach" feature to extract the audio from the video.

![remove-noise-sony-vegas-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/remove-noise-sony-vegas-3.jpg)

1. Double-click on the audio file and select "Remove background noise" in the Edit Menu to eliminate the background noise instantly. You may also reach the Editing panel by double-clicking the video in the timeline without removing audio from the video and switching to the Audio page to edit audio and remove noise.

![remove-noise-sony-vegas-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/remove-noise-sony-vegas-4.jpg)

1. You may also use the Equalizer tool to fine-tune the audio to make it seem more authentic. Simply tweak the music to fit the visual frame by frame if you want a better assessment. After analyzing the results, click Export to save the noise-reduced clip to your device or share it immediately to YouTube or Vimeo.

### **#2:** [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/)

**It is available on Windows, Mac, and Linux.**

Audacity is a free, accessible, high-quality audio editing program that runs on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. You may use it to record live audio, modify it with capabilities like a cut, copy, and paste, and visualize advanced audio analysis using the Spectrogram view mode.You may also use it to eliminate background noise from your audio or video files for free.

The improved detailed instructions for removing background noise in Audacity in 2022 are listed below:

**Step #1: Import Files to Audacity**

Move to the File menu and hit Open or Import after running the program to load the audio or video source into Audacity. Before editing, Audacity will prompt you to make a copy of the audio track. This impresses me as extremely thoughtful. If you want to import a video file into Audacity, you'll have to download and install FFmpeg Library beforehand. Otherwise, you'll need to separate the audio from the video or transcode the video to a suitable audio format.

![remove-noise-sony-vegas-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/remove-noise-sony-vegas-5.jpg)

**Step #2: Detect the Noise Segment**

Locate a portion with pure background noise by zooming in on the track or adjusting the Track Size under the View menu.

![remove-noise-sony-vegas-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/remove-noise-sony-vegas-6.jpg)

Choose "Noise Reduction" from the Effect tab, begin with the defaults, and then hit "Get Noise Profile" to have Audacity determine what to filter out based on the specified section.

**Step #3: Eliminate Background Noise with Noise Profile**

Next, select the entire audio track that requires noise reduction, return to the Noise Reduction panels, select how much noise you want to eliminate, and click OK to eliminate the noise. You may use the default settings. Audacity will automatically minimize the noise, and the outcome will be visible on the audio track right away.

**Step #4: Calibrate the Settings**

To address the white noise of your audio, go to Effect and Amplify. To see if the noise has been gone, click "Preview." Click "OK" and then export the denoised clip from Audacity to MP3, WAV, or other codecs.

![remove-noise-sony-vegas-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/remove-noise-sony-vegas-7.jpg)

### **#4:** [Remove the Entire Audio from Video Online Free](https://www.audioremover.com/)

**It is available on Windows, Mac, and Online.**

You can use several online audio removers if you don't want to install apps to eliminate the background noise. For example, I discovered AudioRemover.com, a free online audio extractor. In just two actions, you may eradicate audio from video.

1. Choose a video file first, then click the Upload Video button below. Depending on the size of the video, this could take some time.
2. Click the download file to save it to your PC after it's finished.

![remove-noise-sony-vegas-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/remove-noise-sony-vegas-10.jpg)

On the other hand, this online audio remover will eliminate all of your audio, background noise, narration, music, and sound. A video file can only be 500MB in size. It can play MP4, AVI, MOV, and other video formats.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **What is the best way to remove background noise from a video?**

I highly recommend using Wondershare Filmora video editor; all you have to do is activate the Denoise feature in the Audio editing window to eliminate the background noise from the video. Furthermore, it will instantly delete the background noise, such as the breeze.

### **Is it possible to eliminate background noise from a video online?**

You certainly can. Background noise can be removed online using online video editors like Veed.

### **How do I get rid of the background noise in a YouTube video?**

To eliminate background audio noise from YouTube videos, you may first have to download the video, then use the Filmora video editor to eliminate the noise with a single click.

**Method #2: Utilize the Noise Gate Feature**

Reducing the volume and implementing the first method does not always eliminate background noise, so you must explore further.

There may be circumstances where the background noise is louder than the speaker, and decreasing the total volume makes it incomprehensible.

I suggest that you consider the Noise Gate if the background noise is a constant hiss. Noise Gate effectively suppresses sound below a specific volume, and background noise volume is lesser than the audio you want to include in your edit. As a result, using the Noise Gate is the best option.

To use the Noise Gate, go to the Track FX section of the interface and click the Audio FX button. Now select "Noise Gate." The choices for this are now visible. Raise the threshold level; this establishes the total volume quality threshold. The Noise Gate will remove all audio below the threshold.

## **Alternative Ways to Remove Background Noise from Video**

The learning curve of Sony Vegas may be a bit too complicated for you; then, there is nothing to worry about because you are in the right place. In this article, I also prepared a few alternative ways that you can use to remove background noises from your video. Let's skip the talk and start learning:

### **#1:** [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) **– Overall Best**

**It is available on Windows and Mac.**

Although there are many applications available for removing background noise, experts recommend Wondershare Filmora Video Editor. Let's get right to the point.

Aside from the standard audio editing tools, Filmora now includes better wavelengths, volume keyframing, peak detection, and audio fades, resulting in a higher-quality audio editing interface. Here are some of the trump cards of using Filmora to remove background audio noise:

* Waveform audio editing with adjustable track height
* Remove background noise with ONE click using the Denoise function.
* Adjust the Denoise level to Weak, Mid, or Strong for improved noise reduction outcomes.

Here's a guide on how to use Filmora to improve video footage, including how to eliminate background noise:

1. In the Wondershare Filmora timeline panel, upload your clip. Trim and erase the video sections that you don't wish to keep.
2. Hover over the Audio option after right-clicking the clip in the timeline. The four choices available are silence detection, modification audio, removal audio, and mute. Select the "Audio Detach" feature to extract the audio from the video.

![remove-noise-sony-vegas-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/remove-noise-sony-vegas-3.jpg)

1. Double-click on the audio file and select "Remove background noise" in the Edit Menu to eliminate the background noise instantly. You may also reach the Editing panel by double-clicking the video in the timeline without removing audio from the video and switching to the Audio page to edit audio and remove noise.

![remove-noise-sony-vegas-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/remove-noise-sony-vegas-4.jpg)

1. You may also use the Equalizer tool to fine-tune the audio to make it seem more authentic. Simply tweak the music to fit the visual frame by frame if you want a better assessment. After analyzing the results, click Export to save the noise-reduced clip to your device or share it immediately to YouTube or Vimeo.

### **#2:** [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/)

**It is available on Windows, Mac, and Linux.**

Audacity is a free, accessible, high-quality audio editing program that runs on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. You may use it to record live audio, modify it with capabilities like a cut, copy, and paste, and visualize advanced audio analysis using the Spectrogram view mode.You may also use it to eliminate background noise from your audio or video files for free.

The improved detailed instructions for removing background noise in Audacity in 2022 are listed below:

**Step #1: Import Files to Audacity**

Move to the File menu and hit Open or Import after running the program to load the audio or video source into Audacity. Before editing, Audacity will prompt you to make a copy of the audio track. This impresses me as extremely thoughtful. If you want to import a video file into Audacity, you'll have to download and install FFmpeg Library beforehand. Otherwise, you'll need to separate the audio from the video or transcode the video to a suitable audio format.

![remove-noise-sony-vegas-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/remove-noise-sony-vegas-5.jpg)

**Step #2: Detect the Noise Segment**

Locate a portion with pure background noise by zooming in on the track or adjusting the Track Size under the View menu.

![remove-noise-sony-vegas-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/remove-noise-sony-vegas-6.jpg)

Choose "Noise Reduction" from the Effect tab, begin with the defaults, and then hit "Get Noise Profile" to have Audacity determine what to filter out based on the specified section.

**Step #3: Eliminate Background Noise with Noise Profile**

Next, select the entire audio track that requires noise reduction, return to the Noise Reduction panels, select how much noise you want to eliminate, and click OK to eliminate the noise. You may use the default settings. Audacity will automatically minimize the noise, and the outcome will be visible on the audio track right away.

**Step #4: Calibrate the Settings**

To address the white noise of your audio, go to Effect and Amplify. To see if the noise has been gone, click "Preview." Click "OK" and then export the denoised clip from Audacity to MP3, WAV, or other codecs.
