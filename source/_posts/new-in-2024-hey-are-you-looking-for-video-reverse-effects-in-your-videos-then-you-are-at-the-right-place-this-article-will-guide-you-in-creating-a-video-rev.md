## Hey! Are You Looking for Video Reverse Effects in Your Videos? Then, You Are at the Right Place. This Article Will Guide You in Creating a Video Reverse Effect

All great video editors use phenomenal video effects in their videos. One of the most professional effects is the reverse video effect. This unique effect is always challenging for the makers to shoot and portray on the screen flawlessly.

At the same time, it is intriguing and always draws the audience's attention. In this article, you will learn to shoot and edit the video for reverse effects using Filmora. But first, we will learn what does video reverse effect mean. So let us get into this!

## Part 1\. What Is Video Reverse Effect?

It is a special video effect in which a motion of things starts in the backward direction. This unique effect is used to intrigue the audience.

For example, if a bullet is fired from a gun. With the reverse effect, you can rewind the footage, and the shot goes back into the gun. So today, you can easily rewind fast action scenes and get a wow reaction from the audience.

### Famous Examples of Reverse Effect in Films

**1- Demolition of a Wall (1896)**

Filmmakers first used this striking effect in 1896 in a 90 seconds film, "Demolition of a wall." Louis Lumiere was the one who made that video. Below is shown an image from the film.

![demolition of a wall 1896](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/video-reverse-effect-1.png)

**2- Tenet (2020)**

It is a viral film by Christopher Nolan, which was a great success. He explained the concept of reverse entropy, in which you start moving back chronologically in time instead of forward. This concept is all shown through this special video reverse effect. Unfortunately, the audience had difficulty digesting this unique concept, which generated an awful response.

![tenet 2020](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/video-reverse-effect-2.png)

## Part 2\. How To Shoot Video Reverse Effect?

The reverse effect is unique, so special attention should be paid while filming a video. This section will cover some of the crucial prerequisites to film a video.

### Steady Camera

It would be best to have your camera placed on a steady surface or mounted on a tripod stand to lock the focus. We will split the area and perform different tasks to make it look smooth. The audience will not get the idea that you completed the tasks separately. And it helps in the editing process as well.

![keep your camera steady](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/video-reverse-effect-3.png)

### A Spacious Area

You will need a spacious area in which you will perform different tasks. Make sure your camera stands still while shooting all the frames of video. In an ample space, it becomes easier to do movements freely. It also helps prevent glitches in the final product.

### Splitting of Area into Portions

Now you have to split your area into portions. Each task is in its part of the frame, and actions in one frame should not pass over into another. You will do one activity per portion. It makes the editing process a lot easier. Finally, we get all three videos to merge and make it look like a single video.

![making three portions of the area](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/video-reverse-effect-4.png)

After covering the prerequisites, we will now learn the editing process of creating a video reverse effect.

* **VSXu Audio Visualizer**

![audio-visualizers-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/audio-visualizers-5.jpg)

**Supported system**: Windows **Introduction**: VSXu is a 3D OpenGL-based audio visualizer for Windows. It's open-source and free, and it has a lot of graphic effects for your music. This standalone application responds to the record channel on the soundcard and works with any media player. VSXu is a platform for running presets; it does not generate visualization on its own. Anyone can make their graphics and share them with those who are interested. VSXu thrives with unlimited possibilities because of its capacity to modify. VSXu isn't your typical graphic modeling application, even if it doesn't require you to write code. To generate images for the sound, you'll need to put in some time and work. **Features**:

* Compatible with YouTube, Spotify, Tidal, and other streaming services.
* The ability to alter the speed and intensity of each visual
* Perfect for parties: connect your PC to your television and use this music visualizer.

**Price**: $0 **Cons**:

* To create the graphics, you'll need basic programming skills.
* Using VSXu in a theatrical show is difficult.
* **SongRender**

![audio-visualizers-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/audio-visualizers-6.jpg)

**Supported system**: Online **Introduction**: SongRender is a music visualizer for artists and multimedia makers on the go. SongRender is the program to use if you want to rapidly create a music video with a static background and basic animated waveforms that dance with the song. You can select the output video size by clicking the social media icon. After uploading the backdrop image and audio file, you can add the waveform, which can be customized in terms of shape, color, thickness, and other factors. However, because there are no color templates, you'll have to look up color schemes to match the color of the shapes to the background. **Features**:

* Simple to use with no learning curve
* Size profiles for YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter videos that are ready to use
* High-quality 1080p HD music video export

**Price**: With $15 per month and $30 per month plans, you can try the free version for seven days. **Cons**:

**Supported system**: Windows/Mac **Introduction**: Sonic Visualiser is a free and open-source audio visualizer that may be used to view and analyze music and audio files. This is not a music visualizer for enjoyment; instead, it is designed for folks who want to know what's inside an audio file. As a result, you'll need some basic knowledge of phonetics and phonology to figure out what the depicted images mean. The solid third-party plug-ins it supports, such as pitch estimation and onset detection, are a significant element of this audio visualizer. The official lessons on utilizing it for musicological reasons may be found here. **Features**:

* Open source and free, with a plethora of plug-ins
* For musicologists, archivists, and other researchers, the best audio visualizer.

**Supported system**: Windows/Mac **Introduction**: Adobe requires no introduction in the photo, audio, and video editing. So it's no surprise that it's one of the most reliable music visualization tools available. The Adobe Audio Spectrum Effect is simple to utilize if you have some prior Adobe experience. Even though it is a premium-based music visualizer, there are numerous music visualization capabilities to try out. You must first create a new composition and then add the sound file to it to utilize the tool. Then, finally, you set the audio duration and leave the rest to the visualizer. **Features**:

* The camera raw image file can be edited or imported.
* When you connect to a USB, this audio visualizer instantly updates the audio device.
* Copying media to a shared location is simple.
* This software allows you to work together on shared projects.

**Price**: $20.99/month as a single app and $52.99/month as a subscription model for all apps. **Cons**:

**Supported system**: Online **Introduction**: Renderforest is one of the most versatile music visualization programs available, offering freemium and subscription-based plans. But that's not all; the software also allows users to visualize their music online and even create a website. Users must create an account to utilize the app because it is online-based. Once you've created an account, you'll have access to Renderforest's massive visualization templates, which you can customize with the song title, artist name, and background photo or video. Then you pick your favorite visualization style and color. Then you finish up by uploading the song you want to use in your video. Click the "Preview" icon to have Renderforest email the music visualization video to you when you're done. **Features**:

* Each template is tagged with a rating and exported to make it easier for you to compare and choose.
* You can use free stock photographs as a background or submit your photos. It is also possible to add text.
* You can share your music visualizer on YouTube, Facebook, and other social media platforms.

**Price**: $9.99/month, but a free version is also available. **Cons**:

* It is necessary to register and log in. The output will be limited to 2 minutes in 360p with a watermark if you merely wish to utilize this online music visualizer for free.
* Error - In addition to the slow processing and unexpected crashes, there is no OK or Back button after applying a filter during image editing.
* **ProjectM Music Visualizer**

![audio-visualizers-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/audio-visualizers-10.jpg)

**Supported system**: Android and iOS **Introduction**: ProjectM Music Visualizer is compatible with Android and iOS devices, demonstrating its versatility. While both the Android and iPhone versions can be used to create powerful audiovisuals for your music, the iOS version is preferred. It has a built-in media player that lets you listen to your recordings to get a sense of how the final product will seem. Both versions, however, feature hundreds of music visualization effects and multi-touch interactive visualizations. ProjectM also supports Chromecast, which is a remarkable feature. **Features**:
