We have mentioned the step-by-step procedure of **After Effects replace Sky** below:

### Procedure 1: Removing Video Background

**Step 1:** After bringing your video to the timeline, navigate towards the top search bar at the left. In the Effects Control option, search for the "Extractor" effect and add it. Then, change the "Channel" of this effect to your "Blue" or "Luminance." Change the position of both sliders there to remove and feather the background.

![enable extract effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/replace-sky-background-in-after-effects-1.jpg)

**Step 2:** To avoid removing parts other than the sky, duplicate this video to the timeline. From the bottom video, eliminate the extractor effect. Navigate towards the top toolbar and select the "Mask" option. Create a mask around the ground at the bottom of the video. In the timeline, click the "Mask Path" option to create the mask throughout the video.

![enable pen tool to draw mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/replace-sky-background-in-after-effects-2.jpg)

## Part 1: What Are the Benefits of Having Video Background Replacers?

Along with enhancing the creative element in videos, background replacers help with more. Users can integrate them for both personal and professional uses. The following section will give a sneak peek at the advantages of background removers:

### 1\. Privacy and Concealment

Video background removers extract the real surroundings, which addresses privacy concerns. In addition, they conceal any mess or imperfections in your background.

### 2\. Maintains Professional Appearance

They help you set up professional backgrounds for Zoom meetings or Google Classrooms. In this way, they maintain the professional element of your videos.

### 3\. Marketing Consistency

When it comes to marketing, they help choose a reliable background for the brand. The background becomes the identity of the brand and maintains its consistency.

### 4\. Creative Expression in Movies

In the media industry, backgrounds like the sky help express the emotion of an actor or a mass. If there is anger, the sky will turn red; if there is peace, it will have a calm outlook.

### 5\. Audience Engagement and Focus

A well-aligned background increases the audience's focus on the theme of the video. This is because irrelevant backgrounds can catch the audience's interest and distract them.

## Part 2: Top Guide Explaining How to Replace Sky in Adobe After Effects?

Do you want to elevate the graphics of your videos professionally? Adobe After Effects is an ideal software for it as it helps professionals to edit films. It offers multiple animations for titles and videos like revolve, rotate, and more. In addition, you can overlap videos with precision using its Rotoscope feature.

There are built-in effects and features to ease the editing process for you. In addition, you can do custom settings in it and save them as presets. One of its many specifications is that it is an elite background remover and replacement. It enables a seamless addition of the sky in the background. We have mentioned the step-by-step procedure of **After Effects replace Sky** below:

### Procedure 1: Removing Video Background

**Step 1:** After bringing your video to the timeline, navigate towards the top search bar at the left. In the Effects Control option, search for the "Extractor" effect and add it. Then, change the "Channel" of this effect to your "Blue" or "Luminance." Change the position of both sliders there to remove and feather the background.

![enable extract effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/replace-sky-background-in-after-effects-1.jpg)

**Step 2:** To avoid removing parts other than the sky, duplicate this video to the timeline. From the bottom video, eliminate the extractor effect. Navigate towards the top toolbar and select the "Mask" option. Create a mask around the ground at the bottom of the video. In the timeline, click the "Mask Path" option to create the mask throughout the video.

![enable pen tool to draw mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/replace-sky-background-in-after-effects-2.jpg)

**Step 3:** Now, select the top video in the timeline and search for “Key Cleaner.” Adjust the values of options under the key cleaner for precision.

![enable key cleaner](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/replace-sky-background-in-after-effects-3.jpg)

**Step 4:** If there are still some spaces left, use the “Simple Choker” effect to correct them. You can find it using the search bar and adjust the given values.

![enable simple choker effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/replace-sky-background-in-after-effects-4.jpg)

### Procedure 2: 3D Camera Tracking

**Step 1:** Now, duplicate the video again on the timeline and remove all its effects. Afterward, add a "3D Camera Tracker" in it. Then click "Analyze" and let the tracker analyze your video.

![activate 3d tracking for mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/replace-sky-background-in-after-effects-5.jpg)

**Step 2:** Next, select any three points from the footage and right-click on them. From the drop-down menu, select "Create Null and Camera" or "Create Solid and Camera."

### Procedure 3: Replacing the Sky

**Step 1:** Import the video of your sky and bring it to the timeline. Bring the sky in the back of your footage and change it to a 3D layer. Afterward, change the "Position" of your sky from the timeline. We recommend you set the values as far away as possible for realistic effect.

![adjust the position of sky](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/replace-sky-background-in-after-effects-7.jpg)

**Step 2:** Once you have set the sky's position, navigate towards the timeline panel again. From there, change the "Scale" of the background to set according to your footage. Afterward, see if the sky needs any flipping. This is because you must align the bright parts of the sky with the bright parts of the ground.

### Procedure 4: Color Matching

**Step 1:** Play with the color setting elements like "Saturation" or "Lightness." Change the position of their sliders to observe the changes in your footage.

![do basic color corrections](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/replace-sky-background-in-after-effects-9.jpg)

**Step 2:** Right-click on the timeline and add "New > Adjustment Layer" for settling colors. Afterward, see the preview of your video and export it.
