Pixel art is digital art created through computer software. In this digital art, images are edited on a pixel level. This gives the kind of aesthetic from computer video games using 8-bit and 16-bit technology. In general, this art uses very few color palettes, with some using only two.

The history of pixel art goes back to the 1930s with the monochromatic light bulb displays in New York City.

Pixel art tries to mimic the features of old video game graphics done by computers that were only able to display a few colors at once.

Digital pixel art evolved in such a way that artists are now dedicated to that art, and so create beautiful pixel art wallpapers that we'll show you in this article.
