## Tips for a Fantastic Logo Intro

We hope the comprehensive guide above was easy to follow and inspired you to try your hand at creating your own logo reveal video. Without further ado, let's discuss some tips for a fantastic logo intro.

* Start by conducting ample research to find as many intro videos as possible before attempting to make your own. Watching and learning will allow you to figure out what works and what you shouldn't do. You might also discover many resources to make a fantastic intro video you missed.
* Understand what message your company intends to send and tailor your intro video to portray it as accurately as possible. For instance, you could create a fun video to relay that your brand is easygoing.
* It wouldn't be a great idea to show your entire logo all at once. You could create anticipation by showing tiny bits of your logo in each frame till the final logo covers the screen.
* Design your video in a manner that keeps your audience glued to the screen. The dynamism will keep the viewer watching because they don't want to miss what comes next.
* Though it is not mandatory, you could end the video on a dark background, such as pitch black, to ensure your logo is clearly visible to your audience.
* The most important tip is to keep the video short, so you don't bore your audience. The average attention span for most viewers is shorter than 15 seconds, meaning any video longer than that will cause them to click away from your video.

**Unique**

It would be a shame if your logo looked like someone else's. Ensure your logo is your own creation and can easily be associated with your brand. Copying someone else's logo could make your audience mistake you for someone else.

**Simple**

Complex logos are hard to recognize. They are also much harder to enlarge or reduce. It would help to incorporate strong lines and letters into your logo as opposed to thinner ones.

**Versatile**

Your logo should look good with or without colour. If you must add colour, ensure you don't exceed four colours in the design. Remember that printing your logo when it contains too many colours becomes an expensive affair.

**Scalability**

It would help to ensure that your logo looks good in a big or small size. Remember that you will use your logo on letterheads and perhaps on large banners.

**Balanced**

Lastly, you should ensure that no element within your logo overpowers the rest. Ensure you keep all the elements in the centre because an asymmetrical logo with all the details in the corner doesn't look aesthetically pleasing.

## Tips for a Fantastic Logo Intro

We hope the comprehensive guide above was easy to follow and inspired you to try your hand at creating your own logo reveal video. Without further ado, let's discuss some tips for a fantastic logo intro.

* Start by conducting ample research to find as many intro videos as possible before attempting to make your own. Watching and learning will allow you to figure out what works and what you shouldn't do. You might also discover many resources to make a fantastic intro video you missed.
* Understand what message your company intends to send and tailor your intro video to portray it as accurately as possible. For instance, you could create a fun video to relay that your brand is easygoing.
* It wouldn't be a great idea to show your entire logo all at once. You could create anticipation by showing tiny bits of your logo in each frame till the final logo covers the screen.
* Design your video in a manner that keeps your audience glued to the screen. The dynamism will keep the viewer watching because they don't want to miss what comes next.
* Though it is not mandatory, you could end the video on a dark background, such as pitch black, to ensure your logo is clearly visible to your audience.
* The most important tip is to keep the video short, so you don't bore your audience. The average attention span for most viewers is shorter than 15 seconds, meaning any video longer than that will cause them to click away from your video.

![add a freeze frame to the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/eye-zoom-2.jpg)

Now trim the first video track from where the freeze frame starts on the second video. Also, cut the second video track to leave only the freeze frame

##### Step 3 Add a masking effect to the eye

With the two video tracks ready, it's time to apply a masking effect. Tap the **Effect** tab on the top menu bar and then find the **Shape Mask** under the utility section. Now drag and drop the effect to the freeze frame.

![add a masking effect to the eye](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/eye-zoom-3.jpg)

Double-click on the freeze frame clip to adjust the Shape Mask on the preview screen. Ensure the mask reveals the eye pupil only and check the **Invert Mask** box. Also, set the **Feather** number to 10.

![double-click on the freeze frame clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/eye-zoom-4.jpg)

##### Step 4 Add the transition video

Next, add the video you want to edit with an eye-zoom effect next to the first video track. Preview the video, and you'll notice your new video playing inside the eye mask.

With that done, move the playhead to the start of the freeze frame video and double-click the video clip to launch the settings window. Click the **Animation** tab before clicking **Customize** to see the keyframe settings. Tap the **Add** button to add a keyframe. Then, add a few frames using the playhead before clicking Add. But because we're zooming in, increase the scale to 160%. You can also add the rotation and position.

![add the transition video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/eye-zoom-5.jpg)

After setting the second keyframe, move the playhead to the right and add the third keyframe. This time, increase the scale number to 400%, as well as the rotation and position. Now preview the video, and you'll notice the rotating eye-zoom effect.

**_Preparation:_**

First, you need to create a close-up eye video. Although you can do that with your digital camera, a standard smartphone should do it just fine. Just ask a friend or family member to use your phone's rear camera to record your eye centered on the screen. Ensure that the eye is as close as possible and you don't lose focus. The camera should be around 10cm away from your face. And lest I forget, the flash should be ON.

## How to Create an Eye-zoom Transition

##### Step 1 Align the video clips on Filmora

After recording a close-up eye video, add it on Wondershare Filmora and duplicate it. Alternatively, you can add the video to the first and second tracks.

## Part 4\. Best Kdenlive Alternative to Edit Videos

Kdenlive has several drawbacks that prevent it from becoming the best video editor. Even though the features are sufficient for beginners, it is not suitable for professional editing. There is a lack of advanced options such as motion tracking or faster video production. Besides, the effects are very limited in number and so are the text and audio effects. That is why we recommend Wondershare Filmora as the best alternative to Kdenlive Mac and Windows.

Filmora is a [premium video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) with video capturing feature. You can record your screen and webcam video. There is no dearth of effects, filters, elements and royalty-free media files. The user interface is cleaner and hence, it is suitable for both beginners and professionals. Here are the key features of Filmora.
