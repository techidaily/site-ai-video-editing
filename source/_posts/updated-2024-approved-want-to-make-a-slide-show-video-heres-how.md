## Part 3: Hot FAQs on Online Video Converter for Instagram

### 1\. Is it illegal to download Instagram videos?

Many applications, online converter tools, and sites are available for safely downloading Instagram videos. However, the service provider does not permit third-party content download from the app. Yet, these online converter tools are not entirely illegal- you should only download personal use instead of commercial usage. Also, downloads are allowed from public IG accounts primarily.

### 2\. How to download reels video with Original HD Quality?

Many converter tools are available for downloading high-quality videos from Instagram Reels. The best ones we tested out with these benefits are InstaVideoSave and iGram. In the former, you can download HD quality videos to 1080p resolution, while iGram allows video downloads to 720p.

### 3\. How can I download reels audio or sound only?

There are specific tools that users can opt for to download Instagram videos in audio format. AceThinker, for example, is the best online converter to download only the audio from the Instagram video links you add. Users opt for this software to convert IG-based music videos into MP3 files.

## Final Words

Overall, multiple online converter tools are available for downloading different IG content like Reels, Videos, and Images to video/audio/image file format. Among them, InstaVideoSave and F2mp are the two tools where we noticed the best benefits. However, F2mp is a paid software, so choose it only for premium features.
