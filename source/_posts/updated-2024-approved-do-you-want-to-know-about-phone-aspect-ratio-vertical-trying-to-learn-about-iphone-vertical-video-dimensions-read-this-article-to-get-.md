## Part 1 What is Phone Aspect Ratio Vertical?

The vertical phone aspect ratio is the “proportional” relationship between the screen's width and height. For example, if your image or video has an aspect ratio of 4:5, it simply means the width of the screen (photo or video) is four times the height of the image.

The vertical phone aspect ratio is the “proportional” relationship between the screen's width and height. For example, if your image or video has an aspect ratio of 4:5, it simply means the width of the screen (photo or video) is four times the height of the image.

Back in the television days, you might have seen certain old pictures with black padding on either side of the screen. It was just that they were shot in different aspect ratios and your television screen had different aspect ratios.

### Aspect Ratio Vs Resolution

Remember that aspect ratio does not refer to the physical size of an image or its dimensions in pixels (resolution). So aspect ratio 3:1 does not refer to the actual width and height of the image or video; it just describes their relationship.

You are wrong if you think aspect ratio is just another fancy name for resolution. Think again. Check out how it is calculated.

"

| |  Aspect Ratio | Resolution                                                     |                                                                                    |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Definition      | The Ratio of the width of an image to the height of the image. | Total number of pixels displayed on your screen (computer, cell phone, television) |
| Commonly Used   | ● 1:1 ● 3:1 ● 3:2 ● 4:3 ● 5:4 ● 9:1 ● 16:9                     | ● 640x480 ● 800x600 ● 1024x768                                                     |

### Aspect Ratio Calculator

To get the resolution, you need to multiply width times the height. To get aspect ratio, the formula is: Divide the width by the height or simply divide the long side by the short side.

There are multiple online aspect ratio calculators available. Check out the value for both the images and the videos generated through the photo ratio calculator for your ease.

| Common Aspect Ratio                   | AR Width | AR Height | Image Width | Image Height |
| ------------------------------------- | -------- | --------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| 1:1(square)                           | 1        | 1         | 1920        | 1920         |
| 5:4 (large and medium format cameras) | 5        | 4         | 1920        | 1536         |
| 4:3 Standard                          | 4        | 3         | 1920        | 1440         |
| 3:2 (35mm camera)                     | 3        | 2         | 1920        | 1280         |
| 16:9                                  | 16       | 9         | 1920        | 1080         |
| 3:1 Panoramic                         | 3        | 1         | 1920        | 640          |
| 9:16                                  | 9        | 16        | 1080        | 1920         |

For example, the aspect ratio of 3:1 may be an image of 3m wide and 1m high. At the same time it can be 3 feet wide and 1 foot high. For further simplification, consider dimensions in pixels: a 6000×4000 image has 3:2 aspect ratios.

Always remember this small but crucial point. The aspect ratio refers to the image or video you captured or recorded and the display (or screen) in which your video or image would be displayed.

### Why is the aspect ratio important?

In the age of web content, asking why aspect ratio is important? Some may consider it naïve. Images need to be uploaded at different aspect ratios for different uses (desktop vs. mobile or blog vs. social media). Incorrect aspect ratio affects your final image and end-user experience.

Choice of the wrong aspect ratio can eliminate the potential for editing (cropping and resizing). In addition, using the correct aspect ratios saves you from facing the trouble of distortion or clipping.

### Phone aspect ratio vertical

Back in the day, taking aspect ratio vertical (portrait mode) footage was considered unprofessional and a sign of an amateur. But the digital revolution has changed that. Now from unforgivable sin, the vewayal mode has practically become a mainstream media sensation. Vertical style has now become the dominant format.

![phone aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-7.png)

Phone aspect ratio vertical simply means taller screen than wider. The most common type is 9:16 (1080x1920 pixels), a typical vertical videos aspect ratio. Although this phone aspect ratio vertical comes in a few more shapes and sizes such as 4:5, 2:3.

## Part 3 Tips to Create Phone Vertical Videos

Creating vertical videos is crucial for getting engagements and growing your brand. It is easy with a phone because most smartphones, by default, record in 9:16, which is the standard vertical aspect ratio. But with a camera, you have to manually edit to the correct aspect ratio before you shoot it.

You can also shoot horizontally and then change it to vertical, but it needs professional videographer expertise.

Who wants to rotate their phones watching videos? Well, as far as the trend, Let us see some tiny but handy tips for creating vertical phone videos.

### 1\. Choose the correct aspect ratio

Video taller than the 1:1 aspect ratio is commonly considered Vertical video. Types of these vertical aspects ratio include 4:5 (social), 2:3 and 9:16\. They are all taller than they are wide, thus vertical.

Choosing the correct aspect ratio for your vertical video, always think about why and where you intend to use the video. The second important thing you should consider is your plans for editing that video.

Cropping horizontal can be irritating and sometimes disappointing at the same time. Producing a 9:16 vertical frame at HD resolution from a horizontal HD frame may result in very pixelated and low-quality footage.

If, for some reason, you still want first to shoot it horizontal and then change it back to mobile vertical video size. You may need to shoot in 4K horizontally to get extra pixels to work with. It can later be cropped in the sides to 9:16 (Vertical phone aspect ratio). Plus, you won't need to scale it anymore.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\. Direct your viewer's eyes

For hooking social media viewers, you need to put your most interesting visual upfront. These include GIFs, colourful stop-motion or looping animation. Always try to match your first couple of shots with your overall brand personality.

3\. Screen splitting into two or more

![screen splitting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-11.png)

A tall vertical screen can be styled with multiple horizontal clips on top of each other. These clips must relate to your relevant content and overall look. Natural lines or patterns can help display them in the most creative ways.

### 4\. Be close to your subject

For producing an intimate experience with the vertical frame, you should get closer to the subject. Most of the action will be positioned to the centre as your viewers scroll. Do not let cut off or cover up your main subject by any text and make sure you leave enough room for text, emojis and stickers.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 5\. Filling the vertical space

First, make sure that your subject is vertical-friendly. Then get closer and fill the space within the vertical frame. The vertical frame can be filled through the following:

● Up-close shot (if the subject is personal).

● Raising the camera high and tilting it down (to film things like a long, empty road).

● Bird’s-eye view from above.

![rule of third](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/phone-aspect-ratio-10.png)

This photography rule says not to place the main subject directly in the center of the frame. Create more dynamic composition by creating imaginary (Horizontal & Vertical) lines that divide your frame into thirds.

You have to place your subject either on the lines or where the lines meet up. And guess what? You don't need to draw imaginary nowadays. Most cameras and smartphones provide you with this option.

### 6\. Avoid Shaking

You do not want to distract your viewers with shaky camera moments. Normal pan and 360-degree rotation are acceptable or maybe even essential. But moving side to side too quickly will make it difficult for the camera to process that information. You better use a selfie stick or gimbal.

Now, check out the best vertical video ratios for various social platforms.
