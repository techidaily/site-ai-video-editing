### Step 3: Changing the Distortion Control

Scroll down to find "Distortion" in the controls and expand it. The user is suggested to increase the color distortion to give an RGB effect to the footage. After that, you should reduce the distortion rate to 0 so that different artifacts can be eliminated effortlessly.

### Step 5: Animating the Glitch Effect

To animate the glitch, use the playhead on the top and drag it to the first position where the effect should start from. Hit the stopwatch located on the left of "Master Amplitude." It will create a keyframe. Alter the "Master Amplitude" to 0 as we do not want the clip to begin with a glitch.

The slow zoom effect is one of the most viral and trending video effects on social media platforms. If you want to add slow zoom effect to your video for a certain portion, you can do the same from your smartphone as well as computer.
