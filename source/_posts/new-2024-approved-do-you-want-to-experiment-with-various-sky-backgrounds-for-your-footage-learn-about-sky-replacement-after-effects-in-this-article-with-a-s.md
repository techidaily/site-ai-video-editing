### Procedure 1: Removing Video Background

**Step 1:** After bringing your video to the timeline, navigate towards the top search bar at the left. In the Effects Control option, search for the "Extractor" effect and add it. Then, change the "Channel" of this effect to your "Blue" or "Luminance." Change the position of both sliders there to remove and feather the background.

![enable extract effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/replace-sky-background-in-after-effects-1.jpg)

**Step 2:** To avoid removing parts other than the sky, duplicate this video to the timeline. From the bottom video, eliminate the extractor effect. Navigate towards the top toolbar and select the "Mask" option. Create a mask around the ground at the bottom of the video. In the timeline, click the "Mask Path" option to create the mask throughout the video.

![enable pen tool to draw mask](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/replace-sky-background-in-after-effects-2.jpg)

**Step 3:** Now, select the top video in the timeline and search for “Key Cleaner.” Adjust the values of options under the key cleaner for precision.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![enable key cleaner](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/replace-sky-background-in-after-effects-3.jpg)

**Step 4:** If there are still some spaces left, use the “Simple Choker” effect to correct them. You can find it using the search bar and adjust the given values.

### Procedure 2: 3D Camera Tracking

### Procedure 3: Replacing the Sky

**Step 1:** Import the video of your sky and bring it to the timeline. Bring the sky in the back of your footage and change it to a 3D layer. Afterward, change the "Position" of your sky from the timeline. We recommend you set the values as far away as possible for realistic effect.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![adjust the position of sky](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/replace-sky-background-in-after-effects-7.jpg)

**Step 2:** Once you have set the sky's position, navigate towards the timeline panel again. From there, change the "Scale" of the background to set according to your footage. Afterward, see if the sky needs any flipping. This is because you must align the bright parts of the sky with the bright parts of the ground.

![do basic color corrections](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/replace-sky-background-in-after-effects-9.jpg)
