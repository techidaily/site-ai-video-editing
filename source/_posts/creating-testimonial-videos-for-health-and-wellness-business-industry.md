## Creating Testimonial Videos For Health And Wellness Business Industry

It's not easy to get a testimonial video right. You need to know how to write one, find the right people to speak in it, and make sure your audience likes what they hear. But post-production can be even more challenging than getting everything else right: editing, adding effects, and music—it's enough to make your head spin!

Fortunately for you, we're here with our step-by-step guide on how to edit testimonial videos using [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). So, sit tight because we're about to take you through each stage of this process from start to finish!

## Import Your Media Files to Filmora Video Editor

It includes your testimonial videos and video/photo materials. You can import your media files from the following sources:

* Medial Files
* Medial Folder
* From Camera or a Phone
* With Instant Cutter Tool
* With Auto Beat Sync

![import your media files](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/import-media-to-filmora.jpg)

To save time, it is best to prepare ahead of time all your videos materials before start editing your testimonial video. Save it in just one folder including your script guide, photos, and videos

## Select Your Preferred Project Aspect Ratio

Aspect ratio is the relationship between the width and height of your video, which determines how it will look on different screens. There are several commonly used aspect ratios such as:

* Widescreen (16:9) – Recommended for Youtube and Facebook
* Instagram (1:1) – Recommended for Instagram and Facebook
* Portrait (9:16) – Recommended for Tiktok, Stories and Reels
* Standard (4:3) – Recommended for Facebook, LinkedInn and other

![select your project aspect ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/filmora-project-aspect-ratio.jpg)

Being aware of the right ratio for each social media platform will help you to advertise correctly. It also affects how you edit your video. For example, if you choose a different aspect ratio than what was originally recorded by Filmora's camera tools, then some of your content may be cut off or stretched out in undesirable ways when viewed on certain devices (e.g., smartphones).

## Split Testimonial Video into Small Clips

![split testimonial video into small clips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/split-testimonial-video-filmora.jpg)

When you're ready, drag your video testimonials to the Show Track then begin to use the “split” button to cut out parts of the video.

To split a video into smaller sections, start by cutting it down to the appropriate length by moving the playhead to the beginning position of the part you want to cut, clicking the Split icon (the scissors icon) on the toolbar, or clicking the Split button on the playhead.

From there, repeat this procedure until you've completed the whole narrative. You'll be left with numerous cut segments that you may either delete or rearrange. To remove a clip from your movie, choose Delete from the toolbar or right-click and select delete.

## Add Catchy Headlines and Text (Optional)

If desired, add catchy headlines/texts like "How to Eliminate Chronic Pain Forever”. You can do this by clicking Text button from toolbar located across top portion of screen (beside Transitions button).

![add catchy headlines and text](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/add-logo-to-video-filmora.jpg)

Adding a phrase or a short sentence is called “headline”. It would be nice to add one of them at your video, so that viewers can get an idea about what it's about before watching it in full. The text can be customized by using different font styles like bold, italic, underline etc., as well as its size and color.

## Input Subtitle

Subtitles are used to translate the spoken word into text. If you have a video that is in a language other than English, subtitles can be added so that viewers who do not speak the language can still understand what is being said. Subtitles are also useful if you want to add subtitles for educational purposes, such as teaching students how to pronounce certain words and phrases.

![input subtitle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/input-subtitle-filmora.jpg)

## Apply Transitions to Your Testimonial Video

You can add fade-in transitions to clips, as well as fade-out transitions.

To add a fade-in transition: Click on the first clip and select "Effects." Then, click "Transition." Choose a transition from the category of “Fades” and then apply it to the first clip by clicking on its thumbnail image.

To add a fade-out transition: Click on the second clip and select “Effects.” Then, click “Transition.” Choose a transition from the category of “Fades” and then apply it to the second clip by clicking on its thumbnail image.

Feel free also to use other transitions as you want, but be careful not to use an overly extreme one.

![apply transitions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/apply-transition-filmora.jpg)

## Add Background Music to Testimonial Video

You may choose from a wide range of music in the audio library. It's available both online and offline.

You can also easily add background music from your computer by going to the "Media" menu and then selecting the import option. Make sure to use a non-copyright music so that you don't run into any copyright problems when you post your video. There are several no copyright tracks on Youtube; simply search for no copyright background music or get it from other sites that provide a free-royalty background music.

![add background music](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/add-music-test-video.jpg)

## Add a Logo/Watermark

To add a logo or watermark to your video, follow these steps:

* Import your Business Logo to the Media Folder.
* Then drag it into the Show Track area.
* Resize it to the ideal dimensions, then position it in the correct location in your video. It's preferable to place it at the top or button section of the video.

You may also add your company's logo at the end of the video as a fade-out transition.

![add business logo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/add-logo-to-video-filmora.jpg)

By adding a logo or watermark to your video, you can make it harder for people to illegally distribute and share your video without permission. It helps also to promote your brand or business. When viewers see your logo or watermark throughout the video, they will be more likely to remember who made the video and where they can find more information about your company or products.

## Insert Thumbnail

A video thumbnail is an image that represents your video to viewers. It should be eye-catching, but not so much that it's distracting. The right video thumbnail can help you increase views and engagement on your content.

Place the thumbnail at the beginning of the video, and make sure it's catchy! Your viewers won't have time to look at it in detail, but they will glance at it in passing. Make sure to include relevant text and images that can hook your audience and keep them watching!

![insert thumbnail](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/insert-subnail-filmora.jpg)

After completing the editing process, you can export your testimonial video in a variety of formats. To do this, click on the "Export" button in the upper right-hand corner of Wondershare Filmora.

Recommended Export Quality

* Resolution: 720 or 1080
* Frame rate 30 fps

Select your preferred file format and destination for storage.

## Part 1 How to Match Paint Color Without a Sample

We will be discussing three methods in which you will get the perfect answer to the question of how can I **match my paint color** perfectly. So, let us jump right into the first method without further delay.

### 01**Method 1 Perfect Match Paint without a sample**

The following steps will help you attain **Perfect Match Paint** without the necessity of a sample.

**Step Clean the print area**

The first and the most essential step is to make the area where you will be painting clean and tidy. As time passes, fingerprints, marks, dust, and many other things accumulate and make the area dirty. And if you do not clean the same, then the paint you do on it becomes much darker, dull, and gives a shabby outlook.

Use a damp sponge, and if possible, it is better to use soap on the sponge. And most importantly, you will have to let the area dry out completely before you put it on to test the paint. Moreover, the new paint adheres much better than before when you clean the area.

![clean area](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-do-perfect-match-paint-100%25-the-easy-way-1.jpg)

**Step Scraping off**

The next step requires you to use a utility knife. And with that utility knife, you will have to scrap an inch or 2.5 cm of your wall paint. It is because, when you have a sample, you can easily bring that to the store for **paint matching near me**. Use a plastic bag to secure the sample price. It will prevent the paint of the sample to smudge or getting any marks or destruction.

And after you **find paint colors** that match the ones you need, try to dab a little of that paint on the sample. As a result, you will precisely know how perfectly the new shade of paint matches with the new one. It ensures optimum precision and can be the **best way to match paint**.

![scrapping off](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-do-perfect-match-paint-100%25-the-easy-way-2.jpg)

**Step Bring the object if possible**

The best way to maintain absolute precision in the match is by bringing an object to the store. You can also opt for a **car paint match near me**. If you bring the object with the color for matching, it ensures perfect matching and 10precision. Nowadays, the technology is highly advanced and will help you obtain the best paint match.

### 02**Method 2 Using a sample**

Since we have discussed the steps for matching paint without the sample, you must know how to match color with the help of samples. So, here are the steps for doing so.

**Step 1: Click a Picture of the original hue**

This step is necessary for better precision and matching the color as perfectly as possible. Clock a picture of the original color sample. The color in the photo might not be absolutely precise. But it can help to a large extent to match the color as perfectly as possible. You can easily take the sample to any renowned color matching store, like, **dupli color paint match** and have the perfect color matching done.

And it is better to not one picture or from just one angel. It will be best to take numerous snaps and that too, from different angles, sides and lighting conditions. It will help you get the original color shades in different angles, shades and lights, and it increases the possibility of matching the color as impeccably as possible.

**Step 2: Bring home more than one sample**

You will see numerous samples of paints that you feel will match the color you brought from your home as a sample of the original color. You might not be sure which sample perfectly matches the original sample color at that exact moment. However, if you find a sample that seems t match perfectly, you must not make your decision right at that moment. Because in the store, the lighting, angles, and many other factors play a hugely influential role in enhancing the shades of the sample colors.

So, the color you see in the store often does not remain the same in natural light settings; it might get a bit darker or lighter. So, it is always better to bring home those samples that you feel match the original shade of the sample you brought. This increases the possibility of being the most precise and impeccable in matching the colors.

![samples color match](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-do-perfect-match-paint-100%25-the-easy-way-3.jpg)

**Step 3: stick the sample and compare.**

This is the final step for matching the colors of paint with the help of a sample. After bringing home the samples that you found similar to the original sample, tape them to the wall. Take a sample at a time and use a tap to place them on the wall. You can also tape all the samples side by side, leaving enough gap between them.

It helps better compare and matches the sample's colors and the wall. A common thing that occurs is that in the daytime, you find one color matching perfectly, whereas, in the nighttime, some other sample color is matching perfectly. In such an instance, it is best to ask the store if they can give you the shade by mixing both the colors: the color that perfectly matched with the sample in the daytime and the color that perfectly matched with the sample in the time.

![taping samples](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/how-to-do-perfect-match-paint-100%25-the-easy-way-4.jpg)

It is an optional step, and you can opt for this step if you are not getting a hundred per cent confidence in choosing the correct color. Try to paint the colors of the samples that you are finding similar to the wall. Since the wall already has the original color, when you paint the sample colors on it, the sample colors clearly distinguish which samples match more impeccably with the actual color.

### 02**Method 2 Using a sample**

**Step 1: Click a Picture of the original hue**

This step is necessary for better precision and matching the color as perfectly as possible. Clock a picture of the original color sample. The color in the photo might not be absolutely precise. But it can help to a large extent to match the color as perfectly as possible. You can easily take the sample to any renowned color matching store, like, **dupli color paint match** and have the perfect color matching done.

And it is better to not one picture or from just one angel. It will be best to take numerous snaps and that too, from different angles, sides and lighting conditions. It will help you get the original color shades in different angles, shades and lights, and it increases the possibility of matching the color as impeccably as possible.

**Step 2: Bring home more than one sample**

You will see numerous samples of paints that you feel will match the color you brought from your home as a sample of the original color. You might not be sure which sample perfectly matches the original sample color at that exact moment.

AR or **Augmented Reality** and VR or Virtual Reality are quite a common discussion in the world of technology. Similarly, the technology-driven workspaces demand a seamless workspace collaboration post-pandemic. People are used to working from home and the workspace culture is changing rapidly due to such habits. 59% of the US workers want to continue WFH according to a study by TalentLyft. To cut the cost of daily travel and dedicate more quality time to work, employees are prioritizing online offices. On the other hand, employers are willing to save office space and other expenses with such a professional routine.

## Part 1 What is Augmented Reality Conferencing and What's VR Video Streaming Workflow

Before jumping to the application of AR and VR, it’s important to clarify the concept of the two different technologies. While AR is an enhanced version of the real world, VR is totally virtual. As a basic concept, note that, augmented reality is an arrangement of the user’s real-world view whereas virtual reality is totally an illusion based on a video. AR can be accessed from a phone to set the camera with a view and a virtual arrangement would be present within it. For example, if there’s a room in the real world, with an **AR video conference**, people can be adjusted virtually.

![ar in conference](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/is-augmented-reality-conferencing-the-future-of-workplace-collaboration-2.jpg)

Virtual reality, as the name suggests, is totally in control of the system. With goggles or headsets, one can view computer-generated video with 360 degrees of technical effects to be seemed as real. This technology is mainly applicable for a video currently and there’re more scopes to experiment further.

![vr video streaming](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/is-augmented-reality-conferencing-the-future-of-workplace-collaboration-3.jpg)

Here comes the question, how these technologies can be merged with a permanent business structure that can be as effective as the older system, and there’s scope for even better results? Well, according to a study by FinancesOnline, 72% of the US customers find AR for better collaboration and 69% think it increases the efficiency in the workspace. Also, 49% of the IT experts believe that AR can access real-time information sooner.

The key idea behind **augmented reality conferencing** is to omit the parameters like distance, time, and space expenses and motivate positive collaboration in business workflow. There are multiple advantages of this technology for both employees and employers. As people are getting accustomed to the virtual setting in any professional or personal work from home, the plan to shift to a semi-virtual or virtual office structure is not vague now. In fact, this adaptation might take place sooner than expected as a long-term effect of the pandemic.

**How** augmented reality conferencing **and virtual reality video streaming will be working?**

AR and VR can be implemented through different technologies and hardware devices. As a result, employees can attend a meeting from home, just with a mobile application that enables the office structure in the room. Or, 2-3 members can be present physically in a meeting room while others are joining from remote places through VR. A 3D video streaming would overshadow the physical absence of the teammates. At the same time, the resources can be shared in no time for reference and transparent communication.

So, how exactly a business can be affected by **augmented reality video conferencing** on a large scale? Here’s a keen observation from both perspectives.

## Part 2 Pros and Cons of AR and VR Conferencing

Here comes the question, how these technologies can be merged with a permanent business structure that can be as effective as the older system, and there’s scope for even better results? Well, according to a study by FinancesOnline, 72% of the US customers find AR for better collaboration and 69% think it increases the efficiency in the workspace. Also, 49% of the IT experts believe that AR can access real-time information sooner.

The key idea behind **augmented reality conferencing** is to omit the parameters like distance, time, and space expenses and motivate positive collaboration in business workflow. There are multiple advantages of this technology for both employees and employers. As people are getting accustomed to the virtual setting in any professional or personal work from home, the plan to shift to a semi-virtual or virtual office structure is not vague now. In fact, this adaptation might take place sooner than expected as a long-term effect of the pandemic.

**How** augmented reality conferencing **and virtual reality video streaming will be working?**

AR and VR can be implemented through different technologies and hardware devices. As a result, employees can attend a meeting from home, just with a mobile application that enables the office structure in the room. Or, 2-3 members can be present physically in a meeting room while others are joining from remote places through VR. A 3D video streaming would overshadow the physical absence of the teammates. At the same time, the resources can be shared in no time for reference and transparent communication.

So, how exactly a business can be affected by **augmented reality video conferencing** on a large scale? Here’s a keen observation from both perspectives.

## Part 2 Pros and Cons of AR and VR Conferencing

## Part 1 What is Augmented Reality Conferencing and What's VR Video Streaming Workflow

Before jumping to the application of AR and VR, it’s important to clarify the concept of the two different technologies. While AR is an enhanced version of the real world, VR is totally virtual. As a basic concept, note that, augmented reality is an arrangement of the user’s real-world view whereas virtual reality is totally an illusion based on a video. AR can be accessed from a phone to set the camera with a view and a virtual arrangement would be present within it. For example, if there’s a room in the real world, with an **AR video conference**, people can be adjusted virtually.
