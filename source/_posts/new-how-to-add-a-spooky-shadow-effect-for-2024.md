## How to Add a Spooky Shadow Effect

Wondershare Filmora's main purpose is the empowerment of content creators. The latest updates to the program are one of the pieces of evidence.

Whether you're a horror content creator or simply living the Halloween vibe 24/7, continue reading to know how to use its latest masking feature to create a cool shadow effect for your next mind-blowing social media video.

## How to Use The Masking Effect

[Wondershare Filmora's](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) latest Masking feature allows its users to select a specific clip that they can overlay on other parts of the video or other clips.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

The feature allows you to insert the mask in any shape, such as a rectangle, circle, or triangle. You can also import any shapes you like if you can't find them in the presets library. You can also adjust the mask placement, width, height, and feather effect.

Without further ado, let's see the detailed step-by-step guide for this effect.

### a. Preparation

You will need at least three shots of the same frame to get the shadow effect to work. The first is the main video, the second is the shadow clip, and the last would be a clip portraying just a plain background.

Make sure that your camera stays at the same point and angle. You can use a tripod for assurance.

Take the first main video and don't forget to mark the positioning of the object for the next take. Then, you can shoot the shadow clip following the marking of the object to match its position in the main clip.

Finally, shoot the final clip without the object on the frame.

Step 3: Move the play head to the start of the shadow clip. Trim the main clip right on that mark so both clips have the same start by clicking the scissor icon and deleting the unused part.

## Top 10 Voice Over Generators [Windows, Mac, Android, iPhone, and Onli

#### Best Voice Generator and Video Editor

Filmora's Text to Speech (TTS) function allows you to convert your text files to voiceover and bring more elements to enrich your video.

![filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/features/text-speech-img1.png)

Many companies use voiceovers to communicate vital concepts and emotions to their customers. Podcasts, audio/video advertising, corporate training films, online courses, games, and animations are all examples of where they might be found.

Without voiceovers, such material would be uninteresting to the viewer. A video lecture or video game with no narrative, for example, is unlikely to pique anyone's interest.

Good voiceovers, on the other hand, are not inexpensive to make.

Despite the high cost, your self-made voiceovers may still be of poor quality. Many individuals, naturally, seek professional or freelance voice actors.

Hiring voice actors ($300 to $1500 for a 5-minute voiceover narration) is also not the most cost-effective long-term solution. Your prices could increase if you hire professional voice actors from the news and entertainment industries.

There are resources available. Voice over generators is available online. Most software products come in both free and premium versions, which you can pick from depending on your needs. These programs will swiftly help you reach your text to audio transformation goals, whether you're a YouTube content maker in need of an informative voiceover or a disabled person looking for a user-friendly text-to-speech converter.

Yes! That's correct. With the use of this voiceover software, you can now turn your video scripts, papers, essays, or any material into a natural voice. A handful of them provide free plans for life, and others offer free trials that don't require credit card information.

Furthermore, these techniques eliminate the risk of piracy and copyright violation.

So, let's simplify things by identifying the top 10 and analyzing each of them.

1. **ai (Supports Web)**

![voice-generators-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/voice-generators-1.jpg)

Resemble.ai operates in a variety of ways. It can not only help you make a speech out of the text, but it can also generate text for adverts with a single click. The platform can also produce a personalized voice that you can use as a voice assistant for Alexa, Google, and other services. The technique can also be used by call centres to clone their agents' voices and customize them.

Resemble gives you four alternative ways to create synthetic voices. You can use the API to generate voices, record up to 50 samples immediately on the online platform, choose from a large number of voice actors, or submit raw audio without a script.

Features

* The software allows you to Customize your brand's tone.
* It creates responsive IVR agents.
* Possible to do Advertisement text generation with AI with one click.
* Allows Instant language translation.

Cons

* The user interface could be enhanced.
* \- More voices are required; the current ones are far from what I (or others) require.

Price

The cheapest package is $30 per month.

For a personalized plan, contact a Resemble representative.

1. **ai ( Supports Web, Mobile**

![voice-generators-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/voice-generators-2.jpg)

Lovo.ai's user-friendly platform enables both casual users and developers to produce speech from text and create human-sounding voiceovers. Over 180 voice styles in 33 languages are available on the platform. The site is also regularly updated with new voices every day, giving consumers a wide range of options.

In just 15 minutes, the tool can generate personalized voices. On this platform, converting text to speech requires only three simple steps. Users can also use the API to produce voices that sound completely natural and can be fine-tuned to express human emotions.

Features

* Listening, conversion and sharing are all unlimited.
* A large voice library is available.
* Up to 15000 characters can be converted at once.
* Collection of unique voices. Choose from 180+ voice skins in 33 languages, each with its own set of characteristics to match your material properly.
* Genuine voices. Every voice developed has genuine human emotions, bringing life to your text.

Cons

* While the UI/UX is simple to use, it feels a little bland and dull."
* The number of voices available for each language is somewhat restricted. More voice samples are available."
* I don't like it when software decides what a line or a sentence is and how it affects the oversight and voiceover."

Pricing

Lovo.ai now offers two pricing options: (all pricing is for annual plans).

$34.99 per month for personal

$99.99 per month for Freelancer

The Personal plan gives access to all of the platform's features as well as 30 monthly voiceover downloads, which should be enough for most people.

Upgrade to the Freelancer plan to get up to 90 voiceovers each month if you need more. Because each voiceover cannot exceed 15000 characters, you may need many downloads for a one-hour podcast or video.

You will have to pay an additional $69.99 per month per voice for voice cloning. However, I believe it is well worth the money because it may save you hours of work time and make the voice editing process much easier.

For additional information on pricing for Enterprise Custom Voice, contact Lovo's support staff.

1. **Synthesia ( Supports Web, Mobile**

![voice-generators-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/voice-generators-3.jpg)

Synthesia is the fourth stage cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval

Synthesia stands apart from the rest of the software on this list. It's a video maker that also has an AI presenter.

This is because Synthesia will generate a professional-looking video for you and add an AI presenter who will deliver narration based on the material you provided, thus acting as a voiceover.

Features

* Avatars - Users can use this unique tool to add an AI presenter to their films. There are many pre-built avatars to pick from.

* Video with AI Presenter — Once you've chosen your avatar, all you have to do now is fill in your script. Synthesia allows you to make videos up to 2.5 hours long.
* From text to video For the first time, turn plain words into a professional-looking video.
* There are more than 60 languages available. We now support over 60 distinct languages.
* There are over 45 AI avatars. Synthesia comes with 40+ avatars right out of the box.
* These are Avatars that are unique to you.
* Uploads of audio are possible using synthesis.
* There is Music available for the background.
* Ability to do your Downloads in MP4

Pricing

Synthesia offers two pricing options.

$30 per month for personal use (monthly billing)

Enterprise – Individualized Pricing

However, you must pay for add-ons if you want the following features.

Synthesia API – beginning at $49 per month. Custom Avatar – $1000 one-time.

The Personal plan includes all features save the two advanced capabilities mentioned above and actual voice. As a result, you can make up to 10 minutes of video per month.

Assume you've exhausted your video credits. More credits can be purchased for $30 for ten credits. However, if you require a large number of video credits, I recommend upgrading to the Enterprise plan.

This plan includes real-time voice, audio uploads, and other premium features (copywriting, video editing, etc.)

Cons

* Only video producers can use it. If you're a podcaster, you'll be disappointed with the tool.
* Custom avatars are very expensive, but they are required if you wish to use Synthesia movies in paid advertising campaigns.

**4.Murf.ai ( Supports Web, Mobile)**

![voice-generators-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/voice-generators-4.jpg)

Murf.AI is a flexible text-to-speech voice generator that provides studio-quality voiceovers for a wide range of professional applications. The tool has a large voice library with over 115 distinct voices in 15 languages. Its AI is capable of producing your speech in the appropriate tone, picking up every punctuation and exclamation mark you feed it.

It also has a grammatical assistant, so you can create proofread scripts that will only improve your voiceover work. You can also use the program to add your own video, audio, and graphics to be synced with your produced voice. With its enterprise plan, the tool also has a powerful collaboration capability.

Pricing

* Murf now offers three paid pricing options: (all pricing is for yearly plans).
* Monthly Basic – $13
* \-$26 per month for Pro
* Enterprise – monthly fees start at $83

The Basic package includes full HD video quality and practically all capabilities (excluding voice editing). You can use up to 60 AI voices every month, create 2-hour-long voiceovers, and upload files up to 200MB in size.

For most users, I believe this plan is adequate. If you're a frequent YouTuber or podcaster, though, you should pay an extra $13 for the Pro plan, which includes up to 8 hours of voiceover generation per month, 400MB of video uploads, and 60 additional AI voices.

Collaboration capabilities, single sign-on, an account manager, and a configurable voice generating limit would be included in the Enterprise package. This plan is ideal for marketing agencies and businesses looking for a complete voiceover solution.

Cons

* Developers, according to several critics, should add more languages. Murf has many fewer AI voices in the library than his competitors.

**5.Play.ht**

![voice-generators-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/voice-generators-5.jpg)

Play. Ht is a web-based voice generator that allows you to generate high-quality text-to-speech. Because of its basic user interface, the platform is exceptionally simple to use. It has a text box on the home page where you may input your text, choose the language, gender, and voice style, and choose the conversion speed.

Features

* Customization — To fully customize the voiceover, highlight the words. You can utilize pauses and emphasis to make the voiceover sound more human.

* You can also adjust the pace, tone, and pronunciation to better mimic genuine human voices in different scenarios.
* Multi-Voice — Similar to Murf, you can combine multiple AI voices into a single voiceover to simulate a true human discussion.

* Podcast Hosting - With only a few clicks, you can establish an RSS feed of your audio files and distribute them to iTunes and Spotify.

* Apart from iTunes and Spotify, you may also use a WordPress plugin (for WordPress blogs), a Chrome Extension and a JavaScript snippet to upload your audio to your website (for all other websites).

* Sounds Analytics - Play. It will gather information on all audio. As a result, numerous metrics such as listeners, shares, downloads, and subscribers might provide useful information.

Pricing

Play. ht has four pricing tiers as of August 2021\. (all pricing below is for yearly plans).

$14.25 per month for personal use

$29.25 per month for professionals

$74.25 per month in Growth

$149.25 per month for business

Commercial rights, premium voice collecting, or podcast hosting are not included in the Personal plan, which severely limits the practical use of the voices. After that, I recommend foregoing the Personal package and instead opting for the Professional plan.

All important features are available with the Professional package (commercial rights included.) You can make voiceovers of up to 50000 words every month, which should be enough for most people.

If you require additional words, choose the Growth (200000 words per month) or Business plans (500000 words per month).

Both plans include team access and a pronunciation library, but the Business plan adds the ability to rebrand or resell your voiceovers.

Cons

* Other than English and European languages, voices made in other languages are not flawless.
* There isn't a built-in video editor for adding voiceovers to videos.

1. **Clipchamp**

![voice-generators-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/voice-generators-6.jpg)

Clipchamp is a powerful text to speech generator that uses artificial intelligence to convert words into voiceovers for everything from professional videos to advertisements. In a matter of seconds, it can convert an imported script into speech.

Because of its simplicity, Clipchamp is another excellent choice for beginners. To generate a preview, simply select your voice, language, and speed before uploading a script. The AI technology in the tool analyzes the script to identify areas that need to be changed.

Features:

* More than 170 distinct voices

Pricing

Clipchamp is available for a monthly fee of $6.0\. Clipchamp offers three different subscription plans:

The creator is available for $6.00 per month.

$13.00 per month for a business.

$27.00 per month for Business Platinum.

Clipchamp also offers a limited-featured Free Plan.

Cons:

The fee is relatively costly for anyone looking for a low budget service.

1. **Balabolka ( Supports Windows)**

Final Thoughts

As you can see, there are numerous free voiceover generators available online. Most software products come in both free and premium versions, which you can pick from depending on your needs. These programs will swiftly help you reach your text to audio transformation goals, whether you're a YouTube content maker in need of an informative voiceover or a disabled person looking for a user-friendly text-to-speech converter.

![filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/features/text-speech-img1.png)

Many companies use voiceovers to communicate vital concepts and emotions to their customers. Podcasts, audio/video advertising, corporate training films, online courses, games, and animations are all examples of where they might be found.

Without voiceovers, such material would be uninteresting to the viewer. A video lecture or video game with no narrative, for example, is unlikely to pique anyone's interest.

Good voiceovers, on the other hand, are not inexpensive to make.

Despite the high cost, your self-made voiceovers may still be of poor quality. Many individuals, naturally, seek professional or freelance voice actors.

Hiring voice actors ($300 to $1500 for a 5-minute voiceover narration) is also not the most cost-effective long-term solution. Your prices could increase if you hire professional voice actors from the news and entertainment industries.

There are resources available. Voice over generators is available online. Most software products come in both free and premium versions, which you can pick from depending on your needs. These programs will swiftly help you reach your text to audio transformation goals, whether you're a YouTube content maker in need of an informative voiceover or a disabled person looking for a user-friendly text-to-speech converter.

Yes! That's correct. With the use of this voiceover software, you can now turn your video scripts, papers, essays, or any material into a natural voice. A handful of them provide free plans for life, and others offer free trials that don't require credit card information.

Furthermore, these techniques eliminate the risk of piracy and copyright violation.

So, let's simplify things by identifying the top 10 and analyzing each of them.

1. **ai (Supports Web)**

For a personalized plan, contact a Resemble representative.

1. **ai ( Supports Web, Mobile**

![voice-generators-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/voice-generators-2.jpg)

Lovo.ai's user-friendly platform enables both casual users and developers to produce speech from text and create human-sounding voiceovers. Over 180 voice styles in 33 languages are available on the platform. The site is also regularly updated with new voices every day, giving consumers a wide range of options.

In just 15 minutes, the tool can generate personalized voices. On this platform, converting text to speech requires only three simple steps. Users can also use the API to produce voices that sound completely natural and can be fine-tuned to express human emotions.

Features

* Listening, conversion and sharing are all unlimited.
* A large voice library is available.
* Up to 15000 characters can be converted at once.
* Collection of unique voices. Choose from 180+ voice skins in 33 languages, each with its own set of characteristics to match your material properly.
* Genuine voices. Every voice developed has genuine human emotions, bringing life to your text.

Cons

* While the UI/UX is simple to use, it feels a little bland and dull."
* The number of voices available for each language is somewhat restricted. More voice samples are available."
* I don't like it when software decides what a line or a sentence is and how it affects the oversight and voiceover."

Pricing

Lovo.ai now offers two pricing options: (all pricing is for annual plans).

$34.99 per month for personal

$99.99 per month for Freelancer

The Personal plan gives access to all of the platform's features as well as 30 monthly voiceover downloads, which should be enough for most people.

Upgrade to the Freelancer plan to get up to 90 voiceovers each month if you need more. Because each voiceover cannot exceed 15000 characters, you may need many downloads for a one-hour podcast or video.

You will have to pay an additional $69.99 per month per voice for voice cloning. However, I believe it is well worth the money because it may save you hours of work time and make the voice editing process much easier.

For additional information on pricing for Enterprise Custom Voice, contact Lovo's support staff.

Synthesia stands apart from the rest of the software on this list. It's a video maker that also has an AI presenter.

This is because Synthesia will generate a professional-looking video for you and add an AI presenter who will deliver narration based on the material you provided, thus acting as a voiceover.

Features

* Avatars - Users can use this unique tool to add an AI presenter to their films. There are many pre-built avatars to pick from.

Synthesia API – beginning at $49 per month. Custom Avatar – $1000 one-time.

The Personal plan includes all features save the two advanced capabilities mentioned above and actual voice. As a result, you can make up to 10 minutes of video per month.

Assume you've exhausted your video credits. More credits can be purchased for $30 for ten credits. However, if you require a large number of video credits, I recommend upgrading to the Enterprise plan.

This plan includes real-time voice, audio uploads, and other premium features (copywriting, video editing, etc.)

Cons

* Only video producers can use it. If you're a podcaster, you'll be disappointed with the tool.
* Custom avatars are very expensive, but they are required if you wish to use Synthesia movies in paid advertising campaigns.

**4.Murf.ai ( Supports Web, Mobile)**

![voice-generators-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/voice-generators-4.jpg)

Murf.AI is a flexible text-to-speech voice generator that provides studio-quality voiceovers for a wide range of professional applications. The tool has a large voice library with over 115 distinct voices in 15 languages. Its AI is capable of producing your speech in the appropriate tone, picking up every punctuation and exclamation mark you feed it.

It also has a grammatical assistant, so you can create proofread scripts that will only improve your voiceover work. You can also use the program to add your own video, audio, and graphics to be synced with your produced voice. With its enterprise plan, the tool also has a powerful collaboration capability.

Pricing

* Murf now offers three paid pricing options: (all pricing is for yearly plans).
* Monthly Basic – $13
* \-$26 per month for Pro
* Enterprise – monthly fees start at $83

The Basic package includes full HD video quality and practically all capabilities (excluding voice editing). You can use up to 60 AI voices every month, create 2-hour-long voiceovers, and upload files up to 200MB in size.

For most users, I believe this plan is adequate. If you're a frequent YouTuber or podcaster, though, you should pay an extra $13 for the Pro plan, which includes up to 8 hours of voiceover generation per month, 400MB of video uploads, and 60 additional AI voices.

Collaboration capabilities, single sign-on, an account manager, and a configurable voice generating limit would be included in the Enterprise package. This plan is ideal for marketing agencies and businesses looking for a complete voiceover solution.

Cons

* Developers, according to several critics, should add more languages. Murf has many fewer AI voices in the library than his competitors.

* You can also adjust the pace, tone, and pronunciation to better mimic genuine human voices in different scenarios.
* Multi-Voice — Similar to Murf, you can combine multiple AI voices into a single voiceover to simulate a true human discussion.

* Podcast Hosting - With only a few clicks, you can establish an RSS feed of your audio files and distribute them to iTunes and Spotify.

* Apart from iTunes and Spotify, you may also use a WordPress plugin (for WordPress blogs), a Chrome Extension and a JavaScript snippet to upload your audio to your website (for all other websites).

* Sounds Analytics - Play. It will gather information on all audio. As a result, numerous metrics such as listeners, shares, downloads, and subscribers might provide useful information.

Pricing

Play. ht has four pricing tiers as of August 2021\. (all pricing below is for yearly plans).

$14.25 per month for personal use

$29.25 per month for professionals

$74.25 per month in Growth

$149.25 per month for business

Commercial rights, premium voice collecting, or podcast hosting are not included in the Personal plan, which severely limits the practical use of the voices. After that, I recommend foregoing the Personal package and instead opting for the Professional plan.

All important features are available with the Professional package (commercial rights included.) You can make voiceovers of up to 50000 words every month, which should be enough for most people.

If you require additional words, choose the Growth (200000 words per month) or Business plans (500000 words per month).

Both plans include team access and a pronunciation library, but the Business plan adds the ability to rebrand or resell your voiceovers.

Cons

* Other than English and European languages, voices made in other languages are not flawless.

Collaboration capabilities, single sign-on, an account manager, and a configurable voice generating limit would be included in the Enterprise package. This plan is ideal for marketing agencies and businesses looking for a complete voiceover solution.

Cons

* Developers, according to several critics, should add more languages. Murf has many fewer AI voices in the library than his competitors.

**5.Play.ht**

![voice-generators-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/voice-generators-5.jpg)

Play. Ht is a web-based voice generator that allows you to generate high-quality text-to-speech. Because of its basic user interface, the platform is exceptionally simple to use. It has a text box on the home page where you may input your text, choose the language, gender, and voice style, and choose the conversion speed.

Features

* Customization — To fully customize the voiceover, highlight the words. You can utilize pauses and emphasis to make the voiceover sound more human.

* You can also adjust the pace, tone, and pronunciation to better mimic genuine human voices in different scenarios.
* Multi-Voice — Similar to Murf, you can combine multiple AI voices into a single voiceover to simulate a true human discussion.

* Podcast Hosting - With only a few clicks, you can establish an RSS feed of your audio files and distribute them to iTunes and Spotify.

* Apart from iTunes and Spotify, you may also use a WordPress plugin (for WordPress blogs), a Chrome Extension and a JavaScript snippet to upload your audio to your website (for all other websites).

* Sounds Analytics - Play. It will gather information on all audio. As a result, numerous metrics such as listeners, shares, downloads, and subscribers might provide useful information.

Pricing

Play. ht has four pricing tiers as of August 2021\. (all pricing below is for yearly plans).

$14.25 per month for personal use

$29.25 per month for professionals

$74.25 per month in Growth

$149.25 per month for business

Commercial rights, premium voice collecting, or podcast hosting are not included in the Personal plan, which severely limits the practical use of the voices. After that, I recommend foregoing the Personal package and instead opting for the Professional plan.

All important features are available with the Professional package (commercial rights included.) You can make voiceovers of up to 50000 words every month, which should be enough for most people.

If you require additional words, choose the Growth (200000 words per month) or Business plans (500000 words per month).

Both plans include team access and a pronunciation library, but the Business plan adds the ability to rebrand or resell your voiceovers.

Cons

* Other than English and European languages, voices made in other languages are not flawless.
* There isn't a built-in video editor for adding voiceovers to videos.

Final Thoughts

These programs will swiftly help you reach your text to audio transformation goals, whether you're a YouTube content maker in need of an informative voiceover or a disabled person looking for a user-friendly text-to-speech converter.

![filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/features/text-speech-img1.png)

Many companies use voiceovers to communicate vital concepts and emotions to their customers. Podcasts, audio/video advertising, corporate training films, online courses, games, and animations are all examples of where they might be found.

Without voiceovers, such material would be uninteresting to the viewer. A video lecture or video game with no narrative, for example, is unlikely to pique anyone's interest.

Good voiceovers, on the other hand, are not inexpensive to make.

Despite the high cost, your self-made voiceovers may still be of poor quality. Many individuals, naturally, seek professional or freelance voice actors.

Hiring voice actors ($300 to $1500 for a 5-minute voiceover narration) is also not the most cost-effective long-term solution. Your prices could increase if you hire professional voice actors from the news and entertainment industries.

There are resources available. Voice over generators is available online. Most software products come in both free and premium versions, which you can pick from depending on your needs. These programs will swiftly help you reach your text to audio transformation goals, whether you're a YouTube content maker in need of an informative voiceover or a disabled person looking for a user-friendly text-to-speech converter.

Yes! That's correct. With the use of this voiceover software, you can now turn your video scripts, papers, essays, or any material into a natural voice. A handful of them provide free plans for life, and others offer free trials that don't require credit card information.

Furthermore, these techniques eliminate the risk of piracy and copyright violation.

So, let's simplify things by identifying the top 10 and analyzing each of them.

Over 180 voice styles in 33 languages are available on the platform. The site is also regularly updated with new voices every day, giving consumers a wide range of options.

Cons

* While the UI/UX is simple to use, it feels a little bland and dull."
* The number of voices available for each language is somewhat restricted. More voice samples are available."
* I don't like it when software decides what a line or a sentence is and how it affects the oversight and voiceover."

Pricing

Lovo.ai now offers two pricing options: (all pricing is for annual plans).

$34.99 per month for personal

$99.99 per month for Freelancer

The Personal plan gives access to all of the platform's features as well as 30 monthly voiceover downloads, which should be enough for most people.

Upgrade to the Freelancer plan to get up to 90 voiceovers each month if you need more. Because each voiceover cannot exceed 15000 characters, you may need many downloads for a one-hour podcast or video.

You will have to pay an additional $69.99 per month per voice for voice cloning. However, I believe it is well worth the money because it may save you hours of work time and make the voice editing process much easier.

**_Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid iPhone Video speeding Softwares?_**

It usually depends on your needs. If you just want a speed editor to make slow-mo or timelapse videos for your social media then you should go for free video editors, as they are easy to use and provide better speed ramping features than some paid video editors mentioned here.

But as a content creator if you want more features alongside speed ramping then you should go for paid softwares mentioned above. As mobile video editors are quite affordable and some of them have features like that of some PC softwares.

**FAQs about Speed ramping feature and softwares:**

1. **Q) What is Speed Ramping and where it is used?**

Speed Ramping is different from just changing the speed of the whole clip. It means changing the speed of the video gradually, so the clip doesn't feel jumpy.

It is done to give viewers a smooth experience between different parts of the clip. like the fast-forward clip is used to show the passage of time. and the slow-mo is used to emphasize something or produce tension, while a mix of both is used in ads and action scenes, e.t.c.

1. **Q) How to do Speed Ramping?**

Speed Ramping methods vary from software to software. Either you can do it by adding keyframes and changing speed with time or you can add or adjust curves for speed change. If your software doesn't support the speed ramping feature, you can split a clip into parts and apply speed change to them differently. For some of the best iPhone softwares, we have mentioned the speed ramping steps above.

1. **Q) What FPS is best for Slo-mo videos?**

Shooting at 60 Fps is ideal as it gives a smooth and crisp video and you can make slow motion easily if required, you can slow it down up to 40% of its speed while maintaining the quality. It is supported in almost most devices nowadays. And if you want to create super slo-mo for your cinematics or product video then 120 or 240 fps is preferable. But higher fps often have disadvantages as it is harder to apply visual effects or masks. So choose the frame rate according to your requirements.

1. **Q) Does changing the speed of video affect its audio?**

Yes, changing the speed of video affects the audio, It affects its pitch (tempo). Increasing its speed increases the pitch of the audio making it sound shrill while decreasing the speed of the video or making slow-mo decreases the pitch making it sound deep.

Although, some softwares provide the feature to maintain the pitch while changing the speed of the clip.

**\~Cons:**

* Its UI doesn't support editing in landscape orientation.

**_Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid iPhone Video speeding Softwares?_**

It usually depends on your needs. If you just want a speed editor to make slow-mo or timelapse videos for your social media then you should go for free video editors, as they are easy to use and provide better speed ramping features than some paid video editors mentioned here.

But as a content creator if you want more features alongside speed ramping then you should go for paid softwares mentioned above. As mobile video editors are quite affordable and some of them have features like that of some PC softwares.

**FAQs about Speed ramping feature and softwares:**

1. **Q) What is Speed Ramping and where it is used?**

Speed Ramping is different from just changing the speed of the whole clip. It means changing the speed of the video gradually, so the clip doesn't feel jumpy.

It is done to give viewers a smooth experience between different parts of the clip. like the fast-forward clip is used to show the passage of time. and the slow-mo is used to emphasize something or produce tension, while a mix of both is used in ads and action scenes, e.t.c.

1. **Q) How to do Speed Ramping?**

Speed Ramping methods vary from software to software. Either you can do it by adding keyframes and changing speed with time or you can add or adjust curves for speed change. If your software doesn't support the speed ramping feature, you can split a clip into parts and apply speed change to them differently. For some of the best iPhone softwares, we have mentioned the speed ramping steps above.

1. **Q) What FPS is best for Slo-mo videos?**

Shooting at 60 Fps is ideal as it gives a smooth and crisp video and you can make slow motion easily if required, you can slow it down up to 40% of its speed while maintaining the quality. It is supported in almost most devices nowadays. And if you want to create super slo-mo for your cinematics or product video then 120 or 240 fps is preferable. But higher fps often have disadvantages as it is harder to apply visual effects or masks. So choose the frame rate according to your requirements.

1. **Q) Does changing the speed of video affect its audio?**

Yes, changing the speed of video affects the audio, It affects its pitch (tempo). Increasing its speed increases the pitch of the audio making it sound shrill while decreasing the speed of the video or making slow-mo decreases the pitch making it sound deep.

Although, some softwares provide the feature to maintain the pitch while changing the speed of the clip.

**\~Cons:**

* Its UI doesn't support editing in landscape orientation.

**_Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid iPhone Video speeding Softwares?_**

It usually depends on your needs. If you just want a speed editor to make slow-mo or timelapse videos for your social media then you should go for free video editors, as they are easy to use and provide better speed ramping features than some paid video editors mentioned here.

**FAQs about Speed ramping feature and softwares:**

1. **Q) What is Speed Ramping and where it is used?**

Speed Ramping is different from just changing the speed of the whole clip. It means changing the speed of the video gradually, so the clip doesn't feel jumpy.

It is done to give viewers a smooth experience between different parts of the clip. like the fast-forward clip is used to show the passage of time. and the slow-mo is used to emphasize something or produce tension, while a mix of both is used in ads and action scenes, e.t.c.

1. **Q) How to do Speed Ramping?**

Speed Ramping methods vary from software to software. Either you can do it by adding keyframes and changing speed with time or you can add or adjust curves for speed change.

For some of the best iPhone softwares, we have mentioned the speed ramping steps above.

1. **Q) What FPS is best for Slo-mo videos?**

Shooting at 60 Fps is ideal as it gives a smooth and crisp video and you can make slow motion easily if required, you can slow it down up to 40% of its speed while maintaining the quality. It is supported in almost most devices nowadays. And if you want to create super slo-mo for your cinematics or product video then 120 or 240 fps is preferable. But higher fps often have disadvantages as it is harder to apply visual effects or masks. So choose the frame rate according to your requirements.

1. **Q) Does changing the speed of video affect its audio?**

Yes, changing the speed of video affects the audio, It affects its pitch (tempo). Increasing its speed increases the pitch of the audio making it sound shrill while decreasing the speed of the video or making slow-mo decreases the pitch making it sound deep.

1. **Q) What FPS is best for Slo-mo videos?**

Shooting at 60 Fps is ideal as it gives a smooth and crisp video and you can make slow motion easily if required, you can slow it down up to 40% of its speed while maintaining the quality. It is supported in almost most devices nowadays. And if you want to create super slo-mo for your cinematics or product video then 120 or 240 fps is preferable. But higher fps often have disadvantages as it is harder to apply visual effects or masks. So choose the frame rate according to your requirements.
