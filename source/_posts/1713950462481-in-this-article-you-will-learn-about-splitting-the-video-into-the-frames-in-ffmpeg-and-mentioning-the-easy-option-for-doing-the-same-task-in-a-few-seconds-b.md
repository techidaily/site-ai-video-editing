## How to Make Video Slow Motion? [Complete Guide]

Slow-motion videos are in trend now, especially when shooting for [Instagram Reels](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), TikTok videos, or [YouTube Shorts](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). While many users record the entire video in slow motion, there are others who need only a particular section of a clip to play at a reduced speed. Nevertheless, slowing down footage is no longer rocket science, thanks to the advancements in technology, and the availability and ease of access to relevant apps.

That said, here you will learn what is needed to record a video in slow motion, and how to get the job done in a simple way. In addition, you will also learn how to reduce the playback speed of an already existing video if it was recorded at a normal pace.

#### In this article

01 [How to Make Slow Motion Videos via Recording?](#part1)

02 [How to Apply the Smooth Slow-Motion Effect in Post-Production?](#part2)

03 [When to Use Slow Motion?](#part3)

## Part 1: How to Make Slow Motion Videos via Recording?

The fact is, the playback speed of a video is inversely proportional to the [frames per second](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) (FPS) it has been recorded in. Usually, to have a video play at normal speed, it is recorded at 24 FPS or 30 FPS. On the other hand, if you increase the frame rate (FPS) to 120 or 240, the playback speed slows down. You can easily check this if you have access to a DSLR camera or an iPhone. These devices allow you to adjust the FPS so the videos can be recorded in slow motion.

For your convenience and learning, the step-by-step procedure on how to record a video in slow motion using an iPhone is explained below:

**Step 1: Get to the SLO-MO Mode**

Launch the **Camera** app on your iPhone (iPhone 13 Pro Max is used here for illustrations), and swipe the screen to the left to get to the **SLO-MO** mode.

![iphone slow motion capture mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-slow-motion-capture-mode.jpg)

**Step 2: Adjust Recording Preferences**

Tap the number at the top-right corner to switch between **120** FPS and **240** FPS as needed. Tap **1x** from the lower-middle section of the screen, and use the rotator to adjust your preferred zoom level.

![adjust slow motion zoom level iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-slow-motion-zoom-level-iphone.jpg)

**Step 3: Start and Stop Recording**

Tap the **Record** button from the bottom-center of the screen to begin recording the video in slow motion. Tap **Stop** when you are done. You can access the recorded video from the **Videos** container of the **Photos** app in your iPhone.

## Part 2: How to Apply the Smooth Slow-Motion Effect in Post-Production?

If you don’t have access to a camera that can record videos in slow motion, or in case you want to capture the footage at normal playback speed and then slow it down later, you need a dedicated tool to get the job done. Even though several post-production applications are available in the market, the one that is most versatile, has an intuitive interface, and is quite easy to use is [Filmora video editor from Wondershare](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

## Part 3: When to Use Slow Motion?

There could be many instances when you want to add a slow-motion effect to your videos. Some of the most common ones include:

* **Add Focus**

If there is a particular scene in a clip that you want the audience to focus on, it would be a good idea to add the slow-motion effect right before that action appears on the screen, and bring the speed back to normal when the section is over.

* **Skill or Style Demonstration**

When a clip is playing at a normal speed, many times, the audience isn’t able to see the skills that you want to display. This is where you may want to add the slow-motion effect so that every detail can be noticed clearly and in detail.

* **Replays**

Mostly used for tournaments and matches where the actual action is to replayed so the audience, umpires, and other viewers can see the movements in detail before making the right decision.

* **Observation**

Some natural phenomena such as a deer running in the woods, a balloon full of water bursting, etc. occur quite quickly. If you want to witness such things clearly and in detail, it would be good to record them, and then reduce the playback speed for better viewing.

* **Add Suspense**

When you add the slow-motion effect to a scene, the impulse of the audience is automatically increased, and they take that particular section more seriously and with a thrill.

**Conclusion**

The slow-motion effect is inversely proportional to the framerate, i.e., frames per second or FPS. Almost all DSLR cameras that are available nowadays allow you to switch between different FPS values (typically 120 and 240) before recording. Also, if you have access to an iPhone, its Camera app has a built-in SLO-MO mode that can capture the footage in slow motion.

In addition, if you already have a video that has been recorded at a normal speed, you can use an efficient post-production software like Wondershare Filmora 11, and exploit its Speed Ramping feature to add the slow-motion effect at different scenes of a clip.

## Part 1: How to Make Slow Motion Videos via Recording?

The fact is, the playback speed of a video is inversely proportional to the [frames per second](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) (FPS) it has been recorded in. Usually, to have a video play at normal speed, it is recorded at 24 FPS or 30 FPS. On the other hand, if you increase the frame rate (FPS) to 120 or 240, the playback speed slows down. You can easily check this if you have access to a DSLR camera or an iPhone. These devices allow you to adjust the FPS so the videos can be recorded in slow motion.

For your convenience and learning, the step-by-step procedure on how to record a video in slow motion using an iPhone is explained below:

**Step 1: Get to the SLO-MO Mode**

Launch the **Camera** app on your iPhone (iPhone 13 Pro Max is used here for illustrations), and swipe the screen to the left to get to the **SLO-MO** mode.

There could be many instances when you want to add a slow-motion effect to your videos. Some of the most common ones include:

* **Add Focus**

If there is a particular scene in a clip that you want the audience to focus on, it would be a good idea to add the slow-motion effect right before that action appears on the screen, and bring the speed back to normal when the section is over.

* **Skill or Style Demonstration**

When a clip is playing at a normal speed, many times, the audience isn’t able to see the skills that you want to display. This is where you may want to add the slow-motion effect so that every detail can be noticed clearly and in detail.

* **Replays**

Mostly used for tournaments and matches where the actual action is to replayed so the audience, umpires, and other viewers can see the movements in detail before making the right decision.

* **Observation**

Some natural phenomena such as a deer running in the woods, a balloon full of water bursting, etc. occur quite quickly. If you want to witness such things clearly and in detail, it would be good to record them, and then reduce the playback speed for better viewing.

* **Add Suspense**

When you add the slow-motion effect to a scene, the impulse of the audience is automatically increased, and they take that particular section more seriously and with a thrill.

**Conclusion**

The slow-motion effect is inversely proportional to the framerate, i.e., frames per second or FPS.

## 3 In-Camera Transitions Tricks To Make Videos

You must have seen it in videos when a scene changes to another place or time. How is it possible? Video transitions are a post-production technique that connects two different shots together. And it makes the whole video goes smooth and fluent.

Hopping directly from one clip to the next looks pretty queer. It disturbs the whole dynamics and charm of the video. To avoid this, we use video transitions. This makes the video appear much smoother and more linked.

You may think it is not easy, but after reading this article, you will know how simple it is. All you need is a camera and a few skills. In this article, we will focus on different in-camera transitions and let you know how to edit in a powerful video editor [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

## Whip Your Camera

You may have noticed that when an object moves quickly, the camera creates a blurred image of the object. We call it motion blur. The idea with this transition is to cut and paste your shots together by whipping your camera at the end of your first shot and at the beginning of your second one. This effect depends on two aspects. The first is by the speedy motion of the object out of the frame, and the second is by the camera's movement.

**Here is a stepwise guide for you to try**

1. Plan your shots, where and in what direction you will make the whip.
2. Then take the first shot and whip the camera at the end of the shot in the direction the object is moving.
3. For the next shot, whip the camera into the action and complete the shot.
4. Import both shots in your editing tool and find the point of blur in both.
5. Cut and paste them to add a blurring effect to your video.

You can whip your camera in any direction you want. Make sure the movement is fast enough to create a motion blur.

The result would be a smooth transition from the first shot to the second, as in this clip:

## Fill The Frame

In this in-camera transition technique, you must fill the frame with an object or subject. Compose the shot with the main subject filling the frame from edge to edge. In this way, those who view the video immediately know what you want them to see.

Here is step-by-step guidance for this transition

1. Plan the two shots you are going to take.
2. Find a subject or an action that will fill the frame during recording.
3. In the first shot, please make the subject move toward the frame so that it fills the frame.
4. The second shot will take place at another time or place.
5. To record the second shot, cover the frame with an object and then reveal the shot.
6. Import both shots into [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).
7. Cut the two shots to the point where the frame is filled and paste these shots together.

## Match Cut

In a video, a match cut transitions from one shot to another. During this, the composition of the two shots is matched by action, subject, and subject matter. The goal is to make a visual match between two situations that don't have a direct link. Here are the steps to creating a match-cut transition in your videos.

1. Plan the shot you are going to take.
2. Record the action in the first shot, for example, clapping your hands.
3. Go to another place or scene to record the second shot.
4. Repeat the same action in the second shot.
5. Import both camera shots to [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).
6. Cut one shot to another when the action is at its peak.

This way, you can smoothly transition from one place or scene to another. There is a video attached below for a better understanding of the steps.
