## After Reading This Article, You Can Add a B-Roll Feature From Filmora and Captivate More Audience. Explanation Video B-Roll and Story-Telling B-Roll Are Well Illustrated

Everyone is bored after watching a simple recorded video in which a character explains or tells a story. No one will watch it for more than 4 minutes!

After looking through this article, you will make your video more fascinating and get more views instantly. It's all just due to B-roll, which will act as a ninja feature in your video. In this regard, [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) will handle everything.

Scroll more to discover two different types of B-roll videos and get an idea of how to make fascinating B-roll videos.

## Part 1\. What Is a B-roll?

B-roll is alternative or supplementary video footage that editors can use to intercut in between their main video. In that way, B-roll can add more information to a scene.

### An additional footage

It is added as a supplementary video to interact with viewers more closely. This feature helps to give more details of a scene.

### Visual representation

When the main explanatory video is too boring, you can add a b-roll to represent the movie's story visually. It can also add to spice up and beat the energy of the narrative.

### Without sound

The B-roll shots are mostly without audio or with little background sound. In most cases, the sound of the primary video is continued while the B-roll footage is just shown.

### Act as a filler

The criteria for the B-roll is to provide the situation of the storyline. Additionally, it could be utilized as filler in between scenes in a movie or television program. B-roll may be found almost anywhere!

In this article, you will learn about two main kinds of B-rolls and the steps to edit them on [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Stick with us to the end!

## Part 2\. Two Types of B-rolls: Explanation Video B-rolls

When recording any explanatory video, the audience may leave it in the middle of a video if a character explains without any visual representation. When explaining something new, showing the object in B-roll can be more effective than just verbally explaining what the audience is seeing.

Let's take the video we made about microphones as an example. Instead of just verbally introduce the various mics, we inserted B-roll footage to display what they look like and how they can be used. The combination of the visual footage and the background voiceover presents the mic in a more vivid way. Also, it keeps the audience's attention.

![explanation b roll of microphone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/explanation-b-roll-of-microphone.gif)

**Goal of the explanation B-roll video**

The main goal of this type of B-roll is to show your audience what you are talking about instead of just telling them in a dull way.

## Part 3\. How to Edit Explanation B-roll Footage on Filmora?

After getting the footage and recording shots for B-roll videos, you need to edit it on the Wondershare Filmora. For this, follow the below-mentioned steps:

##### Step1Download the Wondershare Filmora

There is no need to do any complex process for editing on any platform. Because we have one platform on which every tool is available.

* First of all, you have to download the [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).
* Then get access to the entire features.

The premium version has new features and effects plugins that make editing more filmy and fun!

##### Step2Stock media in Filmora

After downloading, it's time to edit the B-roll video. If you can't film your own B-roll, you can use stock footage but make sure you have the license to use them.

Filmora has a unique **"stock media"** option that enables us to use all these elements and more to boost our videos! To add stock media, follow the below steps:

* Open the app or window of Filmora, which you have installed.
* Head towards the tab on the top right side.
* Then click on the **Stock Media** option and open it.
* A long list of stock videos and images will pop up.

![stock media of filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/stock-media-of-filmora.jpg)

* Select whatever you want, and download it.
* Then **drag** and **drop** it in the timeline and insert it between your video.

![note](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Only premium customers will get access to the stock media of the Wondershare Filmora.

##### Step3Add B-roll in between the main video

The most difficult and frequent asking situation is how you know when to cut to B-roll. To get to know when to insert B-roll, follow the following steps:

* Watch your edits back and check out where you need.
* Sense about the dull and complex points and cut the main video from there.
* The points can be easily fixed with visual aids.

![complex and dull points in the primary video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/complex-and-dull-points-in-the-primary-video.jpg)

## Part 4\. Two Types of B-rolls: Storytelling Video B-rolls

During the creation of short films or any storytelling videos, if a person sits and speaks without showing any character or anything else, it will turn boring. Due to this, you have more chances to lose your audience and viewers.

In visual storytelling, if you will insert more clips with close shots, it will make the environment cool. The crazy thing is that you can make mimic shots easily at home by utilizing household objects. Let's check out one of the examples.

### Example 1\. Film B-roll footage with food

So let's add some b-roll to give it more context even if you have a master shot of yourself looking off frame alone.

##### Step1Write a script

Before making any video, the first step is to write a script for the whole video. If you will have more than two characters, then make dialogues for everyone and practice it again and again to give a fascinating look.

Then speak to your audience, make sure that what you are speaking is vivid and make everything simple and crystal clear.

##### Step2Shot a primary video

First of all, make a primary video according to your script by implementing a camera at one side, or you can also change the angle of the camera lens during shooting to have a look from all sides.

![primary footage of a video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/primary-footage-of-a-video.gif)

As you can see that it's kind of boring for the audience, but we will make it more unique by implementing closer shots. For this, follow the last step:

##### Step3Make B-roll shots

Make closer shots of things which the character have to select and pick up. Check out two B-roll shots for the main video:

* First, make a closer shot of the object (Snacks) that the character is noticing prior.

![b roll footage number 1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/b-roll-footage-number-1.jpg)

* Second, create more intimate footage of the second object (Banana) which the character will select and grab.

![b roll footage number 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/b-roll-footage-number-2.jpg)

##### Step4Edit both B-roll footages in Main Video

Now, in the last, insert the B-roll footage in between the primary video from the Filmora and get your results. Enjoy it with your viewers!

![final video after adding b roll footage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/final-video-after-adding-b-roll-footage.gif)

Now experiment at home with more daily life activities and create all on Filmora. Check out one more example to create B-roll footage!

### Example 2\. Make B-roll shots with a cardboard

Try using readily accessible cardboard to create light effects in different shapes and give the film a fantastical place. These methods frequently produce artistic videos that transmit unique moods to viewers.

Only experienced photographers and videographers understand how to use these fundamental tricks to gain viewers into the photos.

The intriguing thing is that if the light is more shaped, it will more accurately reflect the image's background, setting, and context. Try it out!

##### Step1Cut the cardboard

You may shape the cardboard any way you desire. We'll experiment with this by cutting cardboard into the shape of window shades.

![make shapes of the cardboard](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/make-shapes-of-the-cardboard.jpg)

##### Step2Make B-roll footage

## Part 2\. Two Types of B-rolls: Explanation Video B-rolls

When recording any explanatory video, the audience may leave it in the middle of a video if a character explains without any visual representation. When explaining something new, showing the object in B-roll can be more effective than just verbally explaining what the audience is seeing.

Let's take the video we made about microphones as an example. Instead of just verbally introduce the various mics, we inserted B-roll footage to display what they look like and how they can be used. The combination of the visual footage and the background voiceover presents the mic in a more vivid way. Also, it keeps the audience's attention.

![explanation b roll of microphone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/explanation-b-roll-of-microphone.gif)

**Goal of the explanation B-roll video**

The main goal of this type of B-roll is to show your audience what you are talking about instead of just telling them in a dull way.

## Part 3\. How to Edit Explanation B-roll Footage on Filmora?

After getting the footage and recording shots for B-roll videos, you need to edit it on the Wondershare Filmora. For this, follow the below-mentioned steps:

* The points can be easily fixed with visual aids.

![complex and dull points in the primary video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/complex-and-dull-points-in-the-primary-video.jpg)

## Part 4\. Two Types of B-rolls: Storytelling Video B-rolls

During the creation of short films or any storytelling videos, if a person sits and speaks without showing any character or anything else, it will turn boring. Due to this, you have more chances to lose your audience and viewers.

In visual storytelling, if you will insert more clips with close shots, it will make the environment cool. The crazy thing is that you can make mimic shots easily at home by utilizing household objects. Let's check out one of the examples.

### Example 1\. Film B-roll footage with food

So let's add some b-roll to give it more context even if you have a master shot of yourself looking off frame alone.

##### Step1Write a script

Before making any video, the first step is to write a script for the whole video. If you will have more than two characters, then make dialogues for everyone and practice it again and again to give a fascinating look.

Then speak to your audience, make sure that what you are speaking is vivid and make everything simple and crystal clear.

##### Step2Shot a primary video

First of all, make a primary video according to your script by implementing a camera at one side, or you can also change the angle of the camera lens during shooting to have a look from all sides.

![primary footage of a video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/primary-footage-of-a-video.gif)

As you can see that it's kind of boring for the audience, but we will make it more unique by implementing closer shots. For this, follow the last step:

##### Step3Make B-roll shots

Make closer shots of things which the character have to select and pick up. Check out two B-roll shots for the main video:

* First, make a closer shot of the object (Snacks) that the character is noticing prior.

![b roll footage number 1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/b-roll-footage-number-1.jpg)

* Second, create more intimate footage of the second object (Banana) which the character will select and grab.

![b roll footage number 2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/b-roll-footage-number-2.jpg)

##### Step4Edit both B-roll footages in Main Video

Now, in the last, insert the B-roll footage in between the primary video from the Filmora and get your results. Enjoy it with your viewers!

![final video after adding b roll footage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/final-video-after-adding-b-roll-footage.gif)

Now experiment at home with more daily life activities and create all on Filmora. Check out one more example to create B-roll footage!

### Example 2\. Make B-roll shots with a cardboard

Try using readily accessible cardboard to create light effects in different shapes and give the film a fantastical place. These methods frequently produce artistic videos that transmit unique moods to viewers.

Only experienced photographers and videographers understand how to use these fundamental tricks to gain viewers into the photos.

The intriguing thing is that if the light is more shaped, it will more accurately reflect the image's background, setting, and context. Try it out!

##### Step1Cut the cardboard

You may shape the cardboard any way you desire. We'll experiment with this by cutting cardboard into the shape of window shades.

![make shapes of the cardboard](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/make-shapes-of-the-cardboard.jpg)

##### Step2Make B-roll footage

![final result of b roll footage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/final-result-of-b-roll-footage.jpg)

## Part 1\. How to Add Text Animation in After Effects

You may roughly follow the instructions in this article and produce a similar effect with After Effects if you are familiar with that application and prefer it for graphics and animations. Using Adobe AE, let's demonstrate how to make a text animation effect.

### 1\. After Effects' Fly-in Text Animation

Fortunately, creating this type of effect inside of Adobe AE is really fairly simple and doesn't need downloading and installing any other templates. For those who are knowledgeable with AE and want to create the effect, that is a significant bonus.

**Steps to Add Fly-in Text Animation in AE:**

Step1 The first step is adding your Title Layer to a Comp that has a colorful backdrop and create a route for the text to follow using the Pen tool.

![title layer styles premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/title-layer-styles-premiere.jpg)

Step2 In the next step, rotate the Text menu, Path Options, and Layer down. Using the Pen Tool, change the path to the mask you just created. To advance a few frames, use your keyboard's directional keys.

![select pen tool premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/select-pen-tool-premiere.jpg)

Step3 Afterwards, set a Keyframe for First Margin at frame 0; reduce the value to whatever is appropriate for your Path and change the First Margin value to 0 at frame 30 to center the text on the path's length.

![key frmae margin premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/key-frmae-margin-premiere.jpg)

Step4 Lastly, give this keyframe an Easy Ease to setup the Fly-in text animation.

### 2\. After Effects Typewriter Animation

A great pre-set for animators wishing to produce effects of text on paper is Typewriter Text Presets. The Bevel settings, which let you create the essential indentation effect, are more stunning than the pre-speed set's control. A fun and simple method to show titles in your films is using typewriter effects. While the classic typewriter effect could seem a bit antiquated, combining it with additional text effects will result in something fresh and interesting.

**Steps to Add Typewriter Animation in After Effects:**

Step1 In the Media Viewer, choose the Text tool and enter your title. Then, use the Character panel to change the font, color, and size.

![composition settings premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/composition-settings-premiere.jpg)

Step2 Look for the Typewriter effect in the Effects panel. To see text choices, click the little triangle.

![typewriter effects premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/typewriter-effects-premiere.jpg)

Step3 Select "Opacity" under "Animate" from the menu and advance your timeline a bit and alter the number from "Start" to 100%. Change the keyframes' positions to alter the animation's length.

![change opacity premiere](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/change-opacity-premiere.jpg)

### 3\. Wiggle Text Animation in After Effects

By using the many effects tools of Adobe After Effects, we may edit any image inside of After Effects. One of them is Wiggle, which you can think of as an effect that aids in introducing vibration to the motion of any object to create motion graphics for a variety of objectives in a specific project.

**Steps to Add Wiggle Text Animation in AE:**

Step1 Go to the menu bar at the top of the working screen, choose Composition from the menu, then modify the composition's parameters to your specifications before clicking the dialog box's Ok button.
