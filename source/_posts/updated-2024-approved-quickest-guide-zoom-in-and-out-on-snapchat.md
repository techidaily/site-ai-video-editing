## Part 2: Some Quick Alternatives to Efectum App for Slowing Down Videos

Efectum is undoubtedly a good platform to change video speed with other editing options. Some users might find it boring and get annoyed due to the watermark it locates in videos. They want an alternative to the **Efectum app download without a watermark**. Thus, in this section, we have enlisted the current best replacements for Efectum that are worth trying.

* [FXMotion Slow Fast Video Maker](#alternative1)
* [CapCut - Video Editor](#alternative2)
* [InVideo](#alternative3)
* [VN-Video Editor & Maker](#alternative4)
* [InShot Video Editor & Maker](#alternative5)

### 1\. FXMotion Slow Fast Video Maker ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/tr/app/fxmotion-slow-fast-video-maker/id1559517301))

If you are unsatisfied with the **Efectum app** for limited speed adjustments, try this app. It is designed to change video speed in your own way with the speed graph. You can create a slow-motion video of up to 0.1x speed and a fast motion of up to 10x speed. With high-quality resolution output, it serves quick response. This application lets you share the edited video with friends on social media.

![fxmotion slow fast video maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/reviewing-efectum-app-and-alternatives-5.jpg)

 Pros

* Allow choosing output quality from 480p and 1080p resolution options.
* Provides a music library to add thrill or sensation to slow-down videos.

 Cons

* Restrict you just to change speed and does not offer any feature for video editing.

### 2\. CapCut - Video Editor ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/capcut-video-editor/id1500855883)/[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lemon.lvoverseas&hl=en&gl=US))

It’s a popular video editor with advanced editing and pre-designed video templates. This platform offers built-in fonts, effects, and stickers to add creativity to your content. Furthermore, CapCut provides you with Chroma key, stabilization, and Keyframe animation options. Besides these advanced features, you can alter video speed from 0.1x to 10x. Also, it lets you add a speed curve for a smooth, slow motion.

![capcut video editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/reviewing-efectum-app-and-alternatives-6.jpg)

 Pros

* Add auto-caption and lyrics in videos with speech recognition ability.
* Extract audio clips or add sound effects from a rich music library.

 Cons

* It does not offer exporting in frame rate higher than 60fps.

### 3\. InVideo ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.filmrapp.videoeditor&hl=en&gl=US))

Instead of an **Efectum app download,** discover possibilities with InVideo. This app is an expert in creating aesthetic stop motions, ads, reels, and tutorials. It can speed up and speed down your clips. In addition, you can make a boomerang of shots and add cinematic transitions in clips. From its extensive music library, users can add music or import voiceovers.

![invideo video slow motion app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/reviewing-efectum-app-and-alternatives-7.jpg)

 Pros

* Utilize over 150 stickers, filters, and text templates to level up your projects.
* Record new footage with a built-in 60fps frame rate and 4k resolution.

 Cons

### 4\. VN-Video Editor & Maker ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/is/app/vn-video-editor/id1343581380)/[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.frontrow.vlog&hl=en&gl=US))

If searching for an alternative like the **Efectum app, download without the watermark**; use this app. It satisfies the needs of professionals and amateur video editors with high-quality videos. VN’s speed curve is more like Adobe Premiere Pro’s speed ramping. Thus, you can adjust the playback of your video with 6-speed adjustment curves.

![vn video editor and maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/reviewing-efectum-app-and-alternatives-8.jpg)

 Pros

Another good option in place of the **Efectum app** that you can consider is InShot. This platform offers some AI features such as auto-caption, smart tracking, and AI effects. InShot enables you to make smooth slow-mo with a speed ramping feature and keyframe editing. Plus, you can create multi-layered videos with filters, transitions, and AI effects.

![video editor and maker inshot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/reviewing-efectum-app-and-alternatives-9.jpg)

 Pros

* Make photo collages with AI effects and blend screenshots with AI context recognition.
* Export videos in 4K resolution to YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, and WhatsApp.

 Cons
