## Part 2: Possible Causes of SRT Subtitles Not Working Properly in VLC

While users can **add subtitles to VLC** since the player supports SRT extension files, some issues can cause them not to appear. Here are some potential causes of the error.

**SRT files corrupted or empty**

In case the SRT file you are trying to access is corrupted or does not contain any content, that will not open in the VLC media player.

**The subtitles setting in VLC Media Player is not turned on**

Sometimes, the SRT files are password protected or only work on video players that allow permission for it to play. So, if you have not enabled SRT access in the settings of the app, the SRT-formatted text will not appear.

**Doesn’t update VLC to the latest version**

In cases when the VLC Media Player itself is corrupted or outdated, it cannot allow access to some subtitle formats. You must upgrade it to the latest official version to allow video and SRT file support.

**Wrong encoding instead of UTF-8**

VLC player app only allows the SRT files that have UTF-8 encoding to play on the platform. Users can view the SRT files on videos if they are using the right encoded text, so make sure that you do not have the wrong encoded file.

**Other unknown bugs**

Other issues can cause the defect to the VLC player and, therefore, cannot open the **VLC SRT file.** These include certain unknown bugs and malware- make sure to check your system to find the errors.
