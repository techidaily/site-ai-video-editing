<h2 id="Easy-Way-to-Add-Effects-to-Art-Video"><a href="#Easy-Way-to-Add-Effects-to-Art-Video" class="headerlink" title="Easy Way to Add Effects to Art Video"></a>Easy Way to Add Effects to Art Video</h2><p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a powerful tool and with the know-how can make your art be more than just a still image. Whether it is for a music video or a portfolio showreel, there are better ways than just inserting an image and letting it fade to the next still image. We can make use of effects and transitions to put our art to better use.</p>
<p>In this guide I’m going to show a couple of ways to enhance your images within <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for your videos.</p>
<h2 id="Transitions"><a href="#Transitions" class="headerlink" title="Transitions"></a>Transitions</h2><p>By inserting a transition to your image, you can add some diversity to how the viewer first see’s your image, You may want to emphasis a certain element of your art and therefore would select a transition that zooms in on that element before zooming out to the whole image or maybe you have a painting of a cyberpunk angel and wish to have the image enter in a grid formation. The point is that by experimenting with transitions and trying to select the best ones based on the element in your work you will achieve a better first impression. This is true for all aspects of video creation.</p>
<p>Having multiple transitions can create a unique look for your videos with minimal understanding of how to create a transition but there needs to be an understanding of how the layers work in <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> being that a layer on top is in front of the one below, remember this when you start to add transitions as sometime you may need to duplicate your art as to keep it in the shot.</p>

                      alt="add transitions art video"
                ></p>
<p>As you can see here, I have duplicated my image onto separate channels as to always keep the image in the scene.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/duplicated-image-onto-separate-channels.jpg"
                      alt="duplicated image onto separate channels"
                ></p>
<p>In the image above you can see how I used multiple transitions, I did this as my image is off center and I wanted to emphasize that, I picked transitions that had clear symmetry and lines so that the viewer had a reference point of where center was without me having to place that in my art. This is a very useful way of adding information to your art without telling the viewer directly. As for the color theory, I went with oranges and yellows predominantly here as they are neighboring colors on the color wheel and we know they work well together with my main color of yellow. As for the composition I have tried to keep all the eye-catching points along the top third of the image as to create a piece more pleasing to the eye even with all this information going on.</p>
<h2 id="Effects"><a href="#Effects" class="headerlink" title="Effects"></a>Effects</h2><p>The inclusion of effect onto your art should not be discouraged depending on what the art is used for, in my example i created this as though it was album art and the musician wanted to upload a simple music video using that art, on its own it is static and can loose engagement but by applying relevant effects you can capture the viewer’s eye and make the listening experience more enjoyable. Effects can also be stacked to create unique assets for your art and help tell a story, if your art includes fire why not add a fire effect breaking the stillness of the image or maybe your art has motion, you could include a motion effect to your still image and give the viewer more information.</p>
<p>Even when using effects you can use fundamentals such as color theory or composition to better enhance your imagery.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/choose-effect-art-video.jpg"
                      alt="choose effect art video"
                ></p>
<p>In this image you can see I have added an audio visualizer effect as well as a spectral light effect. I did this to reinforce the face of my image having a strong light source, it creates dynamic movement and the audio visualizer was added due to the nature of the video being music oriented but I felt this could have been done better. The composition of the audio visualizer was front and center and seemed boring and uninteresting. This is where the research into art fundamentals comes into play as remembering the rule of thirds and how all the main features of the image are in the top horizontal third, we can make use of the vertical thirds to gain a better composition and hopefully create more engagement.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/pewview-art-video-effects.jpg"
                      alt="pewview art video effects"
                ></p>
<p>As you can see, we have duplicated the audio visualizer and made better use of the thirds nor having opposing placement within the scene, the same information is being given by the effect but we have managed to use the space more effectively and created a visually pleasing aesthetic to our video. Trick like this can make your still image feel more animated and have more purpose within the video itself.</p>
<h2 id="Adding-Titles-and-Text"><a href="#Adding-Titles-and-Text" class="headerlink" title="Adding Titles and Text"></a>Adding Titles and Text</h2><p>Adding text is another way of adding information to your art. It’s said an image can speak a thousand words but sometimes you need words to talk for an image. When words are needed for your video, there should be some thought into how them words are presented as just selecting any text and inserting that to your video may look jarring to the viewer and result in a loss of interest towards your videos. Selecting the right transition for your text or the color or even the font can have different results and can help with affordance depending on what you’re looking to portray.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/add-text-title-art-video.jpg"
                      alt="add text title art video"
                ></p>
<p>In my example I wanted to say thank you and felt sharp edges would seem formal and because of the main image it would be too similar so I went with a font that was more rounded. When inserting text onto a scene such as this one you are given a lot of information for your selections, we already have color in there to help us choose our font and background color, I went with yellow and pink due to the fact it was already in the scene and I didn’t want to take the attention away from the focus. The way the text transitions onto the screen secures just enough attention to itself that the viewer knows it’s there and can read it if they wish to. If I wanted to gain full attention i would have picked a transition that overlaps the key element and picked complementary colors on the opposite sides of the color wheel guaranteeing the viewer’s eyes would notice and engage with the motion.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>By incorporating all the art fundamentals and skills we have learned we can use the tools provided by <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> more effectively and create dynamic and engaging videos that are aesthetically pleasing for our audience. Upon learning the many different types and styles of transitions, effects, and titles we can enhance our artwork for use within our video.

It saves them from potential danger in production and helps them manage the time required to create a project. In this article, you will get pro tips and easy ways to add Fire effects by Wondershare Filmora.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> let’s not count Michael Bay and Christopher Nolan productions because their movies have a higher budget, and creating fake fire is easy.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-do-you-need-to-create-fire-effects"><a href="#Part-1-What-do-you-need-to-create-fire-effects" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What do you need to create fire effects?"></a>Part 1. What do you need to create fire effects?</h2><p>Using simple tools such as Filmora and visual effects, you can create a realistic fire effect with an easy setup. For filming the effect, we will need</p>
<ol>
<li>A good camera</li>
<li>A light source</li>
<li>Video editing software - Wondershare Filmora</li>
<li>Basic editing skills</li>
</ol>
<p>However, the light source is key to the fire effects. It will be beneficial if you have a <strong>warmer color</strong> light or a light that can change its temperature. You can use <strong>tungsten</strong> light bulbs or small circular <strong>LEDs</strong> that are pretty famous with Vloggers and tick-tock users.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-make-a-realistic-effect-fire"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-make-a-realistic-effect-fire" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to make a realistic effect fire?"></a>Part 2. How to make a realistic effect fire?</h2><p>After getting prepared, it’s time to do the real things. Follow the steps below to create a realistic fire effect like a pro.</p>
<h5 id="Step1-Record-your-footage"><a href="#Step1-Record-your-footage" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Record your footage"></a>Step1 Record your footage</h5><p>While recording the video, you can <strong>slightly shake</strong> your light source, which will give it the flickering effect of the flame. Here, you can do this in two ways.</p>
<p><strong>Shaking the light manually</strong></p>
<p>Just make sure when you are shaking the light, it is not shaken aggressively, or it will lose its realism to a real fire.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="shaking the light source"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Shaking the light using a dimmer</strong></p>
<p>You can also use some skills to create the flickering effect of the fire without literally shaking the LED light. Dimmers come to help. A dimmer is a device that enables you to change the temperature of the LED light. If you have a <strong>dimmer</strong>, your work will be more accessible.</p>
<p>A <strong>regulator</strong> on the dimmer will help you switch between low and high tones. It will flicker the light on the object like a flame and make it look like it was placed in front of a real fire.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="dimmer for shaking"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step2-Record-the-object"><a href="#Step2-Record-the-object" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Record the object"></a>Step2 Record the object</h5><p>Our next step will be to record the object on which the effect is taking place. Ensure the camera is placed under a <strong>good light</strong> source so that the picture is not dim and the object is exposed. Make sure the camera is placed at the <strong>level of the eye</strong> so that it will help you record your video clearly and accurately.</p>
<p>Also, keep in mind to <strong>zoom out</strong> the camera lens, which will fix the frame of the video so that the object or the person is entirely on the screen. Another tip for creating a realistic fire effect would be the person acting as the object. The more natural the acting is, the more realistic would be the fire effect.</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Edit-the-footage"><a href="#Step3-Edit-the-footage" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Edit the footage"></a>Step3 Edit the footage</h5><p>We are being safe and saving time by not using actual fire. The <strong>goal</strong> of creating a fake fire would be the effect and reaction of the object or the actor.</p>
<p><strong>1. Download a professional video editing software - Wondershare Filmora</strong></p>
<p>Visit <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> official site if you haven’t already downloaded it.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> download the latest version of filmora. It will give you a pro version and help you to create more realistic fire effects.</p>
<p><strong>2. Create a new project and import the recorded clips</strong></p>
<p>Before adding the fire effects to your video, you must ensure that you are familiar with the editing software. Your first step would be to add your clips to the <strong>timeline.</strong> Drag the footage from the library and enter it into the timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="import footage"
                ></p>
<p><strong>3. create the fire effect more realistic by adding smoke</strong></p>
<p>The next step would be to add smoke to the fire. As it is only fair that the fire makes the smoke so. Adding the smoke will create the fire effect more realistic. Follow the below steps to get your cinematic video!</p>
<h5 id="Step1-Search-for-smoke-effects"><a href="#Step1-Search-for-smoke-effects" class="headerlink" title="#Step1 Search for smoke effects"></a>#Step1 Search for smoke effects</h5><p>To add the smoke effect, click on the element’s icon on the bar above and search for <strong>smokescreen 2.</strong></p>
<h5 id="Step2-Add-a-smoke-effect"><a href="#Step2-Add-a-smoke-effect" class="headerlink" title="#Step2 Add a smoke effect"></a>#Step2 Add a smoke effect</h5><p>Once you have searched and found the smoke screen 2 effects, then <strong>import</strong> that effect onto your timeline so that you can begin editing.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/realistic-fire-effect-using-wondershare-filmora-4.gif"
                      alt="adding smokescreen2 effect"
                ></p>
<p>Once you’ve added the fire effect, you will notice the change on the screen in the top right corner.</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Add-duration"><a href="#Step3-Add-duration" class="headerlink" title="#Step3 Add duration"></a>#Step3 Add duration</h5><p>The next step would be to set the duration of the smokescreen effect so that it <strong>matches the length of the video</strong>. To do so,</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the edge of the smoke screen effect.</li>
<li>Drag it to the right if the effect appears <strong>smaller</strong> than the video clip.</li>
<li>And drag it to the left if it is <strong>larger</strong> than the video clip.</li>
<li>As soon as it matches the length of the video, leave the drag, and it will fit right into place.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="Step4-Make-some-changes-to-the-smoke-effect"><a href="#Step4-Make-some-changes-to-the-smoke-effect" class="headerlink" title="#Step4 Make some changes to the smoke effect"></a>#Step4 Make some changes to the smoke effect</h5><p>Once you have matched the duration of the smoke screen effect to the video clip, our next step would be to make some changes. These changes will make the <strong>smokescreen appear more pleasing</strong>—<strong>double-click</strong> on the smokescreen effect, which will open the transform menu.</p>
<p>We would first focus on the transform panel. Here you would have many options, but our focus would be on <strong>rotation, scale, and position</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> make sure to rotate the smoke screen effect by simply sliding the slider or dragging the slider right or left to your desire.</p>
<ul>
<li>You would have created an <strong>angle</strong> of the smokescreen to make it more natural.</li>
<li>Now, we would have to adjust the <strong>scale</strong> of the smokescreen effect.</li>
<li>Drag the slider to the right to expand the smoke to spread on the screen. It will help the smoke screen do appear more natural.</li>
<li>You can adjust how much the smoke screen is visible on the screen by decreasing the opacity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Adjust the slider to the <strong>left</strong> so it blends in with the flickering of the light we created. Now playback the video from the big screen to get an idea of the effect you added. And here are our parameters for reference.</p>

<li><strong>First of all,</strong> double-click and open the <strong>transform</strong></li>
<li>Experiment with the <strong>rotation</strong> and the <strong>scale</strong> and position; make your choice.</li>
<li>Then move on to the compositing panel and focus on the <strong>blending mode</strong>.</li>
<li>Here, you will notice a <strong>drop-down panel</strong> and select the screen option from all the other options.</li>
<li>Doing so would help you blend the spark effect video much better.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you focus on the spark effect that appears on the screen, you will notice that it seems to be much more intense than we require.

What do you need to create fire effects?"></a>Part 1. What do you need to create fire effects?</h2><p>Using simple tools such as Filmora and visual effects, you can create a realistic fire effect with an easy setup. For filming the effect, we will need</p>
<ol>
<li>A good camera</li>
<li>A light source</li>
<li>Video editing software - Wondershare Filmora</li>
<li>Basic editing skills</li>
</ol>
<p>However, the light source is key to the fire effects. It will be beneficial if you have a <strong>warmer color</strong> light or a light that can change its temperature. You can use <strong>tungsten</strong> light bulbs or small circular <strong>LEDs</strong> that are pretty famous with Vloggers and tick-tock users.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-make-a-realistic-effect-fire-1"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-make-a-realistic-effect-fire-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to make a realistic effect fire?"></a>Part 2. How to make a realistic effect fire?</h2><p>After getting prepared, it’s time to do the real things. Follow the steps below to create a realistic fire effect like a pro.</p>
<h5 id="Step1-Record-your-footage-1"><a href="#Step1-Record-your-footage-1" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Record your footage"></a>Step1 Record your footage</h5><p>While recording the video, you can <strong>slightly shake</strong> your light source, which will give it the flickering effect of the flame. Here, you can do this in two ways.</p>
<p><strong>Shaking the light manually</strong></p>
<p>Just make sure when you are shaking the light, it is not shaken aggressively, or it will lose its realism to a real fire.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/realistic-fire-effect-using-wondershare-filmora-1.gif"
                      alt="shaking the light source"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Shaking the light using a dimmer</strong></p>
<p>You can also use some skills to create the flickering effect of the fire without literally shaking the LED light. Dimmers come to help. A dimmer is a device that enables you to change the temperature of the LED light. If you have a <strong>dimmer</strong>, your work will be more accessible.</p>
<p>A <strong>regulator</strong> on the dimmer will help you switch between low and high tones. It will flicker the light on the object like a flame and make it look like it was placed in front of a real fire.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/realistic-fire-effect-using-wondershare-filmora-2.jpg"
                      alt="dimmer for shaking"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step2-Record-the-object-1"><a href="#Step2-Record-the-object-1" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Record the object"></a>Step2 Record the object</h5><p>Our next step will be to record the object on which the effect is taking place. Ensure the camera is placed under a <strong>good light</strong> source so that the picture is not dim and the object is exposed. Make sure the camera is placed at the <strong>level of the eye</strong> so that it will help you record your video clearly and accurately.</p>
<p>Also, keep in mind to <strong>zoom out</strong> the camera lens, which will fix the frame of the video so that the object or the person is entirely on the screen. Another tip for creating a realistic fire effect would be the person acting as the object. The more natural the acting is, the more realistic would be the fire effect.</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Edit-the-footage-1"><a href="#Step3-Edit-the-footage-1" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Edit the footage"></a>Step3 Edit the footage</h5><p>We are being safe and saving time by not using actual fire. The <strong>goal</strong> of creating a fake fire would be the effect and reaction of the object or the actor.</p>
<p><strong>1. Download a professional video editing software - Wondershare Filmora</strong></p>
<p>Visit <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> official site if you haven’t already downloaded it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> download the latest version of filmora. It will give you a pro version and help you to create more realistic fire effects.</p>
<p><strong>2. Create a new project and import the recorded clips</strong></p>
<p>Before adding the fire effects to your video, you must ensure that you are familiar with the editing software. Your first step would be to add your clips to the <strong>timeline.</strong> Drag the footage from the library and enter it into the timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="import footage"
                ></p>
<p><strong>3. create the fire effect more realistic by adding smoke</strong></p>
<p>The next step would be to add smoke to the fire. As it is only fair that the fire makes the smoke so. Adding the smoke will create the fire effect more realistic. Follow the below steps to get your cinematic video!</p>
<h5 id="Step1-Search-for-smoke-effects-1"><a href="#Step1-Search-for-smoke-effects-1" class="headerlink" title="#Step1 Search for smoke effects"></a>#Step1 Search for smoke effects</h5><p>To add the smoke effect, click on the element’s icon on the bar above and search for <strong>smokescreen 2.</strong></p>
<h5 id="Step2-Add-a-smoke-effect-1"><a href="#Step2-Add-a-smoke-effect-1" class="headerlink" title="#Step2 Add a smoke effect"></a>#Step2 Add a smoke effect</h5><p>Once you have searched and found the smoke screen 2 effects, then <strong>import</strong> that effect onto your timeline so that you can begin editing.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adding smokescreen2 effect"
                ></p>
<p>Once you’ve added the fire effect, you will notice the change on the screen in the top right corner.</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Add-duration-1"><a href="#Step3-Add-duration-1" class="headerlink" title="#Step3 Add duration"></a>#Step3 Add duration</h5><p>The next step would be to set the duration of the smokescreen effect so that it <strong>matches the length of the video</strong>. To do so,</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the edge of the smoke screen effect.</li>
<li>Drag it to the right if the effect appears <strong>smaller</strong> than the video clip.</li>
<li>And drag it to the left if it is <strong>larger</strong> than the video clip.</li>
<li>As soon as it matches the length of the video, leave the drag, and it will fit right into place.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="Step4-Make-some-changes-to-the-smoke-effect-1"><a href="#Step4-Make-some-changes-to-the-smoke-effect-1" class="headerlink" title="#Step4 Make some changes to the smoke effect"></a>#Step4 Make some changes to the smoke effect</h5><p>Once you have matched the duration of the smoke screen effect to the video clip, our next step would be to make some changes. These changes will make the <strong>smokescreen appear more pleasing</strong>—<strong>double-click</strong> on the smokescreen effect, which will open the transform menu.</p>
<p>We would first focus on the transform panel. Here you would have many options, but our focus would be on <strong>rotation, scale, and position</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> make sure to rotate the smoke screen effect by simply sliding the slider or dragging the slider right or left to your desire.</p>
<ul>
<li>You would have created an <strong>angle</strong> of the smokescreen to make it more natural.</li>
<li>Now, we would have to adjust the <strong>scale</strong> of the smokescreen effect.</li>
<li>Drag the slider to the right to expand the smoke to spread on the screen. It will help the smoke screen do appear more natural.</li>
<li>You can adjust how much the smoke screen is visible on the screen by decreasing the opacity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Adjust the slider to the <strong>left</strong> so it blends in with the flickering of the light we created. Now playback the video from the big screen to get an idea of the effect you added. And here are our parameters for reference.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
