<li><strong>Browse</strong> from the PC library to where your target Videos and Photos are stored.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Right-click</strong> on the photo or video you want.</li>
<li>Keep holding the Right-click and drag it down to the timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p><img

<h5 id="Step4-Add-the-Title"><a href="#Step4-Add-the-Title" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Add the Title"></a>Step4 Add the Title</h5><p>To create an attractive slideshow, you will need to add a title before the start of the video. Doing so will allow you to gain more viewers and audiences.</p>
<p><strong>Add a Black Screen</strong></p>
<p>The black screen will eventually act like a canvas to give your title a good look. To add a black screen, follow the steps mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>media</strong> icon from the bar above the import window.</li>
<li>You will notice many tabs on the left-hand side under a drop-down bar.</li>

                      alt="adding a black screen"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Add a Title Tile</strong></p>
<p>Now that we have our canvas, we will now add the title. Above the import media library, there will be a <strong>Title</strong> icon.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>title</strong> icon, and select the title that you want for your video by browsing and scrolling down.</li>
<li>For this purpose, we will use a simple title tile called “<strong>Title 29</strong>.”</li>
</ul>

                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can find the same title by scrolling, browsing, or searching in the search bar above the import library.</p>
<ul>

<h5 id="Step5-Add-a-Fade-effect"><a href="#Step5-Add-a-Fade-effect" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Add a Fade effect"></a>Step5 Add a Fade effect</h5><p>You can also add a fade transition to the start of your video. It will blend the title with the first clip. Follow the steps mentioned to add the transition effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Search the <strong>Fade</strong> option from the Transitions tab above the import window</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> A fade transition will allow your title to fade into the first clip creating a visually pleasing effect.</p>
<ul>
<li>Download the <strong>Fade</strong> transition and <strong>drag</strong> it between the Black screen and the first clip.</li>

                      alt="adding a fade effect"
                ></p>
<p>Now that we have added a transition, it is time to move on to our music!</p>
<h5 id="Step6-Add-The-Music"><a href="#Step6-Add-The-Music" class="headerlink" title="Step6 Add The Music"></a>Step6 Add The Music</h5><p>You can add your music to the slideshow from your PC library, but make sure you have the music rights.

<li>Please browse the library to find music that best suits your video and download it.</li>
<li>Then add it to the timeline’s audio track.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Add Beat Detection</strong></p>
<p>To match your video clips properly with the music, so it remains in sync, you can adjust it with the beat of the music. To add beat detection, follow the steps mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right-Click on the audio that you selected in the audio library.</li>
<li>You will see a pop-up list, and in the options, you will see Beat detection.</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Beat detection</strong>.</li>

                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Then click on the audio and drag it below on the timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Match The Video With The Audio Markers</strong></p>
<p>To have the full advantage of beat detection, you must adjust your videos and photos to the markers. Follow the steps mentioned below to do so:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="matching the video with the audio"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Check that the video clips are in sync with the marker on the audio.</li>
<li>For this, drag one video end to a marker or as many videos as you want.</li>
<li>Ultimately, you will create a timeline in which your videos sync with the audio beat.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="synced video with audio"
                ></p>
<p>After syncing your videos and photos to the audio, it is time to move on to the scaling and background blur.</p>
<h5 id="Step7-Scale-and-Blur-The-Background"><a href="#Step7-Scale-and-Blur-The-Background" class="headerlink" title="Step7 Scale and Blur The Background"></a>Step7 Scale and Blur The Background</h5><p>Now, some of the pictures you have added must-have black borders. It usually means that your image is shorter than the aspect ratio.</p>
<p>If you leave the picture&#x2F;photo as it is, the black borders will make it look shorter and out of proportion. As a result, it gives a generally poor look, as shown below.</p>

<p>To counter this problem, follow some easy steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> on the picture with black borders, and it will open the settings list.</li>
<li>Go into the <strong>Transform</strong> Here you can see multiple settings.</li>
<li>Increase the size of your photo to match the aspect ratio.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p><strong>Add a Background Blur Effect</strong></p>
<p>In some cases where you have taken a portrait photo where the picture is vertical, it ultimately stays out of proportion to the aspect ratio.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Simply scaling the image to match the aspect ratio size is not sensible in this case. Doing so will hide the many pretty features of a portrait.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="photo with black borders"
                ></p>
<p>To counter this problem, you can add a blur effect. This effect will turn your background blur, matching the aspect ratio. Follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>Effects</strong> tab above the import window and search for <strong>Blur</strong>.</li>
<li>Download the blur effect that suits you best and then <strong>drag</strong> the blur effect above your photo in the timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will notice the background turn to a blur in the main play screen.</p>

<p>When you have adjusted the slideshow transitions, it is time to move on to the effects and filters.</p>

                      alt="import your videos and photos"
                ></p>
<p>Your next step will be to add the imported videos and images to the timeline.</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Add-your-Photos-and-Videos-to-the-Timeline-1"><a href="#Step3-Add-your-Photos-and-Videos-to-the-Timeline-1" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Add your Photos and Videos to the Timeline"></a>Step3 Add your Photos and Videos to the Timeline</h5><p>When you have multiple videos and photos, you can add all of them simultaneously. Or you can also add them one by one wherever you need. Follow the steps mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Right-click</strong> on the photo or video you want.</li>
<li>Keep holding the Right-click and drag it down to the timeline.</li>
</ul>

                      alt="add your photos and videos to your timeline"
                ></p>
<p>Now that we have imported your photos and videos into the timeline, it is time to align and add text.</p>
<h5 id="Step4-Add-the-Title-1"><a href="#Step4-Add-the-Title-1" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Add the Title"></a>Step4 Add the Title</h5><p>To create an attractive slideshow, you will need to add a title before the start of the video. Doing so will allow you to gain more viewers and audiences.</p>
<p><strong>Add a Black Screen</strong></p>
<p>The black screen will eventually act like a canvas to give your title a good look. To add a black screen, follow the steps mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>media</strong> icon from the bar above the import window.</li>
<li>You will notice many tabs on the left-hand side under a drop-down bar.</li>

                      alt="adding a black screen"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Add a Title Tile</strong></p>
<p>Now that we have our canvas, we will now add the title. Above the import media library, there will be a <strong>Title</strong> icon.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>title</strong> icon, and select the title that you want for your video by browsing and scrolling down.</li>
<li>For this purpose, we will use a simple title tile called “<strong>Title 29</strong>.”</li>
</ul>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can find the same title by scrolling, browsing, or searching in the search bar above the import library.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click and drag the title onto the black screen that we added.</li>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> the title to open its settings.</li>

                ></p>
<p>After adding the title, it’s time to go with fading effect as shown below!</p>
<h5 id="Step5-Add-a-Fade-effect-1"><a href="#Step5-Add-a-Fade-effect-1" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Add a Fade effect"></a>Step5 Add a Fade effect</h5><p>You can also add a fade transition to the start of your video. It will blend the title with the first clip. Follow the steps mentioned to add the transition effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Search the <strong>Fade</strong> option from the Transitions tab above the import window</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="adding a fade effect"
                ></p>
<p>Now that we have added a transition, it is time to move on to our music!</p>
<h5 id="Step6-Add-The-Music-1"><a href="#Step6-Add-The-Music-1" class="headerlink" title="Step6 Add The Music"></a>Step6 Add The Music</h5><p>You can add your music to the slideshow from your PC library, but make sure you have the music rights. It is better to use stock audio by following the steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>Audio</strong> icon on the bar above the import window, and the list will pop up.</li>
<li>Please browse the library to find music that best suits your video and download it.</li>
<li>Then add it to the timeline’s audio track.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Add Beat Detection</strong></p>
<p>To match your video clips properly with the music, so it remains in sync, you can adjust it with the beat of the music. To add beat detection, follow the steps mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right-Click on the audio that you selected in the audio library.</li>
<li>You will see a pop-up list, and in the options, you will see Beat detection.</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Beat detection</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-8.png"
                      alt="adding beat detection"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Then click on the audio and drag it below on the timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Match The Video With The Audio Markers</strong></p>
<p>To have the full advantage of beat detection, you must adjust your videos and photos to the markers. Follow the steps mentioned below to do so:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-9.png"
                      alt="matching the video with the audio"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Check that the video clips are in sync with the marker on the audio.</li>
<li>For this, drag one video end to a marker or as many videos as you want.</li>
<li>Ultimately, you will create a timeline in which your videos sync with the audio beat.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="synced video with audio"
                ></p>
<p>After syncing your videos and photos to the audio, it is time to move on to the scaling and background blur.</p>
<h5 id="Step7-Scale-and-Blur-The-Background-1"><a href="#Step7-Scale-and-Blur-The-Background-1" class="headerlink" title="Step7 Scale and Blur The Background"></a>Step7 Scale and Blur The Background</h5><p>Now, some of the pictures you have added must-have black borders. It usually means that your image is shorter than the aspect ratio.</p>
<p>If you leave the picture&#x2F;photo as it is, the black borders will make it look shorter and out of proportion. As a result, it gives a generally poor look, as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="unscaled photo in the main play window"
                ></p>
<p>To counter this problem, follow some easy steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> on the picture with black borders, and it will open the settings list.</li>
<li>Go into the <strong>Transform</strong> Here you can see multiple settings.</li>
