Too high of a frame rate makes the video seem unnatural. On the other hand, too low can make some videos choppy. You can fix that by changing the frame rate using a video editor. And we are here to help you learn how to do that. Here’s <strong>how to change the frame rate in Premiere Pro.</strong></p>
<p>The frame rate sometimes makes or breaks the video. So it is important to get this setting right. Suppose you made a mistake and recorded your video in the wrong setting. You can follow this guide to solve your problem.</p>

Maybe you don’t need to modify the video because it is already in the correct setting.</p>
<p>So how do you do that in Premiere Pro?</p>
<ol>
<li>Import the video to Adobe Premiere Pro.</li>
<li>Check the “Media” window. Next to the video file name is its frame rate. It is written in the format x.00 fps. FPS stands for “frames per second,” which is used interchangeably with the term frame rate.</li>
</ol>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="check video frame rate in premiere pro"
                ></p>
<h2 id="Reasons-for-Changing-Frame-Rate"><a href="#Reasons-for-Changing-Frame-Rate" class="headerlink" title="Reasons for Changing Frame Rate"></a>Reasons for Changing Frame Rate</h2><p>Suppose you have an action-packed video. It would not look great at 30 fps - it will look too choppy. That will give your audience a rotten viewing experience. By increasing the frames, you can make the motion more fluid and smoother.</p>
<p>Increasing the frames per second also results in better slow-motion videos. A 30 fps one would not look good with this effect because it does not show smooth motion. Thus, we recommend making the video at least 60 fps.</p>
<p>However, a higher frame rate does not always mean better videos. It can result in what they call the “soap opera effect.” It means the video shows too many details. That makes the videos seem “unnatural” or less cinematic.</p>
<p>High frame rates make videos look more realistic since there is less stuttering and motion blur between frames. That’s great. But for older audiences - the ones used to watching videos at 24 fps, it can be off-putting. So it’s also important to consider your target audience when deciding the right frame rate for your video.</p>
<p>With these reasons in mind, you may want to change your video’s frame rate.</p>

Here’s a quick guide on how to change fps in Adobe Premiere Pro. This program gives you two different ways to change fps. One is changing the frame rate of a sequence; the other is changing the frame rate of the video clip. We will teach you how to do both.</p>

<li>In the Project panel, select the sequence whose frame rate you want to change. Right-click on that sequence.</li>

<h2 id="How-To-Make-120-FPS-Videos-With-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#How-To-Make-120-FPS-Videos-With-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="How To Make 120 FPS Videos With Premiere Pro"></a>How To Make 120 FPS Videos With Premiere Pro</h2><p>Videos that are 120 fps are very popular now. If you are a gaming content creator on YouTube, you probably record videos at this frame rate. You’d want to edit that footage and export it at the same frame rate.</p>
<p>Adobe Premiere Pro allows you to do that. But it’s a little bit of a hidden feature. When creating a sequence, you may notice that the highest the frame rate can go is 60 frames per second. That’s obviously not the number that we want. Don’t worry. There is a workaround. The best thing is that it’s super easy.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to change your video to 120 fps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Import your 120 fps video to Adobe Premiere Pro.</li>
<li>Select your footage. Drag it to your timeline or the tab where the text says, “Drop media here to create sequence.”</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>Select the timeline panel. Click “Sequence” &gt; “Sequence Settings.”</li>

<p>Let’s take a look into some easy and interesting ways of <strong>creating a GIF in Photoshop</strong>, to leave you with handy solutions, just in case you feel motivated to take up the creation idea.</p>
<p>Before you begin, make sure to install and launch a suitable version the Photoshop application in your device and keep a set of selected images at hand that you will require for GIF creation.</p>

<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Photoshop- Image Selection"
                ></p>
<p>Reach the ‘File’ tab at the top and load your image files into the Photoshop stack using the following path:</p>
<p><strong>File -&gt; Scripts -&gt; Load Files into Stack</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/How-to-create-photoshop-gif-the-100%25-easy-way-2.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop- File Stack Loading"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2: Image Selection</strong></p>
<p>In the next pop-up window, click ‘Browse’ and choose the image file you wish to load into the Photoshop stack. In case the selected images seem tom lack proper alignment, click on the ‘Attempt to Automatically Align Source Images’ checkbox to set this straight and make your GIF frame stable.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Photoshop- File Browse Window"
                ></p>
<p>Click on ‘OK’ when you are happy with your selections.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Photoshop- Confirm Selection Window"
                ></p>
<p>At this instant, Photoshop starts creating layers for the uploaded images, which you can see in the ‘Layers’ panel at the bottom-right. You are allowed to rearrange the image layers by selecting and dragging them or click on layer names to rename them.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Photoshop- Image Layer Creation"
                ></p>
<p>If you notice distortion in Photoshop’s automatic alignment of your images, just crop the images frames to sort this out. Here’s how you can get this done:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Tap the ‘Crop’ symbol.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Adjust the crop frame to select the desired portion.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Click on ‘Enter’ to confirm the action.</p>
<p>If you didn’t permit auto alignment previously, no worries, you can move ahead.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3: Make a Timeline Setup</strong></p>
