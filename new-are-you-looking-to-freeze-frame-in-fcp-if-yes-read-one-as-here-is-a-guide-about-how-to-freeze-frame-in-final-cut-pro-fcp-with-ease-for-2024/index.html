<ul>
<li>Firstly, download and install Adobe Premiere Pro on your Mac. After installation, launch the app to begin.</li>
<li>Next, create a new Premiere Pro project and create the right name you would like to save it as.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/cut-large-file-30.jpg"
                      alt="cut-large-file"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Now, import the large video you want to cut into Adobe Premiere Pro. You can either drag the video into the project clip tab or go to ‘file’ and choose ‘import’ from the menu. Navigate to the file’s location and choose the video.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="cut-large-file"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Now select the video on the timeline; a white border will appear around the clip to show your selection.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="cut-large-file"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Pick the razor tool on the menu or press C on your keyboard to start cutting the large file.</li>
</ul>

                      alt="cut-large-file"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>To cut the video clip, hover the razor over any part of the video and split wherever you prefer. You can make multiple cuts on the video. However, if you want an accurate cut, simply move the playhead to the part you’ll like to begin the cut and then use the razor to cut.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="cut-large-file"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Now you can delete any fragment you want by selecting it and pressing delete on your PC.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>Once you have a clean-cut, you can save or share your video.</p>

However, some are free, while others require a subscription. Therefore, it can be pretty challenging to figure out the best option for your video cutting needs. Below are some factors to consider when choosing between a paid or free video cutter on Mac.</p>
<h3 id="·-Intuitive-Workflow-3"><a href="#·-Intuitive-Workflow-3" class="headerlink" title="· Intuitive Workflow"></a>· Intuitive Workflow</h3><p>Some software is quite difficult to operate, and you could spend hours figuring out how each tool works. An efficient video cutting software makes all tools easy to use. Ensure the large video cutter you choose ensures a seamless workflow to improve your efficiency. In addition, a fast-processing feature is necessary to reduce the editing time significantly.</p>
<h3 id="·-Budget-3"><a href="#·-Budget-3" class="headerlink" title="· Budget"></a>· Budget</h3><p>Another factor that’s important to consider is your budget. You can use free software, but you need to note that the features are limited. If the tool doesn’t offer you the features you’re looking for, you might need to subscribe to a paid video cutter. Always choose a video cutter that falls within your budget.</p>
<h3 id="·-Experience-Level-3"><a href="#·-Experience-Level-3" class="headerlink" title="· Experience Level"></a>· Experience Level</h3><p>Are you looking to develop your editing skills? Then a paid large video cutter is the best option for you. There are usually advanced and basic tools available to help you edit your skills. However, a paid video cutter also offers you more functionality that can help you learn how to create impressive edited videos.</p>
<p>Overall, you want a video editor with an easy learning curve and one that meets your needs effectively. The goal is to get a video editor that will provide you with more editing tools to enhance your video. It is pretty easy to outgrow free video cutters because of their limited features. However, if you’re choosing a paid video cutter, ensure it isn’t made for professionals and, therefore, is challenging to navigate.</p>
