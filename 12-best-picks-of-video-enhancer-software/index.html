Vectorscope: What is It and How to Read"></a><strong>Part 1. Vectorscope: What is It and How to Read</strong></h2><p>Vectorscopes provide a great post-production way for color correction. It is video scope that provides greater data about the color properties of an image. Another way to look at it is that a Vectorscope is a circular graph, which monitors the following information of an image. By looking at it, you can measure saturation outward from the center while hue is measured in a circular pattern.</p>
<p>The Vectorscope contains markings indicating the degree of saturation and hue in an image. The distance of the markings from the center indicates how saturated the color is in your image. In simple terms, the further the markings, the more saturated the color. The two main options of Vectorscope are HLS and YUV. The HLS displays the hue, lightness, saturation, and signal information at a glance. On the other hand, the YUV mode contains several color boxes, giving accurate levels of hue and saturation.</p>
<p><img

<p>Vectorscopes are useful to filmmakers and editors to ensure greater conformity in a film as they transition from one shot to the next. When the camera captures an image with too much saturation, using a Vectorscope helps to reduce the said saturation. This makes Vectorscope a useful feature for color correction and color grading. Color correction involves altering the colors of an image within a film to provide consistency and tone for the film. On the other hand, color grading is more like a supercharged version of color correction. It refers to altering a film so that it matches a tone or theme. Since the two, grading and correction are important, more video editing will use a combination of both.</p>
<h3 id="How-to-Read-a-Vectorscope"><a href="#How-to-Read-a-Vectorscope" class="headerlink" title="How to Read a Vectorscope"></a><strong>How to Read a Vectorscope</strong></h3><p>Learning how to read a Vectorscope will make your video editing fun and easier. The best way is to view the Vectorscope in relation to the color wheel. When using Premiere Vectorscope, the colors are nicely labeled for anyone to understand. You only need to understand the primary colors of saturation and hue to accurately read a Vectorscope.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="reading vectorscope"
                ></p>
<p>The hue color is the direction to which the marketer points. For instance, a marker pointing toward the boxes labeled “R” indicates that the hue is predominantly red. On the other hand, the saturation correlates to the length of the marker. The image is more saturated when the marker is furthest from the center of the wheel.</p>
<p>Keep note of the two boxes in each main color. The box that is close to the center indicates 75%, and you will normally avoid the marker extending beyond this first box. Any marketer that extends beyond this is known as non-broadcast safe or illegal colors. Although you may need to go beyond the first box in some projects for stylistic reasons, the general rule of thumb is to avoid that.</p>
<p>Without proper calibration, your images may end up looking too red or too blue. They will not look natural at all and will affect the overall quality of your video. Therefore, using the features within the vectorsope will help you color-grade your images to perfection.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Vectorscope-in-Premiere-Pro-A-Brief-Guide"><a href="#Part-2-Vectorscope-in-Premiere-Pro-A-Brief-Guide" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

The best way to look at Vectorscope in Premiere Pro is to use the Color Correction workspace. Once you have launched the software, Click Window, followed by Workspace, and then Color Correction. Access the reference monitor directly to deliver the program.</p>
<p>The reference monitor will first display composite video. Clicking on the setting icon allows you to access the panel and choose the video scope you want to use. Now, this is how you use the Vectorscope in Premiere Pro:</p>
<h3 id="1-Reading-a-Vectorscope-on-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#1-Reading-a-Vectorscope-on-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="1. Reading a Vectorscope on Premiere Pro"></a><strong>1. Reading a Vectorscope on Premiere Pro</strong></h3><p>A Vectorscope is similar to a color wheel. It displays colors in the same places as the wheel, with cyan to the bottom right and red to the top left. When you see a dot or line in the Vectorscope, you can tell it is giving you information about the color or chrominance of a shot. Essentially, this information is the hue (specific color) and the saturation (the strength of that hue).</p>

                      alt="color wheel"
                ></p>
<p>As you examine the Vectorscope, you get to see how strong a particular color is by the length of the line from the center of the wheel. A longer line indicates that the color is more saturated. However, all Vectorscopes have small color targets. The Vectorscope points are lined with a drop-down used to read the scope. The default is set to 75%, which is a good limit for a typical broadcast system.</p>

<h3 id="2-Adjusting-Skin-Tones"><a href="#2-Adjusting-Skin-Tones" class="headerlink" title="2. Adjusting Skin Tones"></a><strong>2. Adjusting Skin Tones</strong></h3><p>A commonly used feature of the Premier Pro Vectorscope is the Skin Tone Line. With this feature, you get the line on the scope between the Yellow and the Red sections at about 10.30 or 11 o’clock position.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>The Vectorscope skin tone line represents the color of blood flowing through the skin. You can use this line to check the accuracy of skin tone color representation regardless of the ethnicity of the person you’re filming. In particular, video images are more accurate</p>
<p>The major problem is figuring out how to look at skin tones in a shot with many other colors. With the skin tons line in Premiere Pro, color correction becomes easy and quick. You only need to use a garbage matte, which is found under video effects then keying. Adjust the points so that they cover the skin of the person on the shot, then look at the Premiere Pro Vectorscope to see your end results.</p>

On the other hand, color grading is more like a supercharged version of color correction. It refers to altering a film so that it matches a tone or theme. Since the two, grading and correction are important, more video editing will use a combination of both.</p>
<h3 id="How-to-Read-a-Vectorscope-1"><a href="#How-to-Read-a-Vectorscope-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Read a Vectorscope"></a><strong>How to Read a Vectorscope</strong></h3><p>Learning how to read a Vectorscope will make your video editing fun and easier. The best way is to view the Vectorscope in relation to the color wheel. When using Premiere Vectorscope, the colors are nicely labeled for anyone to understand. You only need to understand the primary colors of saturation and hue to accurately read a Vectorscope.</p>

                      alt="reading vectorscope"
                ></p>
<p>The hue color is the direction to which the marketer points. For instance, a marker pointing toward the boxes labeled “R” indicates that the hue is predominantly red. On the other hand, the saturation correlates to the length of the marker. The image is more saturated when the marker is furthest from the center of the wheel.</p>
<p>Keep note of the two boxes in each main color. The box that is close to the center indicates 75%, and you will normally avoid the marker extending beyond this first box. Any marketer that extends beyond this is known as non-broadcast safe or illegal colors. Although you may need to go beyond the first box in some projects for stylistic reasons, the general rule of thumb is to avoid that.</p>
<p>Without proper calibration, your images may end up looking too red or too blue. They will not look natural at all and will affect the overall quality of your video. Therefore, using the features within the vectorsope will help you color-grade your images to perfection.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Vectorscope-in-Premiere-Pro-A-Brief-Guide-1"><a href="#Part-2-Vectorscope-in-Premiere-Pro-A-Brief-Guide-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Vectorscope in Premiere Pro: A Brief Guide"></a><strong>Part 2.</strong> <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html" >Vectorscope in Premiere Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>: A Brief Guide</strong></h2><p>Just like many other video editing software, Adobe Premiere Pro offers Vectorscope to help in post-production. The best way to look at Vectorscope in Premiere Pro is to use the Color Correction workspace. Once you have launched the software, Click Window, followed by Workspace, and then Color Correction. Access the reference monitor directly to deliver the program.</p>
<p>The reference monitor will first display composite video. Clicking on the setting icon allows you to access the panel and choose the video scope you want to use. Now, this is how you use the Vectorscope in Premiere Pro:</p>
<h3 id="1-Reading-a-Vectorscope-on-Premiere-Pro-1"><a href="#1-Reading-a-Vectorscope-on-Premiere-Pro-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Reading a Vectorscope on Premiere Pro"></a><strong>1. Reading a Vectorscope on Premiere Pro</strong></h3><p>A Vectorscope is similar to a color wheel. It displays colors in the same places as the wheel, with cyan to the bottom right and red to the top left. When you see a dot or line in the Vectorscope, you can tell it is giving you information about the color or chrominance of a shot. Essentially, this information is the hue (specific color) and the saturation (the strength of that hue).</p>

                      alt="color wheel"
                ></p>
<p>As you examine the Vectorscope, you get to see how strong a particular color is by the length of the line from the center of the wheel. A longer line indicates that the color is more saturated. However, all Vectorscopes have small color targets. The Vectorscope points are lined with a drop-down used to read the scope. The default is set to 75%, which is a good limit for a typical broadcast system.</p>

<h3 id="2-Adjusting-Skin-Tones-1"><a href="#2-Adjusting-Skin-Tones-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Adjusting Skin Tones"></a><strong>2. Adjusting Skin Tones</strong></h3><p>A commonly used feature of the Premier Pro Vectorscope is the Skin Tone Line. With this feature, you get the line on the scope between the Yellow and the Red sections at about 10.30 or 11 o’clock position.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="skin tones"
                ></p>
<p>The Vectorscope skin tone line represents the color of blood flowing through the skin. You can use this line to check the accuracy of skin tone color representation regardless of the ethnicity of the person you’re filming. In particular, video images are more accurate</p>
<p>The major problem is figuring out how to look at skin tones in a shot with many other colors. With the skin tons line in Premiere Pro, color correction becomes easy and quick. You only need to use a garbage matte, which is found under video effects then keying. Adjust the points so that they cover the skin of the person on the shot, then look at the Premiere Pro Vectorscope to see your end results.</p>

<h5 id="Step5-Animate-the-text-tile"><a href="#Step5-Animate-the-text-tile" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Animate the text tile"></a>Step5 Animate the text tile</h5><p>After adding text, it is time to animate it. This animation will decide how your text will appear behind the target object.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, you must open the text settings by <strong>double-clicking</strong> on the text tile in the timeline.</li>
<li>In the settings opened in the import window, you will have to click on the animation tab in the upper left corner, aside from the <strong>Preset</strong></li>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You may notice now that the text appears in front of our object. Don’t worry now! We are getting there. With a few simple steps, we will see the results.</p>
<p>Now let us move on to the more significant part of the editing, masking the object. Again, look ahead to see how you can mask the object!</p>
<h5 id="Step6-Mask-the-Object"><a href="#Step6-Mask-the-Object" class="headerlink" title="Step6 Mask the Object"></a>Step6 Mask the Object</h5><p>To mask our object, we will need to be technical. We will begin by adding the same footage of the static object on our timeline. Follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drag and drop the static object footage above the timeline text. Make sure the text stays in the middle of the sandwich.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-7.png"
                      alt="add the main video above the text tile"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>We will hide the video in the first track to simplify things. In addition, this will make our editing easier.</li>
<li>We will have to look in the effects library to insert the masking effect.</li>
<li>You can see the <strong>Effects</strong> icon on the bar at the top.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Effects</strong>.</li>
<li>You will see the search bar at the top of the import window.</li>
<li>In the search bar, type in Image mask.</li>
<li>Drag the <strong>Image mask</strong> effect on the video above the text tile.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now the masking effect has been added. But we would have to adjust so that it stays upon our object.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> on the video and the settings option will open up.</li>
<li>Go into the <strong>Effects</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You must select your target object’s mask shape exactly as its shape.</p>
<ul>
<li>We have to mask out a building, so that we will need a vertical rectangle.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="change the shape of the image mask"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>After you have selected the shape of your object, we will need to convert it to the object’s size so that it only masks the building.</li>
<li>To do that, scroll down below the import window to the settings.</li>
<li>Here you can see the X, Y, and width settings.</li>
<li>First, move the width bar so that it matches the width of the building.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="change the width of the mask"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Now drag the X bar until the mask is confined to the building. You would have created the mask only limited to the building.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="change the position of the mask by dragging x"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Once you complete this step, click OK in the bottom right corner.</li>
<li>Now un-hide the original video that you imported in the beginning.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, play the video in the main play window from the beginning.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="final result of the static video"
                ></p>
<p>You have successfully created a text behind the object effect. Now that you know how to add text behind static objects let us move to learn how to add text to a video that has high contrast and a clean background.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Now that you have added the text, it is time to animate it.</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Take-a-snapshot"><a href="#Step3-Take-a-snapshot" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Take a snapshot"></a>Step3 Take a snapshot</h5><p>After typing in the text, you will notice in the main play window that your text still appears in front of your object. Therefore, we want to take it behind the object. To do so, first, you will need to take a snapshot.</p>
<p>Follow the steps mentioned to take a snapshot:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hide the main video. You can see the Eye icon aside from your main video in the edit column on the left side of the timeline.</li>
<li>Click on the Eye icon to hide the main video.</li>
<li>In the <strong>main play</strong> window, you will notice that the screen turns black, which leaves only the text on the screen.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="taking a snapshot"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>In the main play screen, you can notice a small <strong>camera icon</strong>.</li>
<li>This camera icon is used to take snapshots of your screen.</li>
<li>Click on the camera icon to take a snapshot of your screen.</li>
<li>Your snapshot will now be saved in the main import window.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="snapshot is saved in the import library"
                ></p>
<p>Now that we have taken a snapshot, we will need to import it into the timeline. Scroll below for more.</p>
<h5 id="Step4-Add-the-snapshot"><a href="#Step4-Add-the-snapshot" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Add the snapshot"></a>Step4 Add the snapshot</h5><p>After taking it, your goal is to import it into the timeline. To perform this action, perform the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before adding the snapshot to the timeline, we must delete the main text tile.</li>
<li>Then drag and drop the snapshot from the import library into the timeline above the video.</li>
<li>Make sure that the snapshot is aligned well with the length of the video.</li>
<li>If it is <strong>longer</strong> than the video, drag it from the right to match the length of the video.</li>
<li>If its length is <strong>smaller</strong> than the video, drag it to the right to increase its length.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adjust the length of the snapshot"
                ></p>
<p>After adding the snapshot, we will have to change its blending mode.</p>
<h5 id="Step5-Change-the-blending-of-the-snapshot"><a href="#Step5-Change-the-blending-of-the-snapshot" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Change the blending of the snapshot"></a>Step5 Change the blending of the snapshot</h5><p>To create the effect of your text behind the video, you must alter the main text’s blending mode. In this case, it will be the snapshot we took.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Changing the blending mode of the snapshot will allow it to blend with the transparent background and will create the effect of the text behind the object in the video.</p>
<p>Follow the steps mentioned below to change the blending of the snapshot:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> the snapshot.</li>
<li>If you select the compositing tab, the blending options will pop up.</li>
<li>From default, it would be set to <strong>Normal</strong>. Click on the <strong>Normal</strong></li>
<li>It will show a drop-down option.</li>
<li>Scroll down below until you can see an option labeled Then click on <strong>Overlay.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="change the blending mode to overlay"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>And press <strong>OK</strong> in the bottom right corner to confirm your changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>The text can be blended with the background.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>Eye icon</strong> to un-hide the video from the timeline.</li>
<li>Now play the video from the start from the main play screen to see the final changes.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You may notice now that the text appears in front of our object. Don’t worry now! We are getting there. With a few simple steps, we will see the results.</p>
<p>Now let us move on to the more significant part of the editing, masking the object. Again, look ahead to see how you can mask the object!</p>
<h5 id="Step6-Mask-the-Object-1"><a href="#Step6-Mask-the-Object-1" class="headerlink" title="Step6 Mask the Object"></a>Step6 Mask the Object</h5><p>To mask our object, we will need to be technical. We will begin by adding the same footage of the static object on our timeline. Follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drag and drop the static object footage above the timeline text. Make sure the text stays in the middle of the sandwich.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-7.png"
                      alt="add the main video above the text tile"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>We will hide the video in the first track to simplify things. In addition, this will make our editing easier.</li>
<li>We will have to look in the effects library to insert the masking effect.</li>
<li>You can see the <strong>Effects</strong> icon on the bar at the top.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Effects</strong>.</li>
<li>You will see the search bar at the top of the import window.</li>
<li>In the search bar, type in Image mask.</li>
<li>Drag the <strong>Image mask</strong> effect on the video above the text tile.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now the masking effect has been added. But we would have to adjust so that it stays upon our object.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> on the video and the settings option will open up.</li>
<li>Go into the <strong>Effects</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You must select your target object’s mask shape exactly as its shape.</p>
<ul>
<li>We have to mask out a building, so that we will need a vertical rectangle.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="change the shape of the image mask"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>After you have selected the shape of your object, we will need to convert it to the object’s size so that it only masks the building.</li>
<li>To do that, scroll down below the import window to the settings.</li>
<li>Here you can see the X, Y, and width settings.</li>
<li>First, move the width bar so that it matches the width of the building.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="change the width of the mask"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Now drag the X bar until the mask is confined to the building. You would have created the mask only limited to the building.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="change the position of the mask by dragging x"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Once you complete this step, click OK in the bottom right corner.</li>
<li>Now un-hide the original video that you imported in the beginning.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, play the video in the main play window from the beginning.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="final result of the static video"
                ></p>
<p>You have successfully created a text behind the object effect. Now that you know how to add text behind static objects let us move to learn how to add text to a video that has high contrast and a clean background.</p>
<h3 id="Add-text-behind-a-high-contrast-and-clean-background-1"><a href="#Add-text-behind-a-high-contrast-and-clean-background-1" class="headerlink" title="Add text behind a high contrast and clean background"></a>Add text behind a high contrast and clean background</h3><p>Besides the text can be added behind a static object, it can also be added to a clean background with high contrast. But how is it? Let’s dive into it.</p>
<h5 id="Step1-Import-the-video-into-the-timeline-1"><a href="#Step1-Import-the-video-into-the-timeline-1" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Import the video into the timeline"></a>Step1 Import the video into the timeline</h5><ul>

<h5 id="Step2-Add-the-text-tile-1"><a href="#Step2-Add-the-text-tile-1" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Add the text tile"></a>Step2 Add the text tile</h5><p>To add the text to your video, follow the steps mentioned below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the titles icon on the bar above the import window.</li>
<li>On the left drop-down option, scroll down to the titles.</li>
<li>Select the Plain text option.</li>
<li>You will notice that multiple options will pop up in the import window.</li>
<li>Select the text title that suits you best.</li>
<li>After you have selected the text style, drag and drop it down above your video in the timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Our next step would be to add the text.</li>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> on the text tile. Doing so will open the settings menu in the import window.</li>
<li>Type in the text that you want. For reference, we will keep it simple such as, <strong>“Hello world.”</strong></li>
<li>You can also adjust the font of your text.</li>
<li>Above the type box, a drop-down option will show you the range of fonts available.</li>
<li>Select the font you desire.</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                      alt="type in the text"
                ></p>
<p>Now that you have added the text, it is time to animate it.</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Take-a-snapshot-1"><a href="#Step3-Take-a-snapshot-1" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Take a snapshot"></a>Step3 Take a snapshot</h5><p>After typing in the text, you will notice in the main play window that your text still appears in front of your object. Therefore, we want to take it behind the object. To do so, first, you will need to take a snapshot.</p>
<p>Follow the steps mentioned to take a snapshot:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hide the main video. You can see the Eye icon aside from your main video in the edit column on the left side of the timeline.</li>
<li>Click on the Eye icon to hide the main video.</li>
<li>In the <strong>main play</strong> window, you will notice that the screen turns black, which leaves only the text on the screen.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="taking a snapshot"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>In the main play screen, you can notice a small <strong>camera icon</strong>.</li>
<li>This camera icon is used to take snapshots of your screen.</li>
<li>Click on the camera icon to take a snapshot of your screen.</li>
<li>Your snapshot will now be saved in the main import window.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-16.png"
                      alt="snapshot is saved in the import library"
                ></p>
<p>Now that we have taken a snapshot, we will need to import it into the timeline. Scroll below for more.</p>
<h5 id="Step4-Add-the-snapshot-1"><a href="#Step4-Add-the-snapshot-1" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Add the snapshot"></a>Step4 Add the snapshot</h5><p>After taking it, your goal is to import it into the timeline. To perform this action, perform the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before adding the snapshot to the timeline, we must delete the main text tile.</li>
<li>Then drag and drop the snapshot from the import library into the timeline above the video.</li>
<li>Make sure that the snapshot is aligned well with the length of the video.</li>
<li>If it is <strong>longer</strong> than the video, drag it from the right to match the length of the video.</li>
<li>If its length is <strong>smaller</strong> than the video, drag it to the right to increase its length.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adjust the length of the snapshot"
                ></p>
<p>After adding the snapshot, we will have to change its blending mode.</p>
<h5 id="Step5-Change-the-blending-of-the-snapshot-1"><a href="#Step5-Change-the-blending-of-the-snapshot-1" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Change the blending of the snapshot"></a>Step5 Change the blending of the snapshot</h5><p>To create the effect of your text behind the video, you must alter the main text’s blending mode. In this case, it will be the snapshot we took.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Changing the blending mode of the snapshot will allow it to blend with the transparent background and will create the effect of the text behind the object in the video.</p>
<p>Follow the steps mentioned below to change the blending of the snapshot:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> the snapshot.</li>
<li>If you select the compositing tab, the blending options will pop up.</li>
<li>From default, it would be set to <strong>Normal</strong>. Click on the <strong>Normal</strong></li>
<li>It will show a drop-down option.</li>
<li>Scroll down below until you can see an option labeled Then click on <strong>Overlay.</strong></li>
</ul>

                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="change the blending mode to overlay"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>And press <strong>OK</strong> in the bottom right corner to confirm your changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>The text can be blended with the background.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>Eye icon</strong> to un-hide the video from the timeline.</li>
<li>Now play the video from the start from the main play screen to see the final changes.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p>It is best if you start by finding out what you want to say with your presentation. Then, select images that support your message, and finally, create slides that tell your story.</p>
<p>This process will save a lot of time and effort when it comes to creating slide shows for presentations.</p>

The default setting for the length of the slide show is 60 minutes, but it can be changed to any duration.</p>
<h2 id="●-Ending-Thoughts-→-7"><a href="#●-Ending-Thoughts-→-7" class="headerlink" title="● Ending Thoughts →"></a><strong>●</strong> Ending Thoughts <strong>→</strong></h2><p><strong>●</strong> Recorded slide show presentations are best to consider when one wishes to save the efforts of creating the same presentation again and again.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Filmora is one of the best video editing tools available to users for doing the editing in the recorded slideshow presentation if needed.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Recording a slideshow is relatively an easy task if one is aware of the right steps. But if there is a lack of knowledge, they will not be able to do it.</p>
