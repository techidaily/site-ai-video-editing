                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/play-video-vimeo-watch.jpg"

<li>Add “&#x2F;video&#x2F;“ after “vimeo.com”.</li>
<li>Add “?amp;loop&#x3D;1:” at the end of the URL.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, the initial URL of the video was “<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://vimeo.com/754255543" >https://vimeo.com/754255543 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>“.

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid GoPro Video Editor?</em></strong></p>
<p>You can choose free or paid softwares depending on your requirements and budget. If a free software meets your requirements then stay on it otherwise move towards a paid alternative. If you have a GoPro and you make videos just for fun then use a free and simple video editor. Even if you are an experienced video editor, I would recommend you to go for free video editors which I have mentioned above as they are quite powerful and professional software but if you are harvesting a good amount of money from this field then you can upgrade to pro versions of these free softwares or get a paid software from start. As almost all of these softwares are professional and can get your job done, so it’s better to choose one, which is comfortable for you to work on.</p>

<p>You can choose free or paid softwares depending on your requirements and budget. If a free software meets your requirements then stay on it otherwise move towards a paid alternative.

Even if you are an experienced video editor, I would recommend you to go for free video editors which I have mentioned above as they are quite powerful and professional software but if you are harvesting a good amount of money from this field then you can upgrade to pro versions of these free softwares or get a paid software from start. As almost all of these softwares are professional and can get your job done, so it’s better to choose one, which is comfortable for you to work on.</p>

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid GoPro Video Editor?</em></strong></p>
<p>You can choose free or paid softwares depending on your requirements and budget. If a free software meets your requirements then stay on it otherwise move towards a paid alternative. If you have a GoPro and you make videos just for fun then use a free and simple video editor. Even if you are an experienced video editor, I would recommend you to go for free video editors which I have mentioned above as they are quite powerful and professional software but if you are harvesting a good amount of money from this field then you can upgrade to pro versions of these free softwares or get a paid software from start. As almost all of these softwares are professional and can get your job done, so it’s better to choose one, which is comfortable for you to work on.</p>

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid GoPro Video Editor?</em></strong></p>
<p>You can choose free or paid softwares depending on your requirements and budget. If a free software meets your requirements then stay on it otherwise move towards a paid alternative. If you have a GoPro and you make videos just for fun then use a free and simple video editor. Even if you are an experienced video editor, I would recommend you to go for free video editors which I have mentioned above as they are quite powerful and professional software but if you are harvesting a good amount of money from this field then you can upgrade to pro versions of these free softwares or get a paid software from start. As almost all of these softwares are professional and can get your job done, so it’s better to choose one, which is comfortable for you to work on.</p>
<p>FAQs about GoPro Video Editing:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) Does GoPro has its own video editor?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, GoPro has its own video editor “Quik”. It is available on mobile phones and desktops both. It is simple and easy to use. It provides basic features to edit your video. But the main disadvantage of this desktop software is that it supports only GoPro videos, you can’t import files from other devices. Although this isn’t the issue with Quik mobile app, here you can import videos from other devices also.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) Can I make videos for social media with a GoPro?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>It was basically made for recording sports and action videos. But as the market is revolutionized and new models are released it has covered a wide range of the video industry like vlogging, travel and cooking videos e.t.c. As new models of GoPros are waterproof, you can get some amazing underwater shots for your Instagram.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) What is GoPro media format?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>GoPro export files in popular file format MP4. MP4 is the most common file format and is supported by almost all the video editors. While it is efficient and takes less storage but isn’t supported in many devices.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) How do I transfer files from my GoPro to Mac?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p> You can transfer your GoPro files through 3 methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eject the SD card from your GoPro and connect it to your Mac using a SD card adapter to transfer files.</li>
<li>Connect your GoPro to Mac through USB connector and use “iphoto” or any other photo importer to import files.</li>

For this purpose, the Audio Visualizer as a resource on <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a high-quality option. With this feature, users can typically add audio effects to their video soundtrack with AI technology, aligning the sound properly with the video.</p>
<p>It is possible to choose out of 25 different effects for audio visualization on this software for customized audio effects. You can also drag visual-based effects to the file, which the software mechanism will automatically configure with the sound cohesively.</p>
<p>While this is useful as a functionality, users naturally have concerns about how to handle the Audio Visualization effect to work on video projects and podcasts. Let’s learn the main steps for this process in this post, explained stage by stage in detail.</p>
<h2 id="Launch-the-App"><a href="#Launch-the-App" class="headerlink" title="Launch the App"></a>Launch the App</h2><p>The first step is downloading and installing the software into your device. For this, go to the official website of Wondershare Filmora 11 and click on the Free Download button at the top of the screen. Depending on your device’s operating system, i.e., macOS or Windows, the relevant software installer will download automatically into your device.</p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p>

                      alt="relevant software installer will download"
                ></p>
<p>You must click on the installed APK file and double-click the Agree button for the process to continue. After you carry out the instructions that appear, the software will begin installing into your device. Wait for the software to install completely, and then the main homepage will open automatically on your screen.</p>

                      alt="the homepage will open automatically"
                ></p>
<p>Make sure that the software is in the 11.3.0 or higher version. Because the feature for audio visualization will not work on any of the older software versions. So, if you have the Filmora9 software, upgrade it to the Wondershare Filmora 11.</p>

                ></p>
<p>After that, you must drag the visualizer effect selected from the collection to the editing timeline above the background image you added previously. Again, use the slider on the clip to drag it forward and fit the size of both the music clip and the image.</p>
<h2 id="Edit-the-Audio-Visualiser"><a href="#Edit-the-Audio-Visualiser" class="headerlink" title="Edit the Audio Visualiser"></a>Edit the Audio Visualiser</h2><p>The next step of the process that you must focus on is editing the audio visualizer properly for the song and its background cover. For this, you must double-click on the audio visualizer effect you dropped in the timeline- this will open the editing window for the clip.</p>
<p>Here, make some changes to the quality of the audio visualizer as you prefer. Adjustment options available here include position, scale, Opacity, and Intensity. Drag the sliders for them to adjust the visualizer effect as needed. Change the color of the visualizer as well from here, and then use the slider on the visualizer effect on the timeline to see the effect change. Press the OK button after you are done.</p>

<p>You must click on the installed APK file and double-click the Agree button for the process to continue. After you carry out the instructions that appear, the software will begin installing into your device. Wait for the software to install completely, and then the main homepage will open automatically on your screen.</p>

                      alt="the homepage will open automatically"
                ></p>
<p>Make sure that the software is in the 11.3.0 or higher version. Because the feature for audio visualization will not work on any of the older software versions. So, if you have the Filmora9 software, upgrade it to the Wondershare Filmora 11.</p>

<h2 id="Add-the-music-file-1"><a href="#Add-the-music-file-1" class="headerlink" title="Add the music file"></a>Add the music file</h2><p>Next, you should click on the “Create New Project” button from the homepage. Then, tap on the “Click here to import media” section when it opens and add the file to the software window from your internal storage.</p>
<p>You can also click on the My Media tab and choose Project Media. Go to All Templates and download the audio track you will make changes to. Then, drag the audio file you have imported down to the editor timeline. Add a stock image from your Stock Media section.</p>

                      alt="drag the audio file"
                ></p>
<p>You can also add another pre-made background cover image that you created beforehand from the device, if available. Drag that to the editor timeline as well above the song clip you moved there and tap on the slider. Pull the slider to fit the full size of the audio length for the background alignment. Right-click on the file, and the editing window will open for basic video editing. Make changes like adjusting the Scale, Position, Opacity, etc. Press OK.</p>

<h2 id="Add-the-Audio-Visualizer-Effects-1"><a href="#Add-the-Audio-Visualizer-Effects-1" class="headerlink" title="Add the Audio Visualizer Effects"></a>Add the Audio Visualizer Effects</h2><p>Next, you should go to the Effects tab. When this window opens, you should tap on the Filmstock tab beside the Default one for advanced features like Audio Visualizer. Click on it next.</p>
<p>When you tap on it, you see a list of different visualizer effects in a collection. Please choose one of them that you prefer and download it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="tap on the filmstock tab"
                ></p>
<p>After that, you must drag the visualizer effect selected from the collection to the editing timeline above the background image you added previously. Again, use the slider on the clip to drag it forward and fit the size of both the music clip and the image.</p>
<h2 id="Edit-the-Audio-Visualiser-1"><a href="#Edit-the-Audio-Visualiser-1" class="headerlink" title="Edit the Audio Visualiser"></a>Edit the Audio Visualiser</h2><p>The next step of the process that you must focus on is editing the audio visualizer properly for the song and its background cover. For this, you must double-click on the audio visualizer effect you dropped in the timeline- this will open the editing window for the clip.</p>
<p>Here, make some changes to the quality of the audio visualizer as you prefer. Adjustment options available here include position, scale, Opacity, and Intensity. Drag the sliders for them to adjust the visualizer effect as needed. Change the color of the visualizer as well from here, and then use the slider on the visualizer effect on the timeline to see the effect change. Press the OK button after you are done.</p>
<p><img

<h2 id="Add-the-Portrait-Image-1"><a href="#Add-the-Portrait-Image-1" class="headerlink" title="Add the Portrait Image"></a>Add the Portrait Image</h2><p>Go to the My Media tab next to get the Portrait image into the project. If you previously imported the image to Filmora, drag it to the timeline. Or, you can add it later by clicking on the Import Media button and adding the Portrait photo from your device.</p>
<p>When it is available on the media window, hold, drag, and then drop it above the visualizer. Like in the case of the previous parts, use the slider end of this image in the timeline to drag it and fit the size of the other clips.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="adding the portrait image"
                ></p>
<p>Next, the editing window for that will open. Make changes to the size and placement of the portrait photo, with elements like scale, position, rotation, opacity, etc. Move the photo in the preview window to the section where you want the image to appear. Then, tap the OK button under the window.</p>

<h2 id="Add-the-overlapping-visualizer-effect-1"><a href="#Add-the-overlapping-visualizer-effect-1" class="headerlink" title="Add the overlapping visualizer effect"></a>Add the overlapping visualizer effect</h2><p>After adding the portrait, you can add another audio visualizer effect to the project. For this, again, tap on the Effects tab and choose the Filmstock option. Select Audio Visualizer and click on the circular visualizer effect from the list. Repeat the dragging and dropping step for this effect as well.</p>
<p>On the timeline, you have to adjust the visualizer effect over the portrait photo to match the length of the previous clips. Then, please tap on the portrait photo in the timeline again and adjust its appearance, like reducing the image size to fit the second visualizer effect size.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="reduce size of image"
                ></p>
<p>After fitting the image within the visualizer, click on the Mask tab in the same editor window. Choose the circular shape preset and scroll down to find the adjustment parameters like position, scaling, horizontal&#x2F;vertical lining, etc. Keep making the changes per your needs, like fitting the image to the same size as the circular visualizer.</p>
<p>Move it to place the image inside the visualizer. After you are done, press the OK button.</p>
<h2 id="Add-a-Title-1"><a href="#Add-a-Title-1" class="headerlink" title="Add a Title"></a>Add a Title</h2><p>An attractive title is the next element you should add to the project. You have to click on the Titles tab from the top toolbar. Choose the titles option from the drop-down list and move it to the timeline below. As you did with the previous elements you added to the timeline, move the slider onward and fit it with the previous one’s length.</p>
<p>Next, you should click on the Title in the timeline you added for the Title editing window to open. Here, you have to tap on the Advanced button.</p>

                      alt="tap on the advanced button"
                ></p>
<p>In the next window that opens, tap on the Customize tab and add the song name in the title area. Make other font-related changes as you see fit, like the font size, font style, indentation, color, etc. Tap on the add text icon in this window to get another text field in which you can add the artist’s name. Make sure to reduce the size of it to lower than that of the main song title text.</p>

                      alt="tap on the add text icon"
                ></p>
<p>Following that, you can tap on the shape icon to add a shape to the project by adding the name of the streaming service provider, like Apple Music or Spotify. Choose the Rectangle option, for example, and move it to the side of the screen. Click on the shape editing option and adjust the border size of it to three.</p>
<p>If you want to create a rounded-off edge look to the rectangle shape, tap on the small yellow icon that you will see at its edge. Move it slightly to adjust. Then, type the information into the shape text field, like “Listen on Spotify,” and make font and shape size adjustments. After you have completed this step, press the OK button below.</p>
<h2 id="Check-and-Export-1"><a href="#Check-and-Export-1" class="headerlink" title="Check and Export"></a>Check and Export</h2><p>After making the changes, you will return to the main editor timeline. Press the play button under the preview window to see how the final project looks, and tap on the Export button to download it offline. Make changes to the exporting file after clicking on the Local tab and choosing the file format you will download it as. Then, press Export again.</p>
