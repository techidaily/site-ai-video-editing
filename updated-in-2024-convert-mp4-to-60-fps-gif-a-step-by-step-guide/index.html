They are widely used on social media platforms and messaging apps, making it easy to share moments, reactions, and emotions with friends and family. But not all GIFs are created equal. Some GIFs can look choppy and low-quality, detracting from the viewing experience.</p>
<p>To improve the quality of your GIFs, you can convert your MP4 videos to 60 FPS (frames per second). This will give your GIFs a smooth, fluid motion that looks professional and visually appealing. In this article, we’ll go over the steps you need to follow to convert your MP4 videos to 60 FPS GIFs and create high-quality GIFs that are perfect for sharing online.</p>

<h2 id="Why-Convert-MP4-to-60-FPS-GIF"><a href="#Why-Convert-MP4-to-60-FPS-GIF" class="headerlink" title="Why Convert MP4 to 60-FPS GIF?"></a>Why Convert MP4 to 60-FPS GIF?</h2><p>GIFs are a great way to share short, eye-catching videos online, but not all are made the same. GIFs with low frame rates tend to look choppy, and the motion could be smoother, making the video look unprofessional and detracting from the overall viewing experience. On the other hand, GIFs with higher frame rates look smoother, and the motion is more fluid, making the video more visually appealing.</p>
<p>Converting your MP4 videos to GIFs has several benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Smoother Motion:</strong> By converting MP4s to GIFs, you increase the frame rate of your GIFs, giving them a smoother and more fluid motion.</li>
<li><strong>Increased Detail:</strong> Higher frame rates allow for more detail and clarity in fast-moving scenes, making the video more engaging and easier to watch.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced Ghosting:</strong> A higher frame rate reduces the “ghosting” effect in low-frame rate GIFs, making the video clearer and reducing distractions.</li>
<li><strong>High-Quality Videos:</strong> Converting MP4s to GIFs eliminates the ghosting effect and creates high-quality GIFs that are perfect for sharing online.</li>
<li><strong>Increased Engagement:</strong> High-quality GIFs will engage and entertain your audience, making them more likely to share and interact with your content.</li>
</ul>
<p>Converting MP4s to GIFs is a great way to improve the overall quality of your GIFs and create visually appealing videos that are perfect for sharing online. Whether you’re sharing a reaction, a moment, or an emotion, a high-quality GIF will engage and entertain your audience.</p>

<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>GIFs are an image format designed to display simple animations. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF" >GIF files store delay time between frames <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> which is defined as multiples of 1&#x2F;100th of a second. Value 1 would give you 100 FPS; value 2 would already have half of 100 FPS, that is, 50 FPS; value 3 would give you 33.3 FPS GIF, etc. So there are 20 FPS GIFs, 33.3 FPS GIFs, 50 FPS GIFs, and 100 FPS GIFs.</p>
<p>In addition, many websites or programs (including Google Chrome) ignore value 1 (100 FPS GIFs) and default to a much slower animation speed when viewing GIF files. Therefore, 100 FPS GIFs are technically possible but are rarely used. Value 2 (50 FPS) is the most you can get.</p>
<p>If you want to create high-quality animations, consider using MP4s or alternative image formats better suited for high frame rates and detailed animations.</p>
<p>That being said, some websites may have a “60 FPS GIFs” category, but it’s important to understand that most of the content in these categories is not 60 FPS. Instead, it’s likely to be either an MP4 video or a GIF with a lower frame rate, like 50 FPS, labeled as “60 FPS” for marketing purposes.</p>
<h2 id="Is-There-Any-60-FPS-GIF-Maker"><a href="#Is-There-Any-60-FPS-GIF-Maker" class="headerlink" title="Is There Any 60 FPS GIF Maker?"></a>Is There Any 60 FPS GIF Maker?</h2><p>Unfortunately, there is no such thing as a 60 FPS GIF maker. As mentioned before, there is no 60 FPS GIF, so it is impossible to create a 60 FPS GIF using traditional methods. However, many excellent video-to-GIF converters in the market allow you to set the GIF frame rate.</p>
<p>These video-to-GIF converters allow you to convert MP4 videos to GIFs with a higher frame rate, which can give your GIFs a smoother and more fluid motion. While these GIFs may not be 60 FPS, they can still provide a significant quality improvement compared to traditional GIFs.</p>

<h2 id="People-Also-Ask"><a href="#People-Also-Ask" class="headerlink" title="People Also Ask"></a>People Also Ask</h2><p>Here are some of the most frequently asked questions about converting MP4 to GIF and other related topics:</p>
<h4 id="Q1-Can-a-GIF-be-30-FPS"><a href="#Q1-Can-a-GIF-be-30-FPS" class="headerlink" title="Q1. Can a GIF be 30 FPS?"></a>Q1. Can a GIF be 30 FPS?</h4><p>It is impossible to get an exact 30 FPS GIF. Frame rate refers to the number of images (frames) displayed per second in a video or animation. That frame rate is stored as an integer (n) that defines n&#x2F;100ths of a second. So you can specify a frame of 1&#x2F;100 second (100 FPS), 2&#x2F;100 second (50 FPS), 3&#x2F;100 second (33.33 FPS), 4&#x2F;100 second (25 FPS), etc. but not something like 3.3333…&#x2F;100 second (30 FPS).</p>
<h4 id="Q2-How-Do-I-Get-the-FPS-of-a-GIF"><a href="#Q2-How-Do-I-Get-the-FPS-of-a-GIF" class="headerlink" title="Q2. How Do I Get the FPS of a GIF?"></a>Q2. How Do I Get the FPS of a GIF?</h4><p>To determine the speed or frame rate of a GIF, you can use online tools that show the delay time between its frames in milliseconds. The frame rate of a GIF is calculated by counting how many delays fit in 1 second of animation. The delay time determines the playback speed and can be adjusted to increase or decrease the frame rate. These tools also allow you to preview the speed changes and compare the input and output GIFs.</p>
<h4 id="Q3-What-FPS-Should-a-GIF-Be"><a href="#Q3-What-FPS-Should-a-GIF-Be" class="headerlink" title="Q3. What FPS Should a GIF Be?"></a>Q3. What FPS Should a GIF Be?</h4><p>GIF files store delay time between frames in whole hundredths of a second. They typically run between 10 and 100 frames per second (FPS). The common frame rate for a GIF is 10 FPS, 20 FPS, 12.5 FPS, 25 FPS, and 50 FPS. With online tools, it’s possible to determine and change the speed of a GIF.</p>
<h4 id="Q4-What-Is-the-Max-FPS-for-a-GIF"><a href="#Q4-What-Is-the-Max-FPS-for-a-GIF" class="headerlink" title="Q4. What Is the Max FPS for a GIF?"></a>Q4. What Is the Max FPS for a GIF?</h4><p>The maximum fps for a GIF is 100 FPS, but browsers or consumer screens do not support it. The browser-engine image decoders will automatically reduce the framerate to 10 fps, playing it ten times slower. If a GIF appears slow, the browser has reset the speed to 10 fps. Some software and devices may support higher frame rates.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>GIF is a popular format for short animations and videos. The frame rate of a GIF determines its playback speed, which is usually set at 10, 20, 12.5, 25, and 50 per second. However, the highest possible frame rate that can be represented in the GIF format is 100 FPS, but most browsers and consumer screens cannot display it accurately.</p>
<p>There are various tools available, both online and desktop-based, that can convert videos to GIFs and adjust their frame rate as desired. With these tools, you can create high-quality, personalized GIFs that fit your specific needs and preferences.</p>

What FPS Should a GIF Be?</h4><p>GIF files store delay time between frames in whole hundredths of a second. They typically run between 10 and 100 frames per second (FPS). The common frame rate for a GIF is 10 FPS, 20 FPS, 12.5 FPS, 25 FPS, and 50 FPS. With online tools, it’s possible to determine and change the speed of a GIF.</p>
<h4 id="Q4-What-Is-the-Max-FPS-for-a-GIF-1"><a href="#Q4-What-Is-the-Max-FPS-for-a-GIF-1" class="headerlink" title="Q4. What Is the Max FPS for a GIF?"></a>Q4. What Is the Max FPS for a GIF?</h4><p>The maximum fps for a GIF is 100 FPS, but browsers or consumer screens do not support it. The browser-engine image decoders will automatically reduce the framerate to 10 fps, playing it ten times slower. If a GIF appears slow, the browser has reset the speed to 10 fps. Some software and devices may support higher frame rates.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>GIF is a popular format for short animations and videos. The frame rate of a GIF determines its playback speed, which is usually set at 10, 20, 12.5, 25, and 50 per second. However, the highest possible frame rate that can be represented in the GIF format is 100 FPS, but most browsers and consumer screens cannot display it accurately.</p>
<p>There are various tools available, both online and desktop-based, that can convert videos to GIFs and adjust their frame rate as desired. With these tools, you can create high-quality, personalized GIFs that fit your specific needs and preferences.</p>

In After Effects, this tool adds an invisible layer that is used to mask or reveal parts of a layer, including video, graphics, text, shapes, and images. This feature is in the arsenal of any visual effects artist or motion graphic designer.</p>
<p>For After Effects editors, <strong>Track Mattes</strong> can be an incredibly helpful tool for managing multiple layers and creating complex animations.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about <strong>Track Mattes</strong>. We’ll cover topics like the difference between a mask and Track Matte, finding this tool in After Effects, and its four options: Alpha Matter, Alpha Inverted Matte, Luma Matte, and Luma Inverted Matte.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#part4-1">Alpha Matte</a></li>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-Are-Track-Mattes-In-After-Effects"><a href="#Part-1-What-Are-Track-Mattes-In-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Are Track Mattes In After Effects?"></a>Part 1. What Are Track Mattes In After Effects?</h2><p>A Track Matte is an element used in video editing to control the opacity of a layer. Essentially, it lets you create a “hole” in a layer so that underlying layers can show through. This tool can be used with video and audio layers, which is essential for creating complex composites in After Effects.</p>
<p>You can use Track Mattes to generate shapes, reveal part of a layer, or keying outs. Interestingly, it remains independent of all layers in your projects, which means you can get visual effects and animations more efficiently than with the masks tool.</p>
<p>Moreover, Track Mattes uses Alpha or Luma channels as a layer mask to determine what parts of the layer to reveal. For instance, you can make a top layer that provides an Alpha or Luminous effect and a bottom layer consisting of the image that will be revealed or shown.</p>
<p>Thus, if you want to use an image to hide your video until you want to unveil it or add a picture in your text, Track Mattes will help you to shape the appearance of a layer above it.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Differences-Between-A-Mask-And-A-Track-Matte"><a href="#Part-2-Differences-Between-A-Mask-And-A-Track-Matte" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Differences Between A Mask And A Track Matte"></a>Part 2. Differences Between A Mask And A Track Matte</h2><p>In Adobe After Effects, there are two types of masking tools: Masks and Track Mattes. Both are used to hide or reveal a portion of a layer.</p>
<p>Here’re some key differences between a Mask and a Track Matte:</p>
<ol>
<li>A mask is dependent on a specific layer, while the Track Matter is independent of any layer.</li>
<li>A mask is applied directly to a layer having an image or a video and transforms with the layers. On the other hand, Track Matte is a stationary mask applied to the composition rather than a layer.</li>

Finding The Track Matte Tool In After Effects</h2><p>Track Matte is located by default in the Timeline Window of the After Effects interface, but if it is unavailable there for some reason, toggle the <strong>Transfer Control Pane</strong> button on the bottom-left of the timeline.</p>

<p>Under Track Matte’s drop-down menu, you can find four further options, two with Alpha and two with Luma. We’ll discuss these options in detail in the next section.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-All-Four-Track-Matte-Options-In-After-Effects"><a href="#Part-4-All-Four-Track-Matte-Options-In-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. All Four Track Matte Options In After Effects"></a>Part 4. All Four Track Matte Options In After Effects</h2><p>After Effects provides four types of Track Matte options: Alpha Matte, Alpha Inverted Matte, Luma Matte, and Luma Inverted Matte, each has its own specific use case. But first, you need to understand what Alpha and Luma are:</p>
<p><strong>Alpha:</strong> This Track Matte type uses the layer’s Alpha channel to determine the layer’s opacity.</p>
<p><strong>Luma:</strong> This Track Matte type uses the top layer’s brightness to mask the bottom layer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/the-four-track-matte-options-in-after-effects.png"
                      alt="the four track matte options in after effects"
                ></p>
<p>Let’s find out the functions of each option one by one:</p>
<h3 id="Alpha-Matte"><a href="#Alpha-Matte" class="headerlink" title="Alpha Matte"></a>Alpha Matte</h3><p>Alpha Matte is an important option under the Track Matte menu, as it allows you to create a mask based on the transparency of the layer you are using it on. Like the mask, it will use any pixel above 0% opacity and can be useful for various purposes, such as creating a vignette or isolating a certain area of the frame.</p>
<h3 id="Alpha-Inverted-Matte"><a href="#Alpha-Inverted-Matte" class="headerlink" title="Alpha Inverted Matte"></a>Alpha Inverted Matte</h3><p>The Alpha Inverted Matte option is quite the opposite of the Alpha Matte, and around the Alpha channel, it uses negative space from the above layer and will therefore use pixels with 0% opacity as it had 100% opacity.</p>
<h3 id="Luma-Matte"><a href="#Luma-Matte" class="headerlink" title="Luma Matte"></a>Luma Matte</h3><p>Instead of using the Alpha channel, Luma Mattes uses the brightness level or Luma channel of the upper layer to create a mask for the bottom layer.</p>
<h3 id="Luma-Inverted-Matte"><a href="#Luma-Inverted-Matte" class="headerlink" title="Luma Inverted Matte"></a>Luma Inverted Matte</h3><p>Opposite of the Luma Matte, the Luma Inverted Matte uses dark or low luminance areas of the upper layer to create a mask for the lower layer.</p>
<h3 id="Differences-Between-Alpha-Channel-and-Luma-Channel"><a href="#Differences-Between-Alpha-Channel-and-Luma-Channel" class="headerlink" title="Differences Between Alpha Channel and Luma Channel"></a>Differences Between Alpha Channel and Luma Channel</h3><p>When altering the opacity of a layer, it may look like the brightness settings are changed. This might confuse some users, as both Alpha and Luma channels carry the same information. However, they differ in how they are used.</p>
<p>Alpha channel is a type of Track Matte that stores transparency information. This information determines how opaque or transparent a layer will be when superimposed over another layer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="alpha channel in track matte"
                ></p>
<p>On the other hand, a Luma channel is a video track that stores brightness information. This information is used to determine how bright or dark an image will be and is further divided into three channels, i.e., Red, Green, and Blue (RGB). Their value ranges from 0 to 255, where 0 represents the darkest value while 255 represents the brightest value.</p>

<p>Part 1. What Are Track Mattes In After Effects?</p>
<p>A Track Matte is an element used in video editing to control the opacity of a layer. Essentially, it lets you create a “hole” in a layer so that underlying layers can show through. This tool can be used with video and audio layers, which is essential for creating complex composites in After Effects.</p>
<p>You can use Track Mattes to generate shapes, reveal part of a layer, or keying outs. Interestingly, it remains independent of all layers in your projects, which means you can get visual effects and animations more efficiently than with the masks tool.</p>
<p>Moreover, Track Mattes uses Alpha or Luma channels as a layer mask to determine what parts of the layer to reveal. For instance, you can make a top layer that provides an Alpha or Luminous effect and a bottom layer consisting of the image that will be revealed or shown.</p>
<p>Thus, if you want to use an image to hide your video until you want to unveil it or add a picture in your text, Track Mattes will help you to shape the appearance of a layer above it.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Differences-Between-A-Mask-And-A-Track-Matte-1"><a href="#Part-2-Differences-Between-A-Mask-And-A-Track-Matte-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Differences Between A Mask And A Track Matte"></a>Part 2. Differences Between A Mask And A Track Matte</h2><p>In Adobe After Effects, there are two types of masking tools: Masks and Track Mattes. Both are used to hide or reveal a portion of a layer.</p>
<p>Here’re some key differences between a Mask and a Track Matte:</p>
<ol>
<li>A mask is dependent on a specific layer, while the Track Matter is independent of any layer.</li>
<li>A mask is applied directly to a layer having an image or a video and transforms with the layers. On the other hand, Track Matte is a stationary mask applied to the composition rather than a layer.</li>
</ol>

Finding The Track Matte Tool In After Effects"></a>Part 3. Finding The Track Matte Tool In After Effects</h2><p>Track Matte is located by default in the Timeline Window of the After Effects interface, but if it is unavailable there for some reason, toggle the <strong>Transfer Control Pane</strong> button on the bottom-left of the timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="track matte in the timeline window of the after effects"
                ></p>
<p>If you are still unable to find the Track Matte option, press the <strong>F1 key</strong> or do the following steps in sequence:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click on the area above your layers and select <strong>“Columns.”</strong></li>
<li>Scroll down and click the <strong>“Modes”</strong> option to enable it.</li>
</ol>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="finding the track matte option in after effects"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Track Matte mode, Preserve Underlying Transparency,</strong> and <strong>Blending Modes</strong> will be available now.</li>
</ol>
<p>Under Track Matte’s drop-down menu, you can find four further options, two with Alpha and two with Luma. We’ll discuss these options in detail in the next section.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-All-Four-Track-Matte-Options-In-After-Effects-1"><a href="#Part-4-All-Four-Track-Matte-Options-In-After-Effects-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. All Four Track Matte Options In After Effects"></a>Part 4. All Four Track Matte Options In After Effects</h2><p>After Effects provides four types of Track Matte options: Alpha Matte, Alpha Inverted Matte, Luma Matte, and Luma Inverted Matte, each has its own specific use case. But first, you need to understand what Alpha and Luma are:</p>
<p><strong>Alpha:</strong> This Track Matte type uses the layer’s Alpha channel to determine the layer’s opacity.</p>
<p><strong>Luma:</strong> This Track Matte type uses the top layer’s brightness to mask the bottom layer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/the-four-track-matte-options-in-after-effects.png"
                      alt="the four track matte options in after effects"
                ></p>
<p>Let’s find out the functions of each option one by one:</p>
<h3 id="Alpha-Matte-1"><a href="#Alpha-Matte-1" class="headerlink" title="Alpha Matte"></a>Alpha Matte</h3><p>Alpha Matte is an important option under the Track Matte menu, as it allows you to create a mask based on the transparency of the layer you are using it on. Like the mask, it will use any pixel above 0% opacity and can be useful for various purposes, such as creating a vignette or isolating a certain area of the frame.</p>
<h3 id="Alpha-Inverted-Matte-1"><a href="#Alpha-Inverted-Matte-1" class="headerlink" title="Alpha Inverted Matte"></a>Alpha Inverted Matte</h3><p>The Alpha Inverted Matte option is quite the opposite of the Alpha Matte, and around the Alpha channel, it uses negative space from the above layer and will therefore use pixels with 0% opacity as it had 100% opacity.</p>
<h3 id="Luma-Matte-1"><a href="#Luma-Matte-1" class="headerlink" title="Luma Matte"></a>Luma Matte</h3><p>Instead of using the Alpha channel, Luma Mattes uses the brightness level or Luma channel of the upper layer to create a mask for the bottom layer.</p>
<h3 id="Luma-Inverted-Matte-1"><a href="#Luma-Inverted-Matte-1" class="headerlink" title="Luma Inverted Matte"></a>Luma Inverted Matte</h3><p>Opposite of the Luma Matte, the Luma Inverted Matte uses dark or low luminance areas of the upper layer to create a mask for the lower layer.</p>
<h3 id="Differences-Between-Alpha-Channel-and-Luma-Channel-1"><a href="#Differences-Between-Alpha-Channel-and-Luma-Channel-1" class="headerlink" title="Differences Between Alpha Channel and Luma Channel"></a>Differences Between Alpha Channel and Luma Channel</h3><p>When altering the opacity of a layer, it may look like the brightness settings are changed. This might confuse some users, as both Alpha and Luma channels carry the same information. However, they differ in how they are used.</p>
<p>Alpha channel is a type of Track Matte that stores transparency information. This information determines how opaque or transparent a layer will be when superimposed over another layer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="alpha channel in track matte"
                ></p>
<p>On the other hand, a Luma channel is a video track that stores brightness information. This information is used to determine how bright or dark an image will be and is further divided into three channels, i.e., Red, Green, and Blue (RGB). Their value ranges from 0 to 255, where 0 represents the darkest value while 255 represents the brightest value.</p>
