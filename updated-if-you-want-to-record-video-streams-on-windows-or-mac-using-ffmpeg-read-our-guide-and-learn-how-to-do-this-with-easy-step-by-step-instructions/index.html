Many of these features are exposed through FFmpeg’s command line interface but can also be accessed from the program’s Python bindings and its Qt GUI frontend, called QFFMpeg.</p>
<p>This article will explain using FFmpeg command line tools to record video streams on Windows and Mac computers with step-by-step examples and screenshots.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-FFmpeg"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-FFmpeg" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is FFmpeg?"></a>Part 1. What is FFmpeg?</h2><p>FFmpeg stands for “FF Multi-Platform Executable” and was originally developed by Fabrice Bellard in the year 2000 as an extension of the MPlayer project. The sole purpose of the software command-line design is to provide a complete solution for users to record live streams (audio and&#x2F;or video) from any type of device that supports either the RTSP or HTTP streaming protocols.</p>
<p>FFmpeg is a complete, cross-platform solution to record, convert, mix, and edit audio and video files. The software has over 250 input formats, which allows users to <strong>record video streams</strong> in any media format. The FFmpeg commands stream the video back after recording, convert it into MP4 or MKV file, and process incoming data on the fly, such as rtmpdump.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Record-a-Video-Stream-With-FFmpeg-on-Windows"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Record-a-Video-Stream-With-FFmpeg-on-Windows" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Record a Video Stream With FFmpeg on Windows?"></a>Part 2. How to Record a Video Stream With FFmpeg on Windows?</h2><p>The free FFmpeg command line tool is a great way to record a live internet stream and listen back to it later. If you have a Windows PC and want to record a video stream or screen using FFmpeg, our following step-by-step method will help you go through this process without facing many difficulties.</p>
<p>Step1 First, launch a browser of your choice on your Windows PC and head to the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-windows" >FFmpeg <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> website. Hover over the Windows icon in the middle pane and select either the <strong>gyan.dev</strong> or <strong>BTbn</strong> build.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/downloading-ffmpeg-on-windows.png"
                      alt="downloading ffmpeg on windows"
                ></p>
<p>On the next screen, select the latest <strong>Windows 64-bit</strong> file from the list. Why? You need to use a computer compatible with the Windows 64-bit version. Next, download the ZIP file on your PC and use ZIP file extraction software to open the file contents.</p>
<p>Step2 Locate the <strong>ffmpeg.exe</strong> file on the extracted file and copy it to a new folder on your computer hard drive (e.g., C:\VideoRecorder).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/extracting-ffmpeg-files-on-windows-pc.png"
                      alt="extracting ffmpeg files on windows pc"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 In the next step, click the <strong>Start</strong> icon on your Windows dashboard and type <strong>cmd</strong> in the search box. Right-click on Command Prompt, select <strong>“Run as Administrator,”</strong> and launch the program.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/launching-command-prompt.png"
                      alt="launching command prompt"
                ></p>
<p>Now, write the command to select the FFmpeg directory. For example, cd <strong>C:\VideoRecorder</strong>, and hit the <strong>“Enter”</strong> key.</p>
<p>Step4 To start recording the video stream, simply call FFmpeg and use the following command line. In this case, we are taking the example of capturing a YouTube video of “Running up that hill” from the top-rated TV show Stranger Things.</p>
<p>ffmpeg.exe -y -i <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV0RAcuG2Ao" >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV0RAcuG2Ao <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> runningup.mp4</p>
<p>Hit the “Enter” key, and the output of this command will be displayed on the Command Prompt interface.</p>
<p>The command options have the following meanings:</p>
<p><strong>-y</strong> allows automatic rewriting of existing files.</p>
<p><strong>-i</strong> <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV0RAcuG2Ao" >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV0RAcuG2Ao <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the stream URL that FFmpeg will record. You can change it with any video stream URL.</p>
<p><strong>runningup.mp4</strong> is the name of the output file.</p>

How to Record a Video Stream With FFmpeg on Mac?"></a>Part 3. How to Record a Video Stream With FFmpeg on Mac?</h2><p>You can use the Mac Terminal to record video streams via FFmpeg in the following way.</p>

<p>Download the ZIP file on your Mac and use ZIP file extraction software to open the file contents.</p>
<p>Step2 <strong>Launch the terminal</strong> on your Mac from the Apple menu, type the <strong>“ffmpeg -f avfoundation -list_devices true -i”</strong> command to let the system know which device to record from, and hit the <strong>Enter</strong> key.</p>
<p>Step3 Next, designate the path where you want to save your video, e.g., <strong>cd Path&#x2F;to&#x2F;my&#x2F;videostream</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</p>
<p>Step4 Type in the <strong>“ffmpeg -f avfoundation -i “1:1”-c:v libx264 -qp 0-preset ultrafast out.mp4”</strong> command and hit <strong>Enter</strong> to start recording the video stream.</p>

It’s the only way to highlight important aspects of sports and action scenes. Recording in slow motion is not difficult when you will learn <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>how to record slow-motion video</strong></a>. Before learning, let’s understand important aspects you should look at while recording.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Frame Rate:</strong> For slow-motion video, choosing the right frame rate is crucial. A higher framerate, such as 120fps and 240fps, allows smoother playback. So, before recording, ensure that your camera supports a good framerate.</li>
<li><strong>Resolution:</strong> Maintaining high-resolution videos is important to get good quality. Usually, slow-motion footage uses 4K and HD (High Definition) resolution. Having a high video resolution means providing clarity in details in videos.</li>
<li><strong>Shutter Speed:</strong> It refers to the speed at which the camera closes and controls exposure. Adjust the shutter speed to faster mode to capture every crisp in slow motion. It will prevent motion blur and help in freezing fast-moving objects.</li>
<li><strong>Audio Consideration:</strong> You should know that recording slow motion will affect the original audio. Meanwhile, some cameras preserve the original sound. So, be prepared and test your camera’s audio speed to ease the editing process.</li>
<li><strong>Focus and Stability:</strong> Minimize your camera shake and enable a stabilizer or tripod. Stable footage is essential to enhance the video quality. Moreover, try to keep your main subject in camera focus. In this regard, you can use manual focus control if necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Editing Software Compatibility:</strong> Another thing that you must consider is tool compatibility. It’s better to check it before recording so you will not regret it later. Check your editing tools are supporting the file format of the recorded slow-motion video.</li>
<li><strong>Storage Space:</strong> The <strong>“</strong>No More Storage” sign is a nightmare when you have recorded a perfect shot. Slow-motion videos consume large storage because of high resolution and frame rate. Thus, consider this aspect before recording to avoid inconvenience and arrange storage media.</li>

Recording in slow motion is not difficult when you will learn <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>how to record slow-motion video</strong></a>. Before learning, let’s understand important aspects you should look at while recording.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Frame Rate:</strong> For slow-motion video, choosing the right frame rate is crucial. A higher framerate, such as 120fps and 240fps, allows smoother playback. So, before recording, ensure that your camera supports a good framerate.</li>
<li><strong>Resolution:</strong> Maintaining high-resolution videos is important to get good quality. Usually, slow-motion footage uses 4K and HD (High Definition) resolution. Having a high video resolution means providing clarity in details in videos.</li>
<li><strong>Shutter Speed:</strong> It refers to the speed at which the camera closes and controls exposure. Adjust the shutter speed to faster mode to capture every crisp in slow motion. It will prevent motion blur and help in freezing fast-moving objects.</li>
<li><strong>Audio Consideration:</strong> You should know that recording slow motion will affect the original audio. Meanwhile, some cameras preserve the original sound. So, be prepared and test your camera’s audio speed to ease the editing process.</li>
<li><strong>Focus and Stability:</strong> Minimize your camera shake and enable a stabilizer or tripod. Stable footage is essential to enhance the video quality. Moreover, try to keep your main subject in camera focus. In this regard, you can use manual focus control if necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Editing Software Compatibility:</strong> Another thing that you must consider is tool compatibility. It’s better to check it before recording so you will not regret it later. Check your editing tools are supporting the file format of the recorded slow-motion video.</li>

A phenomenon that arises here is, can we slow down the normally recorded video? The simple answer is yes. There are many editing apps designed for this purpose. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html" >Adobe Premiere Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is one such editing app to slow down the pre-recorded videos.</p>
<h5 id="Step-1-5"><a href="#Step-1-5" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h5><p>Access your Adobe Premiere Pro application and import a video in the timeline. Identify the frame rate of your video clip for a non-choppy playback.</p>

<h5 id="Step-2-5"><a href="#Step-2-5" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h5><p>The frame rate will tell you how much you need to slow down the video. To do so, use this “(Timeline Frame Rate ÷ Footage Frame Rate) x 100” formula. Before moving, analyze the slow motion you can add in your clip as per their frame rate.</p>

Maybe it was too long, or you wanted to draw out an exciting part of the video without having to watch the boring parts.</p>
<p>In this article, we will be showing you how to use FFmpeg to speed up and slow down your videos using CLI. You’ll also find some other useful FFmpeg commands that you can use on your videos.</p>
<p>Finally, we will explain how to automate these commands so that you can run them on all your videos with ease.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-FFmpeg-1"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-FFmpeg-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is FFmpeg?"></a>Part 1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ffmpeg.org/about.html" >What is FFmpeg? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p>FFmpeg is a free and open-source cross-platform software project that can record, convert, and stream audio and video. It was developed by Fabrice Bellard in 2000. It has since become one of the most popular tools for transcoding media content on Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, Windows NT, and more.</p>
<p>One of its lesser-known capabilities is to speed up or slow down videos in just about any design you can think of — with either the audio or the video synced to the other if desired.</p>
<h3 id="Uses-of-FFmpeg"><a href="#Uses-of-FFmpeg" class="headerlink" title="Uses of FFmpeg"></a><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ottverse.com/what-is-ffmpeg-installation-use-cases/" >Uses of FFmpeg <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>FFMPEG is a command-line tool that can manipulate and transcode video files. Its uses are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>FFmpeg can create, trim, join or separate video clips on the fly and encode them into formats including MPEG, VOB, M2TS, TS, RMVB, or AVI.</li>
<li>It can be used for Video processing, Video packaging support, Video compression, Audio, and Video container support, FFplay, and FFprobe.</li>
<li>It also has extensive options for altering the look of an image in just about any way imaginable. Whether you want to change the brightness, hue, saturation, or perform multiple operations like subsampling (resizing) without reducing quality—the list goes on!</li>
</ul>
<p>You could think of it as the Swiss army knife for video manipulation tasks. The interface might seem intimidating at first, but once you get the hang of it, all commands are broken down into simple English phrases.</p>
<p>The most important thing to know before getting started with this is how to use FFmpeg’s -i and -v flags for input and output, respectively. To apply effects like slow motion playback or fast motion playback, use these flags in tandem with one another when specifying which file should be edited.</p>
<h3 id="Benefits-and-Disadvantages-of-FFmpeg"><a href="#Benefits-and-Disadvantages-of-FFmpeg" class="headerlink" title="Benefits and Disadvantages of FFmpeg"></a>Benefits and Disadvantages of FFmpeg</h3><p>FFmpeg has many benefits over other video editing software because it is free and open source, meaning that you have access to the code so that you can modify it if needed. Thus, it’s a better option when compared to other video editing software such as Avidemux, QuickTime Pro 7, and Adobe Premiere Elements 12. Some of these benefits include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Being able to edit videos on multiple platforms (Windows, Mac OS X);</li>
<li>FFmpeg has features to speed up and slow down video;</li>
<li>Being able to convert from one format into another seamlessly;</li>
<li>An extensive amount of features are at your disposal.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the drawbacks are that some settings are not configurable, like with YouTube’s built-in editor. The main disadvantage, though, would be the lengthiness of the program’s installation process: not only do you need to download FFmpeg itself but also three external libraries like libx264, libmp3lame, and libfaac; then you must compile all six packages before the installation completes. Luckily this process doesn’t take very long.</p>
<p>Another possible disadvantage is the time required for downloading the various resources since they may not be readily available on standard file hosting sites such as Mediafire or Dropbox (though they can be found through third-party websites). If you’re looking for something more robust than Windows Movie Maker or iMovie, we recommend checking out FFmpeg.</p>

How to Speed Up a Video in FFmpeg?</h2><p>FFmpeg can be used to speed up videos. It’s not the only option, but it’s one of the most common ways to make your videos faster. If you want your video to be faster, then FFmpeg is the right tool for the job. Some speed-up features include: FFmpeg speed up video and audio, ffmpeg speed up video mp4, ffmpeg change video speed, and so on.</p>

<p>Step1 Open a terminal and type in FFmpeg. This will open the program.</p>

                      alt="open the program"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Drag and drop the video file onto the window.</p>
<p>Step3 This is accomplished with the command -filter:v “setpts&#x3D;.”</p>
<p>Step4 According to the documentation, fast motion requires: -filter:v setpts&#x3D;0.5*PTS.</p>
<p><img

<p>A window appears when we double-click the chosen video. We shall navigate to the “SPEED” section beneath this window. Additional “Uniform Speed” and “Speed Ramping” panels may be found on this speed panel. We shall operate within the uniform speed panel to alter the video’s tempo consistently.

<p>The general speed of the film is continually increased or decreased when we choose the option for constant pace. If we choose the speed option on the screen, it gives us a built-in range of numbers that we can use to change the video’s pace in addition to presets like rapid and regular slow.</p>

When we select the speed ramping option, we see a range of graphs. Each graph shows a number of tempo variations that we may use in our movie.</p>
<p>For Instance, when we select the “MONTAGE” preset, the video’s tempo changes based on how many keyframes we choose and at what rate. As previously stated, as the graph rises above one and falls below one, the movie’s tempo will slow down, increasing its regular speed.</p>

<p>Moving these keyframes higher will make the video go more quickly, while moving them downward will make the movie move more slowly.
