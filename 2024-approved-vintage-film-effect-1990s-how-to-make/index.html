This decade saw horror movies become much more fun and immersive than in the 80s and 50s because they were more psychological. In fact, we can say that the horror movies of the 90s laid the foundation for current horror movies. So, without wasting time, let’s create a 1990s horror movie similar to The Blair Witch Project.</p>
<h2 id="Preparation"><a href="#Preparation" class="headerlink" title="Preparation"></a>Preparation</h2><p><img

                      alt="1990s vintage scene"
                ></p>
<p>The preparation for this horror film production is relatively self-explanatory if you’ve watched The Blair Witch Project. Simply shoot footage inside a dark room and apply some light to your face. It’s even better if you can shoot the video inside the woods. Just add some drama and a few screaming scenes to evoke emotions.</p>

                      alt="add the horror video to the timeline"
                ></p>
<p>Open Wondershare Filmora on your computer, then load the video you want to edit. After adding the video, drag it to the editing timeline, then move it a few keyframes to the right. The idea is to apply some black screen to add drama and fear before the film starts playing.</p>

                      alt="apply color grading"
                ></p>
<p>Next, double-click the horror clip and go to the <strong>Color</strong> menu. Then, click the <strong>Tone</strong> arrow before lowering the <strong>Saturation</strong> to -50%. This will give us a less saturated look popularly used in horror films.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="double-click the horror clip"
                ></p>
<p>Now click the <strong>3D LUT</strong> option and choose a LUT that works for your film. For this horror film project, we’ll select the <strong>Dark Film</strong> option.</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Add-creepiness-to-the-video"><a href="#Step3-Add-creepiness-to-the-video" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Add creepiness to the video"></a>Step3 Add creepiness to the video</h5><p><img

                      alt="add creepiness to the video"
                ></p>
<p>Obviously, you’ll want your horror film to look as creepy as possible. To achieve that, click the <strong>Elements</strong> tab, then search for the <strong>Smokescreen 1</strong> effect. Move the effect to the timeline above the video track before trimming the effect clip to fit with the original horror video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="click the elements tab"
                ></p>
<p>We’ll now change the size and positioning of the smokescreen effect to match the feature video. To do that, double-click the effect track. You can also reduce the opacity to around 30% to make the smoke more visible.</p>

                      alt="add a retro filming effect"
                ></p>
<p>Now we’ll make the film more believable by adding a retro overlay. Click the <strong>Effects</strong> tab, then search for <strong>Retro Film Overlay 15</strong> before dragging and dropping the effect above all the tracks in the editing timeline.</p>

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid GoPro Video Editor?</em></strong></p>
<p>You can choose free or paid softwares depending on your requirements and budget. If a free software meets your requirements then stay on it otherwise move towards a paid alternative. If you have a GoPro and you make videos just for fun then use a free and simple video editor. Even if you are an experienced video editor, I would recommend you to go for free video editors which I have mentioned above as they are quite powerful and professional software but if you are harvesting a good amount of money from this field then you can upgrade to pro versions of these free softwares or get a paid software from start. As almost all of these softwares are professional and can get your job done, so it’s better to choose one, which is comfortable for you to work on.</p>

Even if you are an experienced video editor, I would recommend you to go for free video editors which I have mentioned above as they are quite powerful and professional software but if you are harvesting a good amount of money from this field then you can upgrade to pro versions of these free softwares or get a paid software from start. As almost all of these softwares are professional and can get your job done, so it’s better to choose one, which is comfortable for you to work on.</p>

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid GoPro Video Editor?</em></strong></p>
<p>You can choose free or paid softwares depending on your requirements and budget. If a free software meets your requirements then stay on it otherwise move towards a paid alternative. If you have a GoPro and you make videos just for fun then use a free and simple video editor. Even if you are an experienced video editor, I would recommend you to go for free video editors which I have mentioned above as they are quite powerful and professional software but if you are harvesting a good amount of money from this field then you can upgrade to pro versions of these free softwares or get a paid software from start. As almost all of these softwares are professional and can get your job done, so it’s better to choose one, which is comfortable for you to work on.</p>

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid GoPro Video Editor?</em></strong></p>
<p>You can choose free or paid softwares depending on your requirements and budget. If a free software meets your requirements then stay on it otherwise move towards a paid alternative. If you have a GoPro and you make videos just for fun then use a free and simple video editor. Even if you are an experienced video editor, I would recommend you to go for free video editors which I have mentioned above as they are quite powerful and professional software but if you are harvesting a good amount of money from this field then you can upgrade to pro versions of these free softwares or get a paid software from start. As almost all of these softwares are professional and can get your job done, so it’s better to choose one, which is comfortable for you to work on.</p>
<p>FAQs about GoPro Video Editing:</p>

</ol>
<p>Yes, GoPro has its own video editor “Quik”. It is available on mobile phones and desktops both. It is simple and easy to use. It provides basic features to edit your video.

Although this isn’t the issue with Quik mobile app, here you can import videos from other devices also.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) Can I make videos for social media with a GoPro?</strong></li>

<ol>
