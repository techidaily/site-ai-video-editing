<li>The message “Login required” appears from time to time, which is a source of considerable irritation.</li>
<li>It is also not uncommon to see that some portions of a media file are able to run while other portions of the same media file are unable to run.</li>

<p>A political campaign video is quite similar to other forms of marketing videos. As a political candidate, you are the product, and the cause you’re promoting is your unique selling proposition. A political video helps to promote your cause to the voters. When entering into politics, political campaigns are one of the things you would need to learn how to do. It is the best way to get your message out to the voters. A political video informs the people about who you are, your values, and why you’re the best person to vote for. Your political video needs to be captivating, but more importantly, you need it to be informative and succinctly capture your spirit.</p>
<p>According to an <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.emarketer.com/newsroom/index.php/us-political-ad-spending-to-hit-record-high/" >eMarketer report <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, political ad spending has increased by 63.3%.

Creating an effective political campaign video is essential, and the next section informs you how you can get it done.</p>
<p><strong>4 Political Campaign Video Ideas to Consider</strong></p>
<p>There are various types of political campaign video ideas. It all depends on your target audience and the cause you’re promoting. This section will provide you with four effective pollical campaign videos you can implement in your next political campaign video.</p>
<p><strong>Make an Introduction Video</strong></p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="political-video-"
                ></p>
<p>This is one of the best political campaign videos you can make. The proper introduction video informs your voters about who you are and what they’ll vote for when they pick you. If you’re not new to the political scene and have been in office for quite a while, you can make an introduction video that tells your story and what you accomplished.</p>
<p>This political video reminds your existing supporters why they voted for you and lets you get acquainted with new voters. Several people use this idea effectively, especially those in the office. There are many videos in this format where politicians share their long voting records. However, if you’re new to the scene, the introduction video is the best way to share who you are and what you bring to the table. You can also explain the policy changes you would be implementing and why it matters.</p>
<p>You can spice up your political introduction video with humor and cultural references to appeal to your voters and increase your connection with them.</p>
<p><strong>Make an Endorsement Video</strong></p>

                      alt="political-video-"
                ></p>
<p>This is also quite popular and is an excellent way of gaining the support and loyalty of voters. In a political endorsement video, you can get well-known figures in society to show their support for your cause.

<p>This is one of the best political campaign videos you can make. The proper introduction video informs your voters about who you are and what they’ll vote for when they pick you.

<p>However, before you make an endorsement video, you need to ensure that your target voters like the figures that are endorsing you. Choosing people they know and love like other political leaders, celebrities, and many others increases the voters’ likelihood of supporting you. A common example of an endorsement video is President Barack Obama’s support for President Joe Biden in the 2020 election.</p>

<p><strong>Step 7: Publish and Promote Your Political Campaign Video</strong></p>
<p>After editing your video, you’re ready to share it with the public. Distribute it to the appropriate channels and ensure it meets the ideal advertising rules and regulations. The best part of the campaign videos is that you can easily repurpose them to your preference. You can also share the video on social media; there are chances it will go viral.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8: Measure Your Success</strong></p>
<p>Now is the time to measure your success; how far have you achieved your goal? Use the metrics you set to determine how your video performed. This information will help you adjust and improve your political video strategy.</p>
<p><strong>Best Practices for Promoting Your Political Campaign Video</strong></p>
<p>After you upload the video, you want to ensure that it reaches your target audience and gets the kind of engagement you’re looking for. To ensure this, below are three best practices to promote your political campaign video.</p>
<p><strong>Research and Comply with Government Regulations</strong></p>
<p>Political videos fall into a specific category, and you want to make sure that you follow the rules. There are various regulations, which usually depend on the city, state, or country. Additionally, television advertisements have special rules and social media platforms. Therefore, you should ensure that you follow the rules. For example, although Twitter doesn’t allow for paid political advertisements, Facebook does.</p>
<p><strong>Fact-Check Your Video</strong></p>
<p>You don’t want to mislead your voters; they’re using the video to decide who to vote for. Therefore, you need to ensure that the information you include in your video is accurate. Beyond political reasons, you also have an ethical responsibility to share factual material. You also want to ensure that your video doesn’t include any embarrassing information that can hurt your campaign in the long run.</p>
<p><strong>Promote on Various Platforms</strong></p>
<p>Your target audience is on different platforms, and you need to take the video to them. The legal voting age is eighteen years. Therefore, you should bear this in mind when choosing the right platform to promote your video. Consider sites with politically-engaged voters and ensure you promote your video on such platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>
<p>Video content is essential for most modern campaigns; you can easily promote it on various social media platforms. For example, you can start with an introductory political video and then host a Q&amp;A session down the line. Ensure you edit your video after filming to ensure it looks optimized and catchy for your audience. By implementing the practices shared in this article, your video should reach your target audience seamlessly.</p>

The software lets us to log and transfer videos onto a hard drive, where it can be edited, processed, and output to a wide variety of formats. Final Cut Pro is so advanced that it is used by hobbyist filmmakers and industry professionals in TV, Film, and media. Anyone can get a free trial of the software for their Macs, but, to purchase directly from the Mac App Store it costs $299.99. It’s evident that Final Cut Pro can’t be downloaded, installed, and thus used on Windows, which is unfortunate, but for Mac users, it’s a very powerful video editing software.</p>

<li>Blazing pro performance;</li>
<li>Editing, audio, motion graphics, color grading, and delivery;</li>

But, one should not be alarmed when it comes to experience and knowledge in editing – even though Final Cut Pro seems so advanced with its powerful tools and the possibilities it contains, it is designed for easy use and can be used by amateurs as well as professionals.</p>
<p>The interface, which, when it comes to editing, is one of the most important aspects (if not the main one!), seems quite standard - an ordinary window configuration, sidebar with libraries, events, projects, collections… If you want to know more about the basics of Final Cut Pro, it would be helpful to watch a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygBlgaT78mM" >beginner tutorial <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, with the length of only 20 minutes, an introduction of the whole program.</p>

<p>Anyway, the main topic of this article is about cropping – how to crop a video in Final Cut Pro? If you are a Mac user and have this program installed on your computer, and you as well have a footage where you want to remove some portions of the video and adjust the size of the cropped clip within a certain area, this article is for you. Even though cropping is especially used when it comes to the images, it is extremely helpful in certain situations about the video clips, as well. So, let’s dive into each step of cropping in Final Cut Pro!</p>
<h2 id="Steps-to-crop-a-video-in-Final-Cut-Pro"><a href="#Steps-to-crop-a-video-in-Final-Cut-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Steps to crop a video in Final Cut Pro"></a>Steps to crop a video in Final Cut Pro</h2><p>After getting Final Cut Pro ready to work in and opening it, you need to start as always, as in any other software: Of course, choose Import Media.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-3.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>The software will ask your permission to access files in your computer, so, in order to import some, guess you have to click on OK.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-4.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Then, it will let you choose your file – but not by opening the new window (as in most cases), rather, you can choose file within the software.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-5.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Once you have your file(s) chosen, you need to find Import Selected button on the down and right.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-6.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>This will lead you towards the editor again, but if you try to drag and drop your file into the sequence, the program will not follow this simple order…</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-7.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>This is because what the window below reads and looks like – it offers you create a New Project first. So, you need to hit it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-8.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>This will create the sequence where you can add the video you have already selected and imported from your media.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-9.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Now, it’s time to find where the cropping option is. It’s quite simple – look at the icon below and a little left of the screen where your video clip shows, click on it and you will see three options: Transform, Crop, and Distort. Needless to say, you will choose crop in this case, even if other options sound quite interesting, too!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-10.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Choosing Crop also gives you three options: Trim, Crop, and Ken Burns. Stick with the Crop again!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-11.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>You will notice the kind of rulers on the angles of the video clip – they are there so you can crop your footage manually, by holding and moving them with your cursor to your liking.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-12.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Of course, if you direct your cursor in the middle of the cropped video, you can move the whole cropping window around it, so you can find the area where you intend to crop better.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-13.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>And when the selected area is ready, you need to click on Done button on the right top side of the screen. If you are not satisfied with the result, you can take the step back, by clicking on Reset button right next to Done and modify the area again.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-14.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>On the right side of the screen, you notice a window where Crop is also written. Alongside it, if you hover over the option with your mouse, you will see the word: Show. Clicking on it will let you crop the video from each side from there, too.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-15.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>There, you can “play around” with Left, Right, Top, and Bottom sides.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-16.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>In the process, if you are unsure or you want to compare the original video to the cropped version of it, keep in mind that you can uncheck the Crop button.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-17.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Finally, when you feel the result is what you have imagined, you can proceed to saving your work. For it to be done, you need to now find an Export button top right of the whole editor, and then, choose Export File (or else, if that’s what you are willing to do).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-18.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-19.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>The next step would be Export Settings. You will see a new window which has three sections: Info, Settings, and Roles. The most important one here would be considered Settings, where you choose your preferred Format, Video Codec, Resolution, Color Space, Audio Format, and Action.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p> When you click on Next, you then choose the Name of your project and the location where you want to save it exactly.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Then you click on Save, and in a short amount of time, you have your new cropped video where you chose to save it! So, that’s it with cropping in the Final Cut Pro!</p>

<p>Above your video in the sequence, you will see little icons and find a Crop one.</p>

<p>Click on it and a new window will open – it’s for Crop and Zoom, where you can choose a needed ratio or do it manually (for it, you have to select Custom first).</p>

                ></p>
<p>After clicking OK, your video will be cropped as you like. Then, you can proceed with Exporting it – click on Export, choose your preferred settings, and save the video.</p>

<p>So, in this article, we got to know to software Final Cut Pro better and learned about how to crop our footage using this program; we also discussed how to do the same in Wondershare Filmora X, shall we need a different software.</p>
<p>And now, you can choose your preferred one and follow these step, or, why not try both?..</p>
<p>What are the features this advanced computer program offers to Mac users? – itreads on the web-site of Final Cut Pro:</p>
<ul>
<li>Object Tracker and Cinematic mode;</li>
<li>Blazing pro performance;</li>
<li>Editing, audio, motion graphics, color grading, and delivery;</li>
<li>The best plug-ins, effects, and tools from leading developers.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the most impressive things about Final Cut Pro is that through it, you can create 2D and 3D titles right in the program, apply and modify filters, and use the built-in chroma key for high-quality green- and blue-screen effects. But, one should not be alarmed when it comes to experience and knowledge in editing – even though Final Cut Pro seems so advanced with its powerful tools and the possibilities it contains, it is designed for easy use and can be used by amateurs as well as professionals.</p>
<p>The interface, which, when it comes to editing, is one of the most important aspects (if not the main one!), seems quite standard - an ordinary window configuration, sidebar with libraries, events, projects, collections… If you want to know more about the basics of Final Cut Pro, it would be helpful to watch a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygBlgaT78mM" >beginner tutorial <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, with the length of only 20 minutes, an introduction of the whole program.</p>

<p>Anyway, the main topic of this article is about cropping – how to crop a video in Final Cut Pro? If you are a Mac user and have this program installed on your computer, and you as well have a footage where you want to remove some portions of the video and adjust the size of the cropped clip within a certain area, this article is for you. Even though cropping is especially used when it comes to the images, it is extremely helpful in certain situations about the video clips, as well. So, let’s dive into each step of cropping in Final Cut Pro!</p>
<h2 id="Steps-to-crop-a-video-in-Final-Cut-Pro-1"><a href="#Steps-to-crop-a-video-in-Final-Cut-Pro-1" class="headerlink" title="Steps to crop a video in Final Cut Pro"></a>Steps to crop a video in Final Cut Pro</h2><p>After getting Final Cut Pro ready to work in and opening it, you need to start as always, as in any other software: Of course, choose Import Media.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-3.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>The software will ask your permission to access files in your computer, so, in order to import some, guess you have to click on OK.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-4.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Then, it will let you choose your file – but not by opening the new window (as in most cases), rather, you can choose file within the software.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-5.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Once you have your file(s) chosen, you need to find Import Selected button on the down and right.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-6.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>This will lead you towards the editor again, but if you try to drag and drop your file into the sequence, the program will not follow this simple order…</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-7.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>This is because what the window below reads and looks like – it offers you create a New Project first. So, you need to hit it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-8.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>This will create the sequence where you can add the video you have already selected and imported from your media.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-9.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Now, it’s time to find where the cropping option is. It’s quite simple – look at the icon below and a little left of the screen where your video clip shows, click on it and you will see three options: Transform, Crop, and Distort. Needless to say, you will choose crop in this case, even if other options sound quite interesting, too!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-10.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Choosing Crop also gives you three options: Trim, Crop, and Ken Burns. Stick with the Crop again!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-11.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>You will notice the kind of rulers on the angles of the video clip – they are there so you can crop your footage manually, by holding and moving them with your cursor to your liking.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-12.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Of course, if you direct your cursor in the middle of the cropped video, you can move the whole cropping window around it, so you can find the area where you intend to crop better.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-13.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>And when the selected area is ready, you need to click on Done button on the right top side of the screen. If you are not satisfied with the result, you can take the step back, by clicking on Reset button right next to Done and modify the area again.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-14.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>On the right side of the screen, you notice a window where Crop is also written. Alongside it, if you hover over the option with your mouse, you will see the word: Show. Clicking on it will let you crop the video from each side from there, too.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-15.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>There, you can “play around” with Left, Right, Top, and Bottom sides.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-16.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>In the process, if you are unsure or you want to compare the original video to the cropped version of it, keep in mind that you can uncheck the Crop button.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-17.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Finally, when you feel the result is what you have imagined, you can proceed to saving your work. For it to be done, you need to now find an Export button top right of the whole editor, and then, choose Export File (or else, if that’s what you are willing to do).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-18.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-19.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>The next step would be Export Settings. You will see a new window which has three sections: Info, Settings, and Roles. The most important one here would be considered Settings, where you choose your preferred Format, Video Codec, Resolution, Color Space, Audio Format, and Action.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-20.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-21.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p> When you click on Next, you then choose the Name of your project and the location where you want to save it exactly.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-22.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Then you click on Save, and in a short amount of time, you have your new cropped video where you chose to save it! So, that’s it with cropping in the Final Cut Pro!</p>

<p>So, shall we imagine we use Wondershare Filmora X to crop our video, what would be the steps to do it?..</p>
<p>Needless to say, downloading and installing the software is the first step. To add files, you need to click on Import Media Files Here.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Choose your clip(s) you would like to crop and then drag and drop it in the sequence.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Above your video in the sequence, you will see little icons and find a Crop one.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Click on it and a new window will open – it’s for Crop and Zoom, where you can choose a needed ratio or do it manually (for it, you have to select Custom first).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>After clicking OK, your video will be cropped as you like. Then, you can proceed with Exporting it – click on Export, choose your preferred settings, and save the video.</p>

<p>So, in this article, we got to know to software Final Cut Pro better and learned about how to crop our footage using this program; we also discussed how to do the same in Wondershare Filmora X, shall we need a different software.</p>
<p>And now, you can choose your preferred one and follow these step, or, why not try both?..</p>
<p>What are the features this advanced computer program offers to Mac users? – itreads on the web-site of Final Cut Pro:</p>
<ul>
<li>Object Tracker and Cinematic mode;</li>
<li>Blazing pro performance;</li>
<li>Editing, audio, motion graphics, color grading, and delivery;</li>
<li>The best plug-ins, effects, and tools from leading developers.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the most impressive things about Final Cut Pro is that through it, you can create 2D and 3D titles right in the program, apply and modify filters, and use the built-in chroma key for high-quality green- and blue-screen effects. But, one should not be alarmed when it comes to experience and knowledge in editing – even though Final Cut Pro seems so advanced with its powerful tools and the possibilities it contains, it is designed for easy use and can be used by amateurs as well as professionals.</p>
<p>The interface, which, when it comes to editing, is one of the most important aspects (if not the main one!), seems quite standard - an ordinary window configuration, sidebar with libraries, events, projects, collections… If you want to know more about the basics of Final Cut Pro, it would be helpful to watch a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygBlgaT78mM" >beginner tutorial <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, with the length of only 20 minutes, an introduction of the whole program.</p>

<p>Anyway, the main topic of this article is about cropping – how to crop a video in Final Cut Pro? If you are a Mac user and have this program installed on your computer, and you as well have a footage where you want to remove some portions of the video and adjust the size of the cropped clip within a certain area, this article is for you. Even though cropping is especially used when it comes to the images, it is extremely helpful in certain situations about the video clips, as well. So, let’s dive into each step of cropping in Final Cut Pro!</p>
<h2 id="Steps-to-crop-a-video-in-Final-Cut-Pro-2"><a href="#Steps-to-crop-a-video-in-Final-Cut-Pro-2" class="headerlink" title="Steps to crop a video in Final Cut Pro"></a>Steps to crop a video in Final Cut Pro</h2><p>After getting Final Cut Pro ready to work in and opening it, you need to start as always, as in any other software: Of course, choose Import Media.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-3.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>The software will ask your permission to access files in your computer, so, in order to import some, guess you have to click on OK.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-4.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Then, it will let you choose your file – but not by opening the new window (as in most cases), rather, you can choose file within the software.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-5.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Once you have your file(s) chosen, you need to find Import Selected button on the down and right.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-6.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>This will lead you towards the editor again, but if you try to drag and drop your file into the sequence, the program will not follow this simple order…</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-7.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>This is because what the window below reads and looks like – it offers you create a New Project first. So, you need to hit it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-8.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>This will create the sequence where you can add the video you have already selected and imported from your media.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-9.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Now, it’s time to find where the cropping option is. It’s quite simple – look at the icon below and a little left of the screen where your video clip shows, click on it and you will see three options: Transform, Crop, and Distort. Needless to say, you will choose crop in this case, even if other options sound quite interesting, too!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-10.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Choosing Crop also gives you three options: Trim, Crop, and Ken Burns. Stick with the Crop again!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-11.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>You will notice the kind of rulers on the angles of the video clip – they are there so you can crop your footage manually, by holding and moving them with your cursor to your liking.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-12.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Of course, if you direct your cursor in the middle of the cropped video, you can move the whole cropping window around it, so you can find the area where you intend to crop better.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-13.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>And when the selected area is ready, you need to click on Done button on the right top side of the screen. If you are not satisfied with the result, you can take the step back, by clicking on Reset button right next to Done and modify the area again.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-14.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>On the right side of the screen, you notice a window where Crop is also written. Alongside it, if you hover over the option with your mouse, you will see the word: Show. Clicking on it will let you crop the video from each side from there, too.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-15.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>There, you can “play around” with Left, Right, Top, and Bottom sides.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-16.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>In the process, if you are unsure or you want to compare the original video to the cropped version of it, keep in mind that you can uncheck the Crop button.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-17.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Finally, when you feel the result is what you have imagined, you can proceed to saving your work. For it to be done, you need to now find an Export button top right of the whole editor, and then, choose Export File (or else, if that’s what you are willing to do).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-18.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-19.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>The next step would be Export Settings. You will see a new window which has three sections: Info, Settings, and Roles. The most important one here would be considered Settings, where you choose your preferred Format, Video Codec, Resolution, Color Space, Audio Format, and Action.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p><img

                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p> When you click on Next, you then choose the Name of your project and the location where you want to save it exactly.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-22.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Then you click on Save, and in a short amount of time, you have your new cropped video where you chose to save it! So, that’s it with cropping in the Final Cut Pro!</p>

<p>So, shall we imagine we use Wondershare Filmora X to crop our video, what would be the steps to do it?..</p>
<p>Needless to say, downloading and installing the software is the first step. To add files, you need to click on Import Media Files Here.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Choose your clip(s) you would like to crop and then drag and drop it in the sequence.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Above your video in the sequence, you will see little icons and find a Crop one.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Click on it and a new window will open – it’s for Crop and Zoom, where you can choose a needed ratio or do it manually (for it, you have to select Custom first).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>After clicking OK, your video will be cropped as you like. Then, you can proceed with Exporting it – click on Export, choose your preferred settings, and save the video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p>Anyway, the main topic of this article is about cropping – how to crop a video in Final Cut Pro? If you are a Mac user and have this program installed on your computer, and you as well have a footage where you want to remove some portions of the video and adjust the size of the cropped clip within a certain area, this article is for you. Even though cropping is especially used when it comes to the images, it is extremely helpful in certain situations about the video clips, as well. So, let’s dive into each step of cropping in Final Cut Pro!</p>
<h2 id="Steps-to-crop-a-video-in-Final-Cut-Pro-3"><a href="#Steps-to-crop-a-video-in-Final-Cut-Pro-3" class="headerlink" title="Steps to crop a video in Final Cut Pro"></a>Steps to crop a video in Final Cut Pro</h2><p>After getting Final Cut Pro ready to work in and opening it, you need to start as always, as in any other software: Of course, choose Import Media.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-3.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>The software will ask your permission to access files in your computer, so, in order to import some, guess you have to click on OK.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-4.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Then, it will let you choose your file – but not by opening the new window (as in most cases), rather, you can choose file within the software.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-5.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Once you have your file(s) chosen, you need to find Import Selected button on the down and right.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-6.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>This will lead you towards the editor again, but if you try to drag and drop your file into the sequence, the program will not follow this simple order…</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-7.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>This is because what the window below reads and looks like – it offers you create a New Project first. So, you need to hit it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-8.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>This will create the sequence where you can add the video you have already selected and imported from your media.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-9.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Now, it’s time to find where the cropping option is. It’s quite simple – look at the icon below and a little left of the screen where your video clip shows, click on it and you will see three options: Transform, Crop, and Distort. Needless to say, you will choose crop in this case, even if other options sound quite interesting, too!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-10.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Choosing Crop also gives you three options: Trim, Crop, and Ken Burns. Stick with the Crop again!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-11.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>You will notice the kind of rulers on the angles of the video clip – they are there so you can crop your footage manually, by holding and moving them with your cursor to your liking.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-12.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Of course, if you direct your cursor in the middle of the cropped video, you can move the whole cropping window around it, so you can find the area where you intend to crop better.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-13.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>And when the selected area is ready, you need to click on Done button on the right top side of the screen. If you are not satisfied with the result, you can take the step back, by clicking on Reset button right next to Done and modify the area again.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-14.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>On the right side of the screen, you notice a window where Crop is also written. Alongside it, if you hover over the option with your mouse, you will see the word: Show. Clicking on it will let you crop the video from each side from there, too.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-15.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>There, you can “play around” with Left, Right, Top, and Bottom sides.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-16.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>In the process, if you are unsure or you want to compare the original video to the cropped version of it, keep in mind that you can uncheck the Crop button.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-17.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Finally, when you feel the result is what you have imagined, you can proceed to saving your work. For it to be done, you need to now find an Export button top right of the whole editor, and then, choose Export File (or else, if that’s what you are willing to do).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-18.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-19.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>The next step would be Export Settings. You will see a new window which has three sections: Info, Settings, and Roles. The most important one here would be considered Settings, where you choose your preferred Format, Video Codec, Resolution, Color Space, Audio Format, and Action.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-20.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-21.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p> When you click on Next, you then choose the Name of your project and the location where you want to save it exactly.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-22.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Then you click on Save, and in a short amount of time, you have your new cropped video where you chose to save it! So, that’s it with cropping in the Final Cut Pro!</p>

                ></p>
<p>So, shall we imagine we use Wondershare Filmora X to crop our video, what would be the steps to do it?..</p>
<p>Needless to say, downloading and installing the software is the first step. To add files, you need to click on Import Media Files Here.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-26.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Choose your clip(s) you would like to crop and then drag and drop it in the sequence.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Above your video in the sequence, you will see little icons and find a Crop one.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-final-cut-28.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>Click on it and a new window will open – it’s for Crop and Zoom, where you can choose a needed ratio or do it manually (for it, you have to select Custom first).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="crop-video-final-cut"
                ></p>
<p>After clicking OK, your video will be cropped as you like. Then, you can proceed with Exporting it – click on Export, choose your preferred settings, and save the video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p>So, in this article, we got to know to software Final Cut Pro better and learned about how to crop our footage using this program; we also discussed how to do the same in Wondershare Filmora X, shall we need a different software.</p>

<p>Mobile applications with user-friendly interface, allowing us to manipulate the footage quickly, easily choose our preferred formats and effects and adjust the clips according to the requirements our target platforms set; more time-consuming and advanced software with even more options, but which seem to require us to be more skilled and experienced in editing.</p>
<p>Even though editing, as other innovative and creative actions, is limitless in its possibilities, sometimes we just need to make a little change in our project and it’s quite enough for us to be satisfied with our work and material. One of the things which is rather simple to do, but sometimes essential, when it comes to making our clips better and more picturesque for the audience, is cropping a video.</p>
<p>Cropping, in its essence, is great to “hide” some unnecessary objects in our video, and&#x2F;or highlight the main ones. In this article, we discuss how to crop a video in a software called DaVinci Resolve, in simple little steps, how to export our work and lastly, what would be the alternate way to do the same in other computer program.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-crop-a-video-in-Davinci-Resolve"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-crop-a-video-in-Davinci-Resolve" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How to crop a video in Davinci Resolve"></a>Part 1. How to crop a video in Davinci Resolve</h2><p>First and foremost, let’s get to know Davinci Resolve! As mentioned above, it is a software, so let’s be well-aware that we have to download and install it on our computer systems. Of course, it takes a bit of time, but to be able to use an advanced software, it’s totally worth it. If we are to search for the information about Davinci Resolve, we come across the following description: “color grading and non-linear video editing application for macOS, Windows, and Linux”. So, no matter which system we have, we can count on this software, which is a real advantage!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="crop-video-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>To touch upon the functions, Davinci Resolve includes modules for video editing, color correction, audio mixing and effects, and visual effects. The interface of it is quite advanced, but would be well and soon understandable for someone who has ever used a similar editing software, such as Adobe Premiere Pro. If you are interested in everything the software has to offer, we recommend watching this very viral beginner <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63Ln33O4p4c" >tutorial <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>Now, back to cropping – so, you want to crop the video you took or got somehow, and you also think about using Davinci Resolve? Cropping, in most cases, meaning different applications, platforms and software, is not a complicated task at all, and you can do it in a very short amount of time in Davinci Resolve, too. Therefore, let’s delve into the steps on how to do it!</p>
<p>First, download and install the software, and when it is finished, launch it. You will see a totally clean program, until you add the video you want to work on. To do so, you have to find File in the top menu, find Import and then choose Media.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-davinci-2.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>Then it will open a new window where you can choose your file…</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-davinci-3.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>Your chosen file will be added in Media Pool, and to direct it into the sequence, you have to drag and drop it there.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-davinci-4.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-davinci"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-davinci-5.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>And then you might have difficulty to find the crop button. But here it is – below the screen, on the left, there are two icons, and the second one says – Tools…</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-davinci-6.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-davinci"
                ></p>
<p> Click on the Tools button and more options will appear down the screen where the video clip is shown. And there, you will notice the famous Crop icon, just the second one, which will put your clip in a new window with the option below to crop each side, plus, to add feather around the cropped video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="crop-video-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>When you are ready to make a video bigger and adjust it to a frame size, you need to choose Transform button, left to the Crop icon. You can “touch” the dots on the video and manually manage the size of your cropped clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="crop-video-davinci"
                ></p>
<p><img

                      alt="crop-video-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>When you are ready to save the video you cropped, find Quick Export – you will see the button above the clip, on the right. A little window with settings will appear, so you can choose the format you want to save your video in, and then, of course, click on Export for the last time.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p>To touch upon the functions, Davinci Resolve includes modules for video editing, color correction, audio mixing and effects, and visual effects. The interface of it is quite advanced, but would be well and soon understandable for someone who has ever used a similar editing software, such as Adobe Premiere Pro. If you are interested in everything the software has to offer, we recommend watching this very viral beginner <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63Ln33O4p4c" >tutorial <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>Now, back to cropping – so, you want to crop the video you took or got somehow, and you also think about using Davinci Resolve? Cropping, in most cases, meaning different applications, platforms and software, is not a complicated task at all, and you can do it in a very short amount of time in Davinci Resolve, too. Therefore, let’s delve into the steps on how to do it!</p>
<p>First, download and install the software, and when it is finished, launch it. You will see a totally clean program, until you add the video you want to work on. To do so, you have to find File in the top menu, find Import and then choose Media.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-davinci-2.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>Then it will open a new window where you can choose your file…</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-davinci-3.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>Your chosen file will be added in Media Pool, and to direct it into the sequence, you have to drag and drop it there.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-davinci-4.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-davinci"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-davinci-5.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>And then you might have difficulty to find the crop button. But here it is – below the screen, on the left, there are two icons, and the second one says – Tools…</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="crop-video-davinci"
                ></p>
<p> Click on the Tools button and more options will appear down the screen where the video clip is shown. And there, you will notice the famous Crop icon, just the second one, which will put your clip in a new window with the option below to crop each side, plus, to add feather around the cropped video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="crop-video-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>When you are ready to make a video bigger and adjust it to a frame size, you need to choose Transform button, left to the Crop icon. You can “touch” the dots on the video and manually manage the size of your cropped clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="crop-video-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>When you are ready to save the video you cropped, find Quick Export – you will see the button above the clip, on the right. A little window with settings will appear, so you can choose the format you want to save your video in, and then, of course, click on Export for the last time.</p>
