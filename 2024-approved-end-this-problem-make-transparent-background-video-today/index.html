<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Capable of cropping various types of videos including MP4, WebM, AVI and many more. This means that it can also output different formats and encoding. This article may seem to focus on mp4 format but if in the future that you would need a different format then this may come in handy.</li>
<li>The power to set the cropping size and ratio more effectively. There are also presets available to help you transform it into video square, 4:3, 16:9, 3:2 and many more. Having a cropping area that you can easily adjust is such a helpful feature.</li>
<li>It shows the display configuration info for imported mp4 video files.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The maximum file size is only 100 mb (megabyte). Which means that you have to consider if your mp4 video file would not exceed this limit. A disadvantage indeed especially for those who have a video recorder that saves it in high quality. There is also a fear that the user would be hassled by trimming longer videos into shorter clips just to meet this requirement.</li>
<li>The video preview is not the same as the final output. The quality in the preview may be shown as having a much lower quality.</li>
<li>Other video file formats may not play due to incompatibility. This may be a huge disadvantage especially if you’re looking for efficiency in getting stuff done.</li>

<p>I have shown you the six best online mp4 croppers and each of its pros and cons. By now, you have an idea of which of these would suit you as a user.</p>
<p>The question is… are you aware of what you need or want for a mp4 video cropper? It’s time for you to weigh your own values and which mp4 cropper would fit that. Yes, you can read tons of reviews on the internet but if you don’t have self- awareness then you would still be confused on which would fit you.</p>
<p>There is no need to fear the unknown. A part of the process is exploring the possibilities and here we are demonstrating to you your 6 best choices to try from.</p>
<p>Let me know in the comments about your thoughts on these tools. You could also make your own pros and cons of these mp4 video croppers.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Capable of cropping various types of videos including MP4, WebM, AVI and many more. This means that it can also output different formats and encoding. This article may seem to focus on mp4 format but if in the future that you would need a different format then this may come in handy.</li>
<li>The power to set the cropping size and ratio more effectively. There are also presets available to help you transform it into video square, 4:3, 16:9, 3:2 and many more. Having a cropping area that you can easily adjust is such a helpful feature.</li>
<li>It shows the display configuration info for imported mp4 video files.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The maximum file size is only 100 mb (megabyte). Which means that you have to consider if your mp4 video file would not exceed this limit. A disadvantage indeed especially for those who have a video recorder that saves it in high quality. There is also a fear that the user would be hassled by trimming longer videos into shorter clips just to meet this requirement.</li>
<li>The video preview is not the same as the final output. The quality in the preview may be shown as having a much lower quality.</li>
<li>Other video file formats may not play due to incompatibility. This may be a huge disadvantage especially if you’re looking for efficiency in getting stuff done.</li>

<p>I have shown you the six best online mp4 croppers and each of its pros and cons. By now, you have an idea of which of these would suit you as a user.</p>
<p>The question is… are you aware of what you need or want for a mp4 video cropper? It’s time for you to weigh your own values and which mp4 cropper would fit that. Yes, you can read tons of reviews on the internet but if you don’t have self- awareness then you would still be confused on which would fit you.</p>
<p>There is no need to fear the unknown. A part of the process is exploring the possibilities and here we are demonstrating to you your 6 best choices to try from.</p>
<p>Let me know in the comments about your thoughts on these tools. You could also make your own pros and cons of these mp4 video croppers.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Capable of cropping various types of videos including MP4, WebM, AVI and many more. This means that it can also output different formats and encoding. This article may seem to focus on mp4 format but if in the future that you would need a different format then this may come in handy.</li>
<li>The power to set the cropping size and ratio more effectively. There are also presets available to help you transform it into video square, 4:3, 16:9, 3:2 and many more. Having a cropping area that you can easily adjust is such a helpful feature.</li>
<li>It shows the display configuration info for imported mp4 video files.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The maximum file size is only 100 mb (megabyte). Which means that you have to consider if your mp4 video file would not exceed this limit. A disadvantage indeed especially for those who have a video recorder that saves it in high quality. There is also a fear that the user would be hassled by trimming longer videos into shorter clips just to meet this requirement.</li>
<li>The video preview is not the same as the final output. The quality in the preview may be shown as having a much lower quality.</li>
<li>Other video file formats may not play due to incompatibility. This may be a huge disadvantage especially if you’re looking for efficiency in getting stuff done.</li>

Amidst this, videos have become a powerful medium to relive the past. If you’re aiming to infuse your videos with a touch of the ‘90s, look no further than the VHS effect.</p>
<p>For those who need a quick trip down memory lane, VHS tapes were once the cornerstone of home entertainment. These clunky plastic cassettes captured countless memories, from family gatherings to favorite films and TV shows. While they might be alien to newer generations, they hold a special place in the chronicles of video evolution.</p>
<p>The VHS effect isn’t just about mimicking the look of these tapes. It’s about encapsulating their essence—grainy visuals, occasional jitters, and that characteristic static. Incorporating these imperfections into today’s high-definition videos imparts a distinctive vintage flair. It’s akin to applying an Instagram filter to a photo, where a simple touch can transport a viewer back in time. Dive in as we guide you on adding this retro charm to your free videos.</p>
