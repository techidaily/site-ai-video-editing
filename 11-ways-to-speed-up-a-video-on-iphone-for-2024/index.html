It may go from basic editing to VFX and so on. Speed ramping is also an important feature of editing. Creators who make cinematics or B-rolls often may have used this feature.</p>
<p>Changing the speed of the whole video doesn’t look good in most situations therefore speed ramping feature was created. Speed Ramping means gradually changing the speed of a clip over time. It isn’t a complex thing but doing it correctly in the right amount at the right time can change the feel of the whole video. It catches the attention of viewers through different scenes of a clip.</p>
<p>So, here we have mentioned some iPhone video editing softwares that can at least do basic speed changes. but most of them can also do advanced speed ramping. These are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Filmora Go:</strong></p>
<p><strong>It is available on IOS and Android both.</strong></p>
<p>Want to do speed ramping? use Filmora Go. But are you a content creator and want to do more than just video editing? I would still recommend “Filmora Go”. Because it is such a versatile and easy-to-use software made by Wondershare. Like its PC software, it is also packed with many cool features such as chroma key, mask, keyframing, blending, e.t.c. It also supports multiple layers. It has built-in effects, transitions, and presets to speed up the editing process.</p>
<p>It is a paid video editor but you can try it for free, free trial includes most of the features but it leaves a watermark on export.</p>
<p><strong>~Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Has speed curves for smooth speed ramping.</li>
<li>Supports multiple images and video layers.</li>
<li>Have many presets and filters for fast pace editing.</li>
<li>Have cool features like chroma key, masking, keyframing, e.t.c.</li>
<li>Supports “Pixabay’s” stock library.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>~Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Its UI doesn’t support editing in landscape orientation.</li>
<li>It doesn’t support 4k video resolution.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Some Free Video speeding Softwares for iPhone:</strong></p>
<p>If you are short on budget or don’t want to spend much on video editing softwares then you can try these free softwares. They are free that doesn’t mean that they are useless, they are quite good for beginners or moderate users although some of them are designed for professionals also. If you don’t believe me, go and try it yourself. Apart from just changing the speed, they are good in other editing aspects also.</p>
<p><strong>Adobe Premiere Rush:</strong></p>

<p><strong>FAQs about Speed ramping feature and softwares:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) What is Speed Ramping and where it is used?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Speed Ramping is different from just changing the speed of the whole clip. It means changing the speed of the video gradually, so the clip doesn’t feel jumpy.</p>
<p>It is done to give viewers a smooth experience between different parts of the clip. like the fast-forward clip is used to show the passage of time. and the slow-mo is used to emphasize something or produce tension, while a mix of both is used in ads and action scenes, e.t.c.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) How to do Speed Ramping?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Speed Ramping methods vary from software to software. Either you can do it by adding keyframes and changing speed with time or you can add or adjust curves for speed change. If your software doesn’t support the speed ramping feature, you can split a clip into parts and apply speed change to them differently. For some of the best iPhone softwares, we have mentioned the speed ramping steps above.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) What FPS is best for Slo-mo videos?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Shooting at 60 Fps is ideal as it gives a smooth and crisp video and you can make slow motion easily if required, you can slow it down up to 40% of its speed while maintaining the quality. It is supported in almost most devices nowadays. And if you want to create super slo-mo for your cinematics or product video then 120 or 240 fps is preferable. But higher fps often have disadvantages as it is harder to apply visual effects or masks. So choose the frame rate according to your requirements.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) Does changing the speed of video affect its audio?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, changing the speed of video affects the audio, It affects its pitch (tempo). Increasing its speed increases the pitch of the audio making it sound shrill while decreasing the speed of the video or making slow-mo decreases the pitch making it sound deep.</p>
<p>Although, some softwares provide the feature to maintain the pitch while changing the speed of the clip.</p>
<p><strong>~Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Its UI doesn’t support editing in landscape orientation.</li>
<li>It doesn’t support 4k video resolution.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid iPhone Video speeding Softwares?</em></strong></p>
<p>It usually depends on your needs. If you just want a speed editor to make slow-mo or timelapse videos for your social media then you should go for free video editors, as they are easy to use and provide better speed ramping features than some paid video editors mentioned here.</p>
<p>But as a content creator if you want more features alongside speed ramping then you should go for paid softwares mentioned above. As mobile video editors are quite affordable and some of them have features like that of some PC softwares.</p>
<p><strong>FAQs about Speed ramping feature and softwares:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) What is Speed Ramping and where it is used?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Speed Ramping is different from just changing the speed of the whole clip. It means changing the speed of the video gradually, so the clip doesn’t feel jumpy.</p>
<p>It is done to give viewers a smooth experience between different parts of the clip. like the fast-forward clip is used to show the passage of time. and the slow-mo is used to emphasize something or produce tension, while a mix of both is used in ads and action scenes, e.t.c.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) How to do Speed Ramping?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Speed Ramping methods vary from software to software. Either you can do it by adding keyframes and changing speed with time or you can add or adjust curves for speed change. If your software doesn’t support the speed ramping feature, you can split a clip into parts and apply speed change to them differently. For some of the best iPhone softwares, we have mentioned the speed ramping steps above.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) What FPS is best for Slo-mo videos?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Shooting at 60 Fps is ideal as it gives a smooth and crisp video and you can make slow motion easily if required, you can slow it down up to 40% of its speed while maintaining the quality. It is supported in almost most devices nowadays. And if you want to create super slo-mo for your cinematics or product video then 120 or 240 fps is preferable. But higher fps often have disadvantages as it is harder to apply visual effects or masks. So choose the frame rate according to your requirements.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) Does changing the speed of video affect its audio?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, changing the speed of video affects the audio, It affects its pitch (tempo). Increasing its speed increases the pitch of the audio making it sound shrill while decreasing the speed of the video or making slow-mo decreases the pitch making it sound deep.</p>
<p>Although, some softwares provide the feature to maintain the pitch while changing the speed of the clip.</p>
<p><strong>~Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Its UI doesn’t support editing in landscape orientation.</li>
<li>It doesn’t support 4k video resolution.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>FAQs about Speed ramping feature and softwares:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) What is Speed Ramping and where it is used?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Speed Ramping is different from just changing the speed of the whole clip. It means changing the speed of the video gradually, so the clip doesn’t feel jumpy.</p>
<p>It is done to give viewers a smooth experience between different parts of the clip. like the fast-forward clip is used to show the passage of time. and the slow-mo is used to emphasize something or produce tension, while a mix of both is used in ads and action scenes, e.t.c.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) How to do Speed Ramping?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Speed Ramping methods vary from software to software. Either you can do it by adding keyframes and changing speed with time or you can add or adjust curves for speed change. If your software doesn’t support the speed ramping feature, you can split a clip into parts and apply speed change to them differently. For some of the best iPhone softwares, we have mentioned the speed ramping steps above.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) What FPS is best for Slo-mo videos?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Shooting at 60 Fps is ideal as it gives a smooth and crisp video and you can make slow motion easily if required, you can slow it down up to 40% of its speed while maintaining the quality. It is supported in almost most devices nowadays. And if you want to create super slo-mo for your cinematics or product video then 120 or 240 fps is preferable. But higher fps often have disadvantages as it is harder to apply visual effects or masks. So choose the frame rate according to your requirements.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) Does changing the speed of video affect its audio?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, changing the speed of video affects the audio, It affects its pitch (tempo). Increasing its speed increases the pitch of the audio making it sound shrill while decreasing the speed of the video or making slow-mo decreases the pitch making it sound deep.</p>
<p>Although, some softwares provide the feature to maintain the pitch while changing the speed of the clip.</p>
<p><strong>~Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Its UI doesn’t support editing in landscape orientation.</li>
<li>It doesn’t support 4k video resolution.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>FAQs about Speed ramping feature and softwares:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) What is Speed Ramping and where it is used?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Speed Ramping is different from just changing the speed of the whole clip. It means changing the speed of the video gradually, so the clip doesn’t feel jumpy.</p>
<p>It is done to give viewers a smooth experience between different parts of the clip. like the fast-forward clip is used to show the passage of time. and the slow-mo is used to emphasize something or produce tension, while a mix of both is used in ads and action scenes, e.t.c.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) How to do Speed Ramping?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Speed Ramping methods vary from software to software. Either you can do it by adding keyframes and changing speed with time or you can add or adjust curves for speed change. If your software doesn’t support the speed ramping feature, you can split a clip into parts and apply speed change to them differently. For some of the best iPhone softwares, we have mentioned the speed ramping steps above.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) What FPS is best for Slo-mo videos?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Shooting at 60 Fps is ideal as it gives a smooth and crisp video and you can make slow motion easily if required, you can slow it down up to 40% of its speed while maintaining the quality. It is supported in almost most devices nowadays. And if you want to create super slo-mo for your cinematics or product video then 120 or 240 fps is preferable. But higher fps often have disadvantages as it is harder to apply visual effects or masks. So choose the frame rate according to your requirements.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) Does changing the speed of video affect its audio?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, changing the speed of video affects the audio, It affects its pitch (tempo). Increasing its speed increases the pitch of the audio making it sound shrill while decreasing the speed of the video or making slow-mo decreases the pitch making it sound deep.</p>
<p>Although, some softwares provide the feature to maintain the pitch while changing the speed of the clip.</p>

<p>Technology has always been in the business of amazing man with its extraordinary abilities. The brain of man has a role to play in this awe as these inventions are not without man’s input. As such, daily improvements are ensured to build upon the existing technology - the computer system.</p>
<p>We have always had one reason or the other to hire voiceover artistes. This could be for the purpose of storytelling and narration, advertisement and so on. As beautiful and reliable as that is in executing our tasks, many seem to consider it a waste of resources in terms of funds, energy and time. This is one of the reasons why the innovation of text-to-speech was established. It comes in handy when we do not need voiceover artistes as it serves as a perfect substitute.</p>
<p>Text-to-speech, which is also known as TTS, is a type of supportive technology that assists in reading digital text aloud. It’s sometimes called “read aloud” technology. The benefit of this technology cannot be overemphasised as it has gained a wide reach and global use across many devices such as computers and smartphones of different brands. With the help of softwares for computers (Windows and Mac), applications for smartphones (Android, iPhone, iPad) as well as online platforms, text-to-speech has been made possible and easy as technology keeps evolving.</p>
<p>Today, content creators are grateful for this life-saving innovation as it has dispelled the thoughts of having to do voiceovers themselves (which could be difficult for many). As such, this article comes in handy as it seeks to discuss ten applications or softwares and online platforms for TTS.</p>

<p>Technology has always been in the business of amazing man with its extraordinary abilities. The brain of man has a role to play in this awe as these inventions are not without man’s input. As such, daily improvements are ensured to build upon the existing technology - the computer system.</p>
<p>We have always had one reason or the other to hire voiceover artistes. This could be for the purpose of storytelling and narration, advertisement and so on. As beautiful and reliable as that is in executing our tasks, many seem to consider it a waste of resources in terms of funds, energy and time. This is one of the reasons why the innovation of text-to-speech was established. It comes in handy when we do not need voiceover artistes as it serves as a perfect substitute.</p>
<p>Text-to-speech, which is also known as TTS, is a type of supportive technology that assists in reading digital text aloud. It’s sometimes called “read aloud” technology. The benefit of this technology cannot be overemphasised as it has gained a wide reach and global use across many devices such as computers and smartphones of different brands. With the help of softwares for computers (Windows and Mac), applications for smartphones (Android, iPhone, iPad) as well as online platforms, text-to-speech has been made possible and easy as technology keeps evolving.</p>
<p>Today, content creators are grateful for this life-saving innovation as it has dispelled the thoughts of having to do voiceovers themselves (which could be difficult for many). As such, this article comes in handy as it seeks to discuss ten applications or softwares and online platforms for TTS.</p>

<p>Technology has always been in the business of amazing man with its extraordinary abilities. The brain of man has a role to play in this awe as these inventions are not without man’s input. As such, daily improvements are ensured to build upon the existing technology - the computer system.</p>
<p>We have always had one reason or the other to hire voiceover artistes. This could be for the purpose of storytelling and narration, advertisement and so on. As beautiful and reliable as that is in executing our tasks, many seem to consider it a waste of resources in terms of funds, energy and time. This is one of the reasons why the innovation of text-to-speech was established. It comes in handy when we do not need voiceover artistes as it serves as a perfect substitute.</p>
<p>Text-to-speech, which is also known as TTS, is a type of supportive technology that assists in reading digital text aloud. It’s sometimes called “read aloud” technology. The benefit of this technology cannot be overemphasised as it has gained a wide reach and global use across many devices such as computers and smartphones of different brands. With the help of softwares for computers (Windows and Mac), applications for smartphones (Android, iPhone, iPad) as well as online platforms, text-to-speech has been made possible and easy as technology keeps evolving.</p>
<p>Today, content creators are grateful for this life-saving innovation as it has dispelled the thoughts of having to do voiceovers themselves (which could be difficult for many). As such, this article comes in handy as it seeks to discuss ten applications or softwares and online platforms for TTS.</p>

<p>Technology has always been in the business of amazing man with its extraordinary abilities. The brain of man has a role to play in this awe as these inventions are not without man’s input. As such, daily improvements are ensured to build upon the existing technology - the computer system.</p>
<p>We have always had one reason or the other to hire voiceover artistes. This could be for the purpose of storytelling and narration, advertisement and so on. As beautiful and reliable as that is in executing our tasks, many seem to consider it a waste of resources in terms of funds, energy and time. This is one of the reasons why the innovation of text-to-speech was established. It comes in handy when we do not need voiceover artistes as it serves as a perfect substitute.</p>
<p>Text-to-speech, which is also known as TTS, is a type of supportive technology that assists in reading digital text aloud. It’s sometimes called “read aloud” technology. The benefit of this technology cannot be overemphasised as it has gained a wide reach and global use across many devices such as computers and smartphones of different brands. With the help of softwares for computers (Windows and Mac), applications for smartphones (Android, iPhone, iPad) as well as online platforms, text-to-speech has been made possible and easy as technology keeps evolving.</p>
<p>Today, content creators are grateful for this life-saving innovation as it has dispelled the thoughts of having to do voiceovers themselves (which could be difficult for many). As such, this article comes in handy as it seeks to discuss ten applications or softwares and online platforms for TTS.</p>

<li>Its editor is very advanced, and the user has luxury of control over so many things.</li>
<li>A specific portion of the script can be emphasised; the volume can also be controlled alongside rate and pitch for the specific parts as well. Only few text-to-speech softwares have this feature. This one feature therefore makes it stand out from others. Its voice quality is no different from others.</li>
<li>Notevibes also lets you make dialogue videos where you can use more than one voice to create a voiceover. Your narration then sounds more creative and captivating when this feature well utilised. There are total 201 voices available in NoteVibes.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="CONS-33"><a href="#CONS-33" class="headerlink" title="CONS"></a>CONS</h2><ul>
<li>It has issues with speed, and also produces a highly concentrated robotic sound. Coming along these is its very expensive commercial options. Notevibes can also not read from PDF and docs.</li>
<li>There is no preview in NoteVibes; you can’t listen to the voice preview of the script; rather, the voiceover has to be generated to listen and to know how a speaker sounds.</li>
<li>Demos are unavailable. On the homepage, demo can be found and played, but while generating voiceovers, no demo will be found.</li>
<li>It has no merge feature: You can’t combine multiple audio files to make it one. Almost all major text-to-speech tools have a merge feature, but, Notevibes lags in this respect.</li>
<li>Voiceover &amp; Editor Page is different. There is one specific page for generating the voiceover and one page for downloading audio files. Switching between both of them will consume time. If you have a big project, switching between both pages will be tiring.</li>
<li>No Project-Based Structure: This is another feature that you need when you have big project. Keep multiple files in one place can create a mess. You can’t create any project inside Notevibes. This is a very immature structure.</li>
