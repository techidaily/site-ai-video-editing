Looping a PowerPoint slideshowmakes a presentation more accessible and more attractive. Studies show that humans tend to remember more of what they see than what they hear. You should use a <strong>PowerPoint-loop slideshow</strong> if you want to make a lasting impression while holding that conference, pitch to your boss at work, or even bid for that project**.** Here are some other reasons you should consider looping in your nextPowerPoint slide show.</p>
<p>A looping PowerPoint slideshow runs automatically. A typical PowerPoint presentation moves to the next slide when the presenter clicks the mouse, but a <strong>looping slideshow</strong> does not need human participation. It displays the next slide automatically after the time interval has elapsed.</p>
<p>It can be helpful to welcome guests to a meeting or Newcomers to an office reception area.</p>
<p>It ensures that latecomers do not miss any significant part of the presentation because a <strong>PowerPoint automatic slideshow loop</strong> starts all over again after displaying the last slide.</p>
<p>Setting up a <strong>looping slideshow</strong> is easy and does not require much equipment. You’re all set to go if you have a computer and projector.</p>
<p>It gives the speaker more time to focus on the audience and interact with them rather than concentrating on getting the next slide correctly.</p>
<p>With or without the presence of an operator, the PowerPoint presentation can display the slides configured to display.</p>
<p>It saves you the stress of arranging and rearranging slides during a meeting or an event.</p>
<p>It makes presentation easy and allows the large audience to flow with the speaker as they do not have to read from documents while trying to keep up with the speaker.</p>
<p>A PowerPoint configured to loop continuously can be used to pass general information.</p>
<p>Not everyone likes speaking in public or making a presentation in front of a large crowd. Someone like me immediately starts sweating profusely and has heart palpitations when many eyes are on me. In this kind of situation, a <strong>looped PowerPoint slideshow</strong> helps take the tension off a nervous speaker as the audience will most likely be concentrating on the slideshows instead of you.</p>

<p>A <strong>PowerPoint Looping slideshow</strong> automatically starts over from the beginning after displaying the last slide. A particular slide is displayed for a certain amount of time interval. Once the time has elapsed, the slide automatically moves to the next one. It is sometimes used in seminars to keep the audience busy before the main presentation commences. In most tradeshows, the videos or information you notice repeatedly playing on its own are in a loop. The transition and slide sets get tweaked to work that way. In Nigeria, most banks use looped slides to display their welcome message. Looping slides make display work more accessible and give time to face other activities while your slide runs automatically.</p>

<h3 id="2-Trimming-a-video-3"><a href="#2-Trimming-a-video-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Trimming a video"></a><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Trimming a video</strong></h3><p>If you are cutting some parts at the beginning and the end of the video, it is called trimming a video. You can say it as removing unnecessary preparation scenes. Normally, professionals start their cameras before the film scene to ensure not to miss any part of the video. Here’s, how to trim video in the QuickTime player.</p>
