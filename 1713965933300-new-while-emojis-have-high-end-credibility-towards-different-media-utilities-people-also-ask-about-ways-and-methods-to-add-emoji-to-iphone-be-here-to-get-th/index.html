But many of us can’t afford this, so read this article to get an alternative.</p>
<p>You can use smartphones to record cinematic shots if you don’t have expensive lenses. You’ll learn about filming and editing those shots into Wondershare Filmora to get professional results in the below lines.</p>
<p>But before we get into the filming process, having a general idea about the topic can help a lot. So first, let’s understand what cinematic videos are!</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-a-Cinematic-Video"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-a-Cinematic-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is a Cinematic Video?"></a>Part 1. What Is a Cinematic Video?</h2><p>The world of cinema has developed and has high recording quality. A cinematic video is a video that is recorded to look more like a movie. These shots excel in all aspects of a video, such as Color, aspect ratio, and lighting techniques.</p>
<p>Most of the cinematic footage required unique cameras, i.e., <strong>IMAX</strong> cameras for movies. But these cameras are really costly and only suitable for large-scale production.</p>
<p>With the understanding of cinematic videos, you can now use alternative ways to record a cinematic video without an expensive camera. You can also record a cinematic video using only a smartphone with a few requirements.</p>
<p>Scroll below to learn more about what you need to record a cinematic video!</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Requirements-to-Record-a-Cinematic-Video"><a href="#Part-2-Requirements-to-Record-a-Cinematic-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Requirements to Record a Cinematic Video"></a>Part 2. Requirements to Record a Cinematic Video</h2><p>To record a professional video with cinematic effects, you must have the following equipment in your studio:</p>
<h3 id="1-A-Gimbal-Stabilizer"><a href="#1-A-Gimbal-Stabilizer" class="headerlink" title="1. A Gimbal Stabilizer"></a>1. A Gimbal Stabilizer</h3><p>When you are recording footage from your smartphone, a significant issue that can disturb your video quality is the shaking of your phone. You may have to record while walking, or it could even be a static shot.</p>
<p>If the phone is held in your hands without support, you will end up with shaky footage. This will eventually ruin your video.</p>
<p>A gimbal stabilizer allows you to stabilize your footage with a handheld stand. Many gimbal stabilizers are available in the market, but for reference, we would be looking at the <strong>Q3</strong> Gimbal from <strong>Zhiyun</strong>.</p>

                      alt="zhiyun q3 gimbal stabilizer"
                ></p>
<p>You can also connect the Gimbal from its app. Scroll below to learn more about the app!</p>
<p><strong>Zhiyun Cami App</strong></p>
<p><strong>Zhiyun Q3</strong> stabilizer also connects with the Zhiyun cami app. This app will allow users to access the filming features more intuitively and comprehensively. You can connect your Gimbal with the app via Bluetooth.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Zhiyun Stabilizer Shooting Modes</strong></p>
<p>There are many modes on different Gimbals, but the Locking and the POV mode are the most useful, which are illustrated as shown below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Locking mode:</strong> This mode allows you to lock all three motors of the Gimbal and allows your phone to remain fixed at a certain angle. Due to this, you can shoot your footage from multiple positions while keeping the camera fixed at one angle.</li>
<li><strong>The POV mode</strong> will allow you to unlock all the axes. This mode will also adjust in all three axes when moving around. This feature gives you more freedom of movement.</li>
</ul>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Extra Features of Zhiyun Q3 Stabilizer</strong></p>
<p>When you are shooting a video using the Gimbal stabilizer, you come across a point where you want extra light. Thus, the Q3 stabilizer comes with a built-in <strong>flashlight.</strong></p>
<p>This flashlight will not only light up those small corners of a dark room but also make a huge difference. If you are recording to focus on an object, such as a product, this flashlight will greatly help you.</p>

<h3 id="2-A-Good-Smartphone"><a href="#2-A-Good-Smartphone" class="headerlink" title="2. A Good Smartphone"></a>2. A Good Smartphone</h3><p>Most smartphones these days are equipped with cameras with varying powers of recording. Some smartphone cameras focus on <strong>Mega Pixels,</strong> while others focus on the capture sensor. You need a smartphone camera that balances out all these qualities to record cinematic footage.</p>
<p>The recently released iPhone 14 pro camera is an excellent example of a good quality camera you can use to record cinematic videos.</p>

<p>Now that we have learned about the requirements for recording a cinematic video. Let’s look at the different cinematic movements you can use to record from your Smartphone.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Top-3-Cinematic-Movements-to-Record-From-a-Smartphone"><a href="#Part-3-Top-3-Cinematic-Movements-to-Record-From-a-Smartphone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Top 3 Cinematic Movements to Record From a Smartphone"></a>Part 3. Top 3 Cinematic Movements to Record From a Smartphone</h2><p>You may have watched many movies or TV shows, but the general audience usually ignores the effort put into a shot. Only an experienced videographer can detect the difference between a great cinematic shot and a poor one.</p>
<p>Of the great cinematic shots, some are described in this article. These shots can easily record by using a smartphone. The cinematic movements explained below are the best choice. Here we will look at the three camera movements you can record on your smartphone.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Reveal Movement.</li>
<li>The 180° Presentation Movement.</li>
<li>The Following Movement.</li>
</ul>
<p>First, let’s take a look at the Reveal movement.</p>
<h3 id="1-The-Reveal-Movement"><a href="#1-The-Reveal-Movement" class="headerlink" title="1. The Reveal Movement"></a>1. The Reveal Movement</h3><p>This is the most popular movement used in cinematic shooting from your smartphone. With a Gimbal, the Reveal movement is one of the easiest shots to master. But for this, you will need to learn it first.</p>
<p>The Reveal Movement is a shot taken with an object as a perspective. The shot starts from a static object in the foreground. It could be focused at first, but as the camera moves, the focus will be diverted to reveal our target object. This is known as the Reveal Movement.</p>
<p>To shoot the reveal movement, follow the steps mentioned as shown:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, ensure your phone is connected properly to the <strong>Gimbal</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Align</strong> your Smartphone camera behind the static object.</li>
<li>Guide the target individual to be ready as you move the camera to reveal them.</li>
<li>Slowly move the camera, focusing on the static object to change its focus on your main object.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-8.gif"
                      alt="the reveal movement"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Make sure to practice and experiment a lot with the steps. Try to be more creative and innovative. With every video you shoot, you gain experience with the errors.</p>
<p>Another thing to remember is that when you are shooting a Reveal movement using the Gimbal, it is best to put it in <strong>Locking mode</strong>. This mode works the best as it allows the camera to stay fixed in one frame making your footage seem balanced and of quality.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="gimbal fixed in locking mode"
                ></p>
<h3 id="2-The-180°-Presentation-Movement"><a href="#2-The-180°-Presentation-Movement" class="headerlink" title="2. The 180° Presentation Movement"></a>2. The 180° Presentation Movement</h3><p>The next movement we will be looking at will be the 180° presentation movement. The 180° presentation will move in a half-circle fashion. It will move from one side of the subject to the other side. This will allow you to cover the overall subject’s view.</p>
<p>Apart from that, it will allow you to capture the background with much clarity and detail to maintain a general sense of the ambiance. Making a 180° presentation shot is fairly easy to do so. With its multiple uses, you can use this method in any scenario.</p>
<p>As we will move from one side to the other in a circular manner, we need to fix the frame of our video to move along. Using the <strong>POV</strong> <strong>mode</strong> of the Zhiyun Gimbal stabilizer will be the best option in this sense.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="gimbal fixed in pov mode"
                ></p>
<p>Setting the Gimbal in POV mode will allow you to shoot the video from more than one angle while keeping the video balanced. Follow the steps mentioned to shoot a 180° presentation video:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, start recording from one side of the subject while keeping the Gimbal in the POV mode.</li>
<li>Slowly start moving in front of the subject in an arch.</li>
<li>When you face the subject, do not stop and keep moving to complete the arch.</li>
<li>When you reach the end of the arch, close the video.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="the 180° presentation movement"
                ></p>
<p>By following the steps mentioned, you can create the 180° presentation movement using a smartphone. Now, move forward to learn about “The Following movement.”</p>
<h3 id="3-The-Following-Movement"><a href="#3-The-Following-Movement" class="headerlink" title="3. The Following Movement"></a>3. The Following Movement</h3><p>You can use “The following movement” when recording a scene in which the object moves in random directions. Or when there is a high degree of movement of your object in the video, and you want to fix the focus of your footage to that object.</p>
<p>The Following movement is not technically a movement, but a setting that will allow you to record the footage while keeping the object and the video frame focused. In this type of footage, we will use the Zhiyun Cami app to focus on our target object.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="drawing a square to focus the subject"
                ></p>
<p>To focus on our subject in the video by Cami app, follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li>When recording the video, make sure to put the Gimbal on a tripod stand.</li>
<li>After that, open the <strong>Cami</strong> app and draw a square over the object you want to keep in focus.</li>
<li>Now, the camera will shift its angle to its perspective wherever the object goes.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p>Congratulations! You have now successfully created a cinematic video using Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Using expensive equipment to record a cinematic video can be a reliable step. But it is not in everyone’s budget. You can also use a smartphone to record a cinematic video by the steps mentioned above and give it a professional look by editing on Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<p>Although it might seem strange initially, but the time is close when everyone will create cinematic videos from their smartphones.</p>
<p>Another thing to remember is that when you are shooting a Reveal movement using the Gimbal, it is best to put it in <strong>Locking mode</strong>. This mode works the best as it allows the camera to stay fixed in one frame making your footage seem balanced and of quality.</p>

The 180° Presentation Movement</h3><p>The next movement we will be looking at will be the 180° presentation movement. The 180° presentation will move in a half-circle fashion. It will move from one side of the subject to the other side. This will allow you to cover the overall subject’s view.</p>
<p>Apart from that, it will allow you to capture the background with much clarity and detail to maintain a general sense of the ambiance. Making a 180° presentation shot is fairly easy to do so. With its multiple uses, you can use this method in any scenario.</p>
<p>As we will move from one side to the other in a circular manner, we need to fix the frame of our video to move along. Using the <strong>POV</strong> <strong>mode</strong> of the Zhiyun Gimbal stabilizer will be the best option in this sense.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="gimbal fixed in pov mode"
                ></p>
<p>Setting the Gimbal in POV mode will allow you to shoot the video from more than one angle while keeping the video balanced. Follow the steps mentioned to shoot a 180° presentation video:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, start recording from one side of the subject while keeping the Gimbal in the POV mode.</li>
<li>Slowly start moving in front of the subject in an arch.</li>
<li>When you face the subject, do not stop and keep moving to complete the arch.</li>
<li>When you reach the end of the arch, close the video.</li>
</ul>

                      alt="the 180° presentation movement"
                ></p>
<p>By following the steps mentioned, you can create the 180° presentation movement using a smartphone. Now, move forward to learn about “The Following movement.”</p>
<h3 id="3-The-Following-Movement-1"><a href="#3-The-Following-Movement-1" class="headerlink" title="3. The Following Movement"></a>3. The Following Movement</h3><p>You can use “The following movement” when recording a scene in which the object moves in random directions. Or when there is a high degree of movement of your object in the video, and you want to fix the focus of your footage to that object.</p>
<p>The Following movement is not technically a movement, but a setting that will allow you to record the footage while keeping the object and the video frame focused. In this type of footage, we will use the Zhiyun Cami app to focus on our target object.</p>

                      alt="drawing a square to focus the subject"
                ></p>
<p>To focus on our subject in the video by Cami app, follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li>When recording the video, make sure to put the Gimbal on a tripod stand.</li>
<li>After that, open the <strong>Cami</strong> app and draw a square over the object you want to keep in focus.</li>
<li>Now, the camera will shift its angle to its perspective wherever the object goes.</li>
</ul>

Unfortunately, some social media platforms like Instagram require your video to be short. Therefore, many people wonder how to cut a video to make it easier to share. If you’re wondering how to cut video for Instagram on Mac, you’re in luck. This article shares the best tools to use for this purpose.</p>
<p><strong>What You Should Know About Instagram Video</strong></p>

<p>Instagram is a social media site owned by Facebook. However, its main focus is on sharing videos and photos. It also allows users to put up stories that only last 24 hours. Stories allow you to highlight some crucial aspects of your life. These stories could be made up of photos, texts, and videos. However, each story slide can only take up to 15 seconds of video.</p>
<p>Most times, your video would be longer than that. If you upload a video longer than the accepted 15 seconds, Instagram automatically trims it to 15 seconds. However, the resulting video might not be the parts you want to show to your audience. Maybe there’s a particular section you would like your followers to see. That’s why video cutters enter the picture.</p>
<p>A good video splitter to cut video for Instagram on Mac is necessary when you’re creating video content for your Instagram page. In addition, the video editing tool you choose must maintain the quality and the safety of the file. Therefore, we’ve selected the best tools to cut videos for Instagram on Mac. Next, we’ll explore these tools, highlighting their best features, cons, and how you can use them. On that note, let’s dive in.</p>

<p><strong>Which Should I Choose, Free or Paid Instagram Video Cutter?</strong></p>
<p>Now that you know the best free and paid video cutters to cut Instagram videos, you’re probably wondering what the ideal option is. With so many options, you must make the right decision for your project. You need to consider several factors before you decide if a paid or free Instagram video cutter is the best option for you.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Budget</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When deciding between a paid or free Instagram cutter, one crucial factor is how much you’re willing to pay. If your budget is really low and doesn’t fit into any paid options, you can simply go for a free option. However, if the price isn’t an issue for you, going for a paid option is best because it offers you more editing features to enhance your video.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ease of Use</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You should also consider how easy it is to use the video cutter. Some paid options are for professionals and can be challenging to understand. However, most free options offer poor performance times. The last thing Instagram users want is to devote hours to figure out where each tool is on the software. However, there are paid options with an intuitive interface that makes it easy to cut your Instagram video.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Customer Support</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You also need to consider whether customer support will be available when you need it. Some free options have no customer support to turn to. Instead, consider a video cutter that will offer helpful and responsive customer support when picking.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Video Format Support</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Before choosing a paid or free option, you need to consider if it would support the video format you prefer. You might be using different video formats, and you want to ensure you’re not limited to select options. You also want a video cutter that offers various output formats.</p>
<p><strong>FAQs about Cut Video For Instagram</strong></p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Various tools are available to help you cut a video for Instagram on Mac. Therefore, just refer to the paid and free tools listed above whenever you need a video cutter. These video cutters are highly recommended and ensure the quality isn’t affected while cutting the video. When deciding which is the best option for you, free or paid, the factors listed will help you decide. Suppose you’re looking specifically for a video cutter that offers you all the features you need to enhance your video while providing an intuitive user interface. In that case, Wondershare Filmora is the ideal choice.</p>
<p>Instagram is a social media site owned by Facebook. However, its main focus is on sharing videos and photos. It also allows users to put up stories that only last 24 hours. Stories allow you to highlight some crucial aspects of your life. These stories could be made up of photos, texts, and videos. However, each story slide can only take up to 15 seconds of video.</p>
<p>Most times, your video would be longer than that. If you upload a video longer than the accepted 15 seconds, Instagram automatically trims it to 15 seconds. However, the resulting video might not be the parts you want to show to your audience. Maybe there’s a particular section you would like your followers to see. That’s why video cutters enter the picture.</p>
<p>A good video splitter to cut video for Instagram on Mac is necessary when you’re creating video content for your Instagram page. In addition, the video editing tool you choose must maintain the quality and the safety of the file. Therefore, we’ve selected the best tools to cut videos for Instagram on Mac. Next, we’ll explore these tools, highlighting their best features, cons, and how you can use them. On that note, let’s dive in.</p>

<p>Now that you know the best free and paid video cutters to cut Instagram videos, you’re probably wondering what the ideal option is. With so many options, you must make the right decision for your project. You need to consider several factors before you decide if a paid or free Instagram video cutter is the best option for you.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Budget</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When deciding between a paid or free Instagram cutter, one crucial factor is how much you’re willing to pay. If your budget is really low and doesn’t fit into any paid options, you can simply go for a free option. However, if the price isn’t an issue for you, going for a paid option is best because it offers you more editing features to enhance your video.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ease of Use</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You should also consider how easy it is to use the video cutter. Some paid options are for professionals and can be challenging to understand. However, most free options offer poor performance times. The last thing Instagram users want is to devote hours to figure out where each tool is on the software. However, there are paid options with an intuitive interface that makes it easy to cut your Instagram video.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Customer Support</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You also need to consider whether customer support will be available when you need it. Some free options have no customer support to turn to. Instead, consider a video cutter that will offer helpful and responsive customer support when picking.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Video Format Support</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Before choosing a paid or free option, you need to consider if it would support the video format you prefer. You might be using different video formats, and you want to ensure you’re not limited to select options. You also want a video cutter that offers various output formats.</p>
<p><strong>FAQs about Cut Video For Instagram</strong></p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Various tools are available to help you cut a video for Instagram on Mac. Therefore, just refer to the paid and free tools listed above whenever you need a video cutter. These video cutters are highly recommended and ensure the quality isn’t affected while cutting the video. When deciding which is the best option for you, free or paid, the factors listed will help you decide. Suppose you’re looking specifically for a video cutter that offers you all the features you need to enhance your video while providing an intuitive user interface. In that case, Wondershare Filmora is the ideal choice.</p>
<p>Instagram is a social media site owned by Facebook. However, its main focus is on sharing videos and photos. It also allows users to put up stories that only last 24 hours. Stories allow you to highlight some crucial aspects of your life. These stories could be made up of photos, texts, and videos. However, each story slide can only take up to 15 seconds of video.</p>
<p>Most times, your video would be longer than that. If you upload a video longer than the accepted 15 seconds, Instagram automatically trims it to 15 seconds. However, the resulting video might not be the parts you want to show to your audience. Maybe there’s a particular section you would like your followers to see. That’s why video cutters enter the picture.</p>
<p>A good video splitter to cut video for Instagram on Mac is necessary when you’re creating video content for your Instagram page. In addition, the video editing tool you choose must maintain the quality and the safety of the file. Therefore, we’ve selected the best tools to cut videos for Instagram on Mac. Next, we’ll explore these tools, highlighting their best features, cons, and how you can use them. On that note, let’s dive in.</p>

<p><strong>Which Should I Choose, Free or Paid Instagram Video Cutter?</strong></p>
<p>Now that you know the best free and paid video cutters to cut Instagram videos, you’re probably wondering what the ideal option is. With so many options, you must make the right decision for your project. You need to consider several factors before you decide if a paid or free Instagram video cutter is the best option for you.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Budget</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When deciding between a paid or free Instagram cutter, one crucial factor is how much you’re willing to pay. If your budget is really low and doesn’t fit into any paid options, you can simply go for a free option. However, if the price isn’t an issue for you, going for a paid option is best because it offers you more editing features to enhance your video.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ease of Use</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You should also consider how easy it is to use the video cutter. Some paid options are for professionals and can be challenging to understand. However, most free options offer poor performance times. The last thing Instagram users want is to devote hours to figure out where each tool is on the software. However, there are paid options with an intuitive interface that makes it easy to cut your Instagram video.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Customer Support</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You also need to consider whether customer support will be available when you need it. Some free options have no customer support to turn to. Instead, consider a video cutter that will offer helpful and responsive customer support when picking.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Video Format Support</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Before choosing a paid or free option, you need to consider if it would support the video format you prefer. You might be using different video formats, and you want to ensure you’re not limited to select options. You also want a video cutter that offers various output formats.</p>
<p><strong>FAQs about Cut Video For Instagram</strong></p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Various tools are available to help you cut a video for Instagram on Mac. Therefore, just refer to the paid and free tools listed above whenever you need a video cutter. These video cutters are highly recommended and ensure the quality isn’t affected while cutting the video. When deciding which is the best option for you, free or paid, the factors listed will help you decide. Suppose you’re looking specifically for a video cutter that offers you all the features you need to enhance your video while providing an intuitive user interface. In that case, Wondershare Filmora is the ideal choice.</p>
<p>Instagram is a social media site owned by Facebook. However, its main focus is on sharing videos and photos. It also allows users to put up stories that only last 24 hours. Stories allow you to highlight some crucial aspects of your life. These stories could be made up of photos, texts, and videos. However, each story slide can only take up to 15 seconds of video.</p>
<p>Most times, your video would be longer than that. If you upload a video longer than the accepted 15 seconds, Instagram automatically trims it to 15 seconds. However, the resulting video might not be the parts you want to show to your audience. Maybe there’s a particular section you would like your followers to see. That’s why video cutters enter the picture.</p>
<p>A good video splitter to cut video for Instagram on Mac is necessary when you’re creating video content for your Instagram page. In addition, the video editing tool you choose must maintain the quality and the safety of the file. Therefore, we’ve selected the best tools to cut videos for Instagram on Mac. Next, we’ll explore these tools, highlighting their best features, cons, and how you can use them. On that note, let’s dive in.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Video Format Support</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Before choosing a paid or free option, you need to consider if it would support the video format you prefer. You might be using different video formats, and you want to ensure you’re not limited to select options. You also want a video cutter that offers various output formats.</p>
<p><strong>FAQs about Cut Video For Instagram</strong></p>
