In fact, there are different styles available that you can use in videos to create a specific feel in the viewers—case in point, strobe lights.</p>
<p>This technique involves a series of intense short flashes of light in sections of the clip that create a suspenseful or thrilling ambiance, amping up the horror feel in viewers and more. You might have seen many examples of this in horror movies, thrillers, suspense or action-filled movies, sci-fi films, etc. Similarly, adding the effect to the titles gives a cinematic feel to them.</p>
<p>As a film or video editor, are you interested in adding this effect to your own project as well? Luckily, you do not need significant technical know-how or invest in different types of high-grade equipment to manage it - <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> allows users to add the effect easily in the titles.

<p>First, visit the official website to download the software. The Download button at the top of the screen or the description box is available to click on. That will instantly allow the Filmora installer to download into your device.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Double-click on the installer from your notifications or browser downloads section, then click Install. Allow the prompt for permission approval when it comes up, and the installation process will begin. This would take a little bit of time, and you can tap on the Start Now button at the last window that opens.</p>

<h2 id="Add-the-title"><a href="#Add-the-title" class="headerlink" title="Add the title"></a>Add the title</h2><p>The editor will open automatically next. You have to tap on the Create New Project button to access the editing screen, tap on the Titles tab, and choose the Default Title. If you prefer another version, browse through the different title presets available as options and download the one you prefer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p>Then, drag the title from this section and drop it into the editing timeline. Double-click on the title in the timeline to open the title editing window. Insert the text you want to add as the title in the text field and adjust the size, font, and other font modifications here.</p>
<h2 id="Edit-the-title-and-click-snapshots"><a href="#Edit-the-title-and-click-snapshots" class="headerlink" title="Edit the title and click snapshots"></a>Edit the title and click snapshots</h2><p>Then, you should drag the title clip you added to the timeline to an upper section and click on the Media tab following that. Then, choose the Sample Color option from the listed menu and tap on the Black color choice. After doing so, drag it down to the timeline onto the track under the Default Title clip you added and moved up.</p>
<p>Consequently, click on the Snapshot icon at the right side of the toolbar just above the timeline. This will take a screenshot of the black color picture you added second.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="add second color image"
                ></p>
<p>Then you should double-click on the original Default Title you added and start editing your title text once more. This time, add the term you want to appear under your original title here. Adjust the font for it as something other than the original one. For example, if you put Motor Oil 1937 M54 as the first title font, set the second as Montserrat SemBold. Make more adjustments, if necessary, to the font. Then, retake a snapshot of it.</p>

<h2 id="Insert-the-snapshots"><a href="#Insert-the-snapshots" class="headerlink" title="Insert the snapshots"></a>Insert the snapshots</h2><p>Remove the two title clips you added to the timeline. You have to work with the Snapshots you took now.</p>
<p>It is possible that you will not see the Snapshots saved in your media folder. In this case, tap on the “Click here to insert media” section and go to the device library. It will open in the Wondershare Filmora folder; if not, search for it and access it.</p>
<p>In the folder, double-click on the Snapshot folder. Choose both of the Snapshots you saved right now from here and tap on Open to import them into Filmora.</p>

<p>Choose all files and click on Open to add them to the Filmora software. Now starts the process of merging them all into one cohesive effect.</p>

<h2 id="Drag-the-files-into-the-timeline"><a href="#Drag-the-files-into-the-timeline" class="headerlink" title="Drag the files into the timeline"></a>Drag the files into the timeline</h2><p>The background video is the first file you will drag and drop to the timeline. For the best effect, choose a flashing light background video. Next, drag the first title you edited into Track 2, right above the first one. Make sure to adjust the length of the clip to match the background video length. Repeat the same for the second snapshot, adding it above the first snapshot in the timeline.</p>

After that, click on snapshot 1 and tap on the Chroma Key icon in the toolbar right above the timeline.</p>
<p>When the Chroma Key window opens, tap on the Select Color option and go to the “More…” option. Tap on the basic white color and click on OK.</p>
<p>Following it, move the slider for Edge Thickness to extend it and see the preview to know if you are satisfied with the amount. Then, click on the unhide icon for the second snapshot.

<h2 id="Add-the-initial-keyframes"><a href="#Add-the-initial-keyframes" class="headerlink" title="Add the initial keyframes"></a>Add the initial keyframes</h2><p>Choose the first snapshot in the timeline, below the second snapshot, and above the background video clip. Then, double-click on it to open the editor window and choose the Animation tab this time instead of Image.</p>
<p>Add the keyframe here and change the value of the Scale parameter to 400 or something high like that. In the preview, you will see that most of the font in this title is out of frame. After this, click on Rotate and turn the font to 45 degrees.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>Move your playhead on this snapshot clip in the timeline by at least 1 second. Then, add another keyframe in this location by tapping the Add button. Here, reset the Scale and Rotate parameters and press the OK button to end.</p>
<h2 id="Add-the-lens-flare-and-particle-video"><a href="#Add-the-lens-flare-and-particle-video" class="headerlink" title="Add the lens flare and particle video"></a>Add the lens flare and particle video</h2><p>Next, go back to the media section where all the files you added are present and drag your lens flare clip to the timeline, right on the track above the last one you added. Drop it here and adjust the length of it to match others if it does not show that automatically.</p>
<p>Above it, drag and drop the Particles video from the media files you added previously onto the track above the lens flare one. Do the same to delete the spare part by moving the play head to that point, clicking on the scissor icon, and removing the extra part.</p>
<p>Then, double-click on this Particles video clip on the timeline and go to the Compositing section. Tap on the Blending Mode drop-down choice and choose the Screen option. Press OK. Next, repeat the same for the lens flare video and tap the OK button.</p>
<p>Now, play the preview again.</p>

Now, you have to click on the unhide icon beside it.</p>
<p>Move the play head to the 3-second mark from the beginning. If you need clarification on this, check if the lens flare effect is beginning to start below the first title at this point. Move your playhead to that point for the second snapshot.</p>
<p>Here, tap on the Split icon and remove the clip’s first half. Then, double-click on the second half and go to Animation. Press the Add button to insert a keyframe here and change the scale and position of the title at this point. Move it to the placement you want, right above the lens flare. Also, drag the slider for the Opacity parameter to zero at this point.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="drag the slider for opacity"
                ></p>
<p>Subsequently, move the play head to the point when the lens flare effect stop, which is around 2 seconds more. At this point, you have to add another keyframe and change the Opacity to 100.</p>
<p>Play the preview of the whole thing to see how the effect looks in completion.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Indeed, the strobe light effect in the title of movies or videos of different lengths can effectively create a heart-stopping moment on the screen. Moreover, it can work to incite a feeling of anticipation in viewers, especially with the right music beat in the backdrop.</p>

<p>It helps to indulge the audience with your content and show the after and before transitions. You can try this with any object or any character. But first, let’s figure out the requirements for rotating effects.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Prerequisites-to-Make-a-Rotating-Video-Effect"><a href="#Part-2-Prerequisites-to-Make-a-Rotating-Video-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Prerequisites to Make a Rotating Video Effect"></a>Part 2. Prerequisites to Make a Rotating Video Effect</h2><p>You will need a few items to create a rotating transition video. First, look at the fundamental priorities for creating this feature.</p>
<h3 id="The-Subject-Matters"><a href="#The-Subject-Matters" class="headerlink" title="The Subject Matters"></a>The Subject Matters</h3><p>To record a successful rotating video, you need a person or a subject to perform in front of the camera. It can be a model hired by a brand, a social influencer, or maybe it’s you. Keep in mind the following things before recording:</p>
<ul>
<li>The person should get two different costumes.</li>
<li>All the actions need to be rehearsed before shooting</li>
<li>Show affinity and control of the camera.</li>
</ul>

                ></p>
<h3 id="Shotting-Equipment"><a href="#Shotting-Equipment" class="headerlink" title="Shotting Equipment"></a>Shotting Equipment</h3><p>To record a professional video, you need a good camera. You can use a smartphone to record this footage. There is no need to have a tripod stand or any gear to hold the camera because the camera will be in a rotating position, the same as the subject’s hand.</p>
<p>For this, you need a filmmaker or any person living with you. Just give instructions as shown below to him to record a perfect video for yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Record the whole video in just one direction.</li>
<li>Don’t <strong>shake</strong> the camera because it gives blurry footage.</li>
<li>Ensure to <strong>focus</strong> on the subject during recording.</li>
<li>Don’t <strong>zoom</strong> in or out while recording the video.</li>
<li>Keep the subject in the <strong>middle</strong> of the frame during the recording process.</li>
<li>The <strong>hand rotation</strong> timing is the same as the camera’s rotation.</li>
</ul>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Ensure to record one footage multiple times so that you can choose the perfect one later for editing.</p>

<h3 id="Filming-of-the-First-Footage"><a href="#Filming-of-the-First-Footage" class="headerlink" title="Filming of the First Footage"></a>Filming of the First Footage</h3><p>To make the footage for the rotating video illusion, we have to record it at least twice to get crystal clear and high-resolution results. Therefore, ensure that we have camera movement in the same direction during all recording times.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can film the video either in the vertical format of the camera or in horizontal format. It all depends upon your script!</p>
<p>Follow the below-mentioned steps to record the first footage for the video:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hold the camera in a perfect format, whatever you choose.</li>
<li>Let the subject stand or sit in the middle of the frame.</li>
<li>The filmmaker can rotate the camera when the subject’s hand rotates.</li>
<li>Try your best to rotate the camera 180 degrees.</li>
<li>Ensure that the camera lens faces the ground at the end of the rotation.</li>
</ul>

                ></p>
<p>After filming the first footage for the video, it’s time to record the second footage to transition between the two.</p>
<h3 id="Filming-of-the-Second-Footage"><a href="#Filming-of-the-Second-Footage" class="headerlink" title="Filming of the Second Footage"></a>Filming of the Second Footage</h3><p>To create a second shot, you have to remember that the costume and location of the filming are different from the first footage. Follow the below steps to record it:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first step is to hold the camera in the same direction as the first footage.</li>
<li>When editing, make sure the subject’s position matches the first footage.</li>
<li>Make sure the subject’s hand movement is in the opposite direction from the first shot.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Stop Aiming to Become a Perfectionist</strong></p>
<p>Considering the fact that you are crafting the storyboard just for the purpose of depicting a sequence of video shots, do not aim at defining every element in comprehensive detail. Instead of making a fresh attempt to depict every minor change, pay more attention towards highlighting the significant points of action within a particular scene.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Prefer Numbering the Storyboard Panels</strong></p>

You should hence, proceed with the latter’s crafting process while keeping a close reference with the drafted script. Also, it becomes greatly important to add the imaginative element to your creation to avoid creating an bland and customary impression on the audience.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Feedback Has a Great Importance</strong></p>
<p>Make sure to showcase your storyboard to your project investors, prior to beginning with the film creation process. This will aid you with an escape from the unnecessary changes that can pop out from the audience at the last minute, leading to an unwanted financial expense. Pay attention to gather and work on the feedback of the viewers and start the actual creation process only after everything seems to be well settled.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Enjoy Your Work</strong></p>
<p>Enjoying the different aspects of your work is the key to achieve mastery at your craft and a welcoming response from the audience. Accepted that the storyboarding process is mind straining and time consuming, but taking on the challenge with a fun centered attitude will let your hard work shine on in front of the viewers.</p>
