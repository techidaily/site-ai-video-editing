<h3 id="10Neo-Tokyo-3"><a href="#10Neo-Tokyo-3" class="headerlink" title="10Neo-Tokyo"></a>10Neo-Tokyo</h3><p><strong>Major Attractions</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Compiling 3 short stories into a single movie, this one is an experiment of brilliance in the anime world</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The engaging storylines of each of the 3 shorts will never let you have enough of the movie with a desire to stream one more time</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The directors aim to tell the stories in an animated poetic style that suits the theme of the plot.</p>
<p>Introduced to the anime cinema in 1987, Neo-Tokyo was initially addressed as Manie Manie: Labyrinth Tales. The movie is a split-up craft of the biggest names in the anime world and features shots directed by Yoshiaki Kawajiri, Katsuhiro Otomo and Rintaro. The film got its existing name during its re-release in 1989 by Streamline Pictures to avoid a title clash with Otomo’s allied production Akira, that had hit the screens in the same year.</p>
<p>Viewing through the specific shorts in particular, the ‘Labyrinth Labyrinthos’ directed by Rintaro is inspired by German Expressionism in cohesion with the craft of Salvador Dali. The plot follows Sachi, a notorious young girl who, via the dresser’s looking glass, gets drawn into the gloomy space of a hallucinating quirkiness, along with Cicerone, her pet kitten.</p>
<p>As of ‘The Running Man’ directed by Yoshiaki Kawajiri, the latter is an ugly science fiction noir short that draws its inspiration from Blade Runner. The storyteller here is a sports correspondent who gets the privilege to see Jack Hugh’s last race. This legendary sports star of a dangerous running tournament was then reported to have imbibed fatal psionic tendencies.</p>
<p>Reserving the best for the last, here enters ‘Construction Cancellation Order’, the last short directed by Katsuhiro Omoto. The story progresses with the journey of Tsutomu Sugioka, who is sent to a fictitious and remote area in Aloana Republic, a city in South America by his seniors. His job is to shut down Facility 444, a remote construction project of his Japanese company.</p>
<p>Put collectively, Neo-Tokyo is a masterpiece of technical excellence that showcases the bright future of amine movies, provided that they are crafted by the most unique film creators of the anime world.</p>
<p><strong>Hot Comments</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The movie is a fantastic and cohesive alignment of 3 non-connected stories in one frame to represent an integration that is nothing short of magic</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The movie is a gorgeous play of twisted blocks and designs that conveniently takes the shape of a really great anthology flick</p>

<p>Have you ever had a video with good audio but poor visual quality?

There are many reasons why your video could look dark and unappealing. Brightening a video is a great way to remove your editing mistakes and add some artistic flair to your videos. Some editing software has this option built-in, but if you use Windows 10 to edit, it’s hard to find out how to brighten a video in Windows 10 without the help of additional software.</p>

Windows 10 has an easy-to-use video editing app. This is handy for simple home video editing, but it doesn’t work well for professional movie making.

<p>You can use it to trim videos or create your own home movies and slideshows. You can even have it create videos automatically by taking photos as you go. Forget about buying expensive editing software. With Windows 10, you have a free video editor built into the operating system where you can trim videos, create home movies, and even create automatic montages. You’ll be surprised at what you can do without ever leaving the Windows 10 Photos app.</p>

What is Motion Blur Effects</h2><p>Let’s start with a little introduction before learning how to apply motion blur. The visual result of an item moving while being photographed in conjunction with the shutter speed of the camera is called motion blur. When we swiftly move our heads from side to side, this effect also naturally occurs with our eyes, but we aren’t aware of it since our brains “edit” it for us. It may be startling and awkward to watch when items are moving on the screen, particularly rapid motion, without any kind of blurring effect.</p>
<p>Motion blur was introduced into animation to aid in the blending of frames and replicate the blurring that was seen in earlier cameras as a result of fast-moving objects. When a moving item keeps moving while light is still reaching our eyes, motion blur results. The goal of Motion Blur in After Effects is to replicate this phenomenon. After Effects will duplicate your layer several times when it changes in size or location. Then, it will offset it in various ways. This is closely related to the direction and pace of your layer’s animation.</p>
<p>These days, we have cameras with fast shutter speeds, which allows us to almost completely remove motion blur. Without motion blurring, each frame of your animation is like a flawless still image, making the action seem a little disorienting. Each picture captures the exact moment in time, despite the fluid motion. However, the absence of motion blur is what viewers do notice. Because of this, visual effects creators often use artificial motion blur in their effects to replicate what the viewer would experience if the element were really there in the picture.</p>

It doesn’t matter why you want to make a slow-motion sequence; After Effects’ slow-motion effect will work well. Click the Motion Blur layer switch to turn Motion Blur on or off. Make sure you can render out Motion Blur by turning on the Enable Motion Blur composition option at the top of the Timeline panel.</p>
<p>Using the motion blur option in your layer settings is the first and easiest approach to apply motion blur in After Effects. You’ll see many choices on the left and right sides of the screen after choosing a certain video. There are several techniques to motion blur a video, which we wish to accomplish. But because this guide is for novices, we will choose the simpler option. Follow the steps below to learn how to add motion blur to a video in AE:</p>
<p><strong>Steps to Add Motion Blur to After Effects:</strong></p>
<p>So, it goes without saying that After Effects makes it simple to access Motion Blur’s magic. You should shoot the movie at a frame rate that is faster than the average if you want the greatest slow-motion effects. How many photos are being captured each second is indicated by the frame rate.</p>
<p>Step1 Download and install Adobe After Effects if it isn’t already on your PC. Since Adobe After Effects is a commercial program, it is not available for free. Open the program after installation. After installation, launch it and choose “New Project” to begin editing a brand-new file. Look through the video you wish to alter.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p>Step2 You have a variety of settings in Adobe After Effects on the right side. Then, choose “Effects &amp; Presets.” A search bar will appear as a result. Enter “CC Force Motion Blur” in the search field if you wish to add motion blur to the video. You may apply this effect to whatever layer you choose since your movie is made up of layers.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step3 Next, drag the “CC Force Motion Blur” to the layers that represent your imported video at the bottom left of the screen. On the left side of the screen, under “CC Force Motion Blur,” you will find settings for motion blur. Here, you may change the motion blur to suit your needs. You may type in the values and watch the video as appropriate. There are several choices available for you to modify.</p>

                      alt="note"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Before applying any speed effects, first trim your film to the proper length. Once the speed effects have been included, you need also make sure that your composition is lengthy enough for your clip. Once you’re satisfied with the footage you want to slow down, choose one of the ways—Time warp or Time Stretch.</p>
<p>Step4 Customize “Shutter Angle” and “Motion Blur Samples.” Always be careful to preview the video after any modifications. Adjust to your needs and specifications. Additionally, if you wish, you may add any additional effect to the video. When finished, save the video by selecting “File” in the upper left corner.</p>
