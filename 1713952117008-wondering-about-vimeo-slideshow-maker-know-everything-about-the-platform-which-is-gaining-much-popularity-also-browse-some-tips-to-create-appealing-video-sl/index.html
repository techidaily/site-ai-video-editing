<h2 id="Part-2-Tips-for-a-Great-Slideshow-Video"><a href="#Part-2-Tips-for-a-Great-Slideshow-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Tips for a Great Slideshow Video"></a>Part 2 Tips for a Great Slideshow Video</h2><p>Videos are gaining much popularity these days. It is an easy way to connect with people and show emotions to them. In the same way, slideshow videos also are important in their place. Slides are the collection of traditional photos or negatives which are out of trend now. And slideshow videos are the perfect way to use those slides and relieve those faded memories with loved ones. Creating the slideshow video is also easy and can be done easily with the help of some tools. You don’t need to be professional, but the only need is to follow certain tips carefully. Here, we are sharing the essential tips to prepare a great slideshow video. Also, you will get to know about the best tool for video creation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Tell a story</strong></p>
<p>Prepare the slideshow video in the form of storytelling. Whatever is the theme of your slideshow, prepare the script of the video right from the start. Make a meaningful and impressive story. Select and collect the raw materials according to the requirement.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Keep it cohesive</strong></p>
<p>The cohesion of photos or images is very important in a video slideshow. It is advised not to mix and match still photos and videos in 1 slideshow. Also, choose the photos belonging to the same color family. Mixing different varieties of photos divert the attention of the viewer. Also, one warm photo, then one cool and so on are not the efficient choices for a slideshow. All the images should appear as part of one color family and are similar to one another. Always maintain the quality of photos throughout the slideshow. Gradual jumps between grainy portrait mode photos and some screenshots, meanwhile photos of other modes lead to distracting the viewer and blurring their experience.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Make it personal</strong></p>
<p>Video slideshows are a powerful tool to show your personality and your personal message. The videos should contain your feelings. So, customize them and make them as personal as you can. Give your uniqueness to your slideshows. For this, you can customize the color palette, text, etc and make them unique and personal. So that the people with whom you share the videos may also feel your touch.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Keep slideshow videos short</strong></p>
<p>There might be different aims for creating a slideshow video. You might want to share it with loved ones or any of your friends’ circle. Or you might be wanting it to post as an ad on social media platforms such as Instagram, or Facebook. Whatever the purpose of your making the video, keep them concise and short. Short video clips are best for grabbing the attention of the viewers. Everyone does not find it interesting to watch long-form videos. If you are aiming to make a longer-form video slideshow which contains both images and video clips, then keep each photo for 3 to 5 seconds and each video clip a maximum of 20 seconds. It is recommended to maintain the user’s interest throughout.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Create a storyboard to plan your slideshow video</strong></p>
<p>As we have already discussed in the above point, the video should depict your story. Also, it should be in sync to make it more compelling. Creating a storyboard or outline is the perfect way to predict the right flow as well as choose the right elements for the video.</p>
<p>The storyboard helps to prepare a plan and develop the logical sequence of the photos. Also, if you want to add photos, video clips, texts, etc in a single slideshow, the storyboard can help to outline the sequence. With this, you will be able to create a video that will be logically correct.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Add text to videos and images to convey your message clearly</strong></p>
<p>Text or captions are very crucial to be added to the slideshow especially if you are preparing them for social media. People these days do watch the videos by keeping the sound off on social media. So, they will not be able to get your message without captions. Keep all your key messages highlighted in the video. The first few seconds of the video play an important role. It is the deciding factor whether the viewer will watch the whole video or will just bounce back. So, give a captivating hook to the slideshow to capture the viewer’s attention and make them hit the unmute button.</p>

It is an easy way to connect with people and show emotions to them. In the same way, slideshow videos also are important in their place. Slides are the collection of traditional photos or negatives which are out of trend now. And slideshow videos are the perfect way to use those slides and relieve those faded memories with loved ones.

Here, we are sharing the essential tips to prepare a great slideshow video. Also, you will get to know about the best tool for video creation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Tell a story</strong></p>
<p>Prepare the slideshow video in the form of storytelling. Whatever is the theme of your slideshow, prepare the script of the video right from the start. Make a meaningful and impressive story. Select and collect the raw materials according to the requirement.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Keep it cohesive</strong></p>
<p>The cohesion of photos or images is very important in a video slideshow. It is advised not to mix and match still photos and videos in 1 slideshow. Also, choose the photos belonging to the same color family. Mixing different varieties of photos divert the attention of the viewer. Also, one warm photo, then one cool and so on are not the efficient choices for a slideshow. All the images should appear as part of one color family and are similar to one another. Always maintain the quality of photos throughout the slideshow. Gradual jumps between grainy portrait mode photos and some screenshots, meanwhile photos of other modes lead to distracting the viewer and blurring their experience.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Make it personal</strong></p>
<p>Video slideshows are a powerful tool to show your personality and your personal message. The videos should contain your feelings. So, customize them and make them as personal as you can. Give your uniqueness to your slideshows. For this, you can customize the color palette, text, etc and make them unique and personal. So that the people with whom you share the videos may also feel your touch.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Keep slideshow videos short</strong></p>
<p>There might be different aims for creating a slideshow video. You might want to share it with loved ones or any of your friends’ circle. Or you might be wanting it to post as an ad on social media platforms such as Instagram, or Facebook. Whatever the purpose of your making the video, keep them concise and short. Short video clips are best for grabbing the attention of the viewers. Everyone does not find it interesting to watch long-form videos. If you are aiming to make a longer-form video slideshow which contains both images and video clips, then keep each photo for 3 to 5 seconds and each video clip a maximum of 20 seconds. It is recommended to maintain the user’s interest throughout.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Create a storyboard to plan your slideshow video</strong></p>
<p>As we have already discussed in the above point, the video should depict your story. Also, it should be in sync to make it more compelling. Creating a storyboard or outline is the perfect way to predict the right flow as well as choose the right elements for the video.</p>
<p>The storyboard helps to prepare a plan and develop the logical sequence of the photos. Also, if you want to add photos, video clips, texts, etc in a single slideshow, the storyboard can help to outline the sequence. With this, you will be able to create a video that will be logically correct.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Add text to videos and images to convey your message clearly</strong></p>
<p>Text or captions are very crucial to be added to the slideshow especially if you are preparing them for social media. People these days do watch the videos by keeping the sound off on social media. So, they will not be able to get your message without captions. Keep all your key messages highlighted in the video. The first few seconds of the video play an important role. It is the deciding factor whether the viewer will watch the whole video or will just bounce back. So, give a captivating hook to the slideshow to capture the viewer’s attention and make them hit the unmute button.</p>

<p>What is a Lower Third</p>
<p>A lower third is text and&#x2F;or a graphical element put on top of your video for the purpose of sharing information with your audience.</p>
<p>A lower third provides important information but is done without distracting from the actual video content.</p>
<p>Take a look at the shot below. The lower third is used to convey the speaker’s name and profession. This is a type of lower third often used in documentary films and newscasts.</p>
<h2 id="2-Why-Add-A-Lower-Third"><a href="#2-Why-Add-A-Lower-Third" class="headerlink" title="2. Why Add A Lower Third"></a>2. Why Add A Lower Third</h2><p>So the next question a new filmmaker might ask is, “Why add a lower third?”</p>
<p>Funnily enough, despite its name, a lower third does not have to be in the lower third of the video but can be found in other areas of the screen.</p>
<p>In the shot below, the viewer automatically knows he is looking at the rooftops of Alfama, a neighborhood in Lisbon, without someone having to say it - no distractions from the video content.</p>

<p>Why Add A Lower Third</p>
<p>Lower thirds can also create movement. Many lower thirds come gliding onto the screen and add visual interest to a plain shot.</p>
<p>As simple as it may sound, seeing an overlay on a screen or a moving lower third adds professionalism to even the simplest videos. It gives the audience a sense of polish and high perceived value.</p>

<p><strong>Tips:</strong> A lower third lasts approximately 3-6 seconds and is placed in the “title safe area” of your video. A quick explanation of the “title safe area” is that if the video is cropped to fit certain resolutions, your lower third will still appear without the fear of it being cropped out and losing pertinent information for the audience.</p>

<p>What is a Lower Third</p>
<p>A lower third is text and&#x2F;or a graphical element put on top of your video for the purpose of sharing information with your audience.</p>
<p>A lower third provides important information but is done without distracting from the actual video content.</p>
<p>Take a look at the shot below. The lower third is used to convey the speaker’s name and profession. This is a type of lower third often used in documentary films and newscasts.</p>
<h2 id="2-Why-Add-A-Lower-Third-1"><a href="#2-Why-Add-A-Lower-Third-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Why Add A Lower Third"></a>2. Why Add A Lower Third</h2><p>So the next question a new filmmaker might ask is, “Why add a lower third?”</p>
<p>Funnily enough, despite its name, a lower third does not have to be in the lower third of the video but can be found in other areas of the screen.</p>
<p>In the shot below, the viewer automatically knows he is looking at the rooftops of Alfama, a neighborhood in Lisbon, without someone having to say it - no distractions from the video content.</p>

<p>Why Add A Lower Third</p>
<p>Lower thirds can also create movement. Many lower thirds come gliding onto the screen and add visual interest to a plain shot.</p>
<p>As simple as it may sound, seeing an overlay on a screen or a moving lower third adds professionalism to even the simplest videos. It gives the audience a sense of polish and high perceived value.</p>

<h2 id="Easy-Ways-to-Edit-Recorded-Video"><a href="#Easy-Ways-to-Edit-Recorded-Video" class="headerlink" title="Easy Ways to Edit Recorded Video"></a>Easy Ways to Edit Recorded Video</h2><p>The most critical component of post-production for a video marketer is editing. Your video will seem unfinished and repel your viewers if you cannot effortlessly weave your images together or get your cut to reach the proper frame. Learning to edit a video may soon become a never-ending task. While each project you work on will have somewhat different editing needs, the principles of video editing remain basically the same. You don’t need to spend a lot on costly equipment to have a professional appearance; if you pay attention to a few important things, you can produce excellent movies with whatever you have right now.</p>
<p>Content producers, entrepreneurs, and influencers can have much too much material to include into a single YouTube video. You may not be able to buy video editing software if you’re on a tight budget. So, what does a video marketer do if they don’t have editing software? To assist you with the process of video editing, we’ve put up this thorough tutorial that covers everything you’ll need to know to make stunning films, even if you’ve never done it before. We’ll also demonstrate how to utilize the super-intuitive and user-friendly editor to create a video.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Edit-Recorded-Video-in-OBS"><a href="#Part-1-Edit-Recorded-Video-in-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Edit Recorded Video in OBS"></a><strong>Part 1. Edit Recorded Video in OBS</strong></h2><p>OBS is a video streaming and recording application. It’s open source, free, and works on Macs, Windows, and Linux. It is a strong and adaptable screencast video creation tool when paired with competent audio and video editing tools. Unfortunately, OBS doesn’t support editing feature and hence, we’re enlisting the recording steps so you can edit them by using a third-party toolkit mentioned in the guide.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1. Download and Install OBS</strong></p>
<p>Install OBS according to the instructions for your operating system by downloading it from the link below.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2. Setup Screen Recording</strong></p>
<p>The window is divided into separate parts called “docks” when you initially launch the app. Every dock has a distinct function. Scenes, Sources, Mixer, and Controls are the areas to pay attention to. OBS employs a Scenes and Sources system, which will be discussed in more depth in a later lesson. These two tools operate in tandem to help you keep track of your video, audio, and other production materials. When you first start OBS, you’ll see that a scene is already loaded, which you can locate in the bottom left corner of the interface.</p>

<h2 id="Part-3-The-Common-Reasons-If-You-Can’t-Adjust-the-Length-of-TikTok-Video"><a href="#Part-3-The-Common-Reasons-If-You-Can’t-Adjust-the-Length-of-TikTok-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. The Common Reasons If You Can’t Adjust the Length of TikTok Video"></a>Part 3. The Common Reasons If You Can’t Adjust the Length of TikTok Video</h2><p>Hope the above part will prove helpful to you in terms of adjusting the TikTok video using Wondershare Filmora. Now, let’s see what the common reasons which hinder users from adjusting the length of TikTok Videos are:</p>
<h3 id="1-The-Video-is-Too-Short"><a href="#1-The-Video-is-Too-Short" class="headerlink" title="1. The Video is Too Short"></a>1. The Video is Too Short</h3><p>Most TikTok users worry about <strong>why they can’t adjust TikTok clip length.</strong> The common reason behind this query is the short length of the video. If your video length is 3 seconds, then it would not be possible to shorten it further on TikTok. Thus, try to make a Video of at least 15 seconds to upload it on TikTok successfully.</p>
<h3 id="2-The-Video-is-Too-Long"><a href="#2-The-Video-is-Too-Long" class="headerlink" title="2. The Video is Too Long"></a>2. The Video is Too Long</h3><p>If you have recorded a too-long video, it would not be possible to adjust its length on TikTok. Too long videos, especially more than 10 minutes, are less likely to be modified by TikTok. For that, you can take the help of Filmora to adjust its size. Filmora will trim the video to a suitable length within seconds.</p>
<h3 id="3-Using-Green-Screen-or-Other-Incompatible-Effects"><a href="#3-Using-Green-Screen-or-Other-Incompatible-Effects" class="headerlink" title="3. Using Green Screen or Other Incompatible Effects"></a>3. Using Green Screen or Other Incompatible Effects</h3><p>Sometimes people use those effects in videos that are difficult to edit. For example, using a green screen creates some technical issues in your video, which gets weirder when you try to adjust the length of such a video. Due to this, proper adjustments in such videos are difficult to do on TikTok.</p>
<h3 id="4-App-Glitch"><a href="#4-App-Glitch" class="headerlink" title="4. App Glitch"></a>4. App Glitch</h3><p>As many people are engaged in using TikTok, so sometimes the app slows down. It becomes pretty difficult to adjust the length of TikTok videos when the app shows glitches. However, on Filmora, the case is totally the opposite. You will never face any difficulty, no matter how many users are using it.</p>
