                      alt="freeze frame has a paper texture"
                ></p>
<p>Step8 Now you can use the new feature of Filmora to export this small portion of the video. First, click and drag the playhead to the start of the freeze frame and press <strong>“I”</strong> on the keyboard to set the <strong>IN POINT</strong>, then move the playhead to the end of this freeze frame and press <strong>“O”</strong> on the keyboard to set the <strong>OUT POINT</strong>.</p>

                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-09.png"
                      alt="setting the in point"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you have the latest version, Filmora will automatically set the OUT POINT on the timeline.</p>
<p>Step9 Then click <strong>Export</strong> and choose <strong>Create Video</strong>. Let’s name it <strong>freeze frame 1</strong> and click on Export.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-010.png"
                      alt="selecting create a video"
                ></p>
<p>It will only export the selected part on the timeline. Once the exporting process is completed, <strong>Right-Click</strong> on the timeline and <strong>Cancel</strong> the selected range.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-011.png"
                      alt="exporting the video"
                ></p>
<p>Step10 Import the <strong>Freeze Frame 1</strong> to the media folder and replace the <strong>Freeze Frame + Paper Photo</strong> with this clip. Then adjust the length of this clip to 1 second.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-012.png"
                      alt="replaced the freeze frame and paper photo"
                ></p>
<p>Step11 Now let’s make the second part of the transition effect. You should drag and Drop <strong>Clip 2</strong> onto the timeline and move the playhead to the clip’s first frame. Then Add a Freeze Frame; you can also do it by pressing the <strong>Alt+F</strong> keys. Now click and drag the playhead to the end of the freeze frame and make a <strong>Cut</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-013.png"
                      alt="adding clip 2 to the timeline"
                ></p>
<p>Step12 Drag and drop the paper photo onto the second video track of the timeline and make sure it starts at the beginning of the freeze frame on the first video track. And again, change the blending mode to Multiply as well.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-014.png"
                      alt="adding paper photo"
                ></p>
<p>Step13 Select the range you want to export by setting <strong>IN and OUT</strong> points as we did before. Press the <strong>I</strong> key on the keyboard to set the in point, drag the playhead to the out point, and press the <strong>O</strong> key.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-015.png"
                      alt="selecting in and out points"
                ></p>
<p>Step14 This time use the shortcut <strong>Control + E</strong> to open the export window. Again, let’s name it <strong>freeze frame 2</strong> and then export it.</p>
<p>Step15 You can use the keyboard shortcut <strong>Shift + X</strong> to cancel the selected range. Then import <strong>freeze frame 2</strong> into the media folder and replace the freeze frame + paper photo. Adjust the length of this new clip to about 1 second.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-016.png"
                      alt="replaced the freeze frame and paper photo"
                ></p>
<p>Step16 Now you can add several Filmora transitions to finish the effect. Go to the <strong>Transitions window</strong> and find Evaporate 2.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-017.png"
                      alt="select the transition effect"
                ></p>
<p>Step17 Drag and drop it onto the cut between <strong>clip 1</strong> and <strong>freeze frame 1</strong> and the cut between <strong>clip 2</strong> and <strong>freeze frame 2</strong>. You can also adjust the length of the transition.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-018.png"
                      alt="dropping the transition effect"
                ></p>
<p>Step18 Then, find <strong>Torned Paper Transition 4</strong> in the <strong>Transitions window</strong>. Drag and drop it to the cut between <strong>freeze frame 1</strong> and <strong>freeze frame 2</strong>. Then choose <strong>Prefix</strong> mode in the transition setting video. Adjust the length if needed.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="dropping another transition effect"
                ></p>
<p>Finally, it’s done. Let’s play the video and see how the paper effect and transitions enhanced the video.</p>

If you have already downloaded the Wondershare Filmora. Open it, and let’s start editing the video.</p>
<p>Step2 First, we need to find a photo of a white paper that you can easily download from the internet and two videos in which you want to add this effect. Then import these three files to the media gallery.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-03.png"
                      alt="drag-drop clip 1"
                ></p>
<p>Alt text: Paper rip effect.</p>
<p>Step4 Now right-click on <strong>Clip 1</strong> to open the menu and select <strong>Add Freeze Frame</strong>.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="selecting add freeze frame"
                ></p>
<p>Step5 After adding a freeze frame, cut here.</p>

                      alt="adding a cut"
                ></p>
<p>Step6 Drag and drop the paper photo onto the second video track of the timeline, and make sure it starts at the cut on the first video track.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="dropping paper photo"
                ></p>
<p>Step7 Double-click the paper picture on the timeline to open the settings window and then open the <strong>Compositing</strong> menu. Then Change the <strong>Blending Mode</strong> from Normal to <strong>Multiply</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="opening compositing menu"
                ></p>
<p>In the preview window, we can see that the freeze frame has the paper texture now!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="freeze frame has a paper texture"
                ></p>
<p>Step8 Now you can use the new feature of Filmora to export this small portion of the video. First, click and drag the playhead to the start of the freeze frame and press <strong>“I”</strong> on the keyboard to set the <strong>IN POINT</strong>, then move the playhead to the end of this freeze frame and press <strong>“O”</strong> on the keyboard to set the <strong>OUT POINT</strong>.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you have the latest version, Filmora will automatically set the OUT POINT on the timeline.</p>
<p>Step9 Then click <strong>Export</strong> and choose <strong>Create Video</strong>. Let’s name it <strong>freeze frame 1</strong> and click on Export.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="selecting create a video"
                ></p>
<p>It will only export the selected part on the timeline. Once the exporting process is completed, <strong>Right-Click</strong> on the timeline and <strong>Cancel</strong> the selected range.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="exporting the video"
                ></p>
<p>Step10 Import the <strong>Freeze Frame 1</strong> to the media folder and replace the <strong>Freeze Frame + Paper Photo</strong> with this clip. Then adjust the length of this clip to 1 second.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="replaced the freeze frame and paper photo"
                ></p>
<p>Step11 Now let’s make the second part of the transition effect. You should drag and Drop <strong>Clip 2</strong> onto the timeline and move the playhead to the clip’s first frame. Then Add a Freeze Frame; you can also do it by pressing the <strong>Alt+F</strong> keys. Now click and drag the playhead to the end of the freeze frame and make a <strong>Cut</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adding clip 2 to the timeline"
                ></p>
<p>Step12 Drag and drop the paper photo onto the second video track of the timeline and make sure it starts at the beginning of the freeze frame on the first video track. And again, change the blending mode to Multiply as well.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/paper-rip-effect-014.png"
                      alt="adding paper photo"
                ></p>
<p>Step13 Select the range you want to export by setting <strong>IN and OUT</strong> points as we did before. Press the <strong>I</strong> key on the keyboard to set the in point, drag the playhead to the out point, and press the <strong>O</strong> key.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="selecting in and out points"
                ></p>
<p>Step14 This time use the shortcut <strong>Control + E</strong> to open the export window. Again, let’s name it <strong>freeze frame 2</strong> and then export it.</p>
<p>Step15 You can use the keyboard shortcut <strong>Shift + X</strong> to cancel the selected range. Then import <strong>freeze frame 2</strong> into the media folder and replace the freeze frame + paper photo. Adjust the length of this new clip to about 1 second.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="replaced the freeze frame and paper photo"
                ></p>
<p>Step16 Now you can add several Filmora transitions to finish the effect. Go to the <strong>Transitions window</strong> and find Evaporate 2.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="select the transition effect"
                ></p>
<p>Step17 Drag and drop it onto the cut between <strong>clip 1</strong> and <strong>freeze frame 1</strong> and the cut between <strong>clip 2</strong> and <strong>freeze frame 2</strong>. You can also adjust the length of the transition.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="dropping the transition effect"
                ></p>
<p>Step18 Then, find <strong>Torned Paper Transition 4</strong> in the <strong>Transitions window</strong>. Drag and drop it to the cut between <strong>freeze frame 1</strong> and <strong>freeze frame 2</strong>. Then choose <strong>Prefix</strong> mode in the transition setting video. Adjust the length if needed.</p>

                      alt="dropping another transition effect"
                ></p>
<p>Finally, it’s done. Let’s play the video and see how the paper effect and transitions enhanced the video.</p>
