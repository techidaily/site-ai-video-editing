<h2 id="The-6-Key-Features-of-Flixpress"><a href="#The-6-Key-Features-of-Flixpress" class="headerlink" title="The 6 Key Features of Flixpress"></a>The 6 Key Features of Flixpress</h2><p>Listed below are the features that make Flixpress stand out among the competitors.</p>
<h3 id="1-HD-Downloads"><a href="#1-HD-Downloads" class="headerlink" title="1. HD Downloads"></a>1. HD Downloads</h3><p>It is an established fact that the quality of the video is the first factor for the audience to judge, and having a bad quality video uploaded to a YouTube channel that you wish to grow is not really a wise choice.</p>
<p>Flixpress offers you high-definition downloads that are perfect for viewing your video on the web and broadcasting it on television.</p>
<h3 id="2-Customizable-Templates"><a href="#2-Customizable-Templates" class="headerlink" title="2. Customizable Templates"></a>2. Customizable Templates</h3><p>Having templates that can be customized as per your needs really makes the task easier. Flixpress offers a variety of templates that give you the option to enter text in some fields. This text is then beautifully rendered out in the final edited video.</p>
<h3 id="3-Audio-Tools"><a href="#3-Audio-Tools" class="headerlink" title="3. Audio Tools"></a>3. Audio Tools</h3><p>Adding the right audio can leave a significant impact on the overall aesthetic and impression of the video. It is perhaps one of the prime factors that decides whether the audio is edited well or not.</p>
<p>That said, Flixpress allows you to incorporate any custom audio file into the video. You will just be required to upload that audio in mp3 format, and that’s all. Other than that, you can add several sound elements as well.</p>
<h3 id="4-Multiple-Formats"><a href="#4-Multiple-Formats" class="headerlink" title="4. Multiple Formats"></a>4. Multiple Formats</h3><p>If you’re someone who owns a Mac operating system and wishes to export the video in a MOV format, let us tell you that Flixpress can transcode the video to match your needs. However, along with the MOV format, you also have the option to export the video in the standard MP4 format or a WMV format as well.</p>
<h3 id="5-Stock-Video-Library"><a href="#5-Stock-Video-Library" class="headerlink" title="5. Stock Video Library"></a>5. Stock Video Library</h3><p>Yes, you read that right. Flixpress is dedicated to offering you a comprehensive and affordable video product solution by providing a stock video library which means you can bid farewell to expensive stock footage sites.</p>
<p>It is to be noted that the team at Flixpress is fully committed to growing the Copyright-Free footage and background library, and the size of the library grows with the passing time.</p>
<h3 id="6-Preview"><a href="#6-Preview" class="headerlink" title="6. Preview"></a>6. Preview</h3><p>Being one of the spotlight features of Flixpress, this one really makes it stand out. With this feature, you won’t have to wonder what your video would look like as you can render a free watermarked preview. If you’re working for someone, you can send this preview to your client or boss for approval and tweak data before the final render.</p>
<p>Other than that, these previews can also be used as templates if you wish to duplicate the same video with variable data.</p>

Some of the important options that a good LUT app should have been discussed here.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multiple LUT Formats</strong>: A good iPhone LUT app should support different LUT formats such as .cube, .3dl, .look, and more. It allows you to use LUTs from different sources and import them easily into your application.</li>
<li>Easy LUT Import and Export: The app you are choosing should have an easy-to-use interface. The interface should allow you to import and export LUTs quickly. It saves you time and helps you do the editing quicker.</li>
<li><strong>Customizable LUTs</strong>: You should be able to create custom LUTs for your content. The app should allow you to adjust colors, contrasts, and saturation settings to make editing easy.</li>
<li><strong>Preview Options</strong>: A preview function also is a good option to have in your app. This option allows you to see the LUT effect in your digital media before applying it.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple Formats Compatibility</strong>: Furthermore, the app should be compatible with popular video formats like MP4, AVI, and MOV. With this option, you can edit and export your videos in the format you need.</li>
<li><strong>Non-Destructive Editing</strong>: Moreover, the app should allow you to edit your footage by keeping the original settings alongside. This feature will not affect the original, letting you revert to the original settings if needed.</li>
<li><strong>User-Friendly Interface</strong>: An easy-to-use interface lets you focus on your creativity. A good interface makes the editing process more fluid and easier.</li>
