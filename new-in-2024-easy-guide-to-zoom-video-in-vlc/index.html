This is because VLC Media Player offers several useful and advanced features that the default media player like Windows Media Player lacks. There are situations when users need to zoom into certain parts of a video, and that is where VLC zoom in video feature comes in handy.</p>
<p>You may need to zoom into videos to pay attention to details and focus on parts around the subject that others are missing out. For example, you have recorded a video, and you have played it on VLC to zoom in and ensure that there is nothing distracting before you publish the video. Now, we will illustrate all the different ways on how to zoom in VLC Media Player. We will also suggest a better alternative to zoom into videos easily.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Zoom-VLC-Video-Using-Interactive-Zoom"><a href="#Part-1-Zoom-VLC-Video-Using-Interactive-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Zoom VLC Video Using Interactive Zoom"></a>Part 1: Zoom VLC Video Using Interactive Zoom</h2><p>VLC Media Player comes with Interactive Zoom feature that lets you zoom into a section of a video irrespective of its resolution. You can use Interactive Zoom feature to zoom nearly eight times the original size of the video. While you zoom your video with Interactive Zoom option, VLC Media Player zooms the video digitally, and if the video resolution is not high, you can see some deterioration in video quality as you zoom in. Here are the steps on how to VLC zoom with Interactive Zoom.</p>
<p>Step1First, you have to enable Interactive Zoom feature. Launch VLC Player and go to Tools menu option.</p>
<p>Step2Select Effects and Filters and you will see Adjustments and Effects window open.</p>
<p>Step3Go to Video Effects tab and then go to Geometry tab.</p>
<p>Step4Turn on Interactive Zoom option. Click on Save and Close buttons.</p>

                      alt="zoom in vlc"
                ></p>
<p>Step5Play a video and you will see a Picture in Picture window in the top-left corner where you can see live preview of the video. You will notice a rectangular box that you can drag around the PiP window to zoom that section of the video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="zoom in vlc"

<p>You don’t need to change the setting this time because this keyframe is used to keep the position and opacity unchanged.</p>
<p>Instead, move the play head again to the right for a few frames and add another keyframe. Move the texts out of the frame by changing the y-axis number, then change the opacity to 0. This keyframe is used to create the white line animation exiting the frame and turning back to transparent in the meantime.</p>

<p>Sometimes you might want to create a name card with a solid background like the sample above. To create it, we can use the same method. Here’s how to do it:</p>
<h5 id="Step1-Make-the-lower-third-background"><a href="#Step1-Make-the-lower-third-background" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Make the lower third background"></a>Step1 Make the lower third background</h5><p>Select the white color sample from the sample color folder and drop it onto the upper video track of the video.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Now, type in the texts as needed. Reposition and scale the texts to make sure they are on top of the background shape.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>Double-click on the background clip to show the animation tab setting. Then, playback the text animation and find a position earlier than the start and add a keyframe.</p>

                      alt="double-click on the background clip"
                ></p>
<p>Similar to the tutorial before, move the play head again a few frames earlier to the left and add another keyframe. If you want to have the name card flying in from the left while expanding, you can change the X-axis and scale of the background card to 0. Change the opacity to 0 to create a color change from transparent to white.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="move the play head again"
                ></p>
<p>To let the background card exit the frame, add two more keyframes to the background card. Add a keyframe with no changes to settings. Move the play head to the right for a few frames and add another keyframe.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="add two more keyframes"
                ></p>
<p>If you want the name card to exit to the bottom, change the Y-axis number until it exits. Change the scale and opacity to 0. Then, playback and adjust the keyframes.</p>
<p>Finally, you can add a Subscribe button from the new default Filmora element pack “Social Media.”</p>

                      alt="create an image mask"
                ></p>
<p>Double-click on the white sample clip to activate the video setting window and find the Image Mask settings. Then, choose the mask shape you need. You can also adjust its size by changing the X or Y-axis.</p>

<h5 id="Step3-Add-some-text-1"><a href="#Step3-Add-some-text-1" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Add some text"></a>Step3 Add some text</h5><p>Once the background card is in place, go to Titles &gt; Plain Text &gt; ‘Basic 6’ and drop it onto the third video track.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="go to titles"
                ></p>
<p>Now, type in the texts as needed. Reposition and scale the texts to make sure they are on top of the background shape.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step4-Add-animation-to-the-text-3"><a href="#Step4-Add-animation-to-the-text-3" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Add animation to the text"></a>Step4 Add animation to the text</h5><p>Click Advanced &gt; Animation &gt; Push. Then, adjust the animation length accordingly. Click Ok.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-20.jpg"
                      alt="click advanced"
                ></p>
<p>Double-click on the background clip to show the animation tab setting. Then, playback the text animation and find a position earlier than the start and add a keyframe.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-21.jpg"
                      alt="double-click on the background clip"
                ></p>
<p>Similar to the tutorial before, move the play head again a few frames earlier to the left and add another keyframe. If you want to have the name card flying in from the left while expanding, you can change the X-axis and scale of the background card to 0. Change the opacity to 0 to create a color change from transparent to white.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-22.gif"
                      alt="move the play head again"
                ></p>
<p>To let the background card exit the frame, add two more keyframes to the background card. Add a keyframe with no changes to settings. Move the play head to the right for a few frames and add another keyframe.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-23.gif"
                      alt="add two more keyframes"
                ></p>
<p>If you want the name card to exit to the bottom, change the Y-axis number until it exits. Change the scale and opacity to 0. Then, playback and adjust the keyframes.</p>
<p>Finally, you can add a Subscribe button from the new default Filmora element pack “Social Media.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/custom-lower-thirds-24.jpg"
                      alt="add a subscribe button"
                ></p>
<h2 id="Wrapping-up-1"><a href="#Wrapping-up-1" class="headerlink" title="Wrapping up"></a>Wrapping up</h2><p>These are two ways you can create your own Lower Thirds in FIlmora. You can also change the keyframe settings to customize your lower thirds even more. Now, it’s time to try it yourself, and let us know what you think!</p>
