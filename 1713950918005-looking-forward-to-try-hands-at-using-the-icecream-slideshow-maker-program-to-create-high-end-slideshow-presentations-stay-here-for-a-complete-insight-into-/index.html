                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Import Media Files</strong></p>

In the launch screen, navigate to and tap any one of the ‘Add Photo’ or ‘Add Folder’ buttons at the top left corner to import either a single media file, or an entire media folder to the program’s editing workspace.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>File Sorting</strong></p>
<p>To sort the arrangement of a media file, navigate to the ‘File Queue Panel’ at the left and click on the desired file, while using the ‘Arrow Keys’ at the right to change the latter’s position in the queue, or choose to delete it from the queue by tapping the ‘Recycle Bin’ icon beside the file.</p>

To play the audio track immediately with a time shift, choose to set a negative offset value. Likewise, enter a positive offset value to start playing the track after the lapse of a specified time period.</p>

Use the ‘Up&#x2F;Down’ arrow keys to sort the media files in your preferred order, for example, arranging them according to their specific file names.

<p><strong>Step 4: Include Text Customizations</strong></p>

<h2 id="Adjust-the-aspect-ratio"><a href="#Adjust-the-aspect-ratio" class="headerlink" title="Adjust the aspect ratio"></a>Adjust the aspect ratio</h2><p>The aspect ratio is known as the size of the video frame. For example, the most common aspect ratios are 16:9 and 4:3. The first number represents the width, and the second represents the height.</p>
<p>You should always ask your cinematographer about the aspect ratio. There are chances when cameras won’t shoot at the intended aspect ratio they were framed for. In that case, you’ll need to crop or letterbox them when editing.</p>

<h2 id="Send-your-first-draft"><a href="#Send-your-first-draft" class="headerlink" title="Send your first draft"></a>Send your first draft</h2><p>The first draft is the video in which you added audio and re-ordered the shots. You decided on the pace and flow of the video to create a basic structure. You made changes to make it interesting and captivating.</p>
<p>Before you put too much effort into editing your video, send it to your director, producer, or client for review. It will help ensure that any big changes can be made before you invest too much time in the edit.</p>
<p>For first drafts, you don’t need anything fancy. A lower-resolution and more compressed file can make sending it to a director or client much easier. You can also add a timer on the music video, so the person reviewing it can give you accurate timing on where he wants any revision.</p>

<li>Click on <strong>Effects</strong> and search for <strong>Timecode</strong> in the search bar.</li>
<li>Choose the timer style you like and drop it onto the new timeline.</li>
<li>Extend the timer to the end of the video.</li>
<li>Adjust the position and add the duration of your music video.</li>

It causes the movie to twist and gives it a photorealistic appearance, giving the sense of depth. Too much or too little fading might ruin the whole impact of the video that has been generated, which is why we’re providing instructions on how to apply fade in Windows video editors.</p>
<p>People often search for How to Add Fade in after effects but in such tools, backgrounds are used to achieve fading, so what should you do if you want your movie on your Windows 10 desktop to fade to black, white, or another color? We suggest the solution in this article that would be of assistance. It is suggested that you apply the video fades using a backdrop clip which is either black or white. Video fades come in two varieties: fade in and fade out. A video or picture may gradually appear from a black, white, or colored backdrop using a technique called a “fade-in.” On the other hand, a video or picture may gradually blend into a white, black, or multicolored backdrop using the fade-out technique.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Add-Fade-in-Windows-Video-Editor"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Add-Fade-in-Windows-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Add Fade in Windows Video Editor"></a>Part 1: How to Add Fade in Windows Video Editor</h2><p>To begin with, you’ll need top-notch editing software for your movies. We advise you to try Windows Video Editor if you use Windows. It is slick, simple, and enjoyable to use. The Microsoft Store’s most downloaded video editing app is also this one. To test how it works, you may install it for free. The Windows video editor is a strong tool that makes it simple for users to utilize the fundamentals of video editing. It has the ability to move, concatenate, cut, and add the Fading effects to videos. However, it lacks the transitions needed to insert them into videos or in between them.</p>
<p><strong>Steps to Add Fade in Windows Video Editor</strong></p>
<p>Step1Open Windows Video Editor and choose the video clip you wish to apply a fade to.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/choose-video-windows-video-editor.jpg"
                      alt="choose video windows video editor"
                ></p>
<p>Step2To display further effects, click the down arrow in the corner of the effects tray after selecting the Visual Effects tab. The effects are divided into a group named Motions and Fades. To get an explanation and a sample of what the effects do, hover your mouse cursor over the thumbnails of the effects.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/click-video-tools-windows-editor.jpg"
                      alt="click video tools windows editor"
                ></p>
<p>The available effects include pixelate, ripple, and a simple fade in or fade out to black or white. Apply No Effect, the first thumbnail in the list of visual effects, after choosing the clip and the visual effect you wish to remove.</p>
<p>Step3Select the desired video portion, then click the Edit tab under Video Tools to fade the video sound. The ribbon’s initial part is devoted to audio controls. One drop-down choice is for fade in, and the other is for fade out. You may choose none, slow, medium, or quick for each of them.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="desired video portion windows editor"
                ></p>
<p>Step4Select the Options option beneath Motion and Fades to fade your videos and the soundtrack. The first ribbon area is devoted to audio controls, much to what we saw for video sound. One drop-down choice is for fade in, and the other is for fade out. You may choose none, slow, medium, or quick for each of them.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

Especially when it is combined with the fade-out effect, frequently used to wrap up a shot, end a sequence, or the entire video clip. However, with Filmora, you can upload a picture, a GIF, or a video from your computer or paste in a link in the Filmora opening window including the Fading effects on both Audio and Video clips.</p>

What is the fade panel in Windows video editor?"></a>1. What is the fade panel in Windows video editor?</h3><p>In the windows video editor, there is a panel for basic video editing tools. But for fading in&#x2F;out of a video or text, there is no option available. The built-in windows tool does not have any option of ‘transition’. It straight forwardly moves from one video clip to the other without any sort of transition because Microsoft believe these transitions to be lame and unnecessary. Hence, they are not available. In case of Filmora, and other such tools, there is a straight up option for transitions where you can fade in and out with a lot of other cool stuff. For fading you can follow the method mentioned above in the article.</p>

There is a panel for basic video editing tools in the Windows video editor. However, there is no ability for a video or text to fade in and out.

How do I fade out music in Windows video editor?"></a>3. How do I fade out music in Windows video editor?</h3><p>There is no direct command for making the music or sound fade out but you can do it manually, that is, in the video where ever you want the music or sound to fade out is that you can trim that clip out and then divide into two more clips. You can take the first of the two clips and lower its sound and in the next clip, you can mute the clip, note: the clips must be kept small, otherwise it will sound quite weird. If the respective lengths of the clips are kept quite small, only then will the fade feel natural. Due to unavailability of a direct command, fading the music out can be a very taxing job.</p>
<h3 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h3><p>The built-in video editor for Windows does not have a direct option, therefore fading procedures cannot be utilized without downloading and installing other software, such as Filmora, which may assist with such problems. Filmora comes with built-in tools for text, video, and audio fading. In Filmora, there are at least four different ways to fade media. As a consequence, the conclusion we reach is that although the Windows video editor is strong and useful in a professional setting, it cannot be utilized to create effects that are often employed in the current world to draw in viewers.</p>

There is a panel for basic video editing tools in the Windows video editor. However, there is no ability for a video or text to fade in and out. There is no “transition” option in the built-in Windows programme. Microsoft considers these transitions to be unnecessary, so it simply switches from one video clip to the next without making any other effects.</p>
<h3 id="3-How-do-I-fade-out-music-in-Windows-video-editor-1"><a href="#3-How-do-I-fade-out-music-in-Windows-video-editor-1" class="headerlink" title="3. How do I fade out music in Windows video editor?"></a>3. How do I fade out music in Windows video editor?</h3><p>There is no direct command for making the music or sound fade out but you can do it manually, that is, in the video where ever you want the music or sound to fade out is that you can trim that clip out and then divide into two more clips. You can take the first of the two clips and lower its sound and in the next clip, you can mute the clip, note: the clips must be kept small, otherwise it will sound quite weird. If the respective lengths of the clips are kept quite small, only then will the fade feel natural. Due to unavailability of a direct command, fading the music out can be a very taxing job.</p>
<h3 id="The-Bottom-Line-1"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line-1" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h3><p>The built-in video editor for Windows does not have a direct option, therefore fading procedures cannot be utilized without downloading and installing other software, such as Filmora, which may assist with such problems. Filmora comes with built-in tools for text, video, and audio fading. In Filmora, there are at least four different ways to fade media. As a consequence, the conclusion we reach is that although the Windows video editor is strong and useful in a professional setting, it cannot be utilized to create effects that are often employed in the current world to draw in viewers.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1:</strong> Choosing an Image.</p>
<p>The first step in creating a 3D image is to carefully sort out which moment in your video you wish to convert into 3D. Pick an images or video clips that already have an element that pops out in a forward moving motion.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2:</strong> It should have a smart composition.</p>
<p>Becoming a creator means you need to know more about composition. This can be applicable to anything from making virtual designs to creating GIFs. 3D GIFs requires you to use a special Tumblr ‘frame’ that adds two breaks to the image which creates three horizontal panels. In exceptional cases, you could also use three break points and divide the image into four panels.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3:</strong> Become a content creator.</p>
<p>It’s okay to feel a bit off beat when trying out new skills but the prospects are rewarding. Try taking your own video footage, edit in Photoshop or any similar editing software. You can also opt for instant GIF creator apps that directly converts the footage or image you clicked into a GIF.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4:</strong> Making the split.</p>
<p>The next step would be splitting the image or frame into three panels as guideline for the 3D effects. In Photoshop you can import a GIF and choose ‘View’ from the navigation menu and then click on ‘New Guide’ from the drop down menu. Set the guide to 33% at first and 66% in the second.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5:</strong> Placingthe magical white lines over the guides.</p>
<p>From the shape menu on the sidebar, select the rectangle tool. Right click on this tool to get the shapes menu. Set ‘Fill Colour’ to white and set the weight to five pixels. Click and drag the lines over the guides.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6:</strong> For the final touch.</p>
<p>Merge these line layers and add a layer mask. The objective here is to only mask the panel where the main 3D element of the image which will be moving beyond the guides. How it is done is that you make copies of the frames where the animation goes beyond the guidelines and mask the layers where the element is over the visible layer.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7:</strong>  Enjoy your GIF.</p>
<p>Once you are done masking every frame that you have copied. Replay your GIF to see if everything is in order.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1:</strong> Choosing an Image.</p>
<p>The first step in creating a 3D image is to carefully sort out which moment in your video you wish to convert into 3D. Pick an images or video clips that already have an element that pops out in a forward moving motion.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2:</strong> It should have a smart composition.</p>
<p>Becoming a creator means you need to know more about composition. This can be applicable to anything from making virtual designs to creating GIFs. 3D GIFs requires you to use a special Tumblr ‘frame’ that adds two breaks to the image which creates three horizontal panels. In exceptional cases, you could also use three break points and divide the image into four panels.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3:</strong> Become a content creator.</p>
<p>It’s okay to feel a bit off beat when trying out new skills but the prospects are rewarding. Try taking your own video footage, edit in Photoshop or any similar editing software. You can also opt for instant GIF creator apps that directly converts the footage or image you clicked into a GIF.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4:</strong> Making the split.</p>
<p>The next step would be splitting the image or frame into three panels as guideline for the 3D effects. In Photoshop you can import a GIF and choose ‘View’ from the navigation menu and then click on ‘New Guide’ from the drop down menu. Set the guide to 33% at first and 66% in the second.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5:</strong> Placingthe magical white lines over the guides.</p>
<p>From the shape menu on the sidebar, select the rectangle tool. Right click on this tool to get the shapes menu. Set ‘Fill Colour’ to white and set the weight to five pixels. Click and drag the lines over the guides.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6:</strong> For the final touch.</p>
<p>Merge these line layers and add a layer mask. The objective here is to only mask the panel where the main 3D element of the image which will be moving beyond the guides. How it is done is that you make copies of the frames where the animation goes beyond the guidelines and mask the layers where the element is over the visible layer.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7:</strong>  Enjoy your GIF.</p>
<p>Once you are done masking every frame that you have copied. Replay your GIF to see if everything is in order.</p>

<p>Making and sharing animated GIFs that practically pop out on your friend’s screen can be just the magic one needs to start their day.</p>
<p>3D animated GIFs are growing in popularity and surprisingly, because of a simple trick that even you can try out.</p>
<p>What separates <strong>3D text GIFs</strong> or <strong>3D animation GIFs</strong> from your regular GIFs is that they are bit more difficult but far more fun to make.</p>
<p>3D GIFs are where it feels like the picture is coming out of your screen. Of course, this is just a visual illusion which can be recreated over any video GIF that meets specific parameters.</p>

This approach lets you create convincing 3D GIFs in an easy but deceptive way.</p>
<p>The actual magic behind this trick is the use of white lines that act as reference points separating 3 panels in the image.</p>
<p>Now, any animated elements of the GIF image will seem like they are popping out beyond the pre-set white lines and towards the viewer.</p>
<p>These white lines are used as referencing lines on the screen allowing our brains to bewilder at a passive 3D GIFs coming at us from the screen.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1:</strong> Choosing an Image.</p>
<p>The first step in creating a 3D image is to carefully sort out which moment in your video you wish to convert into 3D. Pick an images or video clips that already have an element that pops out in a forward moving motion.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2:</strong> It should have a smart composition.</p>
<p>Becoming a creator means you need to know more about composition. This can be applicable to anything from making virtual designs to creating GIFs. 3D GIFs requires you to use a special Tumblr ‘frame’ that adds two breaks to the image which creates three horizontal panels. In exceptional cases, you could also use three break points and divide the image into four panels.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3:</strong> Become a content creator.</p>
<p>It’s okay to feel a bit off beat when trying out new skills but the prospects are rewarding. Try taking your own video footage, edit in Photoshop or any similar editing software. You can also opt for instant GIF creator apps that directly converts the footage or image you clicked into a GIF.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4:</strong> Making the split.</p>
<p>The next step would be splitting the image or frame into three panels as guideline for the 3D effects. In Photoshop you can import a GIF and choose ‘View’ from the navigation menu and then click on ‘New Guide’ from the drop down menu. Set the guide to 33% at first and 66% in the second.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5:</strong> Placingthe magical white lines over the guides.</p>
<p>From the shape menu on the sidebar, select the rectangle tool. Right click on this tool to get the shapes menu. Set ‘Fill Colour’ to white and set the weight to five pixels. Click and drag the lines over the guides.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6:</strong> For the final touch.</p>
<p>Merge these line layers and add a layer mask. The objective here is to only mask the panel where the main 3D element of the image which will be moving beyond the guides. How it is done is that you make copies of the frames where the animation goes beyond the guidelines and mask the layers where the element is over the visible layer.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7:</strong>  Enjoy your GIF.</p>
<p>Once you are done masking every frame that you have copied. Replay your GIF to see if everything is in order.</p>

<p>Making and sharing animated GIFs that practically pop out on your friend’s screen can be just the magic one needs to start their day.</p>
<p>3D animated GIFs are growing in popularity and surprisingly, because of a simple trick that even you can try out.</p>
<p>What separates <strong>3D text GIFs</strong> or <strong>3D animation GIFs</strong> from your regular GIFs is that they are bit more difficult but far more fun to make.</p>
<p>3D GIFs are where it feels like the picture is coming out of your screen. Of course, this is just a visual illusion which can be recreated over any video GIF that meets specific parameters.</p>

This approach lets you create convincing 3D GIFs in an easy but deceptive way.</p>
<p>The actual magic behind this trick is the use of white lines that act as reference points separating 3 panels in the image.</p>
<p>Now, any animated elements of the GIF image will seem like they are popping out beyond the pre-set white lines and towards the viewer.</p>
<p>These white lines are used as referencing lines on the screen allowing our brains to bewilder at a passive 3D GIFs coming at us from the screen.</p>
