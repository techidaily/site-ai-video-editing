<h3 id="How-to-smooth-out-cuts"><a href="#How-to-smooth-out-cuts" class="headerlink" title="How to smooth out cuts"></a>How to smooth out cuts</h3><p>Adding cuts in the beats is one part of the job, not the whole job. After adding these cuts, you have to smoothen them. With it, the point of interest for the audience becomes clear.</p>
<p>To maintain the audience’s attention on our video, we have to smoothen the cuts so that our audience quickly understands the ongoing story in our video. If sudden changes occur on the screen, watching it gets disconcerting.</p>
<p>Indeed, you would not want your audience to have this experience. Head to the following techniques to understand how to smooth out video cuts</p>
<h5 id="Technique-1-Showing-multiple-perspectives"><a href="#Technique-1-Showing-multiple-perspectives" class="headerlink" title="Technique 1: Showing multiple perspectives"></a>Technique 1: Showing multiple perspectives</h5><p>The focal person in the video must occupy the same spot in the previous shot as it maintains in the current shot.</p>
<p>Let us understand from the example given below.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shot 1</strong>: The actress in the music video is occupying the left seat on the bus while looking outside.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="focusing on the main lead in the first shot"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shot 2</strong>: The actress occupies the same spot in the subsequent shot.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="focusing the actress in the second shot from a different angle"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Third Shot</strong>: The shot shows the wide angle of the bus from the inside. The actress is still sitting in the same position and the same place.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="focusing the actress in the third shot from a different angle"
                ></p>
<p>This technique keeps the audience focused on the point of interest while giving them a different perspective of the scene.</p>
<h5 id="Technique-2-Using-light-leaks"><a href="#Technique-2-Using-light-leaks" class="headerlink" title="Technique 2: Using light leaks"></a>Technique 2: Using light leaks</h5><p>The technique is quite helpful for the transition between two cuts.

<h5 id="What-are-light-leaks"><a href="#What-are-light-leaks" class="headerlink" title="What are light leaks?"></a>What are light leaks?</h5><p>Light leaks are great effects in Filmora. These effects fill the screen with light. It seems that light is leaking in a disorderly fashion. For the time being, the whole screen is filled with that effect. Thus, it explains the name of this effect as a light leak.</p>
<p>Filmora provides a plethora of features for adding Light Leak for transitioning cuts. With the use of Filmora, one can quickly bring a level of flow to the music video. Keep reading to understand how to use this remarkable feature of Filmora.</p>

After adding these cuts, you have to smoothen them. With it, the point of interest for the audience becomes clear.</p>
<p>To maintain the audience’s attention on our video, we have to smoothen the cuts so that our audience quickly understands the ongoing story in our video. If sudden changes occur on the screen, watching it gets disconcerting.</p>
<p>Indeed, you would not want your audience to have this experience. Head to the following techniques to understand how to smooth out video cuts</p>
<h5 id="Technique-1-Showing-multiple-perspectives-1"><a href="#Technique-1-Showing-multiple-perspectives-1" class="headerlink" title="Technique 1: Showing multiple perspectives"></a>Technique 1: Showing multiple perspectives</h5><p>The focal person in the video must occupy the same spot in the previous shot as it maintains in the current shot.</p>
<p>Let us understand from the example given below.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shot 1</strong>: The actress in the music video is occupying the left seat on the bus while looking outside.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="focusing on the main lead in the first shot"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shot 2</strong>: The actress occupies the same spot in the subsequent shot.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="focusing the actress in the second shot from a different angle"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Third Shot</strong>: The shot shows the wide angle of the bus from the inside. The actress is still sitting in the same position and the same place.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/smooth-out-cuts-3.jpg"
                      alt="focusing the actress in the third shot from a different angle"
                ></p>
<p>This technique keeps the audience focused on the point of interest while giving them a different perspective of the scene.</p>

<h5 id="What-are-light-leaks-1"><a href="#What-are-light-leaks-1" class="headerlink" title="What are light leaks?"></a>What are light leaks?</h5><p>Light leaks are great effects in Filmora. These effects fill the screen with light. It seems that light is leaking in a disorderly fashion. For the time being, the whole screen is filled with that effect. Thus, it explains the name of this effect as a light leak.</p>
<p>Filmora provides a plethora of features for adding Light Leak for transitioning cuts. With the use of Filmora, one can quickly bring a level of flow to the music video. Keep reading to understand how to use this remarkable feature of Filmora.</p>

<h2 id="Easy-Way-to-Add-Effects-to-Art-Video"><a href="#Easy-Way-to-Add-Effects-to-Art-Video" class="headerlink" title="Easy Way to Add Effects to Art Video"></a>Easy Way to Add Effects to Art Video</h2><p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a powerful tool and with the know-how can make your art be more than just a still image. Whether it is for a music video or a portfolio showreel, there are better ways than just inserting an image and letting it fade to the next still image. We can make use of effects and transitions to put our art to better use.</p>
<p>In this guide I’m going to show a couple of ways to enhance your images within <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for your videos.</p>
<h2 id="Transitions"><a href="#Transitions" class="headerlink" title="Transitions"></a>Transitions</h2><p>By inserting a transition to your image, you can add some diversity to how the viewer first see’s your image, You may want to emphasis a certain element of your art and therefore would select a transition that zooms in on that element before zooming out to the whole image or maybe you have a painting of a cyberpunk angel and wish to have the image enter in a grid formation. The point is that by experimenting with transitions and trying to select the best ones based on the element in your work you will achieve a better first impression. This is true for all aspects of video creation.</p>
<p>Having multiple transitions can create a unique look for your videos with minimal understanding of how to create a transition but there needs to be an understanding of how the layers work in <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> being that a layer on top is in front of the one below, remember this when you start to add transitions as sometime you may need to duplicate your art as to keep it in the shot.</p>

                      alt="add transitions art video"
                ></p>
<p>As you can see here, I have duplicated my image onto separate channels as to always keep the image in the scene.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/duplicated-image-onto-separate-channels.jpg"
                      alt="duplicated image onto separate channels"
                ></p>
<p>In the image above you can see how I used multiple transitions, I did this as my image is off center and I wanted to emphasize that, I picked transitions that had clear symmetry and lines so that the viewer had a reference point of where center was without me having to place that in my art. This is a very useful way of adding information to your art without telling the viewer directly. As for the color theory, I went with oranges and yellows predominantly here as they are neighboring colors on the color wheel and we know they work well together with my main color of yellow. As for the composition I have tried to keep all the eye-catching points along the top third of the image as to create a piece more pleasing to the eye even with all this information going on.</p>
<h2 id="Effects"><a href="#Effects" class="headerlink" title="Effects"></a>Effects</h2><p>The inclusion of effect onto your art should not be discouraged depending on what the art is used for, in my example i created this as though it was album art and the musician wanted to upload a simple music video using that art, on its own it is static and can loose engagement but by applying relevant effects you can capture the viewer’s eye and make the listening experience more enjoyable. Effects can also be stacked to create unique assets for your art and help tell a story, if your art includes fire why not add a fire effect breaking the stillness of the image or maybe your art has motion, you could include a motion effect to your still image and give the viewer more information.</p>
<p>Even when using effects you can use fundamentals such as color theory or composition to better enhance your imagery.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/choose-effect-art-video.jpg"
                      alt="choose effect art video"
                ></p>
<p>In this image you can see I have added an audio visualizer effect as well as a spectral light effect. I did this to reinforce the face of my image having a strong light source, it creates dynamic movement and the audio visualizer was added due to the nature of the video being music oriented but I felt this could have been done better. The composition of the audio visualizer was front and center and seemed boring and uninteresting. This is where the research into art fundamentals comes into play as remembering the rule of thirds and how all the main features of the image are in the top horizontal third, we can make use of the vertical thirds to gain a better composition and hopefully create more engagement.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/pewview-art-video-effects.jpg"
                      alt="pewview art video effects"
                ></p>
<p>As you can see, we have duplicated the audio visualizer and made better use of the thirds nor having opposing placement within the scene, the same information is being given by the effect but we have managed to use the space more effectively and created a visually pleasing aesthetic to our video. Trick like this can make your still image feel more animated and have more purpose within the video itself.</p>
<h2 id="Adding-Titles-and-Text"><a href="#Adding-Titles-and-Text" class="headerlink" title="Adding Titles and Text"></a>Adding Titles and Text</h2><p>Adding text is another way of adding information to your art. It’s said an image can speak a thousand words but sometimes you need words to talk for an image. When words are needed for your video, there should be some thought into how them words are presented as just selecting any text and inserting that to your video may look jarring to the viewer and result in a loss of interest towards your videos. Selecting the right transition for your text or the color or even the font can have different results and can help with affordance depending on what you’re looking to portray.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/add-text-title-art-video.jpg"
                      alt="add text title art video"
                ></p>
<p>In my example I wanted to say thank you and felt sharp edges would seem formal and because of the main image it would be too similar so I went with a font that was more rounded. When inserting text onto a scene such as this one you are given a lot of information for your selections, we already have color in there to help us choose our font and background color, I went with yellow and pink due to the fact it was already in the scene and I didn’t want to take the attention away from the focus. The way the text transitions onto the screen secures just enough attention to itself that the viewer knows it’s there and can read it if they wish to. If I wanted to gain full attention i would have picked a transition that overlaps the key element and picked complementary colors on the opposite sides of the color wheel guaranteeing the viewer’s eyes would notice and engage with the motion.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>By incorporating all the art fundamentals and skills we have learned we can use the tools provided by <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> more effectively and create dynamic and engaging videos that are aesthetically pleasing for our audience.
