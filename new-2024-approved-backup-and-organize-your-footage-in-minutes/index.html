<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Making a backup file for your project is crucial. For a video editor, it is quite painful to learn that the final product has a missing file. Therefore, one must ensure that all the files are backed up before beginning the editing phase.</p>
<p>Apart from that, one must also keep updating the files in <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. You performed some editing. Make sure to save the file then and there. Any minor mistake can cause great worry for the professional editor. Thus, it is better to take proactive actions.</p>

The right song will elevate your video to another level and assist in relaying your feelings and emotions to the viewers. The following examples will illustrate how changing the audio changes the impression of the video.</p>
<h3 id="Example-1"><a href="#Example-1" class="headerlink" title="Example #1"></a>Example #1</h3><p>Let’s say you have a video of someone walking through the woods.

<h3 id="Example-2"><a href="#Example-2" class="headerlink" title="Example #2"></a>Example #2</h3><p>For a better understanding, let’s look at a movie scene we all know and love. Take the entrance scene from Avengers: Endgame. The music used by the producer aims to excite the audience while building up the hype for the upcoming battle. However, if we change the audio of this scene, we end up with a completely different set of emotions that might not go too well with the shot.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>Now that we’ve seen how crucial audio can be in a video, let’s see how to choose the best music audio for your video.</p>
<h2 id="Tip-1-Identify-the-mood"><a href="#Tip-1-Identify-the-mood" class="headerlink" title="Tip #1: Identify the mood"></a>Tip #1: Identify the mood</h2><p>As we’ve demonstrated before, the audio can change the entire mood of the video. The right music for any video will be the one that compliments the spirit of the visuals and relays the emotions the producer intended.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="identifying the mood of the video"
                ></p>
<p>Rewatch your recorded clips until you know the mood portrayed by the visuals. Select music that matches the spirit of your visuals. For example, you would use different music for a sunny day compared to a cloudy day. Once you’ve figured out the mood and understand the emotions you want to elicit, search for audio that achieves this and balances out your visuals.</p>
<h2 id="Tip-2-Video-and-music-style"><a href="#Tip-2-Video-and-music-style" class="headerlink" title="Tip #2: Video and music style"></a>Tip #2: Video and music style</h2><p>We’ve already established that different styles of music complement other types of videos. So, keep the type of your video in consideration. For example, is your video fast-paced and full of action, or is it more serious in nature, like an interview or documentary?</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="matching the video and audio styles"
                ></p>
<p>Once you have music that matches your video style, check the audio wave. The four most common patterns are steady, ascending, descending, or furious. The audio wave will help you select the visuals that best match that audio.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="identifying the audio wave"
                ></p>
<p>For example, if you’re using audio with an ascending audio wave, you would use visuals that build up with the audio. The beat drop will signal the transition to reveal a powerful shot.</p>
<h2 id="Tip-3-Don’t-force-the-music"><a href="#Tip-3-Don’t-force-the-music" class="headerlink" title="Tip #3: Don’t force the music"></a>Tip #3: Don’t force the music</h2><p>As emphasized before, your music should match your video. We all have a favorite music genre, but sometimes that may not go well with our visuals. For example, you love country music but have a video about the nightlife in the city. Using country music in a video about the town does not match well and will confuse your audience.</p>

<p>To get music that best suits our video, we must be open and explore all music genres. You’ll see how easy it is to scout a song that fits perfectly with your visuals. The easiest way is to choose a song that gives out the same emotions as intended by the visuals.</p>
<h2 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h2><p>Now, you clearly understand the importance of music in videos. The right music can uplift your video into a viral sensation, while the wrong music track will turn your video into a catastrophe.
