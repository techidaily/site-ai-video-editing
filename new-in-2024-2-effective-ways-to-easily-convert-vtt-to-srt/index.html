<p>The feature allows you to insert the mask in any shape, such as a rectangle, circle, or triangle. You can also import any shapes you like if you can’t find them in the presets library. You can also adjust the mask placement, width, height, and feather effect.</p>
<p>Without further ado, let’s see the detailed step-by-step guide for this effect.</p>
<h3 id="a-Preparation-3"><a href="#a-Preparation-3" class="headerlink" title="a. Preparation"></a>a. Preparation</h3><p>You will need at least three shots of the same frame to get the shadow effect to work. The first is the main video, the second is the shadow clip, and the last would be a clip portraying just a plain background.</p>
<p>Make sure that your camera stays at the same point and angle. You can use a tripod for assurance.</p>
<p>Take the first main video and don’t forget to mark the positioning of the object for the next take. Then, you can shoot the shadow clip following the marking of the object to match its position in the main clip.</p>
<p>Finally, shoot the final clip without the object on the frame.</p>

Steps to add the shadow effect to your videos using Masking"></a>b. Steps to add the shadow effect to your videos using Masking</h3><p>Step 1: Place the main clip on the timeline and find the start of the segment that you want to use. Press M on the keyboard to set a marker.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/spooky-shadow-tricks-2.jpg"
                      alt="placing a marker on the main clip"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Place the shadow clip on top of the main clip on the timeline. Trim and adjust until the shadow clip ends right at the marker of the main clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/spooky-shadow-tricks-3.gif"
                      alt="adjust the length of the shadow clip"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: Move the play head to the start of the shadow clip. Trim the main clip right on that mark so both clips have the same start by clicking the scissor icon and deleting the unused part.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/spooky-shadow-tricks-4.gif"
                      alt="sync the main and shadow clips"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4: Double-click the shadow clip. Open<strong>Settings &gt; Mask Section &gt; Rectangle</strong> to apply the mask. Adjust the blur strength to smooth out the edge.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/spooky-shadow-tricks-5.jpg"
                      alt="place the mask of the shadow clip and adjust"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5: Play the result to see if there’s any part you need to block out. When you find them, repeat steps 1 to 4 but with the background clip. Try to conceal all things you need to hide using the masks. Make sure that you get the timings right.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/spooky-shadow-tricks-6.gif"
                      alt="block unwanted objects off the final clip"
                ></p>
<p>Step6 Trim the length of the masking clips to match the main clip by sliding the play head and clicking the Split button.</p>
<p>Adjust the audio and preview the effect before you save the result. You can also add extra features like slow motion for maximum effect.</p>

                     lazyload

                      alt="preview the result before saving"
                ></p>
