The software market is a pool of editing applications that are packed with extensive libraries to garnish your creations with varieties of exciting after effects. However, the additive black backgrounds are an annoying cringe to your creative artwork.</p>
<p>While these black backgrounds are evident on account of being inherent application properties of video and film editing software, the relaxing note is, there are effective solutions to the removal of these black screens. When browsing through affordable way to take up the removal process, you can adhere to the following procedure for making and <strong>exporting after effects transparent background videos</strong>:</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Launch After Effects</strong></p>
<p>This one is an efficient motion graphics template that you can use to add a visible spunk to your graphic design artworks. Begin with launching the template in your system after an official website download of the same.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Make Your Film Ready</strong></p>
<p>Before beginning to remove the black background in After Effects template, make sure that your footage is ready to take up the action. The tool you are about to use is known to eliminate black pixels from your clip proportional to the luminous intensity variation in the scene under consideration.</p>
<p>Check for any areas you would like to remain untouched and mask them to retain the dark elements. To ensure effective masking, it is recommended to use the ‘Levels and Curves’ effect for a convenient tweak to the final key at the end.</p>

                      alt="After Effects Template- Footage Preparation"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Shift Channels Effect</strong></p>
<p>In the composition panel, navigate to the ‘Shift Channels’ effect and use the ‘Drag and Drop’ method to add it to the dark pixelated layer you wish to remove. You can also use this effect to work with adjustment layers.</p>

                      alt="After Effects Template- ‘Shift Channels’ Effect"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Luminance Adjustments</strong></p>
<p>While continuing with the ‘Shift Channels’ effect, navigate to the ‘Take Alpha From’ checkbox and set ‘Luminance’ as the ‘Reset’ parameter. You are instantly fetched a footage without the black background. If this does not happen, navigate to the bottom of the composition panel and enable the ‘Transparency Grid’ option with a right side toggle.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Color Tweaks</strong></p>
<p>Use the‘Levels and Curves’ effect mentioned in Step 2 to make level adjustments until you get the perfect result. You can experiment with varieties of curve and level variations, both, before and after using the ‘Shift Channels’ effect to get the right tweaks. That’s it! You are now ready to <strong>export after effects transparent background</strong> video.</p>

<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Export-After-Effects-Transparent-Background"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Export-After-Effects-Transparent-Background" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to Export After Effects Transparent Background"></a>Part 2 How to Export After Effects Transparent Background</h2><p>Videos with transparent backgrounds are trending examples of motion graphic designing and video editing artworks. The cue behind these backgrounds is that they exclusively permit the object of focus to have an opaque or colored pixelation, while leaving the remaining pixels as transparent or colorless. This is beneficial in adding an extra spotlight to the main elements of your creation, while rendering the less important parts behind the scene.</p>
<p>Having known the credibility of transparent backgrounds in video crafting, you may feel motivated to try hands on experimenting with transparent backgrounds to uplift your graphic motion artwork.</p>
<p>Considering the most affordable picks of video editing software to choose from, you can rely on the ‘After Effects’ motion graphic template to kick start the creation process. When using the aforesaid template to export videos with transparent backgrounds, you need to adhere to the following steps:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Launch the After Effects Template</strong></p>
<p>Start with downloading the graphic template from its official website and launching the same on your system.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Select Your Video</strong></p>
<p>On a successful launch, the template welcomes you with its composition timeline and project panel. Here, you need to select a desired video from either of the two places to export with a transparent background.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add to Queue</strong></p>
<p>Once you have made your choice, navigate to the top toolbar in the composition panel and hit the ‘Composition’ tab. From the drop down menu that follows, choose ‘Add to Render Queue’. You can alternatively use the ‘Ctrl + M’ shortcut to carry out the above task.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Launch After Effects</strong></p>
<p>This one is an efficient motion graphics template that you can use to add a visible spunk to your graphic design artworks. Begin with launching the template in your system after an official website download of the same.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Make Your Film Ready</strong></p>
<p>Before beginning to remove the black background in After Effects template, make sure that your footage is ready to take up the action.

<p><strong>Step 1: Launch the After Effects Template</strong></p>

<p><strong>Step 2: Select Your Video</strong></p>
<p>On a successful launch, the template welcomes you with its composition timeline and project panel. Here, you need to select a desired video from either of the two places to export with a transparent background.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add to Queue</strong></p>
<p>Once you have made your choice, navigate to the top toolbar in the composition panel and hit the ‘Composition’ tab. From the drop down menu that follows, choose ‘Add to Render Queue’. You can alternatively use the ‘Ctrl + M’ shortcut to carry out the above task.</p>

This is beneficial in adding an extra spotlight to the main elements of your creation, while rendering the less important parts behind the scene.</p>
<p>Having known the credibility of transparent backgrounds in video crafting, you may feel motivated to try hands on experimenting with transparent backgrounds to uplift your graphic motion artwork.</p>
<p>Considering the most affordable picks of video editing software to choose from, you can rely on the ‘After Effects’ motion graphic template to kick start the creation process. When using the aforesaid template to export videos with transparent backgrounds, you need to adhere to the following steps:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Launch the After Effects Template</strong></p>
<p>Start with downloading the graphic template from its official website and launching the same on your system.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Select Your Video</strong></p>
<p>On a successful launch, the template welcomes you with its composition timeline and project panel. Here, you need to select a desired video from either of the two places to export with a transparent background.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add to Queue</strong></p>
<p>Once you have made your choice, navigate to the top toolbar in the composition panel and hit the ‘Composition’ tab. From the drop down menu that follows, choose ‘Add to Render Queue’. You can alternatively use the ‘Ctrl + M’ shortcut to carry out the above task.</p>

<p><strong>To Cut&#x2F;Trim Videos with Wondershare Filmora:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Drag and Drop the Video</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Assuming that you have already downloaded and installed Wondershare Filmora app, click to open. There are two ways through which you can locate your video.</p>
<p>One, you can opt to drag and drop the video from its location to the app’s timeline. Secondly, you can right click on the space at the top left then select the video to be edited from the dialogue box that will appear.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Trimming the video</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>After dropping the video on the timeline, it is likely to take up a lot of space, especially if it is long.</p>
<p>To trim the video from the beginning, place your cursor at the starting point and wait for the pointer to appear. Then move the point forward. To trim from the end, place the cursor at that point, hold and move the pointer forward till the required point.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="cut-video-vlc"
                ></p>
<p>Trimming the video does not mean that you lose the parts. It is more like shortening it to fit in place.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Cutting the video</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Unlike trimming, cutting involves getting rid of a section of the video completely. To do so, you need to first of all isolate that section.</p>
<p>With the video on the timeline, move and point your cursor at the starting point of the video and click on the scissors icon at the top. Then move it to the end of the video section and click on the scissors icon again. By so doing, you will have selected that section.</p>
<p>Once the section has been selected, right click on the video, select and click to delete. You can then drag the remaining parts to make them one.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="cut-video-vlc"
                ></p>
<p>After cutting or trimming, you can choose to add several effects to the video. Transitions, watermarks, cropping, resizing, ripple effects among others are some of the changes you could make. All these appear on the menu at the top.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Save and&#x2F;or Import your video</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The final step is saving or importing your file to prevent its loss. By clicking on the ‘Import’ button, you save the file to the Media Library. By selecting ‘save as’, you select the location where you want to store your file.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Cutting the video</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Unlike trimming, cutting involves getting rid of a section of the video completely. To do so, you need to first of all isolate that section.</p>
<p>With the video on the timeline, move and point your cursor at the starting point of the video and click on the scissors icon at the top. Then move it to the end of the video section and click on the scissors icon again. By so doing, you will have selected that section.</p>
