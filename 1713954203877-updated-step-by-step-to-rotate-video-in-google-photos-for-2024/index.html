It is a very great cloud storage service and most people use it. Google Photos has introduced an artificial intelligence technology into the app. That’s why it can automatically organize and rotate.</p>
<p>You have videos on google photos that are automatically rotated, others are not.</p>
<p>How do you rotate them manually?</p>
<p>It’s is so simple and will not take much of your time.</p>
<p>Let’s dive in…</p>
<h2 id="Rotating-videos-in-google-photos"><a href="#Rotating-videos-in-google-photos" class="headerlink" title="Rotating videos in google photos"></a><strong>Rotating videos in google photos</strong></h2><p>Rotating a video in google photos is pretty simple and will not take much of your time. You can easily fix the rotation and aspect ratio of your videos. But it’s a little tricky.</p>
<p>I’m going to show you how to flip your videos from portrait mode to landscape mode or from landscape mode to portrait mode.</p>
<p>You need to open up your google photos app and choose the video you want to flip, then you’re going to pick the button in the bottom middle with the levers on it and in the bottom right hand corner.</p>

<p>You will see a diamond with a circular arrow on it. You’re going to hit that until you find the way you want it to be.</p>

                      alt="rotate-video-google-photos"
                ></p>
<p>Once you’re happy, in the top right hand corner, hit Save Copy and that’s it, the size of the file determines how long it takes to finish this process later.</p>

<p>Here’s How to do it…</p>
<h3 id="Rotate-video-at-any-angle"><a href="#Rotate-video-at-any-angle" class="headerlink" title="Rotate video at any angle"></a>Rotate video at any angle</h3><p>You can also rotate the video by using the <strong>Transform</strong> tab located at the top right corner.</p>
<ul>

                      alt="rotate-video-google-photos"
                ></p>
<p>You will notice that I have changed the rotation of my video from its original position to the rotated angle.</p>
<p>You can rotate upside down, rotate left, rotate right or 90 degrees clockwise, 180 degrees, 270 degrees, 360 degrees rotate, and back to the original. Check the video result in the preview window. Once you get satisfied with the rotation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hit the <strong>ok</strong></li>
<li>Select the <strong>save</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p>Now you can see that the image has flipped without making a big effort you can also do it. I have done it for you, you are smarter.</p>
<p>Just go ahead and start…</p>
<p> Scale is also used to remove the unwanted and rubbish scenes from the selected video. Like if you don’t want to show something behind the scene, you can use the scale function to cut that scene from your video.</p>

So, if you want to learn to use montages with movies, they need to be the right ones. If you don’t know what Montage is, it is a way of compressing an action or series of actions into a short amount of time. We look at movies because they are a common type of entertainment everyone has seen before, which makes them easier to understand as a concept.</p>
<p>Using Montage is a great way to create engaging video content. There are many people interested in the topic of Montage, so if you get that video out there, you can easily find an audience. When used in conjunction with YouTube advertising, creating videos about Montage could be an excellent business idea for you.</p>

<h2 id="What-Is-A-Montage"><a href="#What-Is-A-Montage" class="headerlink" title="What Is A Montage?"></a>What Is A Montage?</h2><p>The definition of a montage is a “series of short scenes or episodes forming a unified whole.” That definition can lead to different interpretations of a montage and can be applied to any art medium. A “montage” isn’t just for movies. Music artists use montages to tell stories that often describe their emotions and experiences; writers create poetry and prose contained in such an artistic form, and painters often use this art form. However, many people are most familiar with the term associated with movies: a montage is essentially a collection of images or scenes that populate a movie with music.</p>
<p>If you’ve seen any blockbuster Hollywood films in the last ten years, you’ve probably seen some Montage. The Montage is a sequence that takes place over a set period and shows us how the lead character goes from being an ordinary person to an extraordinary one. The difference between these two states is dramatic, so we see so many montages in movies. They are meant to grab your attention and excitingly introduce a character.</p>
<h2 id="Purpose-of-Montage"><a href="#Purpose-of-Montage" class="headerlink" title="Purpose of Montage"></a>Purpose of Montage</h2><p>Montage movies are made up of a compilation of short yet powerful scenes put together to make one movie or project.

<li>Montage has several uses in movies. Of course, Montage can be used to show events such as battles or dancing. It can also describe emotions, including sadness, happiness, and sarcasm. These different uses of Montage do come with their styles, but they all share a few common traits.</li>
<li>They’re often used to condense periods of storytime into much smaller but more entertaining segments. The word montage is French for “to construct from many parts .”Montages can now be seen everywhere in film and television, from silent films to blockbuster action movies.</li>
<li>This is frequently used in narratives when the story needs to advance quickly. The characters are going somewhere or doing something else not within the context of the moment in time that represents them. A great example of a montage was used in Rocky when Rocky was training for his fight with Apollo Creed.</li>
<li>A montage allows filmmakers to explore a theme using several sequential shots that can’t be covered in a single shot.</li>

What is an intro video?</h2><p>A video intro is a brief introduction, typically lasting between 5 and 15 seconds, that introduces your video, YouTube channel, or brand. Video intros are becoming increasingly popular. It is often the first occasion on which a viewer will have the chance to interact with the content you produce.</p>

It goes without saying that this is one of the most critical factors to consider when trying to attract and connect with your desired audience.</p>

<h3 id="Adobe-After-Effects"><a href="#Adobe-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Adobe After Effects"></a>Adobe After Effects</h3><p>One of the most well-known pieces of software for creating video effects is called Adobe After Effects. It is capable of producing great motion graphics, and as a result, it should have no trouble animating and producing dynamic video intros or 3D intros for your company, brand, or YouTube channel.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/after-effects-effects-presets-pane.jpg"
                      alt="adobe after effects intro maker"
                ></p>
<p>After Effects is utilized by professionals working in the film business to create aesthetically spectacular work for cinema, television, video, and the online. The most significant drawback to After Effects is the fact that it requires an average beginner around eight weeks to learn the program by watching training videos and going through tutorials. In addition, the fee to join Adobe’s Creative Cloud Suite membership service is quite high.</p>
<h3 id="Canva"><a href="#Canva" class="headerlink" title="Canva"></a>Canva</h3><p>When you use Canva, you will have instant access to a video introduction creator that is hosted on the web. You get access to a number of different themes, as well as royalty-free photographs and videos, as well as a drag-and-drop editor that you can use to create content that you can then share and post everywhere. In addition to providing, you with intro templates, it also gives you the ability to design your own logo. With a freshly designed logo in hand, now would be the ideal time to produce an introduction film using it.</p>
<p>Canva’s mission is to demystify graphic design and make it available to users who are not designers. They also provide a premium edition of Canva, which is ideally suited for teams to collaborate on the creation of designs with the same objective in mind. In addition, Canva Pro is equipped with additional premium features, such as a brand kit and a backdrop remover.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canva-poster.jpg"
                      alt="canva intro maker"
                ></p>
<p>Canva is an easy-to-use website that provides free access to some of its features, which may be used to create great movies. However, some limitations to using Canva include the fact that it only supports a limited number of output formats and there is a possibility that you will experience connectivity troubles while attempting to save and export your video introductions.</p>
<p>When it came to design, I previously relied on a combination of Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, and PicMonkey until I discovered Canva. After some time, we were able to navigate both with ease, but we found that Canva was more difficult to use than PicMonkey. Canva had a steep learning curve and lacked some of the features I was looking for in a design program.</p>
<p>We choose to disregard it. But I decided to give it another shot about two or three years ago, and this time I was impressed enough to switch PicMonkey out for it in my collection of editing tools. Canva had added a large number of features that made the program simpler to use and gave users the ability to accomplish more.</p>
<h3 id="Promo"><a href="#Promo" class="headerlink" title="Promo"></a>Promo</h3><p>Promo has a wonderful look that pops. You may build quick video intros for your social media or YouTube channel by using their intro maker, and then post and share them on your social networks afterwards. Promo.com provides filmmakers and video editors with high-quality professional video clips, royalty-free music, adjustable video templates, bespoke text, and logos, and more through their monthly membership programs. You may utilize Promo to create videos in a variety of orientations and forms, including horizontal, vertical, square, and even banner films.</p>
<p>To summarize, Promo is a video maker that has an impressive design and allows for direct uploads to various social media platforms. The only problem is that their website occasionally becomes unresponsive and sluggish. Because of this, the process of creation can become rather laborious and drawn out.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Promo.com is my one-stop-shop for all of my business promotional videos because it offers a variety of video ad templates that I can easily edit on my browser without the need for any program, and they also offer a great selection of stock footage and text overlay options to make the videos look more professional. Promo.com has a lot of awesome templates for a bunch of different categories.</p>

<p>A video intro is a brief introduction, typically lasting between 5 and 15 seconds, that introduces your video, YouTube channel, or brand. Video intros are becoming increasingly popular. It is often the first occasion on which a viewer will have the chance to interact with the content you produce.</p>
<p>Because of this, it has the power to attract attention from the very beginning and to develop trust in the company or product that you are promoting. It goes without saying that this is one of the most critical factors to consider when trying to attract and connect with your desired audience.</p>
<h2 id="2-What-are-some-good-intro-makers-1"><a href="#2-What-are-some-good-intro-makers-1" class="headerlink" title="2. What are some good intro makers?"></a>2. What are some good intro makers?</h2><p>Here you will a list of many great intro makers you can use for free and paid.</p>
<h3 id="Adobe-After-Effects-1"><a href="#Adobe-After-Effects-1" class="headerlink" title="Adobe After Effects"></a>Adobe After Effects</h3><p>One of the most well-known pieces of software for creating video effects is called Adobe After Effects. It is capable of producing great motion graphics, and as a result, it should have no trouble animating and producing dynamic video intros or 3D intros for your company, brand, or YouTube channel.</p>

                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/after-effects-effects-presets-pane.jpg"
                      alt="adobe after effects intro maker"
                ></p>
<p>After Effects is utilized by professionals working in the film business to create aesthetically spectacular work for cinema, television, video, and the online. The most significant drawback to After Effects is the fact that it requires an average beginner around eight weeks to learn the program by watching training videos and going through tutorials. In addition, the fee to join Adobe’s Creative Cloud Suite membership service is quite high.</p>
<h3 id="Canva-1"><a href="#Canva-1" class="headerlink" title="Canva"></a>Canva</h3><p>When you use Canva, you will have instant access to a video introduction creator that is hosted on the web. You get access to a number of different themes, as well as royalty-free photographs and videos, as well as a drag-and-drop editor that you can use to create content that you can then share and post everywhere. In addition to providing, you with intro templates, it also gives you the ability to design your own logo. With a freshly designed logo in hand, now would be the ideal time to produce an introduction film using it.</p>
<p>Canva’s mission is to demystify graphic design and make it available to users who are not designers. They also provide a premium edition of Canva, which is ideally suited for teams to collaborate on the creation of designs with the same objective in mind. In addition, Canva Pro is equipped with additional premium features, such as a brand kit and a backdrop remover.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canva-poster.jpg"
                      alt="canva intro maker"
                ></p>
<p>Canva is an easy-to-use website that provides free access to some of its features, which may be used to create great movies. However, some limitations to using Canva include the fact that it only supports a limited number of output formats and there is a possibility that you will experience connectivity troubles while attempting to save and export your video introductions.</p>
<p>When it came to design, I previously relied on a combination of Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, and PicMonkey until I discovered Canva. After some time, we were able to navigate both with ease, but we found that Canva was more difficult to use than PicMonkey. Canva had a steep learning curve and lacked some of the features I was looking for in a design program.</p>
<p>We choose to disregard it. But I decided to give it another shot about two or three years ago, and this time I was impressed enough to switch PicMonkey out for it in my collection of editing tools. Canva had added a large number of features that made the program simpler to use and gave users the ability to accomplish more.</p>
<h3 id="Promo-1"><a href="#Promo-1" class="headerlink" title="Promo"></a>Promo</h3><p>Promo has a wonderful look that pops. You may build quick video intros for your social media or YouTube channel by using their intro maker, and then post and share them on your social networks afterwards. Promo.com provides filmmakers and video editors with high-quality professional video clips, royalty-free music, adjustable video templates, bespoke text, and logos, and more through their monthly membership programs. You may utilize Promo to create videos in a variety of orientations and forms, including horizontal, vertical, square, and even banner films.</p>
<p>To summarize, Promo is a video maker that has an impressive design and allows for direct uploads to various social media platforms. The only problem is that their website occasionally becomes unresponsive and sluggish. Because of this, the process of creation can become rather laborious and drawn out.</p>

                      alt="promo intro maker"
                ></p>
<p>Promo.com is my one-stop-shop for all of my business promotional videos because it offers a variety of video ad templates that I can easily edit on my browser without the need for any program, and they also offer a great selection of stock footage and text overlay options to make the videos look more professional. Promo.com has a lot of awesome templates for a bunch of different categories.</p>
<h3 id="Filmora-1"><a href="#Filmora-1" class="headerlink" title="Filmora"></a>Filmora</h3><p>If you’re worried about how challenging and time-consuming it will be to create the ideal video introduction, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> will put those worries to rest.

Make use of keyframing to modify the dynamism and smoothness of your edits with the help of animated effects. The chroma key tool allows you to get rid of green screens and create amazing effects that will blow people away. And AI Motion Tracking is just what you need to make it possible for text or graphics to automatically track specific objects throughout your films.</p>
