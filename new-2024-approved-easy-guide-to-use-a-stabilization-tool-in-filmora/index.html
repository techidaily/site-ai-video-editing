Shaking movement on your camera is often inevitable, especially if you don’t use a camera stabilizer or a camera with no built-in image stabilization. As a result, it can make your video look distracting and difficult to watch.</p>
<p>But you don’t need to worry. You can use a stabilization tool in <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. A stabilization tool is a feature that can help to correct for camera shake and other types of movement. If you are a handheld shooter, you will find this tool extremely helpful.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-When-do-you-need-to-stabilize-your-video"><a href="#Part-1-When-do-you-need-to-stabilize-your-video" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: When do you need to stabilize your video?"></a>Part 1: When do you need to stabilize your video?</h2><p>Now, let’s talk about when you should stabilize your video. If you’re shooting something that is moving, like people or animals, you will definitely want to stabilize your video. This will help ensure that the video is smooth and steady.</p>
<p>Another time you may want to stabilize your video is if you’re shooting in a low-light situation. It will help to ensure that your video is not too shaky.</p>
<p>Finally, if you’re shooting a video that’s going to be displayed on a large screen, you may want to stabilize your video. Stabilizing your video will help ensure the output is crisp and clear.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-stabilize-your-video-with-Filmora"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-stabilize-your-video-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to stabilize your video with Filmora"></a>Part 2: How to stabilize your video with Filmora</h2><p>Filmora has a stabilization feature that can help to smooth your video and make it look more professional. If you haven’t installed Filmora yet, you can download it for free.</p>

<p>So, should you have a wobble movement in your video, follow these steps to make it smoother in no time:</p>
<p>Step1 Launch Filmora 11 and <strong>create a new project</strong>.</p>
<p>Step2 Import your video to Filmora.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/stabilization-tool-in-filmora-1.jpg"
                      alt="import your video to filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 After you import your video to Filmora, the Stabilization must have been off. So, <strong>switch the Stabilization toggle on</strong>, then a loading bar will start going up to analyze the clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/stabilization-tool-in-filmora-2.jpg"
                      alt="switch the stabilization toggle on"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 Once it finishes analyzing, the smooth level will default to 10. See the preview whether you like how it turns out.</p>
<p><strong>Before</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/stabilization-tool-in-filmora-3.gif"
                      alt="before finish analyzing"
                ></p>
<p><strong>After</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/stabilization-tool-in-filmora-4.gif"
                      alt="after finish analyzing"
                ></p>
<p>Please note that the center point of your image will always be the most stable. The more shaky a clip is, the more it will crop into that image.</p>
<p>If you are unsatisfied with the default setting, increasing the Smoothness Level will result in more cropping to the image. On the contrary, if you put the Smoothness Level down to zero, you are no longer cropping into the image, but the result won’t be as smooth.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/stabilization-tool-in-filmora-5.gif"
                      alt="adjust smothness level as byou like"
                ></p>
<p>Should the cropping bother you, such as it crops the subject’s hair out of the frame, you can adjust it with <strong>Edge Processing</strong>.</p>
<p>If you change it to <strong>None</strong>, you will see the black bars that simulate how it stabilizes the clip. Try to hit play on the preview screen, and then you can see more clearly how the tool keeps the center of the frame to make it stable and less shaky.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="hit play on the preview screen"
                ></p>
<p>As <strong>Reflect</strong> is the default, the <strong>Extend</strong> uses artificial intelligence to extend the pixels, as you are often aware in Photoshop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="extend the pixels"
                ></p>
<p>Besides the three, there is also the <strong>Tile</strong> option. Each of them would give a different result. You can try and use the one that works best for you.</p>
<h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>When you’re shooting a video, you must have wanted it to be as smooth and stable as possible. By stabilizing your video, you can help ensure it’s smooth and easy to watch.</p>

In the editing phase of the video, the green screen is replaced with any background image or video effect that stays intact in the video as long as possible. In short, the green screen technique involves superimposing photos and videos on the green screen in a video.</p>
<p>Starting from the video game industry, movie industry to video streaming and TV channels, the green screen technique is used everywhere. The stunning graphical component of these industries is totally dependent on the green screen technique. In fact, DIY green screen for zoom meetings and video conferencing is widely used. Along with that, YouTubers and Twitch streamers use DIY green screen for streaming live.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, instead of a green screen, you can use any other color of screen. However, green screens are widely used, and it has become a norm. The main point to remember when using a green screen is that nothing else should have green color such as the dresses the subject is wearing. Therefore, in technical terms, the green screen is referred to as Chroma Key, and you will find Chroma Key option instead of green screen in most video editors.</p>
<h2 id="Why-Use-Green-Screen-Technique"><a href="#Why-Use-Green-Screen-Technique" class="headerlink" title="Why Use Green Screen Technique?"></a>Why Use Green Screen Technique?</h2><p>The main reason why the green screen technique is used in movie and video making is that the video editor can replace the entire background at once instead of replacing the background frame by frame. Once you replace a green screen with an image or video effect, it stays the same throughout the video as long as required.</p>
<p>Therefore, the video editor can save a lot of time in editing and the editing stays uniform throughout which gives a realistic effect. If the green screen technique is not used and editing is done frame by frame of a video, there could be a manual error, inconsistent, and graphical glitches.</p>
<p>You can replace green screens with anything you want. It could be a still image of a beautiful studio with 3D effect like you see in case of YouTubers and gamers. It could be a moving, real-life landscape on any place in the world instead of a beautiful background picture. Similarly, it could be replaced by video effects such as explosions, stadiums full of people, battlefields, and likewise. At times, it could be live animations as you see on TV channels.</p>

<ul>
<li>A green cloth that is large enough to cover the entire background.</li>
<li>A video editing software to replace green screen in your video with anything.</li>
<li>External light for more video clarity and a good camera with mic.</li>
</ul>
<p>Step 1: Setup DIY Green Backdrop</p>
<p>Your green fabric should be soft and bright. If you are going to be the subject of the video, make sure you are not wearing anything green. Moreover, do not keep any object within the video frame that is green in color. If there are too many green objects, you can use a blue screen.</p>
<p>When it comes to hanging the green cloth in the background, people find it very difficult. If your video frame is going to be a close-up to the subject, you can use a green screen panel to hang green cloth. A green screen panel generally has a collapsible structure for easy storage and transportation.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you need to install hooks in the wall if you are planning to replace the green screen with a studio-like scene so that the entire background of the video frame stays covered with green screen. You should opt for multiple green screens and stitch them together to cover the background completely.</p>
<p>Step 2: Setup Camera and Light</p>
<p>Whether you are shooting with a DSLR camera or smartphone camera or webcam, make sure you are shooting at least HD video quality so that the editing could be great. Lights are important when you are using green screen though they are not a necessity. The video quality and brightness get enhanced with lights. Diffused lights work the best and the background should be well-lit.</p>
<p>Most importantly, you have to place the lights in such a way that your body arms should not be casting any shadow on the green screen. You can either stand very close to the green screen or away from the green screen so that your shadow does not go till the green screen. Instead of starting to shoot the video from the very beginning, you should capture for a few seconds and make sure everything is perfect including the camera angle.</p>
