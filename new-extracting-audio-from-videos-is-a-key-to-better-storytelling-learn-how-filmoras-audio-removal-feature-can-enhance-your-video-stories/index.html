<p><strong>Doesn’t update VLC to the latest version</strong></p>
<p>In cases when the VLC Media Player itself is corrupted or outdated, it cannot allow access to some subtitle formats. You must upgrade it to the latest official version to allow video and SRT file support.</p>
<p><strong>Wrong encoding instead of UTF-8</strong></p>
<p>VLC player app only allows the SRT files that have UTF-8 encoding to play on the platform. Users can view the SRT files on videos if they are using the right encoded text, so make sure that you do not have the wrong encoded file.</p>
