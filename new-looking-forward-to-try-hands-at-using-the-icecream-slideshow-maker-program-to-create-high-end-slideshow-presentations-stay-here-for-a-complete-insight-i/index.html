                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/How-to-make-a-slideshow-with-icecream-slideshow-maker-1.JPG"
                      alt="Icecream Slideshow Maker"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Import Media Files</strong></p>
<p>Post a successful installation, proceed to launch the program and wait for the latter’s welcome screen to appear. In the launch screen, navigate to and tap any one of the ‘Add Photo’ or ‘Add Folder’ buttons at the top left corner to import either a single media file, or an entire media folder to the program’s editing workspace.</p>
<p>Instead of using the ‘Add Folder’ option at the top left, you can also select multiple files by pressing and holding the ‘Ctrl’ key son your system’s keyboard and import them to the editor timeline, all at once. You can alternatively, click on the ‘Add Files to Start Your Photostory’ tab in the center of the software’s welcome screen to import the required media files.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/How-to-make-a-slideshow-with-icecream-slideshow-maker-2.JPG"
                      alt="Icecream Slideshow Maker- Media Selection Interface"
                ></p>
<p>Clicking on any of the aforesaid buttons or tabs will direct you to a ‘File Explorer’ window, where you can make the desired media selections. Your choices are however; filtered according to their respective file formats and only those in line with the formats supported by the Icecream Slideshow creator program are imported to the timeline.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Configure the Presentation Settings</strong></p>
<p>As soon as you finish the media import process, the editing workspace bifurcates to present the ‘Queue’ window at the left and ‘Preview and Settings’ window at the right side of the screen. This is the space where you can proceed to configure your presentation settings.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>File Sorting</strong></p>
<p>To sort the arrangement of a media file, navigate to the ‘File Queue Panel’ at the left and click on the desired file, while using the ‘Arrow Keys’ at the right to change the latter’s position in the queue, or choose to delete it from the queue by tapping the ‘Recycle Bin’ icon beside the file.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Duration and Transition Adjustments</strong></p>
<p>Proceeding further, you can try hands at customizing the duration and transition effects for each of the added media files within the queue. All you need to do is, navigate to and click on the respective tabs within the window. Hit the ‘Time’ button to adjust the screen time of the slides or click on the ‘Transitions’ tab to include suitable animation effects between successive slides for a smooth presentation flow.</p>
<p>You can even stick with a random transition effect to add to the slides, or choose to add no transition effect at all. The inbuilt slideshow player the right side of the editor workspace automatically plays the preview of the applied transition effects. The ‘Transition’ and ‘Time’ settings are the sole customizations that you can apply individually to the slides, the rest of the effects being universally applicable to all the presentation slides together.</p>
<p>If you are interested to apply a particular transition and play duration to all the slides, navigate to and click within the gray bar at the bottom of the file queue to apply the same transition and time characteristics to all the slides of the presentation. You can even opt to delete all the added media files at the same time by tapping the ‘Clear List’ button.</p>

The software works well with the WAV, WMA, FLAC, M4A, MP3 and OGG audio file formats. Navigate to and hit the ‘Add Audio’ button in the editor workspace to ‘Drag and Drop’ the desired music files within the software’s timeline.</p>
<p>There is an option to create a playlist of the selected audio tracks, along with dragging the files to set them in a preferred sequence within the playlist. You are also granted the liberty to try hands at looping the audio playback and uplift the tracks with fade and offset effects within the playlist pane.</p>

<p><strong>Step 6: Tweak Some Extra Settings</strong></p>
<p>If you are keen towards making your presentation more impressive, try experimenting with including transition effects within the slides. Though the <strong>Icecream slideshow maker full version</strong> supports the application of default random transitions, you are allowed to add and customize the same as per your will, both, separately for each slide, as well as to the entre presentation as a whole.</p>
<p>You can even choose to add no transition effect at all, or set the same transition value for all the media files within the queue, by navigating to and clicking on the ‘Common Image Settings in the ’File Queue’ window.</p>

<p>Making and sharing animated GIFs that practically pop out on your friend’s screen can be just the magic one needs to start their day.</p>
<p>3D animated GIFs are growing in popularity and surprisingly, because of a simple trick that even you can try out.</p>
<p>What separates <strong>3D text GIFs</strong> or <strong>3D animation GIFs</strong> from your regular GIFs is that they are bit more difficult but far more fun to make.</p>
<p>3D GIFs are where it feels like the picture is coming out of your screen. Of course, this is just a visual illusion which can be recreated over any video GIF that meets specific parameters.</p>

This approach lets you create convincing 3D GIFs in an easy but deceptive way.</p>
<p>The actual magic behind this trick is the use of white lines that act as reference points separating 3 panels in the image.</p>
<p>Now, any animated elements of the GIF image will seem like they are popping out beyond the pre-set white lines and towards the viewer.</p>
<p>These white lines are used as referencing lines on the screen allowing our brains to bewilder at a passive 3D GIFs coming at us from the screen.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1:</strong> Choosing an Image.</p>
<p>The first step in creating a 3D image is to carefully sort out which moment in your video you wish to convert into 3D. Pick an images or video clips that already have an element that pops out in a forward moving motion.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2:</strong> It should have a smart composition.</p>
<p>Becoming a creator means you need to know more about composition. This can be applicable to anything from making virtual designs to creating GIFs. 3D GIFs requires you to use a special Tumblr ‘frame’ that adds two breaks to the image which creates three horizontal panels. In exceptional cases, you could also use three break points and divide the image into four panels.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3:</strong> Become a content creator.</p>
<p>It’s okay to feel a bit off beat when trying out new skills but the prospects are rewarding. Try taking your own video footage, edit in Photoshop or any similar editing software. You can also opt for instant GIF creator apps that directly converts the footage or image you clicked into a GIF.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4:</strong> Making the split.</p>
<p>The next step would be splitting the image or frame into three panels as guideline for the 3D effects. In Photoshop you can import a GIF and choose ‘View’ from the navigation menu and then click on ‘New Guide’ from the drop down menu. Set the guide to 33% at first and 66% in the second.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5:</strong> Placingthe magical white lines over the guides.</p>
<p>From the shape menu on the sidebar, select the rectangle tool. Right click on this tool to get the shapes menu. Set ‘Fill Colour’ to white and set the weight to five pixels. Click and drag the lines over the guides.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6:</strong> For the final touch.</p>
<p>Merge these line layers and add a layer mask. The objective here is to only mask the panel where the main 3D element of the image which will be moving beyond the guides. How it is done is that you make copies of the frames where the animation goes beyond the guidelines and mask the layers where the element is over the visible layer.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7:</strong>  Enjoy your GIF.</p>
<p>Once you are done masking every frame that you have copied. Replay your GIF to see if everything is in order.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus Tip:</strong> Use <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> to easily edit your videos using amazing tools, filters and affects. You can then make cool 3D GIFs from the videos you make.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1:</strong> Choosing an Image.</p>
<p>The first step in creating a 3D image is to carefully sort out which moment in your video you wish to convert into 3D. Pick an images or video clips that already have an element that pops out in a forward moving motion.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2:</strong> It should have a smart composition.</p>
<p>Becoming a creator means you need to know more about composition. This can be applicable to anything from making virtual designs to creating GIFs. 3D GIFs requires you to use a special Tumblr ‘frame’ that adds two breaks to the image which creates three horizontal panels. In exceptional cases, you could also use three break points and divide the image into four panels.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3:</strong> Become a content creator.</p>
<p>It’s okay to feel a bit off beat when trying out new skills but the prospects are rewarding. Try taking your own video footage, edit in Photoshop or any similar editing software. You can also opt for instant GIF creator apps that directly converts the footage or image you clicked into a GIF.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4:</strong> Making the split.</p>
<p>The next step would be splitting the image or frame into three panels as guideline for the 3D effects. In Photoshop you can import a GIF and choose ‘View’ from the navigation menu and then click on ‘New Guide’ from the drop down menu. Set the guide to 33% at first and 66% in the second.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5:</strong> Placingthe magical white lines over the guides.</p>
<p>From the shape menu on the sidebar, select the rectangle tool. Right click on this tool to get the shapes menu. Set ‘Fill Colour’ to white and set the weight to five pixels. Click and drag the lines over the guides.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6:</strong> For the final touch.</p>
<p>Merge these line layers and add a layer mask. The objective here is to only mask the panel where the main 3D element of the image which will be moving beyond the guides. How it is done is that you make copies of the frames where the animation goes beyond the guidelines and mask the layers where the element is over the visible layer.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7:</strong>  Enjoy your GIF.</p>
<p>Once you are done masking every frame that you have copied. Replay your GIF to see if everything is in order.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus Tip:</strong> Use <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> to easily edit your videos using amazing tools, filters and affects.

<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Make-3D-Gifs-in-Videos-More-Textured-2"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Make-3D-Gifs-in-Videos-More-Textured-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How to Make 3D Gifs in Videos More Textured"></a>Part 3 How to Make 3D Gifs in Videos More Textured</h2><p>You can use GIF makers to create loops in videos you upload but the trick to making your 3D GIF stand out is about to be explained in the following.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1:</strong> Choosing an Image.</p>
<p>The first step in creating a 3D image is to carefully sort out which moment in your video you wish to convert into 3D. Pick an images or video clips that already have an element that pops out in a forward moving motion.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2:</strong> It should have a smart composition.</p>
<p>Becoming a creator means you need to know more about composition. This can be applicable to anything from making virtual designs to creating GIFs. 3D GIFs requires you to use a special Tumblr ‘frame’ that adds two breaks to the image which creates three horizontal panels. In exceptional cases, you could also use three break points and divide the image into four panels.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3:</strong> Become a content creator.</p>
<p>It’s okay to feel a bit off beat when trying out new skills but the prospects are rewarding. Try taking your own video footage, edit in Photoshop or any similar editing software. You can also opt for instant GIF creator apps that directly converts the footage or image you clicked into a GIF.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4:</strong> Making the split.</p>
<p>The next step would be splitting the image or frame into three panels as guideline for the 3D effects. In Photoshop you can import a GIF and choose ‘View’ from the navigation menu and then click on ‘New Guide’ from the drop down menu. Set the guide to 33% at first and 66% in the second.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5:</strong> Placingthe magical white lines over the guides.</p>
<p>From the shape menu on the sidebar, select the rectangle tool. Right click on this tool to get the shapes menu. Set ‘Fill Colour’ to white and set the weight to five pixels. Click and drag the lines over the guides.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6:</strong> For the final touch.</p>
<p>Merge these line layers and add a layer mask. The objective here is to only mask the panel where the main 3D element of the image which will be moving beyond the guides. How it is done is that you make copies of the frames where the animation goes beyond the guidelines and mask the layers where the element is over the visible layer.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7:</strong>  Enjoy your GIF.</p>
<p>Once you are done masking every frame that you have copied. Replay your GIF to see if everything is in order.</p>

<p>Making and sharing animated GIFs that practically pop out on your friend’s screen can be just the magic one needs to start their day.</p>
<p>3D animated GIFs are growing in popularity and surprisingly, because of a simple trick that even you can try out.</p>
<p>What separates <strong>3D text GIFs</strong> or <strong>3D animation GIFs</strong> from your regular GIFs is that they are bit more difficult but far more fun to make.</p>
<p>3D GIFs are where it feels like the picture is coming out of your screen. Of course, this is just a visual illusion which can be recreated over any video GIF that meets specific parameters.</p>

This approach lets you create convincing 3D GIFs in an easy but deceptive way.</p>
<p>The actual magic behind this trick is the use of white lines that act as reference points separating 3 panels in the image.</p>
<p>Now, any animated elements of the GIF image will seem like they are popping out beyond the pre-set white lines and towards the viewer.</p>
<p>These white lines are used as referencing lines on the screen allowing our brains to bewilder at a passive 3D GIFs coming at us from the screen.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1:</strong> Choosing an Image.</p>
<p>The first step in creating a 3D image is to carefully sort out which moment in your video you wish to convert into 3D. Pick an images or video clips that already have an element that pops out in a forward moving motion.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2:</strong> It should have a smart composition.</p>
<p>Becoming a creator means you need to know more about composition. This can be applicable to anything from making virtual designs to creating GIFs. 3D GIFs requires you to use a special Tumblr ‘frame’ that adds two breaks to the image which creates three horizontal panels. In exceptional cases, you could also use three break points and divide the image into four panels.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3:</strong> Become a content creator.</p>
<p>It’s okay to feel a bit off beat when trying out new skills but the prospects are rewarding. Try taking your own video footage, edit in Photoshop or any similar editing software. You can also opt for instant GIF creator apps that directly converts the footage or image you clicked into a GIF.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4:</strong> Making the split.</p>
<p>The next step would be splitting the image or frame into three panels as guideline for the 3D effects. In Photoshop you can import a GIF and choose ‘View’ from the navigation menu and then click on ‘New Guide’ from the drop down menu. Set the guide to 33% at first and 66% in the second.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5:</strong> Placingthe magical white lines over the guides.</p>
<p>From the shape menu on the sidebar, select the rectangle tool. Right click on this tool to get the shapes menu. Set ‘Fill Colour’ to white and set the weight to five pixels. Click and drag the lines over the guides.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6:</strong> For the final touch.</p>
<p>Merge these line layers and add a layer mask. The objective here is to only mask the panel where the main 3D element of the image which will be moving beyond the guides. How it is done is that you make copies of the frames where the animation goes beyond the guidelines and mask the layers where the element is over the visible layer.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7:</strong>  Enjoy your GIF.</p>
<p>Once you are done masking every frame that you have copied. Replay your GIF to see if everything is in order.</p>

<p>“Google drive is a self-hosted cloud-based site that provides free space to store your files and pictures to share them with your friends and family”.</p>
<p>Google Drive is also used to promote businesses or websites. You can upload a video to Google Drive and embed the file in your blog or any other website.</p>
<p><strong>What is a Thumbnail?</strong></p>
<p>“A Thumbnail is a still image that acts as</p>
<p>a preview image of your video.”</p>
<p>A thumbnail is the first thing seen by the viewers while watching videos. It is the only thing that forces the viewer either to watch the video or not because it previews the video content. It is also shown in the search results. A thumbnail is just like the cover or title of a book. You will read a book by its cover. In the same way, a video is viewed by its thumbnail.</p>
<p>Google drive is also used for the promotion of websites and businesses. It does not offer to add a thumbnail or cover image like YouTube has the option to set and can change the thumbnail of the video. As we all know Google drive is not a streaming platform and has its own boundaries.</p>
<p>Normally, the google drive can generate a thumbnail from the video and uses the generated thumbnail ignoring the one you have uploaded. But on the other hand, if it cannot generate a thumbnail the uploaded thumbnail will be displayed. Usually, the default thumbnail may have weird facial expressions or may not be attractive for the viewers to open the video.</p>
<p>Here we are discussing a few alternatives to change the thumbnail of the video in Google drive.</p>
<p>Select a separate image to be housed in a separate column to set as a thumbnail image and then go into the <strong>details, title,</strong> and <strong>Image settings.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Thumbnails should be added at the start of the video.</li>
<li>The Thumbnail should be a few seconds long so that google drive considers it as a cover image.</li>
<li>It works for short videos but it can be applied for long videos.</li>
<li>Use a high-quality HD image for the thumbnail so that Google Drive can accept it as valuable for the thumbnail image.</li>
<li>Thumbnails should be uploaded in <strong>PNG, GIF, or JPG</strong></li>
<li>The image ratio should be <strong>16:9</strong> and resolution of <strong>1920x1080</strong> pixels for PNG and JPG and <strong>960x480</strong> pixels for GIFs.</li>
<li>The maximum file size should be</li>
<li>The minimum width should be 220 pixels.</li>
