<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Remove-the-Background-of-a-Photo-in-PowerPoint"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Remove-the-Background-of-a-Photo-in-PowerPoint" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 How to Remove the Background of a Photo in PowerPoint"></a>Part 1 How to Remove the Background of a Photo in PowerPoint</h2><p>If there is anything that a designer hates in his precious photo, then it’s the background. It hides and distracts from the main subject at hand. You can use various photo editing tools to remove the background from PNG images or JPG. However, they may not do the job as easily as you are thinking.</p>
<p>Yes, we know that you may be wondering about Adobe Photoshop now. It can be used for removing the background too but are you ready to pay for it? No, right? This is when you can depend on PowerPoint to erase the background of a photo without any hassle. Make sure you have PowerPoint 2010 or a later version installed before beginning. Because the earlier Microsoft PowerPoint versions don’t have a background removal feature.</p>
<p>Step 1: Open the image in a new tab</p>
<p>Launch PowerPoint on your desktop or Mac and change the layout of the slide to “Blank”. Next, insert your image, which has a solid or high-contrast background. Such pictures are easier to transform and edit.</p>

                      alt="import picture powerpoint"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Select the “Remove Background” option</p>
<p>Click on your image to get the “Picture Format” in the menu toolbar. On the left top side, choose the “Remove Background” option. Now, PowerPoint will try to remove the background automatically. If the final picture that you are getting is not satisfactory, move to the next step.</p>

                      alt="click remove background powerpoint"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: Select the Area</p>
<p>From the given options in the toolbar, mark the areas that you want to keep or remove in the final result. As you can view, how some parts of the pictures have been cut. So, spread the box to cover the entire area of the image, which you want to keep. Remember, purple-highlighted areas are removed automatically.</p>

                      alt="select area for background removal powerpoint"
                ></p>
<p>If you want to ensure a better result, use the cursor. Start hovering over the background and the main subject to get the plus and minus sign. These signs are useful for getting a precise image at the end. The Minus sign allows you to mark the areas to be removed. The plus sign can be used to keep the marked areas in the final picture.</p>
<p>Step 4: Finishing Touches</p>
<p>Check your image carefully and see whether any area is left to be removed or not. You can zoom in to find the tiniest spot. When you are satisfied with every detail, click anywhere outside of the image to stop further edits. Congratulations! Your transparent PNG is ready to save. Go to “File”&gt;”Save As” and find the option to save your picture in PNG transparent format.</p>

<p>If the image is already saved on your device, simply hit “Click to Upload” or, if you wish, drag and drop the JPG image to initiate the conversion. On the other hand, in case the image is not available, you can copy and paste from a URL in the “Paste an image or video URL” box.</p>
<p>Step 2: Pick a Tool</p>
<p>After the image upload finishes, the next thing is to start removing its background. Go to the right side of the “Image” tab and click on the “Erase” button. Otherwise, you can use the “Remove Background from Image” tool to start.</p>

<p>You have two options to choose from – Erase and Magic Wand. The first tool gives you full control over what you want to remove or keep. Adjust the “eraser size” by sliding right on the dial. This way, you can remove the background precisely.</p>
<p>Apart from that, the Magic Wand tool is amazing for removing a particular area at once. You can remove the picture background in less time and effort. If you want to remove a certain area of the same color, then the Magic Wand is the best tool to use. It eliminates similar groups of pixels together. To modify the sensitivity, move the same dial to the right as you did while selecting the “Erase” tool.</p>
<p>For some impressive results, adjust the zoom and choose “Move” to select the pixels you want to remove.</p>
<p>Step 3: Make the PNG and Download</p>
<p>After everything has been set, it’s time to download your PNG transparent file. Click “Done” and then move back to the Kapwing Studio for additional features. You can add watermarks, text, and a lot more. Finally, hit the “Publish” button placed at the top right and “Download” to save the PNG file to your desktop.</p>

<p>Yes, we know that you may be wondering about Adobe Photoshop now. It can be used for removing the background too but are you ready to pay for it? No, right? This is when you can depend on PowerPoint to erase the background of a photo without any hassle. Make sure you have PowerPoint 2010 or a later version installed before beginning.

<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Remove-the-Background-of-a-Photo-in-PowerPoint-3"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Remove-the-Background-of-a-Photo-in-PowerPoint-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 How to Remove the Background of a Photo in PowerPoint"></a>Part 1 How to Remove the Background of a Photo in PowerPoint</h2><p>If there is anything that a designer hates in his precious photo, then it’s the background. It hides and distracts from the main subject at hand. You can use various photo editing tools to remove the background from PNG images or JPG. However, they may not do the job as easily as you are thinking.</p>
<p>Yes, we know that you may be wondering about Adobe Photoshop now. It can be used for removing the background too but are you ready to pay for it? No, right? This is when you can depend on PowerPoint to erase the background of a photo without any hassle. Make sure you have PowerPoint 2010 or a later version installed before beginning. Because the earlier Microsoft PowerPoint versions don’t have a background removal feature.</p>
<p>Step 1: Open the image in a new tab</p>
<p>Launch PowerPoint on your desktop or Mac and change the layout of the slide to “Blank”. Next, insert your image, which has a solid or high-contrast background. Such pictures are easier to transform and edit.</p>

                      alt="import picture powerpoint"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Select the “Remove Background” option</p>
<p>Click on your image to get the “Picture Format” in the menu toolbar. On the left top side, choose the “Remove Background” option. Now, PowerPoint will try to remove the background automatically. If the final picture that you are getting is not satisfactory, move to the next step.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="click remove background powerpoint"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: Select the Area</p>
<p>From the given options in the toolbar, mark the areas that you want to keep or remove in the final result. As you can view, how some parts of the pictures have been cut. So, spread the box to cover the entire area of the image, which you want to keep. Remember, purple-highlighted areas are removed automatically.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="select area for background removal powerpoint"
                ></p>
<p>If you want to ensure a better result, use the cursor. Start hovering over the background and the main subject to get the plus and minus sign. These signs are useful for getting a precise image at the end. The Minus sign allows you to mark the areas to be removed. The plus sign can be used to keep the marked areas in the final picture.</p>
<p>Step 4: Finishing Touches</p>
<p>Check your image carefully and see whether any area is left to be removed or not. You can zoom in to find the tiniest spot. When you are satisfied with every detail, click anywhere outside of the image to stop further edits. Congratulations! Your transparent PNG is ready to save. Go to “File”&gt;”Save As” and find the option to save your picture in PNG transparent format.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Convert-JPG-to-Transparent-PNG-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Convert-JPG-to-Transparent-PNG-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to Convert JPG to Transparent PNG"></a>Part 2 How to Convert JPG to Transparent PNG</h2><p>Ever wondered how logos in a graphic match with the background image color? It’s possible with transparent PNG images only. The transparent PNG images format contains superior quality and no background. Hence, it is pretty helpful for the designers to add them to graphics and videos.</p>
<p>In case you have some JPG images but you want it in PNG images format, don’t worry. You can use Kapwing as it’s a trusted content creation and video editing platform.

<p>Launch Kapwing in any browser of your choice. Log in using your account or sign up with a new one. Now, you will be redirected to the Kapwing studio, where you can do all the editing and conversion. Upload your image to the “Kapwing Studio” and use the “Remove Image from Background” tool.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="kapwing interface"
                ></p>
<p>If the image is already saved on your device, simply hit “Click to Upload” or, if you wish, drag and drop the JPG image to initiate the conversion. On the other hand, in case the image is not available, you can copy and paste from a URL in the “Paste an image or video URL” box.</p>
<p>Step 2: Pick a Tool</p>
<p>After the image upload finishes, the next thing is to start removing its background. Go to the right side of the “Image” tab and click on the “Erase” button. Otherwise, you can use the “Remove Background from Image” tool to start.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="pick the tool kapwing"
                ></p>
<p>You have two options to choose from – Erase and Magic Wand. The first tool gives you full control over what you want to remove or keep. Adjust the “eraser size” by sliding right on the dial. This way, you can remove the background precisely.</p>
<p>Apart from that, the Magic Wand tool is amazing for removing a particular area at once. You can remove the picture background in less time and effort. If you want to remove a certain area of the same color, then the Magic Wand is the best tool to use. It eliminates similar groups of pixels together. To modify the sensitivity, move the same dial to the right as you did while selecting the “Erase” tool.</p>
<p>For some impressive results, adjust the zoom and choose “Move” to select the pixels you want to remove.</p>
<p>Step 3: Make the PNG and Download</p>
<p>After everything has been set, it’s time to download your PNG transparent file. Click “Done” and then move back to the Kapwing Studio for additional features. You can add watermarks, text, and a lot more. Finally, hit the “Publish” button placed at the top right and “Download” to save the PNG file to your desktop.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Import the video to Photoshop by going to “File” &gt; “Import” &gt; “Video frames to layers.” Choose the video file you need, and it will appear in the form of separate frames. Now you can select whether you want the entire video or small bits of it; you can also limit the import to any frame to manage the size and time of the video. You can choose different color gradients and many other things according to your preference. And then go to “file” and select “save for web.”</p>

They provide you with the essential tools to make the best GIFs out of any video you want.</p>
<p>So here is a step-by-step method to help you make your GIFs in Photoshop and impress your friends.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: One of the most important steps is to choose the video you want to use in your GIF. GIFs are supposed to be short and express what you want to in that concise sequence, and that’s why choosing a correct sequence of the right length is very important.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now you will have to download the video file to your computer and continue to trim it down to as few frames as possible, and choose the frames that convey the message as accurately as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Import the video to Photoshop by going to “File” &gt; “Import” &gt; “Video frames to layers.” Choose the video file you need, and it will appear in the form of separate frames. Now you can select whether you want the entire video or small bits of it; you can also limit the import to any frame to manage the size and time of the video. You can choose different color gradients and many other things according to your preference. And then go to “file” and select “save for web.”</p>

They provide you with the essential tools to make the best GIFs out of any video you want.</p>
<p>So here is a step-by-step method to help you make your GIFs in Photoshop and impress your friends.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: One of the most important steps is to choose the video you want to use in your GIF. GIFs are supposed to be short and express what you want to in that concise sequence, and that’s why choosing a correct sequence of the right length is very important.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now you will have to download the video file to your computer and continue to trim it down to as few frames as possible, and choose the frames that convey the message as accurately as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Import the video to Photoshop by going to “File” &gt; “Import” &gt; “Video frames to layers.” Choose the video file you need, and it will appear in the form of separate frames. Now you can select whether you want the entire video or small bits of it; you can also limit the import to any frame to manage the size and time of the video. You can choose different color gradients and many other things according to your preference. And then go to “file” and select “save for web.”</p>
