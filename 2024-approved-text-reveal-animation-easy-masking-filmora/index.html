<p>Step 2</p>
<p>Import your footage by clicking on <strong>“Import Media”</strong>. Then, drag your clip to the Timeline to start editing it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="import footage filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3</p>
<p>Review your video and place the Playhead at the point where you want the text reveal to begin.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/move-playhead.png"
                      alt="move playhead"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4</p>
<p>Go to the <strong>Titles</strong> tab and drag the <strong>Basic</strong> title to Track 2 on the Timeline. Then, right-click on the Title clip and go to <strong>Edit Properties.</strong> Here, type in your text and change the font to any bold one. You can also go to the <strong>WordArt</strong> tab to further customize your text. Click <strong>OK.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="insert title filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5</p>
<p>Now, move the text to fit the objects or people on your video perfectly. Copy the video clip on Track 1. Then, lock both Track 1 and Track 2 by pressing the key-lock button. Right-click anywhere above Track 2 and select <strong>Paste.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="copy clip"
                ></p>
<p>Step 6</p>
<p>Move the Playhead to where the clip on Track 2 starts. Right-click on the clip in Track 3 → go to <strong>Edit Properties</strong> → select the <strong>Mask</strong> tab → click on <strong>Single Line.</strong> Then, adjust the <strong>Rotate</strong> value to “<strong>-180°</strong>”. Drag the slider on the screen to the right side until the text totally disappears next to your moving object. Now, scroll down from the panel on the left and change <strong>Blur Strength</strong> to <strong>1%.</strong></p>

                      alt="add mask filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 7</p>
<p>Next, add a keyframe by clicking on the “**+Add**” button. Move the Playhead one frame forward. Drag the X-axis to the left slowly to reveal a tiny portion of the text on the screen. Then, repeat this as many times as it takes until the full text is revealed, going one frame at a time.</p>
