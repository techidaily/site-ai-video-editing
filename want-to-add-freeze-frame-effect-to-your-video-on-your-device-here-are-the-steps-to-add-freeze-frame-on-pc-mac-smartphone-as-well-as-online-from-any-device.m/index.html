Videos are like windows to the past, allowing us to relive precious moments and memories. Similarly, good-looking videos have this remarkable ability to last forever. Even when it comes to content creation, videos are a great engagement tool. They engage audiences like no other medium can, conveying emotions and messages.</p>
<p>However, <strong>VHS effects</strong> have added more spice to the content creation and the creative work behind it. They give a normal video a distinct character and style, further improving it. By applying <strong>VHS filters</strong>, you can change the mood of your videos entirely. Applying these effects to your videos sometimes becomes difficult. However, there is always a simple solution to apply VHS to your videos.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-VHS-Effect-An-Overview"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-VHS-Effect-An-Overview" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is VHS Effect? An Overview"></a>Part 1: What is VHS Effect? An Overview</h2><p>People from the 80s would remember the good old days when they used to watch movies on VHS tapes. In simple terms, the <strong>VHS effect</strong> is a style that tries to recreate the look of VHS recordings. It’s a nostalgic-style effect that has gained popularity in recent years. You can apply different filters and techniques to your videos to achieve this effect.</p>
<p>These techniques aim to replicate the features of VHS tapes. The key features of the VHS filters include distortion, noise, and tracking errors. Distortion and noise create flickering lines and static. Furthermore, the tracking errors give the impression of an unstable video signal. These elements make the video appear just like the old VHS tapes from the 80s.</p>
<p>Additionally, color grading plays an important role in creating this effect. VHS tapes had a unique color palette with saturated and slightly shifted colors. You can replicate this effect by adjusting and applying color grading effects.</p>

This part will discuss the steps to add VHS video effects using Premiere Pro. Although you can also try this on your Mac, you can surely look for other options. If you are a consistent user of FCPX instead of Premiere Pro, you can also <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >apply VFH effects to your videos using FCPX <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open Adobe Premiere Pro and import the video to which you want to apply the effect. Click on the “Color” option in the main toolbar to open the “Lumetri Color” panel. In the panel, choose “Lumetri Scopes” from the top toolbar to open a graph window.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Switch to the “Creative” tab in the “Lumetri Color” panel. Increase the “Faded Film” to your preference. Lower the “Sharpness,” “Saturation,” and “Vibrance” as desired. Adjust the color wheels in the “Color Wheels &amp; Match” section of the “Lumetri Color” tab to achieve the desired VHS look. Find the “Vignette” option in the same tab and increase its value.</p>
