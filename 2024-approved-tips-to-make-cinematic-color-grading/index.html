<p>You can choose from many different look presets and movie emulations based on Hollywood movies plus real-time previews of your favorite LUTs with this software.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Cinematic-Color-Grading"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Cinematic-Color-Grading" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is Cinematic Color Grading?"></a>Part 1. What is Cinematic Color Grading?</h2><p>The cinematic look is all the rage these days and aims to mimic images captured on real film rather than digitally created. To achieve this effect, film directors use various means from lighting to cinematic color gradation. The latter is a powerful tool for bringing a cool or warm tone to a video and providing smooth color transitions to fall on an image that doesn’t look too real but feels emotional.</p>
<p>This kind of post-production processing, which produces beautiful results when used by color magicians, requires a deep understanding of colors and their effect on our psyche and even physiology. It’s not enough to watch a color grading video and use a LUT to get where you want. You should at the very least have an understanding of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Color wheel</li>
<li>Color quality</li>
<li>Color harmony and discord</li>
<li>Warm and cool colors</li>
<li>Color context</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Part-2-Tips-to-make-cinematic-color-grading"><a href="#Part-2-Tips-to-make-cinematic-color-grading" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Tips to make cinematic color grading"></a>Part 2. Tips to make cinematic color grading</h2><p>Here are three helpful tips to create cinematic-looking images in DaVinci Resolve.</p>
<p>In my 10-year career as a colorist, I’ve worked on every type of content imaginable: short, long, commercial, educational, episodic—you name it. And while each of these formats requires its approach, the one constant that spans them all is the client’s desire for a cinematic look.</p>
<p>Virtually all of us aspire to more cinematic color, but we often come up short—in part because the term itself has become too broad to effectively target. To focus on the goal, I like to think of “cinematic” as “an image whose key visual properties are consistent with those of printed film.”</p>
<p>The print film was the primary medium through which we consumed cinematic images for the first century of filmmaking and is therefore at the very heart of cinematic aesthetics. In this video, I’ll show you my top three secrets to achieving this aesthetic quickly and consistently in Davinci Resolve.</p>
<h3 id="Tips1-Create-Color-Density"><a href="#Tips1-Create-Color-Density" class="headerlink" title="Tips1: Create Color Density"></a>Tips1: Create Color Density</h3><p>The first secret to film color is to create color density. Another key aesthetic property of film images is that colors can be either highly saturated or highly luminescent but cannot be both.</p>
<p>We can mimic this visual characteristic by identifying strongly saturated colors in our image and using the Hue vs. Lum to reduce their brightness. This simple technique is especially effective on pure primary colors (red, green, and blue).</p>

                      alt="create color density"
                ></p>
<h3 id="Tips2-Separation-Beats-Saturation"><a href="#Tips2-Separation-Beats-Saturation" class="headerlink" title="Tips2: Separation Beats Saturation"></a>Tips2: Separation Beats Saturation</h3><p>The second secret to film color is prioritizing separation over saturation. When you feel like an image lacks overall color or pop, it’s all too easy to reach for the saturation knob, but that’s not a very cinematic solution.</p>
<p>Instead, try using split toning—pushing cool colors into shadows and warm colors into highlights—to increase tonal separation and add depth to an image. This characteristic is present in virtually every film print and is deeply evocative when applied correctly.</p>
<h3 id="Tips3-Strong-Contrast-is-Your-Friend"><a href="#Tips3-Strong-Contrast-is-Your-Friend" class="headerlink" title="Tips3: Strong Contrast is Your Friend"></a>Tips3: Strong Contrast is Your Friend</h3><p>The third secret of film colors is a strong contrast. This is not always easy, as a higher contrast look inherently requires more precision with exposure placement. Too often we pump up some contrast, end up with an image that looks blown out or too crisp, and then immediately back away from editing.</p>
<p>However, if you stick with high contrast long enough to improve your exposure, you’ll get a very different result and be well on your way to a more cinematic image.</p>

<ul>
<li>Contrast: By adjusting this setting, you can control the brightness and color in different parts of the image.</li>
<li>Saturation: This setting highlights the gray part of the video to a shade. You can adjust it to make the colors of the entire video image appear more saturated or more subdued.</li>
<li>Brightness: You can change this setting to adjust the overall darkness and lightness of your project.</li>
<li>Hue: Hue is generally the lightness of a color. Let’s say that when red is saturated with white, it creates a shade of pink.</li>
<li>3D LUT: 3D lookup tables provide your media with Hollywood movie color sets like the 007 series, Batman, Harry Porter, etc.</li>
