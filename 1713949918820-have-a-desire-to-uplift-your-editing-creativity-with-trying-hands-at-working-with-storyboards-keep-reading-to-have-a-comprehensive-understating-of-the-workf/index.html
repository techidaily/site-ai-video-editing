However, many conversion websites and software on the internet offer you the facility to <strong>convert GIF to AVI</strong> file format with ease of use.

However, many conversion websites and software on the internet offer you the facility to <strong>convert GIF to AVI</strong> file format with ease of use. With these online tools, you also get the opportunity to upload the converted file on various social media channels. Unlike real video, these files have less memory and are easy to save on your device or hard disk.</p>
<p>Although both AVI and GIF are two commonly used file formats, they are different. First of all, GIF stands for Graphical Interchange Format, and it is an image format that can store several consequent or dis-consequent pictures into an animated file. In contrast, AVI is a lossless video file format. This guide focuses on turning GIF animated images into AVI videos and gives a list of the best <strong>GIF to AVI converters</strong> you can choose from.</p>

<h2 id="Introduction-3"><a href="#Introduction-3" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>It will be much fun if you get to assort most of your GIF files and turn them into full-length streaming videos. However, many conversion websites and software on the internet offer you the facility to <strong>convert GIF to AVI</strong> file format with ease of use. With these online tools, you also get the opportunity to upload the converted file on various social media channels. Unlike real video, these files have less memory and are easy to save on your device or hard disk.</p>
<p>Although both AVI and GIF are two commonly used file formats, they are different. First of all, GIF stands for Graphical Interchange Format, and it is an image format that can store several consequent or dis-consequent pictures into an animated file. In contrast, AVI is a lossless video file format. This guide focuses on turning GIF animated images into AVI videos and gives a list of the best <strong>GIF to AVI converters</strong> you can choose from.</p>

<p>Step7 You can choose the stock backgrounds in the app and change the colors as you see fit. Alternatively, you can import a media file from your internal storage to use as a background. If you are satisfied with the new background, tap on “EXPORT” to share the new media on social platforms or save it to your mobile devices.</p>

<h2 id="Conclusion-5"><a href="#Conclusion-5" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Your videos can only go viral if you make a valiant effort to post top-tier content. A pro tip when changing the background to your video is to ensure it blends well with the footage to avoid harsh lines that look unprofessional. A little practice goes a long way, and within no time, you will be editing your videos like a pro! Your fans will also notice a significant change in the quality of your videos over time.</p>
