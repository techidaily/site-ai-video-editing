But many of us can’t afford this, so read this article to get an alternative.</p>
<p>You can use smartphones to record cinematic shots if you don’t have expensive lenses. You’ll learn about filming and editing those shots into Wondershare Filmora to get professional results in the below lines.</p>
<p>But before we get into the filming process, having a general idea about the topic can help a lot. So first, let’s understand what cinematic videos are!</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-a-Cinematic-Video"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-a-Cinematic-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is a Cinematic Video?"></a>Part 1. What Is a Cinematic Video?</h2><p>The world of cinema has developed and has high recording quality. A cinematic video is a video that is recorded to look more like a movie. These shots excel in all aspects of a video, such as Color, aspect ratio, and lighting techniques.</p>
<p>Most of the cinematic footage required unique cameras, i.e., <strong>IMAX</strong> cameras for movies. But these cameras are really costly and only suitable for large-scale production.</p>
<p>With the understanding of cinematic videos, you can now use alternative ways to record a cinematic video without an expensive camera. You can also record a cinematic video using only a smartphone with a few requirements.</p>
<p>Scroll below to learn more about what you need to record a cinematic video!</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Requirements-to-Record-a-Cinematic-Video"><a href="#Part-2-Requirements-to-Record-a-Cinematic-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Requirements to Record a Cinematic Video"></a>Part 2. Requirements to Record a Cinematic Video</h2><p>To record a professional video with cinematic effects, you must have the following equipment in your studio:</p>
<h3 id="1-A-Gimbal-Stabilizer"><a href="#1-A-Gimbal-Stabilizer" class="headerlink" title="1. A Gimbal Stabilizer"></a>1. A Gimbal Stabilizer</h3><p>When you are recording footage from your smartphone, a significant issue that can disturb your video quality is the shaking of your phone. You may have to record while walking, or it could even be a static shot.</p>
<p>If the phone is held in your hands without support, you will end up with shaky footage. This will eventually ruin your video.</p>
<p>A gimbal stabilizer allows you to stabilize your footage with a handheld stand. Many gimbal stabilizers are available in the market, but for reference, we would be looking at the <strong>Q3</strong> Gimbal from <strong>Zhiyun</strong>.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="zhiyun q3 gimbal stabilizer"
                ></p>
<p>You can also connect the Gimbal from its app. Scroll below to learn more about the app!</p>
<p><strong>Zhiyun Cami App</strong></p>
<p><strong>Zhiyun Q3</strong> stabilizer also connects with the Zhiyun cami app. This app will allow users to access the filming features more intuitively and comprehensively. You can connect your Gimbal with the app via Bluetooth.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Zhiyun Stabilizer Shooting Modes</strong></p>
<p>There are many modes on different Gimbals, but the Locking and the POV mode are the most useful, which are illustrated as shown below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Locking mode:</strong> This mode allows you to lock all three motors of the Gimbal and allows your phone to remain fixed at a certain angle. Due to this, you can shoot your footage from multiple positions while keeping the camera fixed at one angle.</li>
<li><strong>The POV mode</strong> will allow you to unlock all the axes. This mode will also adjust in all three axes when moving around. This feature gives you more freedom of movement.</li>
</ul>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Extra Features of Zhiyun Q3 Stabilizer</strong></p>
<p>When you are shooting a video using the Gimbal stabilizer, you come across a point where you want extra light. Thus, the Q3 stabilizer comes with a built-in <strong>flashlight.</strong></p>
<p>This flashlight will not only light up those small corners of a dark room but also make a huge difference. If you are recording to focus on an object, such as a product, this flashlight will greatly help you.</p>

                ></p>
<p>You can also turn the flashlight towards yourself if you are recording a Vlog or taking a selfie. The light’s temperature is 4300K, giving a relatively warm light on the subject.</p>

<h3 id="2-A-Good-Smartphone"><a href="#2-A-Good-Smartphone" class="headerlink" title="2. A Good Smartphone"></a>2. A Good Smartphone</h3><p>Most smartphones these days are equipped with cameras with varying powers of recording. Some smartphone cameras focus on <strong>Mega Pixels,</strong> while others focus on the capture sensor. You need a smartphone camera that balances out all these qualities to record cinematic footage.</p>
<p>The recently released iPhone 14 pro camera is an excellent example of a good quality camera you can use to record cinematic videos.</p>

<p>Now that we have learned about the requirements for recording a cinematic video. Let’s look at the different cinematic movements you can use to record from your Smartphone.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Top-3-Cinematic-Movements-to-Record-From-a-Smartphone"><a href="#Part-3-Top-3-Cinematic-Movements-to-Record-From-a-Smartphone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Top 3 Cinematic Movements to Record From a Smartphone"></a>Part 3. Top 3 Cinematic Movements to Record From a Smartphone</h2><p>You may have watched many movies or TV shows, but the general audience usually ignores the effort put into a shot. Only an experienced videographer can detect the difference between a great cinematic shot and a poor one.</p>
<p>Of the great cinematic shots, some are described in this article. These shots can easily record by using a smartphone. The cinematic movements explained below are the best choice. Here we will look at the three camera movements you can record on your smartphone.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Reveal Movement.</li>
<li>The 180° Presentation Movement.</li>
<li>The Following Movement.</li>
</ul>
<p>First, let’s take a look at the Reveal movement.</p>
<h3 id="1-The-Reveal-Movement"><a href="#1-The-Reveal-Movement" class="headerlink" title="1. The Reveal Movement"></a>1. The Reveal Movement</h3><p>This is the most popular movement used in cinematic shooting from your smartphone. With a Gimbal, the Reveal movement is one of the easiest shots to master. But for this, you will need to learn it first.</p>
<p>The Reveal Movement is a shot taken with an object as a perspective. The shot starts from a static object in the foreground. It could be focused at first, but as the camera moves, the focus will be diverted to reveal our target object. This is known as the Reveal Movement.</p>
<p>To shoot the reveal movement, follow the steps mentioned as shown:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, ensure your phone is connected properly to the <strong>Gimbal</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Align</strong> your Smartphone camera behind the static object.</li>
<li>Guide the target individual to be ready as you move the camera to reveal them.</li>
<li>Slowly move the camera, focusing on the static object to change its focus on your main object.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/shoot-cinematic-footage-8.gif"
                      alt="the reveal movement"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Make sure to practice and experiment a lot with the steps. Try to be more creative and innovative. With every video you shoot, you gain experience with the errors.</p>
<p>Another thing to remember is that when you are shooting a Reveal movement using the Gimbal, it is best to put it in <strong>Locking mode</strong>. This mode works the best as it allows the camera to stay fixed in one frame making your footage seem balanced and of quality.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="gimbal fixed in locking mode"
                ></p>
<h3 id="2-The-180°-Presentation-Movement"><a href="#2-The-180°-Presentation-Movement" class="headerlink" title="2. The 180° Presentation Movement"></a>2. The 180° Presentation Movement</h3><p>The next movement we will be looking at will be the 180° presentation movement. The 180° presentation will move in a half-circle fashion. It will move from one side of the subject to the other side. This will allow you to cover the overall subject’s view.</p>
<p>Apart from that, it will allow you to capture the background with much clarity and detail to maintain a general sense of the ambiance. Making a 180° presentation shot is fairly easy to do so. With its multiple uses, you can use this method in any scenario.</p>
<p>As we will move from one side to the other in a circular manner, we need to fix the frame of our video to move along. Using the <strong>POV</strong> <strong>mode</strong> of the Zhiyun Gimbal stabilizer will be the best option in this sense.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="gimbal fixed in pov mode"
                ></p>
<p>Setting the Gimbal in POV mode will allow you to shoot the video from more than one angle while keeping the video balanced. Follow the steps mentioned to shoot a 180° presentation video:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, start recording from one side of the subject while keeping the Gimbal in the POV mode.</li>
<li>Slowly start moving in front of the subject in an arch.</li>
<li>When you face the subject, do not stop and keep moving to complete the arch.</li>
<li>When you reach the end of the arch, close the video.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="the 180° presentation movement"
                ></p>
<p>By following the steps mentioned, you can create the 180° presentation movement using a smartphone. Now, move forward to learn about “The Following movement.”</p>
<h3 id="3-The-Following-Movement"><a href="#3-The-Following-Movement" class="headerlink" title="3. The Following Movement"></a>3. The Following Movement</h3><p>You can use “The following movement” when recording a scene in which the object moves in random directions. Or when there is a high degree of movement of your object in the video, and you want to fix the focus of your footage to that object.</p>
<p>The Following movement is not technically a movement, but a setting that will allow you to record the footage while keeping the object and the video frame focused. In this type of footage, we will use the Zhiyun Cami app to focus on our target object.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="drawing a square to focus the subject"
                ></p>
<p>To focus on our subject in the video by Cami app, follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li>When recording the video, make sure to put the Gimbal on a tripod stand.</li>
<li>After that, open the <strong>Cami</strong> app and draw a square over the object you want to keep in focus.</li>
<li>Now, the camera will shift its angle to its perspective wherever the object goes.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p>Congratulations! You have now successfully created a cinematic video using Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Using expensive equipment to record a cinematic video can be a reliable step. But it is not in everyone’s budget. You can also use a smartphone to record a cinematic video by the steps mentioned above and give it a professional look by editing on Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<p>Although it might seem strange initially, but the time is close when everyone will create cinematic videos from their smartphones.</p>
<p>Another thing to remember is that when you are shooting a Reveal movement using the Gimbal, it is best to put it in <strong>Locking mode</strong>. This mode works the best as it allows the camera to stay fixed in one frame making your footage seem balanced and of quality.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<h3 id="2-The-180°-Presentation-Movement-1"><a href="#2-The-180°-Presentation-Movement-1" class="headerlink" title="2. The 180° Presentation Movement"></a>2. The 180° Presentation Movement</h3><p>The next movement we will be looking at will be the 180° presentation movement. The 180° presentation will move in a half-circle fashion. It will move from one side of the subject to the other side. This will allow you to cover the overall subject’s view.</p>
<p>Apart from that, it will allow you to capture the background with much clarity and detail to maintain a general sense of the ambiance. Making a 180° presentation shot is fairly easy to do so. With its multiple uses, you can use this method in any scenario.</p>
<p>As we will move from one side to the other in a circular manner, we need to fix the frame of our video to move along. Using the <strong>POV</strong> <strong>mode</strong> of the Zhiyun Gimbal stabilizer will be the best option in this sense.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="gimbal fixed in pov mode"
                ></p>
<p>Setting the Gimbal in POV mode will allow you to shoot the video from more than one angle while keeping the video balanced. Follow the steps mentioned to shoot a 180° presentation video:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, start recording from one side of the subject while keeping the Gimbal in the POV mode.</li>
<li>Slowly start moving in front of the subject in an arch.</li>
<li>When you face the subject, do not stop and keep moving to complete the arch.</li>
<li>When you reach the end of the arch, close the video.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="the 180° presentation movement"
                ></p>
<p>By following the steps mentioned, you can create the 180° presentation movement using a smartphone. Now, move forward to learn about “The Following movement.”</p>
<h3 id="3-The-Following-Movement-1"><a href="#3-The-Following-Movement-1" class="headerlink" title="3. The Following Movement"></a>3. The Following Movement</h3><p>You can use “The following movement” when recording a scene in which the object moves in random directions. Or when there is a high degree of movement of your object in the video, and you want to fix the focus of your footage to that object.</p>
<p>The Following movement is not technically a movement, but a setting that will allow you to record the footage while keeping the object and the video frame focused. In this type of footage, we will use the Zhiyun Cami app to focus on our target object.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="drawing a square to focus the subject"
                ></p>
<p>To focus on our subject in the video by Cami app, follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li>When recording the video, make sure to put the Gimbal on a tripod stand.</li>
<li>After that, open the <strong>Cami</strong> app and draw a square over the object you want to keep in focus.</li>
<li>Now, the camera will shift its angle to its perspective wherever the object goes.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Step 2: Provide Keywords</strong></p>
<p>After providing a topic, give the keywords required for publishing. The video needs to have all the keywords so that the main content of the video can project adequately.</p>

Here are some editing tips you should stick to improve your video content.</p>
<p><strong>Get The Best Video Editor</strong> - Editing a video is equally important as shooting a video. Once you have the best video editor, you can rest assured that your editing work is half done. This is because you have all the tools to turn your raw video into stunning video. You can experiment and come up with the best editing work to your own surprise.</p>
<p><strong>Get The Length Correct</strong> - In today’s world, viewers have very less time to watch videos. Therefore, a lengthy and elaborative video is a bummer. Hence, you should trim the video and keep only the portions that are relevant, engaging, and not boring.</p>
<p><strong>Start with a Bang</strong> - The first impression is always the most important, and hence, the intro of your video is extremely crucial to keep the attention of the audiences intact. To make the intro interesting, you should not only focus on the content but also on video effects and animations that are attention-grabbing.</p>
<p><strong>Smooth Cuts and Soothing Colours</strong> - When you are cutting from one scene or angle to another, the transition should be smooth so that it does not feel abrupt. Therefore, you should cut scenes when the subjects and objects seem to be static so that the transition is smooth naturally. Play attention to colour and the video editors allow you to enhance the quality by adjusting the colors and picture properties.</p>
<p><strong>Graphical Objects</strong> - Use graphical objects and animated texts wherever possible for better explanations. Things can get boring visually when you do not add graphical elements, transitions, and animations appropriately in different places. Similarly, the use of texts and titles makes the video more engaging. Instead of static texts, there are animated texts and titles available with stickers and memes that you can edit your video with.</p>
<p><strong>Play Attention to Sound</strong> - Sound is the most neglected part of a video by amateur video creators when one should pay attention to it. The sound effects can keep the audiences hooked to your video and make them not get bored. Certain sound effects refresh the attention of the audiences when it starts to fade, and hence, you should place the sound effects wisely.</p>
<p><strong>Proper Flow</strong> - The editing work should be smooth so that the flow of the video is smooth and efficient. It takes time, and hence, you can practice and learn video editing so that your video can stand out instantly after your editing touches. Besides, the editing should be such that the video feels like a story that audiences can invest in and get engaged throughout.</p>
<h2 id="Part-6-How-to-Share-Your-Videos"><a href="#Part-6-How-to-Share-Your-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 6 How to Share Your Videos"></a>Part 6 How to Share Your Videos</h2><p>In order to share videos after trimming them, you need to save the video properly. There are different file formats available for video files. For example, MP4 is the most popular video file format among Windows users. On the contrary, MOV is the most popular video file format. Different file formats have different features such as compression and lossless. According to the file format, the file size varies for the same duration of video.</p>
<p>Therefore, the video trimmer you are using must have different file formats for saving and exporting the editing video files. Some video trimmers have in-built features to share videos on social media platforms and upload on video streaming platforms like YouTube. Depending on your target audiences, you need to adjust the parameters like aspect ratio, video resolution, as well as duration. Besides, you can upload videos on cloud storage and share with anyone as per your requirements.</p>

<p><strong>Get The Length Correct</strong> - In today’s world, viewers have very less time to watch videos. Therefore, a lengthy and elaborative video is a bummer. Hence, you should trim the video and keep only the portions that are relevant, engaging, and not boring.</p>
<p><strong>Start with a Bang</strong> - The first impression is always the most important, and hence, the intro of your video is extremely crucial to keep the attention of the audiences intact. To make the intro interesting, you should not only focus on the content but also on video effects and animations that are attention-grabbing.</p>
<p><strong>Smooth Cuts and Soothing Colours</strong> - When you are cutting from one scene or angle to another, the transition should be smooth so that it does not feel abrupt. Therefore, you should cut scenes when the subjects and objects seem to be static so that the transition is smooth naturally. Play attention to colour and the video editors allow you to enhance the quality by adjusting the colors and picture properties.</p>
<p><strong>Graphical Objects</strong> - Use graphical objects and animated texts wherever possible for better explanations. Things can get boring visually when you do not add graphical elements, transitions, and animations appropriately in different places. Similarly, the use of texts and titles makes the video more engaging. Instead of static texts, there are animated texts and titles available with stickers and memes that you can edit your video with.</p>
<p><strong>Play Attention to Sound</strong> - Sound is the most neglected part of a video by amateur video creators when one should pay attention to it. The sound effects can keep the audiences hooked to your video and make them not get bored. Certain sound effects refresh the attention of the audiences when it starts to fade, and hence, you should place the sound effects wisely.</p>
<p><strong>Proper Flow</strong> - The editing work should be smooth so that the flow of the video is smooth and efficient. It takes time, and hence, you can practice and learn video editing so that your video can stand out instantly after your editing touches. Besides, the editing should be such that the video feels like a story that audiences can invest in and get engaged throughout.</p>

Here are some editing tips you should stick to improve your video content.</p>
<p><strong>Get The Best Video Editor</strong> - Editing a video is equally important as shooting a video. Once you have the best video editor, you can rest assured that your editing work is half done. This is because you have all the tools to turn your raw video into stunning video. You can experiment and come up with the best editing work to your own surprise.</p>
<p><strong>Get The Length Correct</strong> - In today’s world, viewers have very less time to watch videos. Therefore, a lengthy and elaborative video is a bummer. Hence, you should trim the video and keep only the portions that are relevant, engaging, and not boring.</p>
<p><strong>Start with a Bang</strong> - The first impression is always the most important, and hence, the intro of your video is extremely crucial to keep the attention of the audiences intact. To make the intro interesting, you should not only focus on the content but also on video effects and animations that are attention-grabbing.</p>
<p><strong>Smooth Cuts and Soothing Colours</strong> - When you are cutting from one scene or angle to another, the transition should be smooth so that it does not feel abrupt. Therefore, you should cut scenes when the subjects and objects seem to be static so that the transition is smooth naturally. Play attention to colour and the video editors allow you to enhance the quality by adjusting the colors and picture properties.</p>
<p><strong>Graphical Objects</strong> - Use graphical objects and animated texts wherever possible for better explanations. Things can get boring visually when you do not add graphical elements, transitions, and animations appropriately in different places. Similarly, the use of texts and titles makes the video more engaging. Instead of static texts, there are animated texts and titles available with stickers and memes that you can edit your video with.</p>
<p><strong>Play Attention to Sound</strong> - Sound is the most neglected part of a video by amateur video creators when one should pay attention to it. The sound effects can keep the audiences hooked to your video and make them not get bored. Certain sound effects refresh the attention of the audiences when it starts to fade, and hence, you should place the sound effects wisely.</p>
<p><strong>Proper Flow</strong> - The editing work should be smooth so that the flow of the video is smooth and efficient. It takes time, and hence, you can practice and learn video editing so that your video can stand out instantly after your editing touches. Besides, the editing should be such that the video feels like a story that audiences can invest in and get engaged throughout.</p>
<h2 id="Part-6-How-to-Share-Your-Videos-2"><a href="#Part-6-How-to-Share-Your-Videos-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 6 How to Share Your Videos"></a>Part 6 How to Share Your Videos</h2><p>In order to share videos after trimming them, you need to save the video properly.

Different file formats have different features such as compression and lossless. According to the file format, the file size varies for the same duration of video.</p>
<p>Therefore, the video trimmer you are using must have different file formats for saving and exporting the editing video files. Some video trimmers have in-built features to share videos on social media platforms and upload on video streaming platforms like YouTube. Depending on your target audiences, you need to adjust the parameters like aspect ratio, video resolution, as well as duration. Besides, you can upload videos on cloud storage and share with anyone as per your requirements.</p>

<h2 id="Part-5-Editing-Tips-to-Improve-Your-Videos-3"><a href="#Part-5-Editing-Tips-to-Improve-Your-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 5 Editing Tips to Improve Your Videos"></a>Part 5 Editing Tips to Improve Your Videos</h2><p>Apart from trimming, you have to edit different other aspects so that you can make the video engaging and eye-catching. Here are some editing tips you should stick to improve your video content.</p>
<p><strong>Get The Best Video Editor</strong> - Editing a video is equally important as shooting a video. Once you have the best video editor, you can rest assured that your editing work is half done. This is because you have all the tools to turn your raw video into stunning video. You can experiment and come up with the best editing work to your own surprise.</p>
<p><strong>Get The Length Correct</strong> - In today’s world, viewers have very less time to watch videos. Therefore, a lengthy and elaborative video is a bummer. Hence, you should trim the video and keep only the portions that are relevant, engaging, and not boring.</p>
<p><strong>Start with a Bang</strong> - The first impression is always the most important, and hence, the intro of your video is extremely crucial to keep the attention of the audiences intact. To make the intro interesting, you should not only focus on the content but also on video effects and animations that are attention-grabbing.</p>
<p><strong>Smooth Cuts and Soothing Colours</strong> - When you are cutting from one scene or angle to another, the transition should be smooth so that it does not feel abrupt. Therefore, you should cut scenes when the subjects and objects seem to be static so that the transition is smooth naturally. Play attention to colour and the video editors allow you to enhance the quality by adjusting the colors and picture properties.</p>
<p><strong>Graphical Objects</strong> - Use graphical objects and animated texts wherever possible for better explanations. Things can get boring visually when you do not add graphical elements, transitions, and animations appropriately in different places. Similarly, the use of texts and titles makes the video more engaging. Instead of static texts, there are animated texts and titles available with stickers and memes that you can edit your video with.</p>
<p><strong>Play Attention to Sound</strong> - Sound is the most neglected part of a video by amateur video creators when one should pay attention to it. The sound effects can keep the audiences hooked to your video and make them not get bored. Certain sound effects refresh the attention of the audiences when it starts to fade, and hence, you should place the sound effects wisely.</p>
<p><strong>Proper Flow</strong> - The editing work should be smooth so that the flow of the video is smooth and efficient. It takes time, and hence, you can practice and learn video editing so that your video can stand out instantly after your editing touches. Besides, the editing should be such that the video feels like a story that audiences can invest in and get engaged throughout.</p>
<h2 id="Part-6-How-to-Share-Your-Videos-3"><a href="#Part-6-How-to-Share-Your-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 6 How to Share Your Videos"></a>Part 6 How to Share Your Videos</h2><p>In order to share videos after trimming them, you need to save the video properly. There are different file formats available for video files. For example, MP4 is the most popular video file format among Windows users. On the contrary, MOV is the most popular video file format. Different file formats have different features such as compression and lossless. According to the file format, the file size varies for the same duration of video.</p>
<p>Therefore, the video trimmer you are using must have different file formats for saving and exporting the editing video files. Some video trimmers have in-built features to share videos on social media platforms and upload on video streaming platforms like YouTube. Depending on your target audiences, you need to adjust the parameters like aspect ratio, video resolution, as well as duration. Besides, you can upload videos on cloud storage and share with anyone as per your requirements.</p>
