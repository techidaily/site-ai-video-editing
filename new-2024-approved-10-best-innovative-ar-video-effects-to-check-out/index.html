<p>Augmented reality technology has proven to be one of the top developments that have opened new growth points for businesses worldwide. People use it in their everyday lives for various purposes. We generally see <strong>ar effects in a video call</strong> or <strong>messenger ar effects</strong> every day. It is predicted that the AR market will reach $198 billion in 2025. The number of mobile AR users is expected to reach 3.5 billion this year. Providing AR experiences has become a competitive matter in many industries with a large market to enter.</p>

<h3 id="01Indoor-and-OutdoorPowering-and-Navigation"><a href="#01Indoor-and-OutdoorPowering-and-Navigation" class="headerlink" title="01Indoor and OutdoorPowering and Navigation"></a>01Indoor and OutdoorPowering and Navigation</h3><p>This year, AR navigation has become more flexible and attainable. The increase in technologies like Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) antennas, Wi-Fi RTT, and ultra-wideband (UWB) make indoor navigation much more practical than before. One of the most useful applications of this technology is for displaying AR directions in large indoor locations like delivery centers, shopping malls, and airports.</p>

                      alt="indoor outdoor navigation"
                ></p>
<p>By using indoor navigation, things bought online and picked up in-store services can be more well-organized. Group members whose job is to ‘pick’ the items in the store for order fulfillment can use AR directions for navigating and finding the item as different to following coordinated directions to find the item. This saves a lot of time looking through similar items and finding the exact aisle and section of the store.</p>
<h3 id="02Healthcare-and-Augmented-Reality"><a href="#02Healthcare-and-Augmented-Reality" class="headerlink" title="02Healthcare and Augmented Reality"></a>02Healthcare and Augmented Reality</h3><p>Deloitte Research has said that augmented reality and AI will change the old-style healthcare business model by giving AR&#x2F;MR-enabled hands-free solutions and IA-based diagnostic tools. With the continued restrictions due to Covid-19, augmented reality solutions are becoming gradually significant to address matters such as the difficulty of distant patient support and the amplified burden on hospitals.</p>
<p>There are psychological healthiness apps helping individuals maintain psychological balance during these grim times.AR technology can also improve telemedicine solutions that are rising currently, such as drawing and interpreting on the 3D screen can make communication between doctors and patients much easier.</p>
<h3 id="03Augmented-Reality-Shopping"><a href="#03Augmented-Reality-Shopping" class="headerlink" title="03Augmented Reality Shopping"></a>03Augmented Reality Shopping</h3><p>Augmented reality has a huge part in the shopping sector. One of the prospects that are presently being comprehended is store mapping. With augmented reality, televised directions can help a person direct the store’s layout to find the item they need.

With the help of infrared lasers, smartphones can determine the depth of scenes with more precision than before. Analysis of scenes for AR experiences can now be done better than ever. The Apple and Android devices are relatively comparable in delivering AR experiences to users. However, now, it’s important to consider convenience. LiDAR hardware is only available on higher-end Apple and Android devices, denoting that most AR customers will only have access to a limited level of quality.</p>

The increase in technologies like Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) antennas, Wi-Fi RTT, and ultra-wideband (UWB) make indoor navigation much more practical than before. One of the most useful applications of this technology is for displaying AR directions in large indoor locations like delivery centers, shopping malls, and airports.</p>

<p>By using indoor navigation, things bought online and picked up in-store services can be more well-organized. Group members whose job is to ‘pick’ the items in the store for order fulfillment can use AR directions for navigating and finding the item as different to following coordinated directions to find the item. This saves a lot of time looking through similar items and finding the exact aisle and section of the store.</p>

Tips for Speeding Up Video in Final Cut Pro"></a>Part II. Tips for Speeding Up Video in Final Cut Pro</h2><p>You have to keep a few points in mind when you speed up videos in Final Cut Pro. This ensures that the video does not get distorted while speeding up a section. Here are some tips to follow to speed up the video in FCP.</p>
<p><strong>Adjust The Pitch of Sped-Up Clips -</strong></p>
<p>By default, Final Cut Pro preserves the pitch of the audio even when you change the speed of the video. However, you may want to change the pitch per the video’s speed. This is because you might want to make the audio sound funny. You need to turn off the Preserve Pitch option from Retime menu. Once you do that, the pitch of the sped-up clip adjusts itself as per the change in speed.</p>
<p><strong>Speeding Up Video by Adjusting Frame Rate -</strong></p>
<p>You can shoot at a low frame rate for the scene you want to speed up. The frame rate should be lower than the overall video project’s frame rate.</p>
<p>You can add the scene to your video project on the timeline. Then you need to choose Automatic Speed from Retime menu. This will increase the frame rate from the scene to the video project frame rate. Once the frame rate increases, the video will speed up automatically.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="speed up automatically"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Smoothen Out the Sped-Up Video -</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes, the overall video may look old when you speed up a particular portion. That is why there are two options available on Final Cut Pro. The first option is frame blending which is more suitable for the slow-motion clip.</p>
<p>The second option is the optical flow that smoothens out the sped-up clip. It adds in-between frames by analyzing the directional movement of pixels. You can find the option from Video Quality present in the Retime menu.</p>
