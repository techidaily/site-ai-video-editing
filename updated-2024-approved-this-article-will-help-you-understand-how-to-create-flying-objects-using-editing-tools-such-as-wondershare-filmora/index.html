This video camera can now be from a mobile phone or a high-quality DSLR. It will all depend upon your preference for quality and frame rate.</p>

<h3 id="Tri-Podor-camera-stands"><a href="#Tri-Podor-camera-stands" class="headerlink" title="Tri-Podor camera stands"></a><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Lightweight-Camera-Mount-Tripod/dp/B00XI87KV8/ref=sr%5F1%5F1%5Fsspa?keywords=tripod&qid=1670223756&sr=8-1-spons&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyRU5FQjJKUk1JR0FJJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwODkzMjE0M1ZJVDY4M0FZVU5PVSZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMDU3NTY1MklFS1FJWjBDNlNITiZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU&th=1" >Tri-Pod <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>or camera stands</h3><p>Selecting the Tri-Pod is also crucial to your quality of video taking as it will ensure stability while capturing the video from the camera.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>Stability is the key here, as the captured videos will be masked and combined in the later stages of the steps. To do so, consistently capturing the video in the same ratio is necessary. You can stabilize the video with a simple gorilla pod that you can get of good quality or a simple tripod.</p>
<h3 id="The-prop"><a href="#The-prop" class="headerlink" title="The prop"></a>The prop</h3><p>The prop will be the object that we will be flying in the video. It could be a fluffy toy, a ball, a box, or anything you desire to be flying in your video.</p>

<h3 id="Good-presentation"><a href="#Good-presentation" class="headerlink" title="Good presentation"></a>Good presentation</h3><p>Now, if you want your video to shine like the good ones, you will need to know how to present it. In this section, the requirement will be yourself. As you are not flying an object, you must act the part.</p>
<p>A good presentation will allow you to make the video more natural. Because no matter how skilled you are with video editing, a video with props will only be of quality until the subject acts their part with quality.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-capture-the-footage"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-capture-the-footage" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to capture the footage?"></a>Part 2. How to capture the footage?</h2><p>Before we get into how we edit our footage, we need to know how to shoot the video to edit. Follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Set up</strong> your camera on a tripod or a gorilla pod.</li>
<li>After setting up the camera, <strong>record</strong> an empty frame.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="note"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> An empty frame video will be the one you will use to mask the original clip.</p>
<h3 id="Reference-video"><a href="#Reference-video" class="headerlink" title="Reference video"></a>Reference video</h3><p>Start recording a five-second clip of the sofa where you will be sitting without yourself or the prop. Here you don’t need to add anything except the reference. Follow the guidelines below when making the reference video:</p>
<ul>
<li>The video should be plain.</li>
<li>It should be simple.</li>
<li>There should be no moving object or subject.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/reference-video.gif"
                      alt="reference video"
                ></p>
<h3 id="Main-video"><a href="#Main-video" class="headerlink" title="Main video"></a>Main video</h3><p>After shooting the empty frame video, move on to shooting the video with yourself in it. Follow the below to achieve something unique:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your focus should be on the prop.</li>
<li>Use a thread or a rope to attach the prop to it. (In this case, we are using a ball.)</li>
<li>Attach the ball to the thread and hand it on the roof.</li>
<li>Record yourself now with the prop with your desired content or script.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/main-video.gif"
                      alt="main video"
                ></p>
<p>After completing the video, simply stop recording. Now you will end up with two video clips.</p>
<p>Adding these two clips in the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, you can easily create the flying object effect. To do so, follow the steps explained in the section ahead.</p>

<li>Open the Wondershare Filmora software and Click on the New Project icon on the window.</li>
<li>After you have clicked on the New Project icon, our main workplace will be launched.</li>
<li>Here you can see various options.</li>
<li>To get started, we need to import our video clips to edit them.</li>
</ul>

<li>Shows you to drag and drop the file from your main directory simply.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can choose whatever suits you the best!</p>
<h5 id="Step2Add-your-clips-to-your-timeline"><a href="#Step2Add-your-clips-to-your-timeline" class="headerlink" title="Step2Add your clips to your timeline"></a>Step2Add your clips to your timeline</h5><p>Now that we have imported our videos into the timeline, our next step will be to add our videos to the timeline.</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply click on the imported clips on the import window.</li>
<li>Then drag it to the timeline below.</li>
<li>Doing so will create a working timeline you can view and edit as you go along the editing process.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

You will need to size it to the original video for that to work. Doing so is simple and will require you to take some easy steps.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, click on the clip.</li>
<li>Then, when it is selected, move on to the tab above to choose the speed option from the bar.</li>
<li>Here, you will also see options such as cropping, Green screen, and color.</li>
<li>Choose the option of speed.</li>
<li>Then, a drop-down tile will pop up. Here you can see different options available to speed up your video.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<ul>
<li>You can speed up your video and slow it down.</li>
<li>For now, we will have to slow it down.</li>
</ul>

                      alt="note"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Slowing it down will increase the time of the video clip and allow you to match it with the original video clip.</p>
<p>Don’t worry about the speed, as the video is already empty, and there will be no distractions to disturb our editing.</p>
<h5 id="Step4Add-the-masking-effect"><a href="#Step4Add-the-masking-effect" class="headerlink" title="Step4Add the masking effect"></a>Step4Add the masking effect</h5><p>Now that we have our video aligned with the reference video we are using. Let’s move to the next step.</p>
<p>This step will try to remove the thread attached to the ball; otherwise, it will show in the video, and our effect will be ruined. However, before we do that, we will need to know what <strong>masking</strong> is.</p>
<h5 id="What-is-the-Masking-effect-in-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#What-is-the-Masking-effect-in-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="What is the Masking effect in Wondershare Filmora?"></a>What is the Masking effect in Wondershare Filmora?</h5><p>Have you ever seen the behind-the-scenes of those big-budget movies? Then you might have seen the actors and the stunt workers hanging from big ropes performing stunts in front of green screens.</p>
<p>Well, the directors capture the video in real-time. But they can do those big stunts on TV with editing and CGI, and one of the effects is “<strong>Masking</strong>.”</p>
<p>The masking effect allows you to mask the object on the screen with a reference video. So that’s how the ropes attached to the stuntmen get removed in the original videos.</p>
<h5 id="How-to-add-a-masking-effect"><a href="#How-to-add-a-masking-effect" class="headerlink" title="How to add a masking effect?"></a>How to add a masking effect?</h5><p>Although there are numerous ways to do that, the one we will use in this video is to remove the thread. For this, follow the below steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply go to the <strong>effect icon</strong> that you can see in the bar above.</li>
<li>In the effects bar, move to the utility tab.</li>
<li>You will see a window showing you the many effects Wondershare Filmora provides you from default.</li>
<li>Select the shape mask tile.</li>
<li>Now drag and drop it on the timeline below.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="note"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You must ensure the effect is applied to the main video, not the reference video.</p>
<ul>
<li>When you drag the effect into the main video, you will notice a transparent shape added to the video. This is your <strong>Mask</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="Step5Edit-the-masking-effect"><a href="#Step5Edit-the-masking-effect" class="headerlink" title="Step5Edit the masking effect"></a>Step5Edit the masking effect</h5><p>You must hide the thread attached to the ball with the masking effect. To do this, follow the below guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Double-click on the effect added to the main video.</li>
<li>You will notice another window pop up on the import library.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="note"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In the pop-up window, you will see the multiple options and edits you can apply to the masking effect, such as Transform, Compositing, Motion tracking, and stabilization.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="wondershare filmora effect editing panel"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Scroll down on the window and notice a video <strong>effect tab</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the effect tab, you will have multiple options, such as the shape mask, X, Y, and scale and blur strength options, as shown below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Now adjust the mask to hide the string. It may be easy to invert the mask.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="note"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> That the borders of the mask are blurred. But you can also change them by inverting the mask, which turns the borders and the space between them.</p>
<p><strong>Remember</strong> the invisibility cloak from Harry Potter? It works just like that, only with a solid shape.</p>
<ul>
<li>Now use the <strong>X</strong> and <strong>Y options</strong> to move the mask anywhere in the video.</li>
</ul>

To blend the borders with the background, follow the steps below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply <strong>Double-click</strong> on the effect in the timeline.</li>
<li>Then, in the editing tab, find out the blur strength option.</li>
</ul>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Please keep looking in the window on the right. Check and increase the blur strength until you are satisfied with the result.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lastly, click on <strong>OK</strong> when you are done.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="Step7Creating-the-popup-effect"><a href="#Step7Creating-the-popup-effect" class="headerlink" title="Step7Creating the popup effect"></a>Step7Creating the popup effect</h5><p>Now, if you want your object to appear out of thin air, you must create that pop-up effect. You can create the pop-up effect in simple and easy steps, as shown below:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, drag the timeline dragger to the point where you want the prop or the ball to pop up.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Your presentation should be accurate and precise!</strong></p>
<p>Imagine you were doing a “<strong>swoosh</strong>“ action, similar to swinging a wand. Now you want your object to appear at that time.</p>
<p><strong>Split the Video:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drag</strong> the timeline dragger to that point.</li>
<li>Now press <strong>Ctrl+B</strong> to split both videos.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Add Popup Effect:</strong></p>
<p>The masking effect will be applied from the start. Our goal is to hide the masking effect before the ball pop-ups. For this, follow the below steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go into the setting by <strong>Double-Clicking</strong> the masking effect on the original video.</li>
<li>Then <strong>move</strong> the mask over the ball instead of on the thread. Doing so would make the ball disappear.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Good-presentation-1"><a href="#Good-presentation-1" class="headerlink" title="Good presentation"></a>Good presentation</h3><p>Now, if you want your video to shine like the good ones, you will need to know how to present it. In this section, the requirement will be yourself. As you are not flying an object, you must act the part.</p>
<p>A good presentation will allow you to make the video more natural. Because no matter how skilled you are with video editing, a video with props will only be of quality until the subject acts their part with quality.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-capture-the-footage-1"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-capture-the-footage-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to capture the footage?"></a>Part 2. How to capture the footage?</h2><p>Before we get into how we edit our footage, we need to know how to shoot the video to edit. Follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Set up</strong> your camera on a tripod or a gorilla pod.</li>
<li>After setting up the camera, <strong>record</strong> an empty frame.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                      alt="note"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> An empty frame video will be the one you will use to mask the original clip.</p>
<h3 id="Reference-video-1"><a href="#Reference-video-1" class="headerlink" title="Reference video"></a>Reference video</h3><p>Start recording a five-second clip of the sofa where you will be sitting without yourself or the prop. Here you don’t need to add anything except the reference. Follow the guidelines below when making the reference video:</p>
<ul>
<li>The video should be plain.</li>
<li>It should be simple.</li>
<li>There should be no moving object or subject.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/reference-video.gif"
                      alt="reference video"
                ></p>
<h3 id="Main-video-1"><a href="#Main-video-1" class="headerlink" title="Main video"></a>Main video</h3><p>After shooting the empty frame video, move on to shooting the video with yourself in it. Follow the below to achieve something unique:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your focus should be on the prop.</li>
<li>Use a thread or a rope to attach the prop to it. (In this case, we are using a ball.)</li>
<li>Attach the ball to the thread and hand it on the roof.</li>
<li>Record yourself now with the prop with your desired content or script.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/main-video.gif"
                      alt="main video"
                ></p>
<p>After completing the video, simply stop recording. Now you will end up with two video clips.</p>
<p>Adding these two clips in the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, you can easily create the flying object effect. To do so, follow the steps explained in the section ahead.</p>

<li>Open the Wondershare Filmora software and Click on the New Project icon on the window.</li>
<li>After you have clicked on the New Project icon, our main workplace will be launched.</li>
<li>Here you can see various options.</li>
<li>To get started, we need to import our video clips to edit them.</li>
</ul>

</ol>
<p>You can choose whatever suits you the best!</p>

<ul>
<li>Simply click on the imported clips on the import window.</li>
<li>Then drag it to the timeline below.</li>
<li>Doing so will create a working timeline you can view and edit as you go along the editing process.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

You will need to size it to the original video for that to work. Doing so is simple and will require you to take some easy steps.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, click on the clip.</li>
<li>Then, when it is selected, move on to the tab above to choose the speed option from the bar.</li>
<li>Here, you will also see options such as cropping, Green screen, and color.</li>
<li>Choose the option of speed.</li>
<li>Then, a drop-down tile will pop up. Here you can see different options available to speed up your video.</li>
</ul>
<p><img

<ul>
<li>You can speed up your video and slow it down.</li>

                      alt="note"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Slowing it down will increase the time of the video clip and allow you to match it with the original video clip.</p>
<p>Don’t worry about the speed, as the video is already empty, and there will be no distractions to disturb our editing.</p>
<h5 id="Step4Add-the-masking-effect-1"><a href="#Step4Add-the-masking-effect-1" class="headerlink" title="Step4Add the masking effect"></a>Step4Add the masking effect</h5><p>Now that we have our video aligned with the reference video we are using. Let’s move to the next step.</p>
<p>This step will try to remove the thread attached to the ball; otherwise, it will show in the video, and our effect will be ruined. However, before we do that, we will need to know what <strong>masking</strong> is.</p>
<h5 id="What-is-the-Masking-effect-in-Wondershare-Filmora-1"><a href="#What-is-the-Masking-effect-in-Wondershare-Filmora-1" class="headerlink" title="What is the Masking effect in Wondershare Filmora?"></a>What is the Masking effect in Wondershare Filmora?</h5><p>Have you ever seen the behind-the-scenes of those big-budget movies? Then you might have seen the actors and the stunt workers hanging from big ropes performing stunts in front of green screens.</p>
<p>Well, the directors capture the video in real-time. But they can do those big stunts on TV with editing and CGI, and one of the effects is “<strong>Masking</strong>.”</p>
<p>The masking effect allows you to mask the object on the screen with a reference video. So that’s how the ropes attached to the stuntmen get removed in the original videos.</p>
<h5 id="How-to-add-a-masking-effect-1"><a href="#How-to-add-a-masking-effect-1" class="headerlink" title="How to add a masking effect?"></a>How to add a masking effect?</h5><p>Although there are numerous ways to do that, the one we will use in this video is to remove the thread. For this, follow the below steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply go to the <strong>effect icon</strong> that you can see in the bar above.</li>
<li>In the effects bar, move to the utility tab.</li>
<li>You will see a window showing you the many effects Wondershare Filmora provides you from default.</li>
<li>Select the shape mask tile.</li>
<li>Now drag and drop it on the timeline below.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="note"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You must ensure the effect is applied to the main video, not the reference video.</p>
<ul>
<li>When you drag the effect into the main video, you will notice a transparent shape added to the video. This is your <strong>Mask</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="Step5Edit-the-masking-effect-1"><a href="#Step5Edit-the-masking-effect-1" class="headerlink" title="Step5Edit the masking effect"></a>Step5Edit the masking effect</h5><p>You must hide the thread attached to the ball with the masking effect. To do this, follow the below guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Double-click on the effect added to the main video.</li>
<li>You will notice another window pop up on the import library.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="note"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In the pop-up window, you will see the multiple options and edits you can apply to the masking effect, such as Transform, Compositing, Motion tracking, and stabilization.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="wondershare filmora effect editing panel"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Scroll down on the window and notice a video <strong>effect tab</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the effect tab, you will have multiple options, such as the shape mask, X, Y, and scale and blur strength options, as shown below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Now adjust the mask to hide the string. It may be easy to invert the mask.</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                      alt="note"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> That the borders of the mask are blurred. But you can also change them by inverting the mask, which turns the borders and the space between them.</p>
<p><strong>Remember</strong> the invisibility cloak from Harry Potter? It works just like that, only with a solid shape.</p>
<ul>
<li>Now use the <strong>X</strong> and <strong>Y options</strong> to move the mask anywhere in the video.</li>
</ul>

To blend the borders with the background, follow the steps below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply <strong>Double-click</strong> on the effect in the timeline.</li>
<li>Then, in the editing tab, find out the blur strength option.</li>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Please keep looking in the window on the right. Check and increase the blur strength until you are satisfied with the result.</p>

You can create the pop-up effect in simple and easy steps, as shown below:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, drag the timeline dragger to the point where you want the prop or the ball to pop up.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Your presentation should be accurate and precise!</strong></p>
<p>Imagine you were doing a “<strong>swoosh</strong>“ action, similar to swinging a wand. Now you want your object to appear at that time.</p>
<p><strong>Split the Video:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drag</strong> the timeline dragger to that point.</li>
<li>Now press <strong>Ctrl+B</strong> to split both videos.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Add Popup Effect:</strong></p>
<p>The masking effect will be applied from the start. Our goal is to hide the masking effect before the ball pop-ups. For this, follow the below steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go into the setting by <strong>Double-Clicking</strong> the masking effect on the original video.</li>
<li>Then <strong>move</strong> the mask over the ball instead of on the thread. Doing so would make the ball disappear.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="How-to-Remove-Audio-From-Videos-with-FFmpeg"><a href="#How-to-Remove-Audio-From-Videos-with-FFmpeg" class="headerlink" title="How to Remove Audio From Videos with FFmpeg?"></a>How to Remove Audio From Videos with FFmpeg?</h2><p>Unbelievably, the globe has been making headway in its endeavors. Considering how far the world has come in producing amazing things in recent times, it is impossible to fathom the progress made in the digital industry. There are now millions of video editing programs like <strong>FFmpeg that remove audio</strong>, each allowing you to accomplish anything. In addition to video editing, it is now possible to modify the music playing in the backdrop of a video. Doesn’t it seem impossible to you? However, it has an actual appearance and is simple to pull audio from a video. You will, however, need to choose a tool with great care and consideration.</p>
<p>In the following parts, we will discuss how to <strong>remove audio from video with FFmpeg</strong> successfully. In addition, we have also looked at other software that has the potential to be an alternative to FFmpeg that is far more effective.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/remove-audio-from-video-ffmpeg-1.jpg"

                ></p>
<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Use-FFmpeg-to-Remove-Audio-from-Videos"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Use-FFmpeg-to-Remove-Audio-from-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Use FFmpeg to Remove Audio from Videos?"></a>Part 1: How to Use FFmpeg to Remove Audio from Videos?</h2><p>FFMPEG is a highly flexible video editing program from the command line. You may use it for various purposes, including converting between different file formats. But in addition to that, you may use it to <strong>remove audio from your videos</strong> or clips. Here are two different ways to delete audio using FFMPEG, depending on what you want to do. But most crucially, speed and quality are not sacrificed with any of these choices. It’s about coding. When using other people’s code, also label the author. Using FFmpeg, you can separate the audio. The audio in video files may be removed, added, extracted, and added again with the help of this powerful utility.</p>
<p>You will only need to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ffmpeg.org/download.html"><strong>install FFmpeg</strong></a> on your computer after you have purchased it. Removing video is straightforward, so you won’t have to put in much effort to achieve this goal. Let’s look at the many methods available.</p>
<p><strong>Use the Command Line</strong></p>
<p>Step1 The command to extract audio from your video file is visible for your review.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/remove-audio-from-video-ffmpeg-2.jpg"
                      alt="ffmpeg use the command"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 It would be helpful if you updated the extension and the name of the file that was entered, but other than that, you won’t need to do anything else.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/remove-audio-from-video-ffmpeg-3.jpg"
                      alt="ffmpeg audio command"
                ></p>
<p>The preceding command is successful if the input file certifies. This is why you need to find the codec for the audio stream. If you obey this order, you will accomplish what you set out to do. A user might sometimes use an audio format returned by the previous command. However, this will only occasionally be successful.</p>
<p>The storage format that FFmpeg employs is determined by looking at the output file’s extension. It would help if you knew that a storage format, a container, and an audio format are distinct. You will encounter a scenario where the audio format does not have a container named after it. Two problematic formats are among the most common formats; they are PCM and Vorbis. OGG is compatible with Vorbis, whereas WAV is compatible with PCM.</p>
<p>Let’s investigate another approach to extract audio from a video using FFmpeg if the prior one was too difficult for you to grasp.</p>
<p><strong>Use the Terminal</strong></p>
<p>Step1 Verify that the format remains the same.</p>
<p>You will need to locate the video in its original format to be able to extract the audio from it. If you are unfamiliar with the primary format, you will be unable to determine the appropriate file extension. Because of this, you are going to need to make use of the ffprobe command.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/remove-audio-from-video-ffmpeg-4.jpg"
                      alt="ffmpeg check the original format"
                ></p>
<p>Now, change “myvideo.mp4” to the name of the video file you want to use. This will verify that you are familiar with the video’s original file format.</p>
<p>After learning about the original audio’s format, you can reencode a video clip to remove the audio from it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/remove-audio-from-video-ffmpeg-5.jpg"
                      alt="ffmpeg reencoding"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Modify the format, please.</p>
<p>You might try replacing myvideo.mp4 with the directory and filename to see if it helps. Additionally, it would be helpful if you updated the name of the audio.ogg file with the name you want to use.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you follow the two approaches discussed above, you can extract audio from your video files with little to no work. To completely comprehend the stages, you must examine them in great detail.</p>

Firstly, GIF is the abbreviation for Graphics Interchange Format. Steve Wilhite, an American computer scantiest, was responsible for developing this bitmap image format with the team at the online services provider CompuServe.</p>
<p>The GIFs are images and animations whose sizes are reduced. The animations are much shorter in duration than the regular animation videos. It makes the animations look more expressive. The message, information, or expression to be portrayed through the animation gets better expressed due to its speed.</p>
<p>Therefore, the GIFs’ animations are much more exciting and engaging. A question might arise t you: Why should you use GIFs in slideshows, or how can they be beneficial.

<p>Text-to-speech (TTS) is a type of assistive technology that reads digital text aloud. It’s sometimes called “read aloud” technology. This technology has evolved to the point of being inculcated or introduced directly to some video editing applications without having to visit a separate text-to-speech application or software for support. This article therefore aims at discussing ten video makers that have inbuilt the text-to-speech feature.</p>

<p>FEATURES</p>
<p>After reviewing both versions (Android and iOS) of CapCut, we found that the app is indeed easy to use and includes a ton of attractive features designed for TikTok users. Would we recommend it to you? Yes, definitely, but with some caveats.</p>
<ul>
<li>Split function: This is similar to trimming where you have to separate the clip in order to define your desired part of the clip. Your clip can be further extended after splitting, so it’s just a process of simple trimming in editing.</li>
<li>Video overlay: This feature helps you place a video on another video. Those who do this often are those who have reaction channels, online teachers and gamers. This feature helps the viewers to simultaneously comprehend explanations the main video content alongside the reaction or explanation.</li>
<li>Speed control: This feature aids speed ramping. You can slow down your video and increase the speed just as you want. One thing to have in mind is when you plan to edit such a video, you have to shoot in a high resolution and high frame rate like 30-60fps so as to avoid the amateurish look.</li>
<li>Reverse video: The reverse feature helps you to rewind your clip to create the effect you have pictured in your mind while shooting.</li>
<li>Music library: CapCut comes with an impressive collection of royalty-free music and sound effects that can really make a huge difference to your videos. The tracks have a high quality and you can effortlessly insert them into your video to create the feel you desire.</li>
<li>Filters: Choose from various filters to soften or sharpen your videos and make them more professional-looking. There are color-based and season-based filters, as well as a range of beautification tools to enhance video quality. Filters can also be used effectively if you have multiple clips that have color variations or different contrast and brightness levels. Since you can’t edit most of these in CapCut, you can avoid having to use a desktop editor by choosing the right filters and applying them to all your clips to bring some uniformity.</li>
<li>Effects: There’s a collection of effects you can select from to appeal to the visual cravings of your audience. This will add colour to your content as it makes your viewers involved in the video. These effects include split-screen, retro, comic, party, dreamy, and so on. These effects will make your video look fresh and professionally edited.</li>
<li>Stickers and text: Stickers could be fun to use due to their expressive nature. Your choice as a content creator will go a long way in determining the fascination of your content. CapCut has therefore had you covered when it comes to adding fun features to your content to make it more interactive and exciting.

<p>FEATURES</p>
<p>After reviewing both versions (Android and iOS) of CapCut, we found that the app is indeed easy to use and includes a ton of attractive features designed for TikTok users. Would we recommend it to you? Yes, definitely, but with some caveats.</p>
<ul>
<li>Split function: This is similar to trimming where you have to separate the clip in order to define your desired part of the clip. Your clip can be further extended after splitting, so it’s just a process of simple trimming in editing.</li>
<li>Video overlay: This feature helps you place a video on another video. Those who do this often are those who have reaction channels, online teachers and gamers. This feature helps the viewers to simultaneously comprehend explanations the main video content alongside the reaction or explanation.</li>
<li>Speed control: This feature aids speed ramping. You can slow down your video and increase the speed just as you want. One thing to have in mind is when you plan to edit such a video, you have to shoot in a high resolution and high frame rate like 30-60fps so as to avoid the amateurish look.</li>
<li>Reverse video: The reverse feature helps you to rewind your clip to create the effect you have pictured in your mind while shooting.</li>
<li>Music library: CapCut comes with an impressive collection of royalty-free music and sound effects that can really make a huge difference to your videos. The tracks have a high quality and you can effortlessly insert them into your video to create the feel you desire.</li>
<li>Filters: Choose from various filters to soften or sharpen your videos and make them more professional-looking. There are color-based and season-based filters, as well as a range of beautification tools to enhance video quality. Filters can also be used effectively if you have multiple clips that have color variations or different contrast and brightness levels. Since you can’t edit most of these in CapCut, you can avoid having to use a desktop editor by choosing the right filters and applying them to all your clips to bring some uniformity.</li>
<li>Effects: There’s a collection of effects you can select from to appeal to the visual cravings of your audience. This will add colour to your content as it makes your viewers involved in the video. These effects include split-screen, retro, comic, party, dreamy, and so on. These effects will make your video look fresh and professionally edited.</li>
<li>Stickers and text: Stickers could be fun to use due to their expressive nature. Your choice as a content creator will go a long way in determining the fascination of your content. CapCut has therefore had you covered when it comes to adding fun features to your content to make it more interactive and exciting. Stickers and texts are therefore engaging tools you can employ to drive the fantasy of your audience. Also, it creates room for more details to be added without necessarily having to introduce more audio contents especially. With this feature, you can literally do more with less using CapCut.</li>

<h2 id="Capture-the-moment-and-Cut-3"><a href="#Capture-the-moment-and-Cut-3" class="headerlink" title="Capture the moment and Cut"></a>Capture the moment and Cut</h2><p>CapCut is a free all-in-one video editing app that helps you create amazing videos. It is a mobile app for iOS and Android devices which is easy to use in terms of creating your content. It makes your cutting, reversing and speed change easier than ever when you get it right to produce incredible results as you share on social media. You can make your video captivating by adding features such as filters, stickers, speed changes, background music, effects, split, reverse and more to make your wonderful moments more polished and professional.</p>
<p>FEATURES</p>
<p>After reviewing both versions (Android and iOS) of CapCut, we found that the app is indeed easy to use and includes a ton of attractive features designed for TikTok users. Would we recommend it to you? Yes, definitely, but with some caveats.</p>
<ul>
<li>Split function: This is similar to trimming where you have to separate the clip in order to define your desired part of the clip. Your clip can be further extended after splitting, so it’s just a process of simple trimming in editing.</li>
<li>Video overlay: This feature helps you place a video on another video. Those who do this often are those who have reaction channels, online teachers and gamers. This feature helps the viewers to simultaneously comprehend explanations the main video content alongside the reaction or explanation.</li>
<li>Speed control: This feature aids speed ramping. You can slow down your video and increase the speed just as you want. One thing to have in mind is when you plan to edit such a video, you have to shoot in a high resolution and high frame rate like 30-60fps so as to avoid the amateurish look.</li>
<li>Reverse video: The reverse feature helps you to rewind your clip to create the effect you have pictured in your mind while shooting.</li>
<li>Music library: CapCut comes with an impressive collection of royalty-free music and sound effects that can really make a huge difference to your videos. The tracks have a high quality and you can effortlessly insert them into your video to create the feel you desire.</li>
<li>Filters: Choose from various filters to soften or sharpen your videos and make them more professional-looking. There are color-based and season-based filters, as well as a range of beautification tools to enhance video quality. Filters can also be used effectively if you have multiple clips that have color variations or different contrast and brightness levels. Since you can’t edit most of these in CapCut, you can avoid having to use a desktop editor by choosing the right filters and applying them to all your clips to bring some uniformity.</li>
<li>Effects: There’s a collection of effects you can select from to appeal to the visual cravings of your audience. This will add colour to your content as it makes your viewers involved in the video. These effects include split-screen, retro, comic, party, dreamy, and so on. These effects will make your video look fresh and professionally edited.</li>
<li>Stickers and text: Stickers could be fun to use due to their expressive nature. Your choice as a content creator will go a long way in determining the fascination of your content. CapCut has therefore had you covered when it comes to adding fun features to your content to make it more interactive and exciting. Stickers and texts are therefore engaging tools you can employ to drive the fantasy of your audience. Also, it creates room for more details to be added without necessarily having to introduce more audio contents especially. With this feature, you can literally do more with less using CapCut.</li>
