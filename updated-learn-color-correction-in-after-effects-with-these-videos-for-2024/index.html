<p><strong>Step 3: Let’s Create!</strong></p>
<p>Click on ‘Upload and Make a GIF’. You will be shown a preview of your creation. At this point, you can customize the GIF with effects, filters and texts.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4: Visual Adjustments</strong></p>
<p>When using still images, consider arranging them in a particular order with the ‘Drag and Drop method’. You can skip this step if you are satisfied with the default arrangement. If you are creating a GIF from a video, pay attention to adjust its play duration.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4</strong></p>
<p>When you are done, click on ‘Convert to GIF’ and wait for the conversion process to finish. You can now see your created GIF in the pop up window that appears next. Click on ‘Save’ option in the toolbar beneath the created GIF to download your creation to your device.</p>

Video to GIF conversion is one thing, besides that, you can also crop your videos using this tool. Wondering how to go about the process? Here’s a quick, stepwise tutorial to answer this for you. Follow the steps given below to crop your videos with a blink:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1: Launch the Ezgif Crop Tool</strong></p>
<p>Open the official Ezgif website and navigate to the ‘Crop Video’ tab on the top toolbar in the welcome page. You can alternatively click on the link given below to reach the ‘Crop Video’ interface directly.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2: Upload Your Video</strong></p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3: Adjust Video Borders</strong></p>
<p>To crop the video to a desired part, you need to set its borders within the required section. To do this, ‘Hold and Drag’ the mouse to highlight a desired section. Now leave the mouse to see the highlighted section within a frame.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4: Final Touches</strong></p>
<p>After you have the desired section, scroll down to find some adjustment options. Here, you can resize, set aspect ratio and make frame adjustments to your cropping clip. When selecting the output video format, you can either choose to stick with the original file format or change to mp4.</p>
<p>Tap on ‘Crop Video’ when you are done making the changes. The conversion process may take a few seconds. You can enjoy looking at the swaying kitten in the meantime.</p>
