This refers to the frequency of a series of images or frames consecutively appearing during display. A low frame rate per second or FPS causes issues in most display screens, so you will need a <strong>60 FPS video converter</strong> to update it.</p>

<h3 id="Why-Should-You-Convert-Videos-into-60FPS"><a href="#Why-Should-You-Convert-Videos-into-60FPS" class="headerlink" title="Why Should You Convert Videos into 60FPS?"></a>Why Should You Convert Videos into 60FPS?</h3><p>In the context of video FPS, the three variations- 30FPS, 60FPS, and 24FPS are the most common. However, there are specific reasons why 60FPS is the best option you should use, and take the time to convert your files with this frame rate.</p>
<ul>
<li>Playing 24FPS or 30FPS videos on LCD screens have more prominent motion blur, the sharpness of transition is low and rough, etc.</li>
<li>Well-known streaming sites like YouTube set their standard for videos at 60FPS. If you use a file with a higher FPS, it will compress to 60FPS automatically. Anything lower than that is unacceptable since it creates a laggy video transition.</li>
<li>Creating high-quality movies in UHD or 4K resolution requires a high FPS like 60FPS. Movies shot with 24FPS do not assure the best display in the native frame rate and need pulldown conversion. This causes judder, which affects video quality. Converting the video to <strong>60fps ai online</strong> is a better choice.</li>
<li>Modern devices like computers, smartphones, and tablets have a high refresh rate. So, these, including some gaming monitors and television varieties, accept videos with 60FPS best.</li>
<li>In animation, most creators run 3-4 images per drawing, which means 6 or 8 drawings per second. For the best transition between shorts and images, converting the animation videos to 60FPS is useful.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Indeed, adjusting the frame rate of your video will help you create high-quality videos with a fluid and lag-less transition. You should convert your file to 60FPS if it is a lower version at the time to improve sharpness and make it compatible with most screen types, 4K movie playing, and streaming.</p>
<p>Use the available online and native software options to make these changes quickly and efficiently. Additionally, if you want to create a file directly at 60FPS, you can do so using Filmora.</p>
<p>Give these tools a try first to get a better experience with the features and process.</p>
<p>Why Should You Convert Videos into 60FPS?</p>
<p>In the context of video FPS, the three variations- 30FPS, 60FPS, and 24FPS are the most common. However, there are specific reasons why 60FPS is the best option you should use, and take the time to convert your files with this frame rate.</p>
<ul>
<li>Playing 24FPS or 30FPS videos on LCD screens have more prominent motion blur, the sharpness of transition is low and rough, etc.</li>
<li>Well-known streaming sites like YouTube set their standard for videos at 60FPS. If you use a file with a higher FPS, it will compress to 60FPS automatically. Anything lower than that is unacceptable since it creates a laggy video transition.</li>
<li>Creating high-quality movies in UHD or 4K resolution requires a high FPS like 60FPS. Movies shot with 24FPS do not assure the best display in the native frame rate and need pulldown conversion. This causes judder, which affects video quality. Converting the video to <strong>60fps ai online</strong> is a better choice.</li>
<li>Modern devices like computers, smartphones, and tablets have a high refresh rate. So, these, including some gaming monitors and television varieties, accept videos with 60FPS best.</li>
<li>In animation, most creators run 3-4 images per drawing, which means 6 or 8 drawings per second. For the best transition between shorts and images, converting the animation videos to 60FPS is useful.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How to Change Frame Rate to 60FPS in Filmora?</strong></p>

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>Step4 Click on Export to download the file or directly upload it via Vimeo or YouTube through those tabs.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Indeed, adjusting the frame rate of your video will help you create high-quality videos with a fluid and lag-less transition. You should convert your file to 60FPS if it is a lower version at the time to improve sharpness and make it compatible with most screen types, 4K movie playing, and streaming.</p>
<p>Use the available online and native software options to make these changes quickly and efficiently. Additionally, if you want to create a file directly at 60FPS, you can do so using Filmora.</p>
<p>Give these tools a try first to get a better experience with the features and process.</p>
