In After Effects, this tool adds an invisible layer that is used to mask or reveal parts of a layer, including video, graphics, text, shapes, and images. This feature is in the arsenal of any visual effects artist or motion graphic designer.</p>
<p>For After Effects editors, <strong>Track Mattes</strong> can be an incredibly helpful tool for managing multiple layers and creating complex animations.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about <strong>Track Mattes</strong>. We’ll cover topics like the difference between a mask and Track Matte, finding this tool in After Effects, and its four options: Alpha Matter, Alpha Inverted Matte, Luma Matte, and Luma Inverted Matte.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#part4-1">Alpha Matte</a></li>
<li><a href="#part4-2">Alpha Inverted Matte</a></li>
<li><a href="#part4-3">Luma Matte</a></li>
<li><a href="#part4-4">Luma Inverted Matte</a></li>
<li><a href="#part4-5">Differences Between Alpha Channel and Luma Channel</a></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-Are-Track-Mattes-In-After-Effects"><a href="#Part-1-What-Are-Track-Mattes-In-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Are Track Mattes In After Effects?"></a>Part 1. What Are Track Mattes In After Effects?</h2><p>A Track Matte is an element used in video editing to control the opacity of a layer. Essentially, it lets you create a “hole” in a layer so that underlying layers can show through. This tool can be used with video and audio layers, which is essential for creating complex composites in After Effects.</p>
<p>You can use Track Mattes to generate shapes, reveal part of a layer, or keying outs. Interestingly, it remains independent of all layers in your projects, which means you can get visual effects and animations more efficiently than with the masks tool.</p>
<p>Moreover, Track Mattes uses Alpha or Luma channels as a layer mask to determine what parts of the layer to reveal. For instance, you can make a top layer that provides an Alpha or Luminous effect and a bottom layer consisting of the image that will be revealed or shown.</p>
<p>Thus, if you want to use an image to hide your video until you want to unveil it or add a picture in your text, Track Mattes will help you to shape the appearance of a layer above it.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Differences-Between-A-Mask-And-A-Track-Matte"><a href="#Part-2-Differences-Between-A-Mask-And-A-Track-Matte" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Differences Between A Mask And A Track Matte"></a>Part 2. Differences Between A Mask And A Track Matte</h2><p>In Adobe After Effects, there are two types of masking tools: Masks and Track Mattes. Both are used to hide or reveal a portion of a layer.</p>
<p>Here’re some key differences between a Mask and a Track Matte:</p>
<ol>
<li>A mask is dependent on a specific layer, while the Track Matter is independent of any layer.</li>
<li>A mask is applied directly to a layer having an image or a video and transforms with the layers. On the other hand, Track Matte is a stationary mask applied to the composition rather than a layer.</li>
</ol>

Finding The Track Matte Tool In After Effects"></a>Part 3. Finding The Track Matte Tool In After Effects</h2><p>Track Matte is located by default in the Timeline Window of the After Effects interface, but if it is unavailable there for some reason, toggle the <strong>Transfer Control Pane</strong> button on the bottom-left of the timeline.</p>

<p>If you are still unable to find the Track Matte option, press the <strong>F1 key</strong> or do the following steps in sequence:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click on the area above your layers and select <strong>“Columns.”</strong></li>
<li>Scroll down and click the <strong>“Modes”</strong> option to enable it.</li>
</ol>

<p>Under Track Matte’s drop-down menu, you can find four further options, two with Alpha and two with Luma. We’ll discuss these options in detail in the next section.</p>

All Four Track Matte Options In After Effects"></a>Part 4. All Four Track Matte Options In After Effects</h2><p>After Effects provides four types of Track Matte options: Alpha Matte, Alpha Inverted Matte, Luma Matte, and Luma Inverted Matte, each has its own specific use case. But first, you need to understand what Alpha and Luma are:</p>
<p><strong>Alpha:</strong> This Track Matte type uses the layer’s Alpha channel to determine the layer’s opacity.</p>
<p><strong>Luma:</strong> This Track Matte type uses the top layer’s brightness to mask the bottom layer.</p>

<p>Let’s find out the functions of each option one by one:</p>
<h3 id="Alpha-Matte"><a href="#Alpha-Matte" class="headerlink" title="Alpha Matte"></a>Alpha Matte</h3><p>Alpha Matte is an important option under the Track Matte menu, as it allows you to create a mask based on the transparency of the layer you are using it on. Like the mask, it will use any pixel above 0% opacity and can be useful for various purposes, such as creating a vignette or isolating a certain area of the frame.</p>
<h3 id="Alpha-Inverted-Matte"><a href="#Alpha-Inverted-Matte" class="headerlink" title="Alpha Inverted Matte"></a>Alpha Inverted Matte</h3><p>The Alpha Inverted Matte option is quite the opposite of the Alpha Matte, and around the Alpha channel, it uses negative space from the above layer and will therefore use pixels with 0% opacity as it had 100% opacity.</p>
<h3 id="Luma-Matte"><a href="#Luma-Matte" class="headerlink" title="Luma Matte"></a>Luma Matte</h3><p>Instead of using the Alpha channel, Luma Mattes uses the brightness level or Luma channel of the upper layer to create a mask for the bottom layer.</p>
<h3 id="Luma-Inverted-Matte"><a href="#Luma-Inverted-Matte" class="headerlink" title="Luma Inverted Matte"></a>Luma Inverted Matte</h3><p>Opposite of the Luma Matte, the Luma Inverted Matte uses dark or low luminance areas of the upper layer to create a mask for the lower layer.</p>
<h3 id="Differences-Between-Alpha-Channel-and-Luma-Channel"><a href="#Differences-Between-Alpha-Channel-and-Luma-Channel" class="headerlink" title="Differences Between Alpha Channel and Luma Channel"></a>Differences Between Alpha Channel and Luma Channel</h3><p>When altering the opacity of a layer, it may look like the brightness settings are changed. This might confuse some users, as both Alpha and Luma channels carry the same information. However, they differ in how they are used.</p>
<p>Alpha channel is a type of Track Matte that stores transparency information. This information determines how opaque or transparent a layer will be when superimposed over another layer.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a Luma channel is a video track that stores brightness information. This information is used to determine how bright or dark an image will be and is further divided into three channels, i.e., Red, Green, and Blue (RGB). Their value ranges from 0 to 255, where 0 represents the darkest value while 255 represents the brightest value.</p>

<p>Part 1. What Are Track Mattes In After Effects?</p>
<p>A Track Matte is an element used in video editing to control the opacity of a layer. Essentially, it lets you create a “hole” in a layer so that underlying layers can show through. This tool can be used with video and audio layers, which is essential for creating complex composites in After Effects.</p>
<p>You can use Track Mattes to generate shapes, reveal part of a layer, or keying outs. Interestingly, it remains independent of all layers in your projects, which means you can get visual effects and animations more efficiently than with the masks tool.</p>
<p>Moreover, Track Mattes uses Alpha or Luma channels as a layer mask to determine what parts of the layer to reveal. For instance, you can make a top layer that provides an Alpha or Luminous effect and a bottom layer consisting of the image that will be revealed or shown.</p>
<p>Thus, if you want to use an image to hide your video until you want to unveil it or add a picture in your text, Track Mattes will help you to shape the appearance of a layer above it.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Differences-Between-A-Mask-And-A-Track-Matte-1"><a href="#Part-2-Differences-Between-A-Mask-And-A-Track-Matte-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Differences Between A Mask And A Track Matte"></a>Part 2. Differences Between A Mask And A Track Matte</h2><p>In Adobe After Effects, there are two types of masking tools: Masks and Track Mattes. Both are used to hide or reveal a portion of a layer.</p>
<p>Here’re some key differences between a Mask and a Track Matte:</p>
<ol>
<li>A mask is dependent on a specific layer, while the Track Matter is independent of any layer.</li>
<li>A mask is applied directly to a layer having an image or a video and transforms with the layers. On the other hand, Track Matte is a stationary mask applied to the composition rather than a layer.</li>
</ol>

All Four Track Matte Options In After Effects</h2><p>After Effects provides four types of Track Matte options: Alpha Matte, Alpha Inverted Matte, Luma Matte, and Luma Inverted Matte, each has its own specific use case. But first, you need to understand what Alpha and Luma are:</p>
<p><strong>Alpha:</strong> This Track Matte type uses the layer’s Alpha channel to determine the layer’s opacity.</p>
<p><strong>Luma:</strong> This Track Matte type uses the top layer’s brightness to mask the bottom layer.</p>

<p>Many companies use voiceovers to communicate vital concepts and emotions to their customers. Podcasts, audio&#x2F;video advertising, corporate training films, online courses, games, and animations are all examples of where they might be found.</p>
<p>Without voiceovers, such material would be uninteresting to the viewer. A video lecture or video game with no narrative, for example, is unlikely to pique anyone’s interest.</p>
<p>Good voiceovers, on the other hand, are not inexpensive to make.</p>
<p>Despite the high cost, your self-made voiceovers may still be of poor quality. Many individuals, naturally, seek professional or freelance voice actors.</p>
<p>Hiring voice actors ($300 to $1500 for a 5-minute voiceover narration) is also not the most cost-effective long-term solution. Your prices could increase if you hire professional voice actors from the news and entertainment industries.</p>
<p>There are resources available. Voice over generators is available online. Most software products come in both free and premium versions, which you can pick from depending on your needs. These programs will swiftly help you reach your text to audio transformation goals, whether you’re a YouTube content maker in need of an informative voiceover or a disabled person looking for a user-friendly text-to-speech converter.</p>
<p>Yes! That’s correct. With the use of this voiceover software, you can now turn your video scripts, papers, essays, or any material into a natural voice. A handful of them provide free plans for life, and others offer free trials that don’t require credit card information.</p>
<p>Furthermore, these techniques eliminate the risk of piracy and copyright violation.</p>

<p>Lovo.ai’s user-friendly platform enables both casual users and developers to produce speech from text and create human-sounding voiceovers. Over 180 voice styles in 33 languages are available on the platform. The site is also regularly updated with new voices every day, giving consumers a wide range of options.</p>
<p>In just 15 minutes, the tool can generate personalized voices. On this platform, converting text to speech requires only three simple steps. Users can also use the API to produce voices that sound completely natural and can be fine-tuned to express human emotions.</p>
<p>Features</p>
<ul>
<li>Listening, conversion and sharing are all unlimited.</li>
<li>A large voice library is available.</li>
<li>Up to 15000 characters can be converted at once.</li>
<li>Collection of unique voices. Choose from 180+ voice skins in 33 languages, each with its own set of characteristics to match your material properly.</li>
<li>Genuine voices. Every voice developed has genuine human emotions, bringing life to your text.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>While the UI&#x2F;UX is simple to use, it feels a little bland and dull.”</li>
<li>The number of voices available for each language is somewhat restricted. More voice samples are available.”</li>
<li>I don’t like it when software decides what a line or a sentence is and how it affects the oversight and voiceover.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Pricing</p>
<p>Lovo.ai now offers two pricing options: (all pricing is for annual plans).</p>
<p>$34.99 per month for personal</p>
<p>$99.99 per month for Freelancer</p>
<p>The Personal plan gives access to all of the platform’s features as well as 30 monthly voiceover downloads, which should be enough for most people.</p>
<p>Upgrade to the Freelancer plan to get up to 90 voiceovers each month if you need more. Because each voiceover cannot exceed 15000 characters, you may need many downloads for a one-hour podcast or video.</p>
<p>You will have to pay an additional $69.99 per month per voice for voice cloning. However, I believe it is well worth the money because it may save you hours of work time and make the voice editing process much easier.</p>

<p>Murf.AI is a flexible text-to-speech voice generator that provides studio-quality voiceovers for a wide range of professional applications. The tool has a large voice library with over 115 distinct voices in 15 languages. Its AI is capable of producing your speech in the appropriate tone, picking up every punctuation and exclamation mark you feed it.</p>
<p>It also has a grammatical assistant, so you can create proofread scripts that will only improve your voiceover work. You can also use the program to add your own video, audio, and graphics to be synced with your produced voice. With its enterprise plan, the tool also has a powerful collaboration capability.</p>
<p>Pricing</p>
<ul>
<li>Murf now offers three paid pricing options: (all pricing is for yearly plans).</li>
<li>Monthly Basic – $13</li>
<li>-$26 per month for Pro</li>
<li>Enterprise – monthly fees start at $83</li>
</ul>
<p>The Basic package includes full HD video quality and practically all capabilities (excluding voice editing). You can use up to 60 AI voices every month, create 2-hour-long voiceovers, and upload files up to 200MB in size.</p>
<p>For most users, I believe this plan is adequate. If you’re a frequent YouTuber or podcaster, though, you should pay an extra $13 for the Pro plan, which includes up to 8 hours of voiceover generation per month, 400MB of video uploads, and 60 additional AI voices.</p>
<p>Collaboration capabilities, single sign-on, an account manager, and a configurable voice generating limit would be included in the Enterprise package. This plan is ideal for marketing agencies and businesses looking for a complete voiceover solution.</p>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>Developers, according to several critics, should add more languages. Murf has many fewer AI voices in the library than his competitors.</li>

<p>Play. Ht is a web-based voice generator that allows you to generate high-quality text-to-speech. Because of its basic user interface, the platform is exceptionally simple to use. It has a text box on the home page where you may input your text, choose the language, gender, and voice style, and choose the conversion speed.</p>
<p>Features</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Customization — To fully customize the voiceover, highlight the words. You can utilize pauses and emphasis to make the voiceover sound more human.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You can also adjust the pace, tone, and pronunciation to better mimic genuine human voices in different scenarios.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Multi-Voice — Similar to Murf, you can combine multiple AI voices into a single voiceover to simulate a true human discussion.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Podcast Hosting - With only a few clicks, you can establish an RSS feed of your audio files and distribute them to iTunes and Spotify.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Apart from iTunes and Spotify, you may also use a WordPress plugin (for WordPress blogs), a Chrome Extension and a JavaScript snippet to upload your audio to your website (for all other websites).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Sounds Analytics - Play. It will gather information on all audio. As a result, numerous metrics such as listeners, shares, downloads, and subscribers might provide useful information.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Pricing</p>
<p>Play. ht has four pricing tiers as of August 2021. (all pricing below is for yearly plans).</p>
<p>$14.25 per month for personal use</p>
<p>$29.25 per month for professionals</p>
<p>$74.25 per month in Growth</p>
<p>$149.25 per month for business</p>
<p>Commercial rights, premium voice collecting, or podcast hosting are not included in the Personal plan, which severely limits the practical use of the voices. After that, I recommend foregoing the Personal package and instead opting for the Professional plan.</p>
<p>All important features are available with the Professional package (commercial rights included.) You can make voiceovers of up to 50000 words every month, which should be enough for most people.</p>
<p>If you require additional words, choose the Growth (200000 words per month) or Business plans (500000 words per month).</p>
<p>Both plans include team access and a pronunciation library, but the Business plan adds the ability to rebrand or resell your voiceovers.</p>
<p>Cons</p>

<li>Other than English and European languages, voices made in other languages are not flawless.</li>
<li>There isn’t a built-in video editor for adding voiceovers to videos.</li>

<p>Final Thoughts</p>
<p>As you can see, there are numerous free voiceover generators available online. Most software products come in both free and premium versions, which you can pick from depending on your needs. These programs will swiftly help you reach your text to audio transformation goals, whether you’re a YouTube content maker in need of an informative voiceover or a disabled person looking for a user-friendly text-to-speech converter.</p>
<p><img

<p>Many companies use voiceovers to communicate vital concepts and emotions to their customers. Podcasts, audio&#x2F;video advertising, corporate training films, online courses, games, and animations are all examples of where they might be found.</p>
<p>Without voiceovers, such material would be uninteresting to the viewer. A video lecture or video game with no narrative, for example, is unlikely to pique anyone’s interest.</p>
<p>Good voiceovers, on the other hand, are not inexpensive to make.</p>
<p>Despite the high cost, your self-made voiceovers may still be of poor quality. Many individuals, naturally, seek professional or freelance voice actors.</p>
<p>Hiring voice actors ($300 to $1500 for a 5-minute voiceover narration) is also not the most cost-effective long-term solution. Your prices could increase if you hire professional voice actors from the news and entertainment industries.</p>
<p>There are resources available. Voice over generators is available online. Most software products come in both free and premium versions, which you can pick from depending on your needs. These programs will swiftly help you reach your text to audio transformation goals, whether you’re a YouTube content maker in need of an informative voiceover or a disabled person looking for a user-friendly text-to-speech converter.</p>
<p>Yes! That’s correct. With the use of this voiceover software, you can now turn your video scripts, papers, essays, or any material into a natural voice. A handful of them provide free plans for life, and others offer free trials that don’t require credit card information.</p>
<p>Furthermore, these techniques eliminate the risk of piracy and copyright violation.</p>
<p>So, let’s simplify things by identifying the top 10 and analyzing each of them.</p>

The platform can also produce a personalized voice that you can use as a voice assistant for Alexa, Google, and other services. The technique can also be used by call centres to clone their agents’ voices and customize them.</p>
<p>Resemble gives you four alternative ways to create synthetic voices. You can use the API to generate voices, record up to 50 samples immediately on the online platform, choose from a large number of voice actors, or submit raw audio without a script.</p>

<p>Lovo.ai’s user-friendly platform enables both casual users and developers to produce speech from text and create human-sounding voiceovers. Over 180 voice styles in 33 languages are available on the platform. The site is also regularly updated with new voices every day, giving consumers a wide range of options.</p>
<p>In just 15 minutes, the tool can generate personalized voices. On this platform, converting text to speech requires only three simple steps. Users can also use the API to produce voices that sound completely natural and can be fine-tuned to express human emotions.</p>
<p>Features</p>

<li>Genuine voices. Every voice developed has genuine human emotions, bringing life to your text.</li>

<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>While the UI&#x2F;UX is simple to use, it feels a little bland and dull.”</li>
<li>The number of voices available for each language is somewhat restricted. More voice samples are available.”</li>
<li>I don’t like it when software decides what a line or a sentence is and how it affects the oversight and voiceover.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Pricing</p>
<p>Lovo.ai now offers two pricing options: (all pricing is for annual plans).</p>
<p>$34.99 per month for personal</p>
<p>$99.99 per month for Freelancer</p>
<p>The Personal plan gives access to all of the platform’s features as well as 30 monthly voiceover downloads, which should be enough for most people.</p>
<p>Upgrade to the Freelancer plan to get up to 90 voiceovers each month if you need more. Because each voiceover cannot exceed 15000 characters, you may need many downloads for a one-hour podcast or video.</p>
<p>You will have to pay an additional $69.99 per month per voice for voice cloning. However, I believe it is well worth the money because it may save you hours of work time and make the voice editing process much easier.</p>

<ul>

<p>Pricing</p>
<p>Play. ht has four pricing tiers as of August 2021. (all pricing below is for yearly plans).</p>
<p>$14.25 per month for personal use</p>
<p>$29.25 per month for professionals</p>
<p>$74.25 per month in Growth</p>
<p>$149.25 per month for business</p>
<p>Commercial rights, premium voice collecting, or podcast hosting are not included in the Personal plan, which severely limits the practical use of the voices. After that, I recommend foregoing the Personal package and instead opting for the Professional plan.</p>
<p>All important features are available with the Professional package (commercial rights included.) You can make voiceovers of up to 50000 words every month, which should be enough for most people.</p>
<p>If you require additional words, choose the Growth (200000 words per month) or Business plans (500000 words per month).</p>
<p>Both plans include team access and a pronunciation library, but the Business plan adds the ability to rebrand or resell your voiceovers.</p>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>Other than English and European languages, voices made in other languages are not flawless.</li>
<li>There isn’t a built-in video editor for adding voiceovers to videos.</li>

<p>Final Thoughts</p>
<p>As you can see, there are numerous free voiceover generators available online. Most software products come in both free and premium versions, which you can pick from depending on your needs. These programs will swiftly help you reach your text to audio transformation goals, whether you’re a YouTube content maker in need of an informative voiceover or a disabled person looking for a user-friendly text-to-speech converter.</p>
<p><img

<p>Many companies use voiceovers to communicate vital concepts and emotions to their customers. Podcasts, audio&#x2F;video advertising, corporate training films, online courses, games, and animations are all examples of where they might be found.</p>
<p>Without voiceovers, such material would be uninteresting to the viewer. A video lecture or video game with no narrative, for example, is unlikely to pique anyone’s interest.</p>
<p>Good voiceovers, on the other hand, are not inexpensive to make.</p>
<p>Despite the high cost, your self-made voiceovers may still be of poor quality. Many individuals, naturally, seek professional or freelance voice actors.</p>
<p>Hiring voice actors ($300 to $1500 for a 5-minute voiceover narration) is also not the most cost-effective long-term solution. Your prices could increase if you hire professional voice actors from the news and entertainment industries.</p>
<p>There are resources available. Voice over generators is available online. Most software products come in both free and premium versions, which you can pick from depending on your needs. These programs will swiftly help you reach your text to audio transformation goals, whether you’re a YouTube content maker in need of an informative voiceover or a disabled person looking for a user-friendly text-to-speech converter.</p>
<p>Yes! That’s correct. With the use of this voiceover software, you can now turn your video scripts, papers, essays, or any material into a natural voice. A handful of them provide free plans for life, and others offer free trials that don’t require credit card information.</p>
<p>Furthermore, these techniques eliminate the risk of piracy and copyright violation.</p>
<p>So, let’s simplify things by identifying the top 10 and analyzing each of them.</p>

The platform can also produce a personalized voice that you can use as a voice assistant for Alexa, Google, and other services. The technique can also be used by call centres to clone their agents’ voices and customize them.</p>
<p>Resemble gives you four alternative ways to create synthetic voices. You can use the API to generate voices, record up to 50 samples immediately on the online platform, choose from a large number of voice actors, or submit raw audio without a script.</p>
<p>Features</p>

<li>The user interface could be enhanced.</li>

<p>Lovo.ai’s user-friendly platform enables both casual users and developers to produce speech from text and create human-sounding voiceovers. Over 180 voice styles in 33 languages are available on the platform. The site is also regularly updated with new voices every day, giving consumers a wide range of options.</p>
<p>In just 15 minutes, the tool can generate personalized voices. On this platform, converting text to speech requires only three simple steps. Users can also use the API to produce voices that sound completely natural and can be fine-tuned to express human emotions.</p>
<p>Features</p>
<ul>
<li>Listening, conversion and sharing are all unlimited.</li>
<li>A large voice library is available.</li>
<li>Up to 15000 characters can be converted at once.</li>
<li>Collection of unique voices. Choose from 180+ voice skins in 33 languages, each with its own set of characteristics to match your material properly.</li>
<li>Genuine voices. Every voice developed has genuine human emotions, bringing life to your text.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>While the UI&#x2F;UX is simple to use, it feels a little bland and dull.”</li>
<li>The number of voices available for each language is somewhat restricted. More voice samples are available.”</li>
<li>I don’t like it when software decides what a line or a sentence is and how it affects the oversight and voiceover.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Pricing</p>
<p>Lovo.ai now offers two pricing options: (all pricing is for annual plans).</p>
<p>$34.99 per month for personal</p>
<p>$99.99 per month for Freelancer</p>
<p>The Personal plan gives access to all of the platform’s features as well as 30 monthly voiceover downloads, which should be enough for most people.</p>
<p>Upgrade to the Freelancer plan to get up to 90 voiceovers each month if you need more. Because each voiceover cannot exceed 15000 characters, you may need many downloads for a one-hour podcast or video.</p>
<p>You will have to pay an additional $69.99 per month per voice for voice cloning. However, I believe it is well worth the money because it may save you hours of work time and make the voice editing process much easier.</p>

<p>Synthesia stands apart from the rest of the software on this list. It’s a video maker that also has an AI presenter.</p>

<p>Assume you’ve exhausted your video credits. More credits can be purchased for $30 for ten credits. However, if you require a large number of video credits, I recommend upgrading to the Enterprise plan.</p>
<p>This plan includes real-time voice, audio uploads, and other premium features (copywriting, video editing, etc.)</p>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>Only video producers can use it. If you’re a podcaster, you’ll be disappointed with the tool.</li>
<li>Custom avatars are very expensive, but they are required if you wish to use Synthesia movies in paid advertising campaigns.</li>

The tool has a large voice library with over 115 distinct voices in 15 languages. Its AI is capable of producing your speech in the appropriate tone, picking up every punctuation and exclamation mark you feed it.</p>
<p>It also has a grammatical assistant, so you can create proofread scripts that will only improve your voiceover work. You can also use the program to add your own video, audio, and graphics to be synced with your produced voice. With its enterprise plan, the tool also has a powerful collaboration capability.</p>
<p>Pricing</p>

</ul>
<p>The Basic package includes full HD video quality and practically all capabilities (excluding voice editing). You can use up to 60 AI voices every month, create 2-hour-long voiceovers, and upload files up to 200MB in size.</p>
<p>For most users, I believe this plan is adequate. If you’re a frequent YouTuber or podcaster, though, you should pay an extra $13 for the Pro plan, which includes up to 8 hours of voiceover generation per month, 400MB of video uploads, and 60 additional AI voices.</p>
<p>Collaboration capabilities, single sign-on, an account manager, and a configurable voice generating limit would be included in the Enterprise package. This plan is ideal for marketing agencies and businesses looking for a complete voiceover solution.</p>

<p>Final Thoughts</p>
<p>As you can see, there are numerous free voiceover generators available online. Most software products come in both free and premium versions, which you can pick from depending on your needs. These programs will swiftly help you reach your text to audio transformation goals, whether you’re a YouTube content maker in need of an informative voiceover or a disabled person looking for a user-friendly text-to-speech converter.</p>
<p><img

<p>Many companies use voiceovers to communicate vital concepts and emotions to their customers. Podcasts, audio&#x2F;video advertising, corporate training films, online courses, games, and animations are all examples of where they might be found.</p>
<p>Without voiceovers, such material would be uninteresting to the viewer. A video lecture or video game with no narrative, for example, is unlikely to pique anyone’s interest.</p>
<p>Good voiceovers, on the other hand, are not inexpensive to make.</p>
<p>Despite the high cost, your self-made voiceovers may still be of poor quality. Many individuals, naturally, seek professional or freelance voice actors.</p>
<p>Hiring voice actors ($300 to $1500 for a 5-minute voiceover narration) is also not the most cost-effective long-term solution. Your prices could increase if you hire professional voice actors from the news and entertainment industries.</p>
<p>There are resources available. Voice over generators is available online. Most software products come in both free and premium versions, which you can pick from depending on your needs. These programs will swiftly help you reach your text to audio transformation goals, whether you’re a YouTube content maker in need of an informative voiceover or a disabled person looking for a user-friendly text-to-speech converter.</p>
<p>Yes! That’s correct. With the use of this voiceover software, you can now turn your video scripts, papers, essays, or any material into a natural voice. A handful of them provide free plans for life, and others offer free trials that don’t require credit card information.</p>
<p>Furthermore, these techniques eliminate the risk of piracy and copyright violation.</p>
<p>So, let’s simplify things by identifying the top 10 and analyzing each of them.</p>

The platform can also produce a personalized voice that you can use as a voice assistant for Alexa, Google, and other services. The technique can also be used by call centres to clone their agents’ voices and customize them.</p>
<p>Resemble gives you four alternative ways to create synthetic voices. You can use the API to generate voices, record up to 50 samples immediately on the online platform, choose from a large number of voice actors, or submit raw audio without a script.</p>

<p>Lovo.ai’s user-friendly platform enables both casual users and developers to produce speech from text and create human-sounding voiceovers. Over 180 voice styles in 33 languages are available on the platform. The site is also regularly updated with new voices every day, giving consumers a wide range of options.</p>
<p>In just 15 minutes, the tool can generate personalized voices. On this platform, converting text to speech requires only three simple steps. Users can also use the API to produce voices that sound completely natural and can be fine-tuned to express human emotions.</p>
<p>Features</p>
<ul>
<li>Listening, conversion and sharing are all unlimited.</li>
<li>A large voice library is available.</li>
<li>Up to 15000 characters can be converted at once.</li>
<li>Collection of unique voices. Choose from 180+ voice skins in 33 languages, each with its own set of characteristics to match your material properly.</li>
<li>Genuine voices. Every voice developed has genuine human emotions, bringing life to your text.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>While the UI&#x2F;UX is simple to use, it feels a little bland and dull.”</li>
<li>The number of voices available for each language is somewhat restricted. More voice samples are available.”</li>
<li>I don’t like it when software decides what a line or a sentence is and how it affects the oversight and voiceover.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Pricing</p>
<p>Lovo.ai now offers two pricing options: (all pricing is for annual plans).</p>
<p>$34.99 per month for personal</p>
<p>$99.99 per month for Freelancer</p>
<p>The Personal plan gives access to all of the platform’s features as well as 30 monthly voiceover downloads, which should be enough for most people.</p>
<p>Upgrade to the Freelancer plan to get up to 90 voiceovers each month if you need more. Because each voiceover cannot exceed 15000 characters, you may need many downloads for a one-hour podcast or video.</p>
<p>You will have to pay an additional $69.99 per month per voice for voice cloning. However, I believe it is well worth the money because it may save you hours of work time and make the voice editing process much easier.</p>

<p>Synthesia is the fourth stage cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval cheval</p>
<p>Synthesia stands apart from the rest of the software on this list. It’s a video maker that also has an AI presenter.</p>
<p>This is because Synthesia will generate a professional-looking video for you and add an AI presenter who will deliver narration based on the material you provided, thus acting as a voiceover.</p>
<p>Features</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Avatars - Users can use this unique tool to add an AI presenter to their films. There are many pre-built avatars to pick from.</p>

<p>The Personal plan includes all features save the two advanced capabilities mentioned above and actual voice. As a result, you can make up to 10 minutes of video per month.</p>
<p>Assume you’ve exhausted your video credits. More credits can be purchased for $30 for ten credits. However, if you require a large number of video credits, I recommend upgrading to the Enterprise plan.</p>
<p>This plan includes real-time voice, audio uploads, and other premium features (copywriting, video editing, etc.)</p>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>Only video producers can use it. If you’re a podcaster, you’ll be disappointed with the tool.</li>
<li>Custom avatars are very expensive, but they are required if you wish to use Synthesia movies in paid advertising campaigns.</li>

<p>Murf.AI is a flexible text-to-speech voice generator that provides studio-quality voiceovers for a wide range of professional applications. The tool has a large voice library with over 115 distinct voices in 15 languages. Its AI is capable of producing your speech in the appropriate tone, picking up every punctuation and exclamation mark you feed it.</p>
<p>It also has a grammatical assistant, so you can create proofread scripts that will only improve your voiceover work. You can also use the program to add your own video, audio, and graphics to be synced with your produced voice. With its enterprise plan, the tool also has a powerful collaboration capability.</p>
<p>Pricing</p>
<ul>
<li>Murf now offers three paid pricing options: (all pricing is for yearly plans).</li>
<li>Monthly Basic – $13</li>
<li>-$26 per month for Pro</li>
<li>Enterprise – monthly fees start at $83</li>
</ul>
<p>The Basic package includes full HD video quality and practically all capabilities (excluding voice editing). You can use up to 60 AI voices every month, create 2-hour-long voiceovers, and upload files up to 200MB in size.</p>
<p>For most users, I believe this plan is adequate. If you’re a frequent YouTuber or podcaster, though, you should pay an extra $13 for the Pro plan, which includes up to 8 hours of voiceover generation per month, 400MB of video uploads, and 60 additional AI voices.</p>
<p>Collaboration capabilities, single sign-on, an account manager, and a configurable voice generating limit would be included in the Enterprise package. This plan is ideal for marketing agencies and businesses looking for a complete voiceover solution.</p>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>Developers, according to several critics, should add more languages. Murf has many fewer AI voices in the library than his competitors.</li>

<p>Play. Ht is a web-based voice generator that allows you to generate high-quality text-to-speech. Because of its basic user interface, the platform is exceptionally simple to use. It has a text box on the home page where you may input your text, choose the language, gender, and voice style, and choose the conversion speed.</p>
<p>Features</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Customization — To fully customize the voiceover, highlight the words. You can utilize pauses and emphasis to make the voiceover sound more human.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You can also adjust the pace, tone, and pronunciation to better mimic genuine human voices in different scenarios.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Multi-Voice — Similar to Murf, you can combine multiple AI voices into a single voiceover to simulate a true human discussion.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Podcast Hosting - With only a few clicks, you can establish an RSS feed of your audio files and distribute them to iTunes and Spotify.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Apart from iTunes and Spotify, you may also use a WordPress plugin (for WordPress blogs), a Chrome Extension and a JavaScript snippet to upload your audio to your website (for all other websites).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Sounds Analytics - Play. It will gather information on all audio. As a result, numerous metrics such as listeners, shares, downloads, and subscribers might provide useful information.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Pricing</p>
<p>Play. ht has four pricing tiers as of August 2021. (all pricing below is for yearly plans).</p>
<p>$14.25 per month for personal use</p>
<p>$29.25 per month for professionals</p>
<p>$74.25 per month in Growth</p>
<p>$149.25 per month for business</p>
<p>Commercial rights, premium voice collecting, or podcast hosting are not included in the Personal plan, which severely limits the practical use of the voices. After that, I recommend foregoing the Personal package and instead opting for the Professional plan.</p>
<p>All important features are available with the Professional package (commercial rights included.) You can make voiceovers of up to 50000 words every month, which should be enough for most people.</p>
<p>If you require additional words, choose the Growth (200000 words per month) or Business plans (500000 words per month).</p>
<p>Both plans include team access and a pronunciation library, but the Business plan adds the ability to rebrand or resell your voiceovers.</p>
<p>Cons</p>

<li>Other than English and European languages, voices made in other languages are not flawless.</li>
<li>There isn’t a built-in video editor for adding voiceovers to videos.</li>
