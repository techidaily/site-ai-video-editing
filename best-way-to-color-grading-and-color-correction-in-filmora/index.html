The colors do not appear bright and robust on a screen as in real life.</p>
<p>While there are numerous reasons for the dull, uninviting look- a basic edit could fix it quickly. One of the vital, if not the first, steps in the process is color grading and color correction. However, what exactly are color grading and color correction? And how can they help fix the color ratios and balance in a video?</p>
<p>This article covers everything you need to know about color grading and correction and a complete guide to adjusting cinematic colors with the best video editor, Wondershare Filmora. So, without much ado, let’s dig into it!</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Color-Grading-VS-Color-Correction"><a href="#Part-1-Color-Grading-VS-Color-Correction" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Color Grading VS Color Correction"></a>Part 1. Color Grading VS Color Correction</h2><p>These terms have often been used interchangeably; people consider them synonymous. However, they are two different artistic phenomena to adjust the color scheme.</p>
<p>Since we will discuss them in detail later, here is a brief description. Put simply, color correcting is a corrective procedure, while color grading is a cinematic adjustment.</p>
<p>Color correction diverts the colors to a relatively neutral baseline achieving a unified look for all captured shots. On the other hand, color grading is inclined more toward a creative look aimed at balancing colors that reflect the emotion of the sequence.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/color-correction-vs-color-grading.gif"
                      alt="color correction vs color grading"
                ></p>
<p>These two work hand in hand to dramatically uplift the overall look of the sequence. Let’s delve deeper into these techniques and see how to use them.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-Is-Color-Correction"><a href="#Part-2-What-Is-Color-Correction" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. What Is Color Correction?"></a>Part 2. What Is Color Correction?</h2><p>We will start with color correction- the first step in color editing. Even with a slight glance at the raw shots, you can notice how much the tones are messed up. The crude product is oversaturated with colors.</p>
<p>Color correction is about making the shots look as natural as possible. It brings the sequences to the neutral baseline to achieve a unified look.</p>
<p>For now, we need to ignore our creative and aesthetic preferences and focus entirely on exposure and white balance. The actual end goal is to keep the colors true to life.</p>
<p>However, color-correcting a video is challenging if you are a beginner. There needs to be more than just understanding the fundamentals; it requires cinematic and technical skills.</p>
<p>Here is the basic process for a clean, color-corrected shot, irrespective of the software you use.</p>
<h3 id="Essential-Steps-for-Color-Correcting-a-Shot"><a href="#Essential-Steps-for-Color-Correcting-a-Shot" class="headerlink" title="Essential Steps for Color Correcting a Shot"></a>Essential Steps for Color Correcting a Shot</h3><h5 id="1-Set-the-color-profile"><a href="#1-Set-the-color-profile" class="headerlink" title="1. Set the color profile"></a>1. Set the color profile</h5><p>Different video formats (HDR, LOG, RAW, HLG, etc.) have different exposure content. Therefore, select a color profile that matches your video format for the best results before starting.</p>
<h5 id="2-Adjust-the-saturation"><a href="#2-Adjust-the-saturation" class="headerlink" title="2. Adjust the saturation"></a>2. Adjust the saturation</h5><p>It is the primary step of color correction. Often the exposure of raw content is high. Next, equalize the saturation for a natural look.</p>
<h5 id="3-Fix-the-contrast"><a href="#3-Fix-the-contrast" class="headerlink" title="3. Fix the contrast"></a>3. Fix the contrast</h5><p>Contrast is the difference between the light and dark areas of the image. Pictures with a higher contrast are sharper and more detailed.</p>
<p>However, adjust the contrast during color correcting so that the dark areas are not crushed, and you preserve the details maximally.</p>
<h5 id="4-Set-the-white-balance"><a href="#4-Set-the-white-balance" class="headerlink" title="4. Set the white balance"></a>4. Set the white balance</h5><p>It is time to adjust the white balance with the saturation and contrast fixed. The colors will shift to orange and blue hues if it is maladjusted.</p>
<p>Use the color curves to ensure pure whites so all colors fall correctly in place.</p>
<h5 id="5-Double-check-individual-color-tones"><a href="#5-Double-check-individual-color-tones" class="headerlink" title="5. Double-check individual color tones"></a>5. Double-check individual color tones</h5><p>The final step is a secondary checking of the individual colors. Double-check the skin tones so they match in each shot.</p>
<p>Make sure the skin tones match their natural hues for an authentic, unfiltered look.</p>
<p>It is a basic walkthrough for color-correcting. More steps can vary according to the professional demands of the video. However, as a beginner, this is the best process to follow.</p>
<p>Once we’ve corrected the color, it is time to move to the next and primary step- color grading.</p>

<h2 id="Part-3-What-Is-Color-Grading"><a href="#Part-3-What-Is-Color-Grading" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. What Is Color Grading?"></a>Part 3. What Is Color Grading?</h2><p>After you set all the tones to the baseline, you can start with the creative process of color grading. In this case, you do not change the colors anymore. Instead, you make artistic choices to change the moods and emotions of that particular sequence. Color grading is about manipulating the colors and contrasts that intensify the visual tone and explain your story to the world.</p>
<p>Color correction can be enough if you want to keep the video realistic. However, color grading is essential if you want to imply emotions and feelings in your content. Following is an essential step-by-step guide to color grading.</p>
<h3 id="Basic-Steps-of-Color-Grading"><a href="#Basic-Steps-of-Color-Grading" class="headerlink" title="Basic Steps of Color Grading"></a>Basic Steps of Color Grading</h3><p>If you are a beginner, the color grading process can be tricky without expertise. Hence here are the basic steps of color grading a video.</p>
<h5 id="1-Color-correcting"><a href="#1-Color-correcting" class="headerlink" title="1. Color correcting"></a>1. Color correcting</h5><p>Correcting the colors and balance will always be the first step before you can color-grade footage. Next, the video must be normalized and should seem natural before you intensify the overall look.</p>
<h5 id="2-Match-the-colors"><a href="#2-Match-the-colors" class="headerlink" title="2. Match the colors"></a>2. Match the colors</h5><p>In the next step, we balance the contours between color-corrected footage and color grading. Then, you can use LUTs (Look Up Tables) to match the individual colors to the scheme.</p>
<h5 id="3-Shot-to-shot-matching"><a href="#3-Shot-to-shot-matching" class="headerlink" title="3. Shot-to-shot matching"></a>3. Shot-to-shot matching</h5><p>The next integral step is to match the colors between all the shots so we can achieve a unified look. The contrasting appearance of shots can make them look unprofessional and poorly cinematic.</p>
<h5 id="4-Adjust-the-mood-and-emotions"><a href="#4-Adjust-the-mood-and-emotions" class="headerlink" title="4. Adjust the mood and emotions"></a>4. Adjust the mood and emotions</h5><p>A well-executed color grading can potentiate the emotions in a shot. Use your artistic choices and tools from editing software to imply the director’s feelings in the video.</p>
<h5 id="5-Make-the-final-adjustments"><a href="#5-Make-the-final-adjustments" class="headerlink" title="5. Make the final adjustments"></a>5. Make the final adjustments</h5><p>As the final opportunity, tweak hues and chroma to ensure the colors match your palette in each scene. But, again, do not overdo anything, and play with colors to nudge the moods in the shot.</p>
<p>If your footage is the cake, color grading is the cherry on top that enhances the final look. You can instantly evoke connotations and bring the audience to a different page with some professional color grading.</p>
<p>However, while color correcting and grading, there are a few things that you should take care of. Here is a list of some To-do’s and Not To-do’s in the post-production edit.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-Things-To-Consider-About-the-Editing-Environment"><a href="#Part-4-Things-To-Consider-About-the-Editing-Environment" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Things To Consider About the Editing Environment"></a>Part 4. Things To Consider About the Editing Environment</h2><p>Before you begin color-grading or color-correcting, here are some essential things to consider that can dramatically improve the results.</p>
<h5 id="1-Neutral-editing-environment"><a href="#1-Neutral-editing-environment" class="headerlink" title="1. Neutral editing environment"></a>1. Neutral editing environment</h5><p>Funky neon lights or fluorescent lights in the background can dominate your vision. As compensation, you will be over-saturating your footage with colors.</p>
<p>Make sure to use only white, neutral light with a CRI (color rendering Index) of at least 90. It will decrease inconsistencies as much as possible.</p>
<h5 id="2-Using-might-shifts-orange-screen"><a href="#2-Using-might-shifts-orange-screen" class="headerlink" title="2. Using might shifts&#x2F;orange screen"></a>2. Using might shifts&#x2F;orange screen</h5><p>People often activate night shifts or orange screens to protect their eyes from excessive strain. Resultantly, the screen appears dull and orange-y.</p>
<p>Since this alters the actual colors of the video, the results are undermined. So make sure to turn off all technologies that can sabotage the grading.</p>
<h5 id="3-Control-the-light"><a href="#3-Control-the-light" class="headerlink" title="3. Control the light"></a>3. Control the light</h5><p>It is necessary to control the amount of light that enters your working space area. Excessive light alters your color perception and hence obstructs achieving a balanced contour.</p>
<p>Ensure that the light does not directly falls on the screen or your eyes. You must maintain an adequate distance from the screen to see nuances as you grade.</p>
<p>After completing all the fundamentals of color correcting and color grading, let’s demonstrate how to do it in real-time.</p>

What Is Color Grading?</h2><p>After you set all the tones to the baseline, you can start with the creative process of color grading. In this case, you do not change the colors anymore. Instead, you make artistic choices to change the moods and emotions of that particular sequence. Color grading is about manipulating the colors and contrasts that intensify the visual tone and explain your story to the world.</p>
<p>Color correction can be enough if you want to keep the video realistic. However, color grading is essential if you want to imply emotions and feelings in your content. Following is an essential step-by-step guide to color grading.</p>
<h3 id="Basic-Steps-of-Color-Grading-1"><a href="#Basic-Steps-of-Color-Grading-1" class="headerlink" title="Basic Steps of Color Grading"></a>Basic Steps of Color Grading</h3><p>If you are a beginner, the color grading process can be tricky without expertise. Hence here are the basic steps of color grading a video.</p>
<h5 id="1-Color-correcting-1"><a href="#1-Color-correcting-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Color correcting"></a>1. Color correcting</h5><p>Correcting the colors and balance will always be the first step before you can color-grade footage. Next, the video must be normalized and should seem natural before you intensify the overall look.</p>
<h5 id="2-Match-the-colors-1"><a href="#2-Match-the-colors-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Match the colors"></a>2. Match the colors</h5><p>In the next step, we balance the contours between color-corrected footage and color grading. Then, you can use LUTs (Look Up Tables) to match the individual colors to the scheme.</p>
<h5 id="3-Shot-to-shot-matching-1"><a href="#3-Shot-to-shot-matching-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Shot-to-shot matching"></a>3. Shot-to-shot matching</h5><p>The next integral step is to match the colors between all the shots so we can achieve a unified look. The contrasting appearance of shots can make them look unprofessional and poorly cinematic.</p>
<h5 id="4-Adjust-the-mood-and-emotions-1"><a href="#4-Adjust-the-mood-and-emotions-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Adjust the mood and emotions"></a>4. Adjust the mood and emotions</h5><p>A well-executed color grading can potentiate the emotions in a shot. Use your artistic choices and tools from editing software to imply the director’s feelings in the video.</p>
<h5 id="5-Make-the-final-adjustments-1"><a href="#5-Make-the-final-adjustments-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Make the final adjustments"></a>5. Make the final adjustments</h5><p>As the final opportunity, tweak hues and chroma to ensure the colors match your palette in each scene. But, again, do not overdo anything, and play with colors to nudge the moods in the shot.</p>
<p>If your footage is the cake, color grading is the cherry on top that enhances the final look. You can instantly evoke connotations and bring the audience to a different page with some professional color grading.</p>

<h2 id="Top-5-Best-Video-to-PPT-Converters"><a href="#Top-5-Best-Video-to-PPT-Converters" class="headerlink" title="Top 5 Best Video to PPT Converters"></a>Top 5 Best Video to PPT Converters</h2><p>Almost three decades after its debut, Microsoft PowerPoint has become a hallmark of professionalism and quality in the presentation software industry. Traditional PPT files produced by PowerPoint have many drawbacks, including the fact that the content of your presentations may be readily edited and reused by others.</p>
<p>The Save to Video option in 2010 and subsequent versions of PowerPoint addresses this problem by allowing users to produce video files that may be readily shared on social media, video sharing sites, or utilized in eLearning courses. The built-in PPT file conversion function in newer versions of PowerPoint has several restrictions that prohibit you from picking the video file type or incorporating embedded media files in the PowerPoint presentation video.</p>
<p>That’s why we’ve compiled a list of the top five video to ppt converter to make the process of turning a PowerPoint presentation into a movie as simple and enjoyable as possible.</p>
