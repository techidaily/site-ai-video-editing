You can shoot the footage in slow-motion mode or slow it down while editing the video. Similarly, if you are making a funny video, there are surely going to be parts where the video speeds up. Sped-up video clips have always been part of comic relief and entertainment for the audience. You will need a feature-rich video editor to customize the speed of your video.</p>
<p>DaVinci Resolve has established itself as a complete video editor. You can edit your video, correct the color, add visual effects and edit audio parts. You can undoubtedly change video speed in DaVinci Resolve. However, DaVinci Resolve’s user interface is slightly complex for beginners. We will instruct on how you can speed up a video using DaVinci Resolve. We will also suggest you an easier alternative if you are not in favor of DaVinci Resolve.</p>

What are the Scenarios When You Need to Speed Up Video?"></a>Part I. What are the Scenarios When You Need to Speed Up Video?</h2><p>There are several scenarios when speeding up a video becomes a necessity. Here are the most probable ones that you can relate to.</p>
<p><strong>Boring But Necessary Parts</strong> - There could be some sections in a long video that are necessary but boring to watch. You can’t bore your viewers and let them leave your video midway. Hence, you can speed up those sections to pass them away quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Funny Videos</strong> - The subject’s actions in the video look very funny when you speed them up. Therefore, if you make funny videos to entertain your viewers, speeding up certain sections of your video with funny audio in the background should be a regular thing.</p>
<p><strong>Short Videos</strong> - Short-duration videos are extremely popular on social media platforms.</p>
<p>People upload them as Stories and Statuses to entertain their followers regularly. Therefore, a sped-up video can shorten the duration, accommodate the necessary content, and fit the video duration requirements of the respective social media platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Timelapse</strong> - Timelapse videos are a treat to watch. You can shoot the video in timelapse mode or speed up the video while editing. That is how you can fit hours of a video into a few minutes or seconds of video duration.</p>

Speed Up Video using DaVinci Resolve</h2><p>DaVinci Resolve is a professional video editor where you can change your video’s speed in several ways. You can instantly change your video clip’s speed by mentioning the speed in terms of percentage.</p>
<p>You can also use the advanced Speed Ramp option to customize the video speed unevenly. Besides, there are retime curves to adjust the video speed at your convenience. Let us go through the detailed guide on how to speed up the video in DaVinci Resolve 17.</p>
<h3 id="Method-1-Change-Clip-Speed-Option"><a href="#Method-1-Change-Clip-Speed-Option" class="headerlink" title="Method 1. Change Clip Speed Option"></a>Method 1. Change Clip Speed Option</h3><p>The simplest way is through the Change Clip Speed option. You can explicitly mention the speed percentage as needed. To speed it up, mention speed percentage above 100. If you want to slow it down, the speed percentage will be below 100. Here are the steps you need to execute.</p>
<p>Step1 After you have placed the video clip onto the timeline, select the clip and right-click on it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-up-video-with-davinci-resolve-1.jpg"
                      alt="placed the video clip"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Tap “Change Clip Speed…” option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-up-video-with-davinci-resolve-2.jpg"
                      alt="change clip speed"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 Once the Change Clip Speed dialog box opens, modify the speed from 100% to something higher if you want to speed it up.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-up-video-with-davinci-resolve-3.jpg"
                      alt="once the change clip"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 Click on the Change button when you are happy with the result.</p>
<h3 id="Method-2-Speed-Ramping-Option"><a href="#Method-2-Speed-Ramping-Option" class="headerlink" title="Method 2. Speed Ramping Option"></a>Method 2. Speed Ramping Option</h3><p>Speed ramping is a process where you can vary the speed of your video unevenly. It means you can speed up some portions while slowing down others. This is achieved through retime controls that let you edit the video clips in sections using speed points. Here are the steps to illustrate the process.</p>
<p>Step1 Right-click the video clip on your timeline. From the menu, select the Retime Controls option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/speed-up-video-with-davinci-resolve-4.jpg"
                      alt="video clip"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Move the play head where you want to change the speed. Click the arrow next to 100% and select the Add Speed Point option. Similarly, move the play head to another point and add a new speed point.</p>

<p>Speed Ramping enables you to add the slow-motion effect at different parts of a video and even freeze the screen for the duration that you specify. The processes to get these done are given below in detail:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Add Source Video to Timeline and Get to the Speed Ramping Window</strong></p>
<p>Use the process given in the previous method to import a source video to Wondershare Filmora 11 and add it to the Timeline. Then use the process given in the second step of the previous method to get to the <strong>Speed Ramping</strong> window.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add Slow Motion Effect to Different Parts of the Clip</strong></p>
<p>Go to the <strong>Speed Ramping</strong> tab if it is not already selected, click <strong>Custom</strong> from the available options, and drag the adjustment points below the center line to reduce the playback speed for that particular section of the clip. Optionally, you can click any of the available presets to automatically add the slow-motion effect to the video.</p>
<p>Note: You can also drag the adjustment points above the line to increase the playback speed.</p>
<p>To add an adjustment point on the frame where it is not already present, place the playhead (skimmer) at the correct position, and click <strong>Add Adjust Point</strong> from the left of the <strong>Speed Ramping</strong> window itself. Once added, you can drag it downward to reduce the playback speed of that part of the clip.</p>

<h2 id="Part-3-When-to-Use-Slow-Motion"><a href="#Part-3-When-to-Use-Slow-Motion" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: When to Use Slow Motion?"></a>Part 3: When to Use Slow Motion?</h2><p>There could be many instances when you want to add a slow-motion effect to your videos. Some of the most common ones include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Add Focus</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If there is a particular scene in a clip that you want the audience to focus on, it would be a good idea to add the slow-motion effect right before that action appears on the screen, and bring the speed back to normal when the section is over.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Skill or Style Demonstration</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When a clip is playing at a normal speed, many times, the audience isn’t able to see the skills that you want to display. This is where you may want to add the slow-motion effect so that every detail can be noticed clearly and in detail.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Replays</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Mostly used for tournaments and matches where the actual action is to replayed so the audience, umpires, and other viewers can see the movements in detail before making the right decision.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Observation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Some natural phenomena such as a deer running in the woods, a balloon full of water bursting, etc. occur quite quickly. If you want to witness such things clearly and in detail, it would be good to record them, and then reduce the playback speed for better viewing.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Add Suspense</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When you add the slow-motion effect to a scene, the impulse of the audience is automatically increased, and they take that particular section more seriously and with a thrill.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The slow-motion effect is inversely proportional to the framerate, i.e., frames per second or FPS. Almost all DSLR cameras that are available nowadays allow you to switch between different FPS values (typically 120 and 240) before recording. Also, if you have access to an iPhone, its Camera app has a built-in SLO-MO mode that can capture the footage in slow motion.</p>
<p>In addition, if you already have a video that has been recorded at a normal speed, you can use an efficient post-production software like Wondershare Filmora 11, and exploit its Speed Ramping feature to add the slow-motion effect at different scenes of a clip.</p>

Usually, to have a video play at normal speed, it is recorded at 24 FPS or 30 FPS. On the other hand, if you increase the frame rate (FPS) to 120 or 240, the playback speed slows down. You can easily check this if you have access to a DSLR camera or an iPhone. These devices allow you to adjust the FPS so the videos can be recorded in slow motion.</p>
<p>For your convenience and learning, the step-by-step procedure on how to record a video in slow motion using an iPhone is explained below:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Get to the SLO-MO Mode</strong></p>
<p>Launch the <strong>Camera</strong> app on your iPhone (iPhone 13 Pro Max is used here for illustrations), and swipe the screen to the left to get to the <strong>SLO-MO</strong> mode.</p>

<p>Some natural phenomena such as a deer running in the woods, a balloon full of water bursting, etc. occur quite quickly. If you want to witness such things clearly and in detail, it would be good to record them, and then reduce the playback speed for better viewing.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Add Suspense</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When you add the slow-motion effect to a scene, the impulse of the audience is automatically increased, and they take that particular section more seriously and with a thrill.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The slow-motion effect is inversely proportional to the framerate, i.e., frames per second or FPS. Almost all DSLR cameras that are available nowadays allow you to switch between different FPS values (typically 120 and 240) before recording. Also, if you have access to an iPhone, its Camera app has a built-in SLO-MO mode that can capture the footage in slow motion.</p>
<p>In addition, if you already have a video that has been recorded at a normal speed, you can use an efficient post-production software like Wondershare Filmora 11, and exploit its Speed Ramping feature to add the slow-motion effect at different scenes of a clip.</p>

Usually, to have a video play at normal speed, it is recorded at 24 FPS or 30 FPS. On the other hand, if you increase the frame rate (FPS) to 120 or 240, the playback speed slows down. You can easily check this if you have access to a DSLR camera or an iPhone. These devices allow you to adjust the FPS so the videos can be recorded in slow motion.</p>
<p>For your convenience and learning, the step-by-step procedure on how to record a video in slow motion using an iPhone is explained below:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Get to the SLO-MO Mode</strong></p>
<p>Launch the <strong>Camera</strong> app on your iPhone (iPhone 13 Pro Max is used here for illustrations), and swipe the screen to the left to get to the <strong>SLO-MO</strong> mode.</p>

<p>Speed Ramping enables you to add the slow-motion effect at different parts of a video and even freeze the screen for the duration that you specify. The processes to get these done are given below in detail:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Add Source Video to Timeline and Get to the Speed Ramping Window</strong></p>
<p>Use the process given in the previous method to import a source video to Wondershare Filmora 11 and add it to the Timeline. Then use the process given in the second step of the previous method to get to the <strong>Speed Ramping</strong> window.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add Slow Motion Effect to Different Parts of the Clip</strong></p>
<p>Go to the <strong>Speed Ramping</strong> tab if it is not already selected, click <strong>Custom</strong> from the available options, and drag the adjustment points below the center line to reduce the playback speed for that particular section of the clip. Optionally, you can click any of the available presets to automatically add the slow-motion effect to the video.</p>
<p>Note: You can also drag the adjustment points above the line to increase the playback speed.</p>
<p>To add an adjustment point on the frame where it is not already present, place the playhead (skimmer) at the correct position, and click <strong>Add Adjust Point</strong> from the left of the <strong>Speed Ramping</strong> window itself. Once added, you can drag it downward to reduce the playback speed of that part of the clip.</p>

Some of the most common ones include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Add Focus</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If there is a particular scene in a clip that you want the audience to focus on, it would be a good idea to add the slow-motion effect right before that action appears on the screen, and bring the speed back to normal when the section is over.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Skill or Style Demonstration</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When a clip is playing at a normal speed, many times, the audience isn’t able to see the skills that you want to display. This is where you may want to add the slow-motion effect so that every detail can be noticed clearly and in detail.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Replays</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Mostly used for tournaments and matches where the actual action is to replayed so the audience, umpires, and other viewers can see the movements in detail before making the right decision.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Observation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Some natural phenomena such as a deer running in the woods, a balloon full of water bursting, etc. occur quite quickly. If you want to witness such things clearly and in detail, it would be good to record them, and then reduce the playback speed for better viewing.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Add Suspense</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When you add the slow-motion effect to a scene, the impulse of the audience is automatically increased, and they take that particular section more seriously and with a thrill.</p>

<p>Go to the <strong>Speed Ramping</strong> tab if it is not already selected, click <strong>Custom</strong> from the available options, and drag the adjustment points below the center line to reduce the playback speed for that particular section of the clip. Optionally, you can click any of the available presets to automatically add the slow-motion effect to the video.</p>
<p>Note: You can also drag the adjustment points above the line to increase the playback speed.</p>
<p>To add an adjustment point on the frame where it is not already present, place the playhead (skimmer) at the correct position, and click <strong>Add Adjust Point</strong> from the left of the <strong>Speed Ramping</strong> window itself. Once added, you can drag it downward to reduce the playback speed of that part of the clip.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Freeze the Video</strong></p>
<p>Place the skimmer on the frame where you want to freeze the video for a while, and click <strong>Add Freeze Frame</strong> from the left of the Speed Ramping window. When the time box appears, in the Freeze Time field, enter the duration in seconds you want to freeze the screen for, and click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="add freeze frame speed ramping filmora"
                ></p>
<p>After adding a freeze point, optionally, you can drag and reposition it in the <strong>Speed Ramping</strong> timeline as needed. Finally, click <strong>OK</strong> from the bottom-right area to save the changes.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-When-to-Use-Slow-Motion-3"><a href="#Part-3-When-to-Use-Slow-Motion-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: When to Use Slow Motion?"></a>Part 3: When to Use Slow Motion?</h2><p>There could be many instances when you want to add a slow-motion effect to your videos. Some of the most common ones include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Add Focus</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If there is a particular scene in a clip that you want the audience to focus on, it would be a good idea to add the slow-motion effect right before that action appears on the screen, and bring the speed back to normal when the section is over.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Skill or Style Demonstration</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When a clip is playing at a normal speed, many times, the audience isn’t able to see the skills that you want to display. This is where you may want to add the slow-motion effect so that every detail can be noticed clearly and in detail.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Replays</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Mostly used for tournaments and matches where the actual action is to replayed so the audience, umpires, and other viewers can see the movements in detail before making the right decision.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Observation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Some natural phenomena such as a deer running in the woods, a balloon full of water bursting, etc. occur quite quickly. If you want to witness such things clearly and in detail, it would be good to record them, and then reduce the playback speed for better viewing.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Add Suspense</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When you add the slow-motion effect to a scene, the impulse of the audience is automatically increased, and they take that particular section more seriously and with a thrill.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The slow-motion effect is inversely proportional to the framerate, i.e., frames per second or FPS. Almost all DSLR cameras that are available nowadays allow you to switch between different FPS values (typically 120 and 240) before recording. Also, if you have access to an iPhone, its Camera app has a built-in SLO-MO mode that can capture the footage in slow motion.</p>
<p>In addition, if you already have a video that has been recorded at a normal speed, you can use an efficient post-production software like Wondershare Filmora 11, and exploit its Speed Ramping feature to add the slow-motion effect at different scenes of a clip.</p>

This article will show you the multiple options you can get if you want to export your video in Filmora.</p>
<h2 id="Steps-to-export-your-video-with-Filmora"><a href="#Steps-to-export-your-video-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Steps to export your video with Filmora"></a>Steps to export your video with Filmora</h2><p>To open the export box, press “CTRL+E” on your keyboard. After that, you’ll see many export options you can do.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="open the export box"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Export Video Platform</strong></p>
<p>If you want your video to end up on YouTube, you can click on the “YouTube” option, sign in, and enter all the basic metadata you need for your YouTube video. Then you can click “Export”, and the video will go straight to YouTube. Also, you can have all of your privacy settings, descriptions, and everything else.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/export-video-in-filmora-2.jpg"
                      alt="export video platform"
                ></p>
<p>Similar to YouTube, you can do the same thing if you want to export your video on Vimeo.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/export-video-in-filmora-3.jpg"
                      alt="export your video on vimeo"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Export and Burn Video into DVD</strong></p>
<p>You can also directly burn your video to a DVD. Even though video to DVD isn’t as common as it used to be, it’s still nice to be able to do it, especially if you like making DVDs.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/export-video-in-filmora-4.jpg"
                      alt="export and burn video into dvd"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Export Video to Other Devices</strong></p>
<p>Go to the “Devices” option if you want to export your video to specific devices with everything looking good on that particular device. For instance, if you want to export your video to iPhone, you can see the size will be 41MB, and the resolution will be 1080p. All those things are going to look much better on an iPhone.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/export-video-in-filmora-5.jpg"
                      alt="export video to other devices"
                ></p>
<p>You can also adjust the quality of your video based on your needs by clicking on “Setting.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/export-video-in-filmora-6.jpg"
                      alt="adjust the quality of video"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Export Videos in High Res Quality</strong></p>
<p>In the “Format” option you can choose the file extension, the format, or the codec. Exporting your video based on format is good if you prefer to save your video on your computer since maybe you may upload your video on YouTube, Instagram or other social media platforms.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/export-video-in-filmora-7.jpg"
                      alt="export videos in high res quality"
                ></p>
<p>You can choose “Apple Prores” if you want the least amount of compression possible and don’t care about the file size. For example, if you want to export a video from Filmora and then import it into another video editor without losing too much quality, you should definitely choose “Apple Prores.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/export-video-in-filmora-8.jpg"
                      alt="choose apple prores"
                ></p>
<p>Before exporting, there is the option to upload to the cloud. If you do not know what it is, Wondershare has its own Drive, which allows you to save and remotely view your video files.</p>
<p>In the meantime, if you have a decent PC, you can enable “Hardware acceleration for video encoding.” This option will utilize as much computer power as you have to export the video and make the process significantly faster. Once everything is finished, click “Export.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/export-video-in-filmora-9.jpg"
                      alt="click export"
                ></p>
<p>When you click Export, you can see the progress with thumbnails and everything. Lastly, your video has been exported successfully when the exporting process reaches 100%.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="finish exporting video"
                ></p>
<h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>Indeed, there are many options to export your video using Filmora. If you wish to export your video directly to YouTube, simply select the YouTube option in the Export box. Meanwhile, if you want to export your video on your computer and upload it to various social media platforms, it’s much better to export it with a format option.</p>
