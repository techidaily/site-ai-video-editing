There’s a Better Solution Waiting for You Inside</h2><p>So you have captured some mind-blowing clips and want to join them together to make an excellent movie? But, sadly, you are still stuck because you are not sure what video editors would be suitable to complete this task fast.</p>
<p>If such miseries are haunting you, take a deep breath because many like you are searching for the right video merging tools. However, some people recommend using HandBrake for merging clips. So let’s dig some ground to know if the software can really combine clips. And if there’s a “Yes”? Then <strong>how to merge videos in HandBrake</strong>?</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-HandBrake"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-HandBrake" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is HandBrake?"></a>Part 1: What is HandBrake?</h2><p>Before you gear up for HandBrake to merge videos, it would be wise to know a few essential details about this software.</p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://handbrake.fr/" >HandBrake <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a free tool for Windows, Linux, and MAC operating systems. The basic purpose of this software is to convert videos from any format in MKV, WebM, and MP4. It is an open-source program that allows users to convert their videos to play them on multiple devices, such as TV media players, computers, tablets, mobile phones, etc.</p>
<p>Moreover, this platform gives you the power to turn your low-quality videos into high-quality screen time. That is why most professional videographers use this tool to polish videos captured with old cameras.</p>
<p>A few more interesting features of HandBrake are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Combing artifacts removal due to interlacing</li>
<li>Convert videos without negatively affecting the audio quality</li>
<li>Volume and range adjustment</li>
<li>Addition, removal, and preservation of soft subtitles</li>
</ul>
<p>However, one vital thing to understand is that although HandBrake takes a tiny little space of your hard drive, the interface is complicated for beginners.</p>

<h2 id="Part-2-Using-HandBrake-to-Merge-Videos-–-Possible-or-Not"><a href="#Part-2-Using-HandBrake-to-Merge-Videos-–-Possible-or-Not" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Using HandBrake to Merge Videos – Possible or Not?"></a>Part 2: Using HandBrake to Merge Videos – Possible or Not?</h2><p>There is a great misconception about HandBrake among the newbies that HandBrake is primarily a video merger software. But, in reality, that is not true at all. Or, at least, the latest HandBrake version 1.5.1 lacks such features.</p>
<p>Even the official website states that <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://handbrake.fr/docs/en/latest/introduction/about.html#:~:text=does%20not%20do-,HandBrake%20does%20not%3A,video%20clips%20into%20one,-Pass-through%20video" >HandBrake cannot combine <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> two or more clips to make them whole.</p>
<p>So feel yourself lucky to read this article if you haven’t downloaded HandBrake yet. Congratulations! You are saved from another heartbreak.</p>
<p>But wait! If the software is not meant to merge clips, it doesn’t mean that you can’t use it to prepare your videos for the real deal. HandBrake can still be a helpful tool, permitting you to convert videos in a similar format before you start merging them on any other video editor.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you have two video clips in different formats. In that case, you can use HandBrake to convert all of them in a similar format so that they can be easily be merged when imported on any video merger tool.</p>
<p>But, again, the question is, if not HandBrake, then what?</p>
<p>Frankly, you will find hundreds of video editing tools with a combining clips feature, but not all of them deserve your attention and time. While software like DaVinci Resolve includes characteristics to merge two or more clips in a single shot, beginners and mid-level users may still find them a bit difficult at the start.</p>
<p>That is why professionals and experts prefer Filmora by Wondershare to merge videos without banging their heads on the screen.</p>
<p>So, how to merge videos in Filmora with simple clicks? Focus on the next part of the article to learn the step-by-step method within a few minutes.</p>

<p>For macOS 10.14 or later</p>
<p>Now, without any more delay, let’s start learning how to combine videos in Filmora through the following steps.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Install Filmora on Your Computer</strong></p>
<p>Just visit <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora’s website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to download the latest version of the software for your Windows or MAC.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-2.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>
<p>After downloading the software on your computer, install it. Once the software is ready, double-click the “Wondershare Filmora” icon (it should be on your desktop screen) to open the program.</p>
<p>As you can see, the interface is simple with user-friendly options.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-3.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Import Multiple Videos in Filmora</strong></p>
<p>Click on the blue icon with a “+” sign to import videos.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-4.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>
<p>Or, click on the “File” button on the top menu to import files and drag and drop both clips to the same timeline.</p>
<p>As you can see, there are two clips on the timeline. The first clip is called “Cherry Blossom,” and the second clip’s name is “Plating Food.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-5.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Keep Video Clips on the Same Timeline</strong></p>
<p>There shouldn’t be any gap or spaces between the two clips.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-6.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>
<p>It is because gaps will create a dark blank space between the clips when you export the clips, like this:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-7.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>
<p>Therefore, slide the second video right next to the first video without leaving any gaps with your mouse.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-8.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>
<p>And guess what? You have already merged the two clips.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Save Video on Your PC</strong></p>
<p>Now, hit the “Export” button and save the merged video on your computer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-9.jpeg"

<p><img

                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-2.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>
<p>After downloading the software on your computer, install it. Once the software is ready, double-click the “Wondershare Filmora” icon (it should be on your desktop screen) to open the program.</p>
<p>As you can see, the interface is simple with user-friendly options.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-3.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Import Multiple Videos in Filmora</strong></p>
<p>Click on the blue icon with a “+” sign to import videos.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-4.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>
<p>Or, click on the “File” button on the top menu to import files and drag and drop both clips to the same timeline.</p>
<p>As you can see, there are two clips on the timeline. The first clip is called “Cherry Blossom,” and the second clip’s name is “Plating Food.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-5.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Keep Video Clips on the Same Timeline</strong></p>
<p>There shouldn’t be any gap or spaces between the two clips.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-6.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>
<p>It is because gaps will create a dark blank space between the clips when you export the clips, like this:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-7.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>
<p>Therefore, slide the second video right next to the first video without leaving any gaps with your mouse.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-video-handbrake-8.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-video-handbrake-"
                ></p>
<p>And guess what? You have already merged the two clips.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Save Video on Your PC</strong></p>
<p>Now, hit the “Export” button and save the merged video on your computer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-HandBrake-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-HandBrake-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is HandBrake?"></a>Part 1: What is HandBrake?</h2><p>Before you gear up for HandBrake to merge videos, it would be wise to know a few essential details about this software.</p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://handbrake.fr/" >HandBrake <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a free tool for Windows, Linux, and MAC operating systems. The basic purpose of this software is to convert videos from any format in MKV, WebM, and MP4. It is an open-source program that allows users to convert their videos to play them on multiple devices, such as TV media players, computers, tablets, mobile phones, etc.</p>
<p>Moreover, this platform gives you the power to turn your low-quality videos into high-quality screen time. That is why most professional videographers use this tool to polish videos captured with old cameras.</p>
<p>A few more interesting features of HandBrake are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Combing artifacts removal due to interlacing</li>
<li>Convert videos without negatively affecting the audio quality</li>
<li>Volume and range adjustment</li>
<li>Addition, removal, and preservation of soft subtitles</li>
</ul>
<p>However, one vital thing to understand is that although HandBrake takes a tiny little space of your hard drive, the interface is complicated for beginners.</p>
<p><img

<h2 id="Part-2-Using-HandBrake-to-Merge-Videos-–-Possible-or-Not-3"><a href="#Part-2-Using-HandBrake-to-Merge-Videos-–-Possible-or-Not-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Using HandBrake to Merge Videos – Possible or Not?"></a>Part 2: Using HandBrake to Merge Videos – Possible or Not?</h2><p>There is a great misconception about HandBrake among the newbies that HandBrake is primarily a video merger software. But, in reality, that is not true at all. Or, at least, the latest HandBrake version 1.5.1 lacks such features.</p>
<p>Even the official website states that <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://handbrake.fr/docs/en/latest/introduction/about.html#:~:text=does%20not%20do-,HandBrake%20does%20not%3A,video%20clips%20into%20one,-Pass-through%20video" >HandBrake cannot combine <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> two or more clips to make them whole.</p>
<p>So feel yourself lucky to read this article if you haven’t downloaded HandBrake yet. Congratulations! You are saved from another heartbreak.</p>
<p>But wait! If the software is not meant to merge clips, it doesn’t mean that you can’t use it to prepare your videos for the real deal. HandBrake can still be a helpful tool, permitting you to convert videos in a similar format before you start merging them on any other video editor.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you have two video clips in different formats. In that case, you can use HandBrake to convert all of them in a similar format so that they can be easily be merged when imported on any video merger tool.</p>
<p>But, again, the question is, if not HandBrake, then what?</p>
<p>Frankly, you will find hundreds of video editing tools with a combining clips feature, but not all of them deserve your attention and time. While software like DaVinci Resolve includes characteristics to merge two or more clips in a single shot, beginners and mid-level users may still find them a bit difficult at the start.</p>
<p>That is why professionals and experts prefer Filmora by Wondershare to merge videos without banging their heads on the screen.</p>
<p>So, how to merge videos in Filmora with simple clicks? Focus on the next part of the article to learn the step-by-step method within a few minutes.</p>

                      alt="default title filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3</p>
<p>Now, double-click on the Default Title clip. Here, change its font to any bold font. Increase the text size to 120. Type in your text in the box. Scroll a bit down and change the <strong>Text Spacing</strong> to <strong>8.</strong> Click <strong>OK.</strong></p>

                      alt="take snapshot filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5</p>
<p>Double-click on the Default Title clip once again. This time, click on its <strong>Advanced</strong> settings. Here, turn OFF <strong>Text Fill →</strong> turn ON <strong>Outline →</strong> change the Outline color to <strong>White →</strong> reduce <strong>Thickness</strong> to <strong>1.</strong> Click <strong>OK.</strong> Now, take another Snapshot.</p>

<p>Step 6</p>
<p>Delete the Default Title clip from the Timeline. Now, drag the Outline snapshot that we just created to the Timeline. Open the <strong>Crop</strong> tool <strong>→</strong> change the Ratio to <strong>Custom</strong> <strong>→</strong> replace “<strong>1080</strong>” with “<strong>540</strong>”.

                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/default.png"
                      alt="default title filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3</p>
<p>Now, double-click on the Default Title clip. Here, change its font to any bold font. Increase the text size to 120. Type in your text in the box. Scroll a bit down and change the <strong>Text Spacing</strong> to <strong>8.</strong> Click <strong>OK.</strong></p>

                      alt="edit text"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4</p>
<p>Take a Snapshot of this Default Title.</p>

                      alt="take snapshot filmora"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5</p>
<p>Double-click on the Default Title clip once again. This time, click on its <strong>Advanced</strong> settings. Here, turn OFF <strong>Text Fill →</strong> turn ON <strong>Outline →</strong> change the Outline color to <strong>White →</strong> reduce <strong>Thickness</strong> to <strong>1.</strong> Click <strong>OK.</strong> Now, take another Snapshot.</p>

                      alt="advanced title settings"
                ></p>
<p>Step 6</p>
<p>Delete the Default Title clip from the Timeline. Now, drag the Outline snapshot that we just created to the Timeline. Open the <strong>Crop</strong> tool <strong>→</strong> change the Ratio to <strong>Custom</strong> <strong>→</strong> replace “<strong>1080</strong>” with “<strong>540</strong>”. Lastly, move the highlighted crop section to the top. Click <strong>OK.</strong></p>

<p>Step 8</p>
<p>Next, click on the <strong>Crop</strong> tool again and simply move the highlighted crop section to the bottom part of the screen. Click <strong>OK.</strong> Then, double-click on the snapshot clip in the Timeline and change the value of the <strong>Y-axis</strong> from “275” to “<strong>-275</strong>”**.** Click <strong>OK.</strong> Take a Snapshot again.</p>
<p>Step 9</p>
<p>Import a background image to <strong>My Media.</strong> Drag the background image to the Timeline. Double-click on it and drag the <strong>Scale</strong> bar until the background image covers the whole screen. Click <strong>OK.</strong> You should cut the background clip to make it 3 seconds long as well.</p>

Learn the Easy Steps to Setup DIY Green Screen, Shoot the Video and Edit It Out to Add Green Screen Effects"></a>Wondering if You Can Make DIY Green Screen Video for Streaming? Learn the Easy Steps to Setup DIY Green Screen, Shoot the Video and Edit It Out to Add Green Screen Effects</h2><p>No matter how big the budget of a Hollywood movie is, at the end of the day, it has to rely on the humble green screens for special video effects. The stunning studios from where your favorite YouTubers and gamers stream their videos are graphical video effects created through green screens. Even the studios that you see on TV channels are a graphical creation of green screens. You must be wondering how they could achieve such awesome graphics with a simple green screen.</p>
<p>All you need is a good-quality green fabric, a professional video editing software, and a camera. You may not believe it, but that is all you need for creating DIY green screen video effect. You do not have to be a professional video editor to edit the green screen on your videos and add any special video effect. In this article, you will learn how to create your own DIY green backdrop.</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-Green-Screen-Technique"><a href="#What-Is-Green-Screen-Technique" class="headerlink" title="What Is Green Screen Technique?"></a>What Is Green Screen Technique?</h2><p>A green screen is nothing but a green fabric. In a video, a green screen is placed in the background behind the subject. In the editing phase of the video, the green screen is replaced with any background image or video effect that stays intact in the video as long as possible. In short, the green screen technique involves superimposing photos and videos on the green screen in a video.</p>
<p>Starting from the video game industry, movie industry to video streaming and TV channels, the green screen technique is used everywhere. The stunning graphical component of these industries is totally dependent on the green screen technique. In fact, DIY green screen for zoom meetings and video conferencing is widely used. Along with that, YouTubers and Twitch streamers use DIY green screen for streaming live.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, instead of a green screen, you can use any other color of screen. However, green screens are widely used, and it has become a norm. The main point to remember when using a green screen is that nothing else should have green color such as the dresses the subject is wearing. Therefore, in technical terms, the green screen is referred to as Chroma Key, and you will find Chroma Key option instead of green screen in most video editors.</p>
<h2 id="Why-Use-Green-Screen-Technique"><a href="#Why-Use-Green-Screen-Technique" class="headerlink" title="Why Use Green Screen Technique?"></a>Why Use Green Screen Technique?</h2><p>The main reason why the green screen technique is used in movie and video making is that the video editor can replace the entire background at once instead of replacing the background frame by frame. Once you replace a green screen with an image or video effect, it stays the same throughout the video as long as required.</p>
<p>Therefore, the video editor can save a lot of time in editing and the editing stays uniform throughout which gives a realistic effect. If the green screen technique is not used and editing is done frame by frame of a video, there could be a manual error, inconsistent, and graphical glitches.</p>
<p>You can replace green screens with anything you want. It could be a still image of a beautiful studio with 3D effect like you see in case of YouTubers and gamers. It could be a moving, real-life landscape on any place in the world instead of a beautiful background picture. Similarly, it could be replaced by video effects such as explosions, stadiums full of people, battlefields, and likewise. At times, it could be live animations as you see on TV channels.</p>
<h2 id="How-To-Create-DIY-Green-Screen-Stand-Setup-and-Add-Green-Screen-Effect"><a href="#How-To-Create-DIY-Green-Screen-Stand-Setup-and-Add-Green-Screen-Effect" class="headerlink" title="How To Create DIY Green Screen Stand Setup and Add Green Screen Effect?"></a>How To Create DIY Green Screen Stand Setup and Add Green Screen Effect?</h2><p>If you want to have a green screen setup for your video, you need to have the following things ready.</p>
<ul>
<li>A green cloth that is large enough to cover the entire background.</li>
<li>A video editing software to replace green screen in your video with anything.</li>
<li>External light for more video clarity and a good camera with mic.</li>
</ul>
<p>Step 1: Setup DIY Green Backdrop</p>
<p>Your green fabric should be soft and bright. If you are going to be the subject of the video, make sure you are not wearing anything green. Moreover, do not keep any object within the video frame that is green in color. If there are too many green objects, you can use a blue screen.</p>
<p>When it comes to hanging the green cloth in the background, people find it very difficult. If your video frame is going to be a close-up to the subject, you can use a green screen panel to hang green cloth. A green screen panel generally has a collapsible structure for easy storage and transportation.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you need to install hooks in the wall if you are planning to replace the green screen with a studio-like scene so that the entire background of the video frame stays covered with green screen. You should opt for multiple green screens and stitch them together to cover the background completely.</p>
<p>Step 2: Setup Camera and Light</p>
<p>Whether you are shooting with a DSLR camera or smartphone camera or webcam, make sure you are shooting at least HD video quality so that the editing could be great. Lights are important when you are using green screen though they are not a necessity. The video quality and brightness get enhanced with lights. Diffused lights work the best and the background should be well-lit.</p>
<p>Most importantly, you have to place the lights in such a way that your body arms should not be casting any shadow on the green screen. You can either stand very close to the green screen or away from the green screen so that your shadow does not go till the green screen. Instead of starting to shoot the video from the very beginning, you should capture for a few seconds and make sure everything is perfect including the camera angle.</p>
<p>Step 3: Get The Best Video Editor For Green Screen Effect</p>
<p>There are various video editors available, but not all of them are suitable for green screen effect. We recommend Wondershare Filmora as the best video editor to apply green screen effects on your video while editing.
