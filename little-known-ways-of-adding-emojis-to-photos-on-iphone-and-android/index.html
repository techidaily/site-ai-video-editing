<li>First, you should have the skill to <strong>read</strong> the room and the mood.</li>
<li>If you start telling a story about <strong>yourself</strong> that has no relation to the topic whatsoever will only lead to the guest being annoyed.</li>
<li>You may have <strong>called</strong> the <strong>guest</strong> for a reason. This reason should tally with your topic as it will make you ask about their experience.</li>
<li>Asking the right questions is important.</li>
<li>You’d better not begin with leading statements such as, <strong>“Obi-wan Kenobi is a good TV show.”</strong> the guest may simply reply, <strong>“I do not care.”</strong></li>
<li>You should approach with question statements such as, <strong>“Did you know that your son is a big fan of the Obi-wan Kenobi TV show.”</strong> These are <strong>indulging</strong> questions to help your audience be more involved in your podcasts.</li>
</ul>
<p>The audience and the guest will also develop an interest in the conversation that will lead to a successful show for the day.</p>
