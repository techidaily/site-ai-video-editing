The following are some of the most frequently encountered issues when using KMPlayer to rotate video.</p>
<ul>
<li>After rotating a video, the video appears without a black bar, which may be irritating to some of you who are used to seeing black bars. In addition, there is no workaround for this because it is the default setting of the software.</li>
<li>You may occasionally receive an error message such as “class not registered,” which will cause your videos to be closed while you are watching them.</li>
<li>Additionally, the screen may turn blue.</li>
<li>The message “Login required” appears from time to time, which is a source of considerable irritation.</li>
<li>It is also not uncommon to see that some portions of a media file are able to run while other portions of the same media file are unable to run.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we talk about reliable and affordable alternatives to KM Player, Wonder Share Filmora is the best alternative for rotating videos.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that it is one of the most user-friendly pieces of software currently available, this video spinning software achieves its goal without sacrificing image quality in the process. People with little or no experience in video creation, on the other hand, will find the Filmora video editing application to be a simple and straightforward tool that anyone can use.</p>
<p>Users have been experiencing difficulties while editing films on the platform, according to the company, and the most recent update to Filmora includes a new manual rotation option in the video editing interface, which the company claims will alleviate this issue.</p>

In the Netflix series Stranger Things, there is an opposite version of our world called the Upside Down. The Upside Down is dark, creepy, and possibly filled with aliens, monsters, creatures, and other things.</p>
<p>Now, you can also apply the Stranger Things Upside Down Effect to your video! This effect combines camera tricks and video editing within <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to transition from the normal world into the Upside Down.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Guide"><a href="#How-to-Guide" class="headerlink" title="How-to Guide"></a>How-to Guide</h2><p><em><strong>1) Preparation</strong></em></p>
<p>To make this effect, you will need two footage shots: one with the camera moving down and one with the camera coming back up.</p>
<p>When shooting for the footage, follow the steps below:</p>
<p><strong>First shot</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Find any item close enough to the ground that we can block our frame with.</li>
</ol>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-1.jpg"
                      alt="block our frame with item"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li>Once you have your talent lined up, rotate your camera while lowering it below the foreground item at a constant speed and leaving the camera there. The key is making sure when you go behind the object, the frame is nothing but black.</li>
</ol>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-2.gif"
                      alt="rotate your camera"
                ></p>
<p>For the next scene, have your actor change positions, or you can change the set around to look like the Upside Down. For instance, adding fake plants and flickering lights.</p>
<p><strong>Second shot</strong></p>
<p>Start bringing your camera back up at the same speed and rotate it again in the direction it was moving.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="start bringing your camera back up"
                ></p>
<p><em><strong>2) Steps</strong></em></p>
<p>After you have all the footage, you can start editing it on Filmora. If you haven’t installed it yet, you can download Filmora at their official website at <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/" >https://filmora.wondershare.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>

<p>Now, launch Filmora on your PC and follow the steps below:</p>
<p>Step1 Take your first clip in the “normal” world and drag it down to a video track on the timeline. Trim the edge of the clip, so it ends on pure black and in a downward motion.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-4.jpg"
                      alt="trim the edge of the clip"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Drag the second clip (in the Upside Down) onto the video track on the timeline after the first clip. Trim this video, so it begins in pure black and an upward motion.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-5.jpg"
                      alt="trim video"
                ></p>
<p>Cut the clips to get the timing right since it should be a very fast transition. You can cut in the black frames so they won’t be too apparent.</p>
<p>If you don’t have a perfectly smooth transition, you can add a dissolve by going to <strong>Transitions &gt; Basic &gt; Dissolve</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-6.jpg"
                      alt="cut the clips"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Color Grading and Effects</strong></p>
<p>After the transition, you can make the clip look a lot more like the Upside Down from the show with a color grade and Filmora effects. Follow the steps below:</p>
<p>Step1 Double-click on your second clip, then go to <strong>Color &gt; Advanced</strong>. For a quick edit, you can try one of the presets available, such as “cool film.” It will give you the colder blue tones that Stranger Things used for the Upside Down.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-7.jpg"
                      alt="go to color"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 You can further edit the color grading in the white balance menu. Drag the slider to the left to get a blue, cold vibe for the Upside Down.</p>
<p>The “cool” or “warm” color grading technically talks about color temperature. A “warmer” look will be more orange, and a “colder” look will be bluer. You can also use the tint slider to fine-tune the look.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-8.gif"
                      alt="further edit the color grading"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 Next, move down to the color, lower the brightness and increase contrast. It makes the scene darker and more sinister than the normal world.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-9.jpg"
                      alt="move down to the color"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 Finally, go down to the vignette and drag the amount slider a tiny bit to give a Vinnette around your clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-10.jpg"
                      alt="go down to the vignette"
                ></p>
<p><em><strong>3) Pro Tips</strong></em></p>
<p>You can still make your clip look even more like Upside Down with some Filmora elements.</p>
<p>Go to <strong>Elements &gt; Smoke &gt; Smokescreen 2</strong>. Drag this element on top of your Upside Down clip and trim it, so it starts at the same time the clip leaves the black frame.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/upside-down-effect-11.jpg"
                      alt="drag this element on top of your upside down clip"
                ></p>
<p>You can adjust the opacity by double-clicking the smoke effect to open the setting.</p>
<p>Finally, go to the <strong>Transition &gt; Basic &gt; Dissolve</strong> to the start of the smoke and adjust it when the smoke gradually appears.</p>

<h2 id="Resources-from-Filmostock"><a href="#Resources-from-Filmostock" class="headerlink" title="Resources from Filmostock"></a>Resources from Filmostock</h2><p>You can also use filmstock effects to bring our video to the next level.

                      alt="go to elements"
                ></p>
<p>Double-click the clip and change the scale of the effect to your needs. Then, go to compositing to change the blending mode to the screen to help the effect blend in more.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Now, go to color and open the white balance menu. Drag the two sliders to change the color of the particles to match your clip.</p>

<p>The “cool” or “warm” color grading technically talks about color temperature. A “warmer” look will be more orange, and a “colder” look will be bluer. You can also use the tint slider to fine-tune the look.</p>

<p><em><strong>3) Pro Tips</strong></em></p>
<p>You can still make your clip look even more like Upside Down with some Filmora elements.</p>
<p>Go to <strong>Elements &gt; Smoke &gt; Smokescreen 2</strong>. Drag this element on top of your Upside Down clip and trim it, so it starts at the same time the clip leaves the black frame.</p>

<p>You can adjust the opacity by double-clicking the smoke effect to open the setting.</p>
<p>Finally, go to the <strong>Transition &gt; Basic &gt; Dissolve</strong> to the start of the smoke and adjust it when the smoke gradually appears.</p>
