<p>In terms of video editing, Adobe Premiere Pro is one of the most powerful applications on the market, and it’s well-known for its versatility. Speeding up movies is one of the program’s many features required for the insertion of special effects and transitions. A lot of ways are there for you to pick from while using premiere pro to speed up the film as desired.</p>

<p>You can’t overwrite or replace your media files by doing anything in Premiere Pro, which means that nothing you do will have an effect on your media files. The point remains: a copy of your project and all its media assets should always be kept on hand just in case.</p>
<p>Adobe Premiere Pro is an excellent editing tool in terms of its functionality and capabilities. Still, it has a steep hill to climb that makes it difficult for newbies and users without previous editing experience. To get the most out of Adobe Premiere Pro, one must thoroughly understand the product.</p>

<p>No need to worry, folks; as in this article, we will be looking at how we can alter premiere pro speed.</p>
<h2 id="Fast-Forward-or-Speed-up-Playback-Speed-in-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#Fast-Forward-or-Speed-up-Playback-Speed-in-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Fast Forward or Speed up Playback Speed in Premiere Pro"></a>Fast Forward or Speed up Playback Speed in Premiere Pro</h2><p>On analog editing systems, the speed of film could permanently be altered; but, because of the limitations of the technology, if you slowed anything down too much, the frame rate at which it was taken may become evident, and the image quality would begin to suffer as a consequence.</p>
<p>Adobe Premiere Pro is a feature-rich and professional video editor designed for the Macintosh platform. It has a variety of editing features built-in. Adobe Premiere Pro lets you change and control the speed at which movies are played back.</p>
<p>Premiere provides three choices for adjusting the tempo of a movie or speeding it up. We’ll go over them one by one as we scroll down the page.</p>

                      alt="Speed up the film in premiere pro"
                ></p>
<h3 id="Method-1"><a href="#Method-1" class="headerlink" title="Method 1"></a>Method 1</h3><ul>
<li>Download and Install Adobe Premiere Pro. Launch the application on your system.</li>
<li>Once you’ve set up a new project in Adobe Premiere Pro, import the video you want to edit.</li>
<li>In order to place the video where you want it, drag the necessary video clips into the timeline. In the end, you’ll have a new series to call your own.</li>
<li>Using the right-click menu, you may choose the whole movie or only a portion of it that you wish to edit.</li>
<li>The popup dialog box will display if you choose Speed&#x2F;Duration from the context menu list.</li>
<li>Choose Clip&gt; Speed Duration instead from the program’s drop-down menu.</li>
<li>The Speed field should be raised, and then the OK button should be pressed to accept the change.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Method-2-Rate-Stretch-Tool"><a href="#Method-2-Rate-Stretch-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Rate Stretch Tool"></a>Method 2: Rate Stretch Tool</h3><p>Adobe Premiere Pro has a Rate Stretch feature that lets you manually alter the movie’s tempo by sliding the trim bar along the timeline. To utilize the Rate Stretch tool to speed up a video clip, you must first divide the movie into pieces.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick method for altering the video speed so that it fits under the time limit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch the application on your respective systems.</li>
<li>Drag and drop the selected video onto the timeline in Premiere Pro.</li>
<li>Then, choose the Ripple Edit Tool from the toolbar, followed by the Rate Stretch Tool by clicking and holding the Ripple Edit Tool. Click the Rate Stretch button on the timeline’s left side to begin a timer.</li>
<li>You may also use the R key on your keyboard to activate the Rate Stretch Tool, which is a shortcut key.</li>
<li>Drag the video’s start and endpoints to their respective ends on the right and left sides to prolong or reduce the duration. As a consequence, the video speed will be improved. The bigger the period of time the video is dragged inwards, the faster it rises.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Method-3-Time-Remapping-Tool"><a href="#Method-3-Time-Remapping-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Time Remapping Tool"></a>Method 3: Time Remapping Tool</h3><p>In Adobe Premiere Pro, the time remapping tool is where you go to speed up a selected video section. With a video clip, this function may be utilized to create the illusion of speed and slowness.</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s time to fire up Adobe Premiere Pro and start fiddling with your footage.</li>
<li>Simply right-click on it to bring up the context menu, and then choose Show Clip Keyframes from the display list. Afterward, choose Time Remapping from the context menu that opens.</li>
<li>Click on it to make it go faster. The video will be colored blue, and a horizontal rubber band line will be drawn down its center if this option is selected. One of the video’s frame rate lines may be found here.</li>
<li>A white speed-control track may be seen just below the title bar in the upper part of the video. If you can’t see it well when zooming in, you may try again. The rubber band may be dragged higher in Premiere Pro to speed up the video.</li>
</ul>
<p>The tooltip will show how long it has been since the change happened compared to the original speed. As the movie progresses, so does the speed at which it is shown, and the duration of the video fluctuates as well. The audio remains unaltered and tied to the video when using Time Remapping.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Slow-Down-A-Video-in-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#How-to-Slow-Down-A-Video-in-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="How to Slow Down A Video in Premiere Pro?"></a>How to Slow Down A Video in Premiere Pro?</h2><p>Now, let’s discuss how to slow down a video in premiere pro</p>
<h3 id="Time-stretch"><a href="#Time-stretch" class="headerlink" title="Time stretch"></a>Time stretch</h3><p>A one-second video clip at 60 frames per second is an example of this situation. When the game is being played at a reasonable speed on any given platform or software, 60 frames will be shown. Because of this, each frame will take twice as long to play at a 0.5X slower pace.</p>
<p>To put it another way, you’d see 30 frames in a second that weren’t repeated. A second has been added to the video’s duration, which will now be 2 seconds instead of 1. There will be no deterioration in quality in this situation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new project in Premiere Pro on your PC.</li>
<li>To import a video file, choose Import from the File menu at the top of the screen. After that, drag the video into either the timeline or the project panel, whichever you like.</li>
<li>Right-clicking and choosing the Duration&#x2F;Speed option causes the video to begin playing.</li>
<li>This stage necessitates a decrease in speed from 100% to a lower percentage.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Using-Keyframes"><a href="#Using-Keyframes" class="headerlink" title="Using Keyframes"></a>Using Keyframes</h3><p>When you attempt to slow down a video by adjusting the frame rate, you are essentially eliminating frames from the video stream. This procedure will allow you to slow down a movie to your desired speed without sacrificing quality.</p>
<ul>
<li>After downloading and installing Adobe Premiere Pro, the first step is to launch the program. Later, you’ll need to choose a specific video that you’d want to have slowed down.</li>
<li>After you’ve chosen it, you may upload it to Premiere Pro. After importing the video, you must drag and drop it into the timeline in Premiere.</li>
<li>By right-clicking the mouse, choose Modify &gt; Interpret from the drop-down menu.</li>
<li>You’ll need to make some changes to the frame information now. Hit the Assume this frame rate button and input a value that is lower than the original video frame rate.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Utlizing-Time-Remapping"><a href="#Utlizing-Time-Remapping" class="headerlink" title="Utlizing Time Remapping"></a>Utlizing Time Remapping</h3><p>The remapping tool is a very common tool for creating slow-motion videos. It may be found in many video editing programs. It gives you the option of selecting a particular section of a video clip and then slowing down the video clip.</p>
<ul>
<li>Launching Adobe Premiere Pro is the initial step once it has been downloaded and installed on your computer. A particular video that you’d want slow-motioned will need to be selected later on in the process.</li>
<li>After dragging the video to the timeline, you’ll need to choose the area of the movie that you want to slow down.</li>
<li>Now you must choose the Key Frames and Speed from your video by clicking on the video’s right-click menu.</li>
<li>Only the “Pen Tool” must be used to lock the specific region you wish to slow down in order to push the Speed Line through the Selection tool to slow down the video during this phase.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Why-Is-Premiere-Pro-Playback-Fast"><a href="#Why-Is-Premiere-Pro-Playback-Fast" class="headerlink" title="Why Is Premiere Pro Playback Fast?"></a>Why Is Premiere Pro Playback Fast?</h2><p>If this issue arises in your program, you’ll notice choppy playback, a character that speaks too rapidly, and audio that skips frames in the narration.</p>
<p>The multimedia editor Premiere Pro is one of the best currently available on the market. In addition to creating YouTube videos, feature films, music videos, and other sorts of content, many professionals turn to it.</p>
<p>It is said that Adobe Premiere Pro suffers from a playback issue. It has the ability to make the video creation process more complicated and demanding than it should be. Let me show you how to fix this easy error in just two simple steps.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start the program on your computer’s operating system.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select Edit from the drop-down menu.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Look towards preference</p>
</li>
<li><p>Afterward, choose audio hardware.</p>
</li>
<li><p>No input should be used as the default input, regardless of what it is currently set to.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When you click on Playback your film, you will notice that the issue has been rectified.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>In terms of video editing, Adobe Premiere Pro is one of the most powerful applications on the market, and it’s well-known for its versatility. Speeding up movies is one of the program’s many features required for the insertion of special effects and transitions. A lot of ways are there for you to pick from while using premiere pro to speed up the film as desired.</p>

<p>You can’t overwrite or replace your media files by doing anything in Premiere Pro, which means that nothing you do will have an effect on your media files. The point remains: a copy of your project and all its media assets should always be kept on hand just in case.</p>
<p>Adobe Premiere Pro is an excellent editing tool in terms of its functionality and capabilities. Still, it has a steep hill to climb that makes it difficult for newbies and users without previous editing experience. To get the most out of Adobe Premiere Pro, one must thoroughly understand the product.</p>

<p>No need to worry, folks; as in this article, we will be looking at how we can alter premiere pro speed.</p>
<h2 id="Fast-Forward-or-Speed-up-Playback-Speed-in-Premiere-Pro-1"><a href="#Fast-Forward-or-Speed-up-Playback-Speed-in-Premiere-Pro-1" class="headerlink" title="Fast Forward or Speed up Playback Speed in Premiere Pro"></a>Fast Forward or Speed up Playback Speed in Premiere Pro</h2><p>On analog editing systems, the speed of film could permanently be altered; but, because of the limitations of the technology, if you slowed anything down too much, the frame rate at which it was taken may become evident, and the image quality would begin to suffer as a consequence.</p>
<p>Adobe Premiere Pro is a feature-rich and professional video editor designed for the Macintosh platform. It has a variety of editing features built-in. Adobe Premiere Pro lets you change and control the speed at which movies are played back.</p>
<p>Premiere provides three choices for adjusting the tempo of a movie or speeding it up. We’ll go over them one by one as we scroll down the page.</p>

                      alt="Speed up the film in premiere pro"
                ></p>
<h3 id="Method-1-1"><a href="#Method-1-1" class="headerlink" title="Method 1"></a>Method 1</h3><ul>
<li>Download and Install Adobe Premiere Pro. Launch the application on your system.</li>
<li>Once you’ve set up a new project in Adobe Premiere Pro, import the video you want to edit.</li>
<li>In order to place the video where you want it, drag the necessary video clips into the timeline. In the end, you’ll have a new series to call your own.</li>
<li>Using the right-click menu, you may choose the whole movie or only a portion of it that you wish to edit.</li>
<li>The popup dialog box will display if you choose Speed&#x2F;Duration from the context menu list.</li>
<li>Choose Clip&gt; Speed Duration instead from the program’s drop-down menu.</li>
<li>The Speed field should be raised, and then the OK button should be pressed to accept the change.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Method-2-Rate-Stretch-Tool-1"><a href="#Method-2-Rate-Stretch-Tool-1" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Rate Stretch Tool"></a>Method 2: Rate Stretch Tool</h3><p>Adobe Premiere Pro has a Rate Stretch feature that lets you manually alter the movie’s tempo by sliding the trim bar along the timeline. To utilize the Rate Stretch tool to speed up a video clip, you must first divide the movie into pieces.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick method for altering the video speed so that it fits under the time limit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch the application on your respective systems.</li>
<li>Drag and drop the selected video onto the timeline in Premiere Pro.</li>
<li>Then, choose the Ripple Edit Tool from the toolbar, followed by the Rate Stretch Tool by clicking and holding the Ripple Edit Tool. Click the Rate Stretch button on the timeline’s left side to begin a timer.</li>
<li>You may also use the R key on your keyboard to activate the Rate Stretch Tool, which is a shortcut key.</li>
<li>Drag the video’s start and endpoints to their respective ends on the right and left sides to prolong or reduce the duration. As a consequence, the video speed will be improved. The bigger the period of time the video is dragged inwards, the faster it rises.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Method-3-Time-Remapping-Tool-1"><a href="#Method-3-Time-Remapping-Tool-1" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Time Remapping Tool"></a>Method 3: Time Remapping Tool</h3><p>In Adobe Premiere Pro, the time remapping tool is where you go to speed up a selected video section. With a video clip, this function may be utilized to create the illusion of speed and slowness.</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s time to fire up Adobe Premiere Pro and start fiddling with your footage.</li>
<li>Simply right-click on it to bring up the context menu, and then choose Show Clip Keyframes from the display list. Afterward, choose Time Remapping from the context menu that opens.</li>
<li>Click on it to make it go faster. The video will be colored blue, and a horizontal rubber band line will be drawn down its center if this option is selected. One of the video’s frame rate lines may be found here.</li>
<li>A white speed-control track may be seen just below the title bar in the upper part of the video. If you can’t see it well when zooming in, you may try again. The rubber band may be dragged higher in Premiere Pro to speed up the video.</li>
</ul>
<p>The tooltip will show how long it has been since the change happened compared to the original speed. As the movie progresses, so does the speed at which it is shown, and the duration of the video fluctuates as well. The audio remains unaltered and tied to the video when using Time Remapping.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Slow-Down-A-Video-in-Premiere-Pro-1"><a href="#How-to-Slow-Down-A-Video-in-Premiere-Pro-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Slow Down A Video in Premiere Pro?"></a>How to Slow Down A Video in Premiere Pro?</h2><p>Now, let’s discuss how to slow down a video in premiere pro</p>
<h3 id="Time-stretch-1"><a href="#Time-stretch-1" class="headerlink" title="Time stretch"></a>Time stretch</h3><p>A one-second video clip at 60 frames per second is an example of this situation. When the game is being played at a reasonable speed on any given platform or software, 60 frames will be shown. Because of this, each frame will take twice as long to play at a 0.5X slower pace.</p>
<p>To put it another way, you’d see 30 frames in a second that weren’t repeated. A second has been added to the video’s duration, which will now be 2 seconds instead of 1. There will be no deterioration in quality in this situation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new project in Premiere Pro on your PC.</li>
<li>To import a video file, choose Import from the File menu at the top of the screen. After that, drag the video into either the timeline or the project panel, whichever you like.</li>
<li>Right-clicking and choosing the Duration&#x2F;Speed option causes the video to begin playing.</li>
<li>This stage necessitates a decrease in speed from 100% to a lower percentage.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Using-Keyframes-1"><a href="#Using-Keyframes-1" class="headerlink" title="Using Keyframes"></a>Using Keyframes</h3><p>When you attempt to slow down a video by adjusting the frame rate, you are essentially eliminating frames from the video stream. This procedure will allow you to slow down a movie to your desired speed without sacrificing quality.</p>
<ul>
<li>After downloading and installing Adobe Premiere Pro, the first step is to launch the program. Later, you’ll need to choose a specific video that you’d want to have slowed down.</li>
<li>After you’ve chosen it, you may upload it to Premiere Pro. After importing the video, you must drag and drop it into the timeline in Premiere.</li>
<li>By right-clicking the mouse, choose Modify &gt; Interpret from the drop-down menu.</li>
<li>You’ll need to make some changes to the frame information now. Hit the Assume this frame rate button and input a value that is lower than the original video frame rate.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Utlizing-Time-Remapping-1"><a href="#Utlizing-Time-Remapping-1" class="headerlink" title="Utlizing Time Remapping"></a>Utlizing Time Remapping</h3><p>The remapping tool is a very common tool for creating slow-motion videos. It may be found in many video editing programs. It gives you the option of selecting a particular section of a video clip and then slowing down the video clip.</p>
<ul>
<li>Launching Adobe Premiere Pro is the initial step once it has been downloaded and installed on your computer. A particular video that you’d want slow-motioned will need to be selected later on in the process.</li>
<li>After dragging the video to the timeline, you’ll need to choose the area of the movie that you want to slow down.</li>
<li>Now you must choose the Key Frames and Speed from your video by clicking on the video’s right-click menu.</li>
<li>Only the “Pen Tool” must be used to lock the specific region you wish to slow down in order to push the Speed Line through the Selection tool to slow down the video during this phase.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Why-Is-Premiere-Pro-Playback-Fast-1"><a href="#Why-Is-Premiere-Pro-Playback-Fast-1" class="headerlink" title="Why Is Premiere Pro Playback Fast?"></a>Why Is Premiere Pro Playback Fast?</h2><p>If this issue arises in your program, you’ll notice choppy playback, a character that speaks too rapidly, and audio that skips frames in the narration.</p>
<p>The multimedia editor Premiere Pro is one of the best currently available on the market. In addition to creating YouTube videos, feature films, music videos, and other sorts of content, many professionals turn to it.</p>
<p>It is said that Adobe Premiere Pro suffers from a playback issue. It has the ability to make the video creation process more complicated and demanding than it should be. Let me show you how to fix this easy error in just two simple steps.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start the program on your computer’s operating system.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select Edit from the drop-down menu.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Look towards preference</p>
</li>
<li><p>Afterward, choose audio hardware.</p>
</li>
<li><p>No input should be used as the default input, regardless of what it is currently set to.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When you click on Playback your film, you will notice that the issue has been rectified.</p>
</li>

<p>In terms of video editing, Adobe Premiere Pro is one of the most powerful applications on the market, and it’s well-known for its versatility. Speeding up movies is one of the program’s many features required for the insertion of special effects and transitions. A lot of ways are there for you to pick from while using premiere pro to speed up the film as desired.</p>

<p>You can’t overwrite or replace your media files by doing anything in Premiere Pro, which means that nothing you do will have an effect on your media files. The point remains: a copy of your project and all its media assets should always be kept on hand just in case.</p>
<p>Adobe Premiere Pro is an excellent editing tool in terms of its functionality and capabilities. Still, it has a steep hill to climb that makes it difficult for newbies and users without previous editing experience. To get the most out of Adobe Premiere Pro, one must thoroughly understand the product.</p>

<p>No need to worry, folks; as in this article, we will be looking at how we can alter premiere pro speed.</p>
<h2 id="Fast-Forward-or-Speed-up-Playback-Speed-in-Premiere-Pro-2"><a href="#Fast-Forward-or-Speed-up-Playback-Speed-in-Premiere-Pro-2" class="headerlink" title="Fast Forward or Speed up Playback Speed in Premiere Pro"></a>Fast Forward or Speed up Playback Speed in Premiere Pro</h2><p>On analog editing systems, the speed of film could permanently be altered; but, because of the limitations of the technology, if you slowed anything down too much, the frame rate at which it was taken may become evident, and the image quality would begin to suffer as a consequence.</p>
<p>Adobe Premiere Pro is a feature-rich and professional video editor designed for the Macintosh platform. It has a variety of editing features built-in. Adobe Premiere Pro lets you change and control the speed at which movies are played back.</p>
<p>Premiere provides three choices for adjusting the tempo of a movie or speeding it up. We’ll go over them one by one as we scroll down the page.</p>

                      alt="Speed up the film in premiere pro"
                ></p>
<h3 id="Method-1-2"><a href="#Method-1-2" class="headerlink" title="Method 1"></a>Method 1</h3><ul>
<li>Download and Install Adobe Premiere Pro. Launch the application on your system.</li>
<li>Once you’ve set up a new project in Adobe Premiere Pro, import the video you want to edit.</li>
<li>In order to place the video where you want it, drag the necessary video clips into the timeline. In the end, you’ll have a new series to call your own.</li>
<li>Using the right-click menu, you may choose the whole movie or only a portion of it that you wish to edit.</li>
<li>The popup dialog box will display if you choose Speed&#x2F;Duration from the context menu list.</li>
<li>Choose Clip&gt; Speed Duration instead from the program’s drop-down menu.</li>
<li>The Speed field should be raised, and then the OK button should be pressed to accept the change.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Method-2-Rate-Stretch-Tool-2"><a href="#Method-2-Rate-Stretch-Tool-2" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Rate Stretch Tool"></a>Method 2: Rate Stretch Tool</h3><p>Adobe Premiere Pro has a Rate Stretch feature that lets you manually alter the movie’s tempo by sliding the trim bar along the timeline. To utilize the Rate Stretch tool to speed up a video clip, you must first divide the movie into pieces.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick method for altering the video speed so that it fits under the time limit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch the application on your respective systems.</li>
<li>Drag and drop the selected video onto the timeline in Premiere Pro.</li>
<li>Then, choose the Ripple Edit Tool from the toolbar, followed by the Rate Stretch Tool by clicking and holding the Ripple Edit Tool. Click the Rate Stretch button on the timeline’s left side to begin a timer.</li>
<li>You may also use the R key on your keyboard to activate the Rate Stretch Tool, which is a shortcut key.</li>
<li>Drag the video’s start and endpoints to their respective ends on the right and left sides to prolong or reduce the duration. As a consequence, the video speed will be improved. The bigger the period of time the video is dragged inwards, the faster it rises.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Method-3-Time-Remapping-Tool-2"><a href="#Method-3-Time-Remapping-Tool-2" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Time Remapping Tool"></a>Method 3: Time Remapping Tool</h3><p>In Adobe Premiere Pro, the time remapping tool is where you go to speed up a selected video section. With a video clip, this function may be utilized to create the illusion of speed and slowness.</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s time to fire up Adobe Premiere Pro and start fiddling with your footage.</li>
<li>Simply right-click on it to bring up the context menu, and then choose Show Clip Keyframes from the display list. Afterward, choose Time Remapping from the context menu that opens.</li>
<li>Click on it to make it go faster. The video will be colored blue, and a horizontal rubber band line will be drawn down its center if this option is selected. One of the video’s frame rate lines may be found here.</li>
<li>A white speed-control track may be seen just below the title bar in the upper part of the video. If you can’t see it well when zooming in, you may try again. The rubber band may be dragged higher in Premiere Pro to speed up the video.</li>
</ul>
<p>The tooltip will show how long it has been since the change happened compared to the original speed. As the movie progresses, so does the speed at which it is shown, and the duration of the video fluctuates as well. The audio remains unaltered and tied to the video when using Time Remapping.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Slow-Down-A-Video-in-Premiere-Pro-2"><a href="#How-to-Slow-Down-A-Video-in-Premiere-Pro-2" class="headerlink" title="How to Slow Down A Video in Premiere Pro?"></a>How to Slow Down A Video in Premiere Pro?</h2><p>Now, let’s discuss how to slow down a video in premiere pro</p>
<h3 id="Time-stretch-2"><a href="#Time-stretch-2" class="headerlink" title="Time stretch"></a>Time stretch</h3><p>A one-second video clip at 60 frames per second is an example of this situation. When the game is being played at a reasonable speed on any given platform or software, 60 frames will be shown. Because of this, each frame will take twice as long to play at a 0.5X slower pace.</p>
<p>To put it another way, you’d see 30 frames in a second that weren’t repeated. A second has been added to the video’s duration, which will now be 2 seconds instead of 1. There will be no deterioration in quality in this situation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new project in Premiere Pro on your PC.</li>
<li>To import a video file, choose Import from the File menu at the top of the screen. After that, drag the video into either the timeline or the project panel, whichever you like.</li>
<li>Right-clicking and choosing the Duration&#x2F;Speed option causes the video to begin playing.</li>
<li>This stage necessitates a decrease in speed from 100% to a lower percentage.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Using-Keyframes-2"><a href="#Using-Keyframes-2" class="headerlink" title="Using Keyframes"></a>Using Keyframes</h3><p>When you attempt to slow down a video by adjusting the frame rate, you are essentially eliminating frames from the video stream. This procedure will allow you to slow down a movie to your desired speed without sacrificing quality.</p>
<ul>
<li>After downloading and installing Adobe Premiere Pro, the first step is to launch the program. Later, you’ll need to choose a specific video that you’d want to have slowed down.</li>
<li>After you’ve chosen it, you may upload it to Premiere Pro. After importing the video, you must drag and drop it into the timeline in Premiere.</li>
<li>By right-clicking the mouse, choose Modify &gt; Interpret from the drop-down menu.</li>
<li>You’ll need to make some changes to the frame information now. Hit the Assume this frame rate button and input a value that is lower than the original video frame rate.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Utlizing-Time-Remapping-2"><a href="#Utlizing-Time-Remapping-2" class="headerlink" title="Utlizing Time Remapping"></a>Utlizing Time Remapping</h3><p>The remapping tool is a very common tool for creating slow-motion videos. It may be found in many video editing programs. It gives you the option of selecting a particular section of a video clip and then slowing down the video clip.</p>
<ul>
<li>Launching Adobe Premiere Pro is the initial step once it has been downloaded and installed on your computer. A particular video that you’d want slow-motioned will need to be selected later on in the process.</li>
<li>After dragging the video to the timeline, you’ll need to choose the area of the movie that you want to slow down.</li>
<li>Now you must choose the Key Frames and Speed from your video by clicking on the video’s right-click menu.</li>
<li>Only the “Pen Tool” must be used to lock the specific region you wish to slow down in order to push the Speed Line through the Selection tool to slow down the video during this phase.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Why-Is-Premiere-Pro-Playback-Fast-2"><a href="#Why-Is-Premiere-Pro-Playback-Fast-2" class="headerlink" title="Why Is Premiere Pro Playback Fast?"></a>Why Is Premiere Pro Playback Fast?</h2><p>If this issue arises in your program, you’ll notice choppy playback, a character that speaks too rapidly, and audio that skips frames in the narration.</p>
<p>The multimedia editor Premiere Pro is one of the best currently available on the market. In addition to creating YouTube videos, feature films, music videos, and other sorts of content, many professionals turn to it.</p>
<p>It is said that Adobe Premiere Pro suffers from a playback issue. It has the ability to make the video creation process more complicated and demanding than it should be. Let me show you how to fix this easy error in just two simple steps.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start the program on your computer’s operating system.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select Edit from the drop-down menu.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Look towards preference</p>
</li>
<li><p>Afterward, choose audio hardware.</p>
</li>
<li><p>No input should be used as the default input, regardless of what it is currently set to.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When you click on Playback your film, you will notice that the issue has been rectified.</p>
</li>

<p>In terms of video editing, Adobe Premiere Pro is one of the most powerful applications on the market, and it’s well-known for its versatility.

<p>You can’t overwrite or replace your media files by doing anything in Premiere Pro, which means that nothing you do will have an effect on your media files. The point remains: a copy of your project and all its media assets should always be kept on hand just in case.</p>
<p>Adobe Premiere Pro is an excellent editing tool in terms of its functionality and capabilities. Still, it has a steep hill to climb that makes it difficult for newbies and users without previous editing experience. To get the most out of Adobe Premiere Pro, one must thoroughly understand the product.</p>

<p>No need to worry, folks; as in this article, we will be looking at how we can alter premiere pro speed.</p>
<h2 id="Fast-Forward-or-Speed-up-Playback-Speed-in-Premiere-Pro-3"><a href="#Fast-Forward-or-Speed-up-Playback-Speed-in-Premiere-Pro-3" class="headerlink" title="Fast Forward or Speed up Playback Speed in Premiere Pro"></a>Fast Forward or Speed up Playback Speed in Premiere Pro</h2><p>On analog editing systems, the speed of film could permanently be altered; but, because of the limitations of the technology, if you slowed anything down too much, the frame rate at which it was taken may become evident, and the image quality would begin to suffer as a consequence.</p>
<p>Adobe Premiere Pro is a feature-rich and professional video editor designed for the Macintosh platform. It has a variety of editing features built-in. Adobe Premiere Pro lets you change and control the speed at which movies are played back.</p>
<p>Premiere provides three choices for adjusting the tempo of a movie or speeding it up. We’ll go over them one by one as we scroll down the page.</p>

                      alt="Speed up the film in premiere pro"
                ></p>
<h3 id="Method-1-3"><a href="#Method-1-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 1"></a>Method 1</h3><ul>
<li>Download and Install Adobe Premiere Pro. Launch the application on your system.</li>
<li>Once you’ve set up a new project in Adobe Premiere Pro, import the video you want to edit.</li>
<li>In order to place the video where you want it, drag the necessary video clips into the timeline. In the end, you’ll have a new series to call your own.</li>
<li>Using the right-click menu, you may choose the whole movie or only a portion of it that you wish to edit.</li>
<li>The popup dialog box will display if you choose Speed&#x2F;Duration from the context menu list.</li>
<li>Choose Clip&gt; Speed Duration instead from the program’s drop-down menu.</li>
<li>The Speed field should be raised, and then the OK button should be pressed to accept the change.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Method-2-Rate-Stretch-Tool-3"><a href="#Method-2-Rate-Stretch-Tool-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Rate Stretch Tool"></a>Method 2: Rate Stretch Tool</h3><p>Adobe Premiere Pro has a Rate Stretch feature that lets you manually alter the movie’s tempo by sliding the trim bar along the timeline. To utilize the Rate Stretch tool to speed up a video clip, you must first divide the movie into pieces.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick method for altering the video speed so that it fits under the time limit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch the application on your respective systems.</li>
<li>Drag and drop the selected video onto the timeline in Premiere Pro.</li>
<li>Then, choose the Ripple Edit Tool from the toolbar, followed by the Rate Stretch Tool by clicking and holding the Ripple Edit Tool. Click the Rate Stretch button on the timeline’s left side to begin a timer.</li>
<li>You may also use the R key on your keyboard to activate the Rate Stretch Tool, which is a shortcut key.</li>
<li>Drag the video’s start and endpoints to their respective ends on the right and left sides to prolong or reduce the duration. As a consequence, the video speed will be improved. The bigger the period of time the video is dragged inwards, the faster it rises.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Method-3-Time-Remapping-Tool-3"><a href="#Method-3-Time-Remapping-Tool-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Time Remapping Tool"></a>Method 3: Time Remapping Tool</h3><p>In Adobe Premiere Pro, the time remapping tool is where you go to speed up a selected video section. With a video clip, this function may be utilized to create the illusion of speed and slowness.</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s time to fire up Adobe Premiere Pro and start fiddling with your footage.</li>
<li>Simply right-click on it to bring up the context menu, and then choose Show Clip Keyframes from the display list. Afterward, choose Time Remapping from the context menu that opens.</li>
<li>Click on it to make it go faster. The video will be colored blue, and a horizontal rubber band line will be drawn down its center if this option is selected. One of the video’s frame rate lines may be found here.</li>
<li>A white speed-control track may be seen just below the title bar in the upper part of the video. If you can’t see it well when zooming in, you may try again. The rubber band may be dragged higher in Premiere Pro to speed up the video.</li>
</ul>
<p>The tooltip will show how long it has been since the change happened compared to the original speed. As the movie progresses, so does the speed at which it is shown, and the duration of the video fluctuates as well. The audio remains unaltered and tied to the video when using Time Remapping.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Slow-Down-A-Video-in-Premiere-Pro-3"><a href="#How-to-Slow-Down-A-Video-in-Premiere-Pro-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Slow Down A Video in Premiere Pro?"></a>How to Slow Down A Video in Premiere Pro?</h2><p>Now, let’s discuss how to slow down a video in premiere pro</p>
<h3 id="Time-stretch-3"><a href="#Time-stretch-3" class="headerlink" title="Time stretch"></a>Time stretch</h3><p>A one-second video clip at 60 frames per second is an example of this situation. When the game is being played at a reasonable speed on any given platform or software, 60 frames will be shown. Because of this, each frame will take twice as long to play at a 0.5X slower pace.</p>
<p>To put it another way, you’d see 30 frames in a second that weren’t repeated. A second has been added to the video’s duration, which will now be 2 seconds instead of 1. There will be no deterioration in quality in this situation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new project in Premiere Pro on your PC.</li>
<li>To import a video file, choose Import from the File menu at the top of the screen. After that, drag the video into either the timeline or the project panel, whichever you like.</li>
<li>Right-clicking and choosing the Duration&#x2F;Speed option causes the video to begin playing.</li>
<li>This stage necessitates a decrease in speed from 100% to a lower percentage.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Using-Keyframes-3"><a href="#Using-Keyframes-3" class="headerlink" title="Using Keyframes"></a>Using Keyframes</h3><p>When you attempt to slow down a video by adjusting the frame rate, you are essentially eliminating frames from the video stream. This procedure will allow you to slow down a movie to your desired speed without sacrificing quality.</p>
<ul>
<li>After downloading and installing Adobe Premiere Pro, the first step is to launch the program. Later, you’ll need to choose a specific video that you’d want to have slowed down.</li>
<li>After you’ve chosen it, you may upload it to Premiere Pro. After importing the video, you must drag and drop it into the timeline in Premiere.</li>
<li>By right-clicking the mouse, choose Modify &gt; Interpret from the drop-down menu.</li>
<li>You’ll need to make some changes to the frame information now. Hit the Assume this frame rate button and input a value that is lower than the original video frame rate.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Utlizing-Time-Remapping-3"><a href="#Utlizing-Time-Remapping-3" class="headerlink" title="Utlizing Time Remapping"></a>Utlizing Time Remapping</h3><p>The remapping tool is a very common tool for creating slow-motion videos. It may be found in many video editing programs. It gives you the option of selecting a particular section of a video clip and then slowing down the video clip.</p>
<ul>
<li>Launching Adobe Premiere Pro is the initial step once it has been downloaded and installed on your computer. A particular video that you’d want slow-motioned will need to be selected later on in the process.</li>
<li>After dragging the video to the timeline, you’ll need to choose the area of the movie that you want to slow down.</li>
<li>Now you must choose the Key Frames and Speed from your video by clicking on the video’s right-click menu.</li>
<li>Only the “Pen Tool” must be used to lock the specific region you wish to slow down in order to push the Speed Line through the Selection tool to slow down the video during this phase.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Why-Is-Premiere-Pro-Playback-Fast-3"><a href="#Why-Is-Premiere-Pro-Playback-Fast-3" class="headerlink" title="Why Is Premiere Pro Playback Fast?"></a>Why Is Premiere Pro Playback Fast?</h2><p>If this issue arises in your program, you’ll notice choppy playback, a character that speaks too rapidly, and audio that skips frames in the narration.</p>
<p>The multimedia editor Premiere Pro is one of the best currently available on the market. In addition to creating YouTube videos, feature films, music videos, and other sorts of content, many professionals turn to it.</p>
<p>It is said that Adobe Premiere Pro suffers from a playback issue. It has the ability to make the video creation process more complicated and demanding than it should be. Let me show you how to fix this easy error in just two simple steps.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start the program on your computer’s operating system.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select Edit from the drop-down menu.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Look towards preference</p>
</li>
<li><p>Afterward, choose audio hardware.</p>
</li>
<li><p>No input should be used as the default input, regardless of what it is currently set to.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When you click on Playback your film, you will notice that the issue has been rectified.</p>
</li>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Create a GIF or download one that meets your taste from different websites. Currently, we have many sites offering free GIFs; hence you don’t have to worry about copyright issues. Some top websites to consider are Giphy, Gifer, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Look for a site that can translate a GIF document to the APNG file. Don’t worry about this step since you can always google the top options. We currently have the ezgif site but technology changes every day; hence you can expect rising websites.</p>

<h2 id="How-to-Blur-Part-of-a-Video-Using-OpenShot"><a href="#How-to-Blur-Part-of-a-Video-Using-OpenShot" class="headerlink" title="How to Blur Part of a Video Using OpenShot"></a>How to Blur Part of a Video Using OpenShot</h2><p>Designed for Windows, Mac, and Linux, OpenShot is a free, open-source, and cross-platform video editor. While there’s no predefined function or filter in this tool to help you blur part of a video, OpenShot has another way of blurring static parts of your video: it uses an image.</p>
<p>OpenShot blur part of video is free, and you’ll use its open-source programs as a base program for the edition of the video and GIMP Image Manipulation software to edit photos. Follow the guide below to learn how to blur out something in a video using OpenShot.</p>
<p>Step 1: Download OpenShot and install it on your device.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-12.png"
                      alt="blur part of a video using openshot"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Take a screenshot from your video, where the part you want to blur is easily visible. You can do this by going to a relevant frame and utilizing Save Current Frame with a camera icon, located on the right side of the video preview window in a standard program configuration.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-11.png"
                      alt="blur part of a video using openshot"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: Be sure to save your video screenshot on your computer.</p>
<p>Step 4: Since you have exported a relevant frame from your video as a screenshot, you need to open it in a photo editor that can handle PNG pics and transparency, like the GIMP Image Manipulation program. Use any selection tool to select the area of the picture you want to blur on the video. Depending on your preferences, you can choose the free select tool, the ellipse select tool, or the rectangle select tool.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-13.png"
                      alt="blur part of a video using openshot - select blur area"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5: In the blur filters submenu, open the Pixelize tool and adjust the options that suit your preferences. You can use CTRL-Z to cancel the operation, and repeat it until you find the best combination of blurring settings.</p>
<p>Step 6: When you are satisfied with blurring, right-click on the blurred area and select Invert in the Select submenu; this will allow you to select the entire part of the frame that has not been blurred, which is the part you would like to get rid of because you will only have to use the blurred part of your video overlay where necessary.</p>
<p>Step 7: Now, cut the section of the picture you do not want to keep. You can do this by using CTRL-X. The blurred filter for your video is now ready.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-14.png"
                      alt="blur part of a video using openshot - cut unwanted section"
                ></p>
<p>Step 8: If after cutting you notice a plain color rather than a checkerboard canvas representing transparency, use CTRL-Z to cancel the cut. Then, use CTRL-I to invert the selection again to get control of the blurred selection again, and copy or cut it using CTRL-X or CTRL-C.</p>
<p>Step 9: Create another image using CTRL-N, and ensure you have navigated to the advanced options and selected transparency as the fill-in color, and paste your selection there.</p>
<p>Step 10: You now have a perfect photo with full transparency, which is represented by a checkerboard canvas, except for the section of the video frames you would like to blur that should be pixelized.</p>
<p>Step 11: Use the Export option under the File menu to export the photo to your PC as a . PNG file. To save a picture with a transparency channel, you need to use the . PNG extension.</p>
<p>Step 12: Now return to OpenShot video editor and import the generated picture with a pixelized portion in the OpenShot video project. Next, add the picture as an overlay track. Make sure it’s above the video track.</p>
<p>Step 13: If the program asks you to import the photo as an image sequence, select the NO option because you need to import a still photo, and not a video sequence.</p>
<p>Step 14: The picture will be displayed before the video, blurring only the portion of the video where you modified the frame. The other parts of the video won’t be touched. You can make adjustments to ensure the picture track is only displayed at required moments. And that’s how to blur part of a video using OpenShot.</p>

<p>Step 4: Since you have exported a relevant frame from your video as a screenshot, you need to open it in a photo editor that can handle PNG pics and transparency, like the GIMP Image Manipulation program. Use any selection tool to select the area of the picture you want to blur on the video. Depending on your preferences, you can choose the free select tool, the ellipse select tool, or the rectangle select tool.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 5: In the blur filters submenu, open the Pixelize tool and adjust the options that suit your preferences. You can use CTRL-Z to cancel the operation, and repeat it until you find the best combination of blurring settings.</p>
<p>Step 6: When you are satisfied with blurring, right-click on the blurred area and select Invert in the Select submenu; this will allow you to select the entire part of the frame that has not been blurred, which is the part you would like to get rid of because you will only have to use the blurred part of your video overlay where necessary.</p>
<p>Step 7: Now, cut the section of the picture you do not want to keep. You can do this by using CTRL-X. The blurred filter for your video is now ready.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="blur part of a video using openshot - cut unwanted section"
                ></p>
<p>Step 8: If after cutting you notice a plain color rather than a checkerboard canvas representing transparency, use CTRL-Z to cancel the cut. Then, use CTRL-I to invert the selection again to get control of the blurred selection again, and copy or cut it using CTRL-X or CTRL-C.</p>
<p>Step 9: Create another image using CTRL-N, and ensure you have navigated to the advanced options and selected transparency as the fill-in color, and paste your selection there.</p>
<p>Step 10: You now have a perfect photo with full transparency, which is represented by a checkerboard canvas, except for the section of the video frames you would like to blur that should be pixelized.</p>
<p>Step 11: Use the Export option under the File menu to export the photo to your PC as a . PNG file. To save a picture with a transparency channel, you need to use the . PNG extension.</p>
<p>Step 12: Now return to OpenShot video editor and import the generated picture with a pixelized portion in the OpenShot video project. Next, add the picture as an overlay track. Make sure it’s above the video track.</p>
<p>Step 13: If the program asks you to import the photo as an image sequence, select the NO option because you need to import a still photo, and not a video sequence.</p>
<p>Step 14: The picture will be displayed before the video, blurring only the portion of the video where you modified the frame. The other parts of the video won’t be touched. You can make adjustments to ensure the picture track is only displayed at required moments. And that’s how to blur part of a video using OpenShot.</p>

While there’s no predefined function or filter in this tool to help you blur part of a video, OpenShot has another way of blurring static parts of your video: it uses an image.</p>
<p>OpenShot blur part of video is free, and you’ll use its open-source programs as a base program for the edition of the video and GIMP Image Manipulation software to edit photos. Follow the guide below to learn how to blur out something in a video using OpenShot.</p>
<p>Step 1: Download OpenShot and install it on your device.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Take a screenshot from your video, where the part you want to blur is easily visible. You can do this by going to a relevant frame and utilizing Save Current Frame with a camera icon, located on the right side of the video preview window in a standard program configuration.</p>

<h2 id="How-to-Blur-a-Moving-Part-of-a-Video-Using-Filmora-3"><a href="#How-to-Blur-a-Moving-Part-of-a-Video-Using-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Blur a Moving Part of a Video Using Filmora"></a>How to Blur a Moving Part of a Video Using Filmora</h2><p>You can also blur a moving part of your video with Filmora; this program allows you to add the motion-tracking mosaic to any moving object in your video that you do not want your viewers to see. You can use stickers, mosaic, or anything you download on the internet to hide any unwanted moving object.</p>
<p>With that in mind, here is how to blur a moving part of a video using Filmora:</p>
<ol>
<li>Run Filmora on your device.</li>
<li>Import your video into Filmora’s Media Library.</li>
<li>Drag your video to the Timeline.</li>
</ol>

                ></p>
<ol>
<li>Now, double-click the video in the Timeline. Doing this will open the editing menu.</li>
<li>Check the box that’s right next to Motion Tracking; this tool allows you to track movement in a video and then have objects like text, images, videos, or elements follow this movement.</li>
</ol>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<ol>
<li>A tracker box will appear on your preview window; move it over the moving object you would like to track. You can increase or reduce the size of the tracker box. Hit the Start Tracking button to render the effect.</li>
</ol>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="how to blur a moving part in video with filmora - tracker box"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li>Wait until the tracking process is complete. The duration of this process will depend on the length of your video. You’ll have to do some trimming if other objects block the moving part you’re tracking from time to time.</li>
</ol>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<ol>
<li>WNow, select the Add Mosaic option.</li>
<li>Choose the Mosaic type you prefer and adjust the opacity and blur amount to ensure the object is unrecognizable.</li>
<li>Now, select the moving part of the video you want to blur and click OK.</li>
<li>The object is now blurred, and the mosaic layer will follow its movement everywhere it goes.</li>
<li>Playback your video to check the result. Filmora allows you to fine-tune the position and size of the object that’s following the track in your Preview Window without restarting tracking. Additionally, you can switch the follower anytime you want.</li>
<li>When you have finished blurring the moving part on your video, click File &gt; Save Project or Save Project As to save your video.</li>

<h2 id="How-to-Blur-Part-of-a-Video-Using-OpenShot-3"><a href="#How-to-Blur-Part-of-a-Video-Using-OpenShot-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Blur Part of a Video Using OpenShot"></a>How to Blur Part of a Video Using OpenShot</h2><p>Designed for Windows, Mac, and Linux, OpenShot is a free, open-source, and cross-platform video editor. While there’s no predefined function or filter in this tool to help you blur part of a video, OpenShot has another way of blurring static parts of your video: it uses an image.</p>
<p>OpenShot blur part of video is free, and you’ll use its open-source programs as a base program for the edition of the video and GIMP Image Manipulation software to edit photos. Follow the guide below to learn how to blur out something in a video using OpenShot.</p>
<p>Step 1: Download OpenShot and install it on your device.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-12.png"
                      alt="blur part of a video using openshot"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Take a screenshot from your video, where the part you want to blur is easily visible. You can do this by going to a relevant frame and utilizing Save Current Frame with a camera icon, located on the right side of the video preview window in a standard program configuration.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-11.png"
                      alt="blur part of a video using openshot"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: Be sure to save your video screenshot on your computer.</p>
<p>Step 4: Since you have exported a relevant frame from your video as a screenshot, you need to open it in a photo editor that can handle PNG pics and transparency, like the GIMP Image Manipulation program. Use any selection tool to select the area of the picture you want to blur on the video. Depending on your preferences, you can choose the free select tool, the ellipse select tool, or the rectangle select tool.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-13.png"
                      alt="blur part of a video using openshot - select blur area"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5: In the blur filters submenu, open the Pixelize tool and adjust the options that suit your preferences. You can use CTRL-Z to cancel the operation, and repeat it until you find the best combination of blurring settings.</p>
<p>Step 6: When you are satisfied with blurring, right-click on the blurred area and select Invert in the Select submenu; this will allow you to select the entire part of the frame that has not been blurred, which is the part you would like to get rid of because you will only have to use the blurred part of your video overlay where necessary.</p>
<p>Step 7: Now, cut the section of the picture you do not want to keep. You can do this by using CTRL-X. The blurred filter for your video is now ready.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/blur-a-part-of-video-14.png"
                      alt="blur part of a video using openshot - cut unwanted section"
                ></p>
<p>Step 8: If after cutting you notice a plain color rather than a checkerboard canvas representing transparency, use CTRL-Z to cancel the cut. Then, use CTRL-I to invert the selection again to get control of the blurred selection again, and copy or cut it using CTRL-X or CTRL-C.</p>
<p>Step 9: Create another image using CTRL-N, and ensure you have navigated to the advanced options and selected transparency as the fill-in color, and paste your selection there.</p>
<p>Step 10: You now have a perfect photo with full transparency, which is represented by a checkerboard canvas, except for the section of the video frames you would like to blur that should be pixelized.</p>
<p>Step 11: Use the Export option under the File menu to export the photo to your PC as a . PNG file. To save a picture with a transparency channel, you need to use the . PNG extension.</p>
<p>Step 12: Now return to OpenShot video editor and import the generated picture with a pixelized portion in the OpenShot video project. Next, add the picture as an overlay track. Make sure it’s above the video track.</p>
<p>Step 13: If the program asks you to import the photo as an image sequence, select the NO option because you need to import a still photo, and not a video sequence.</p>
<p>Step 14: The picture will be displayed before the video, blurring only the portion of the video where you modified the frame. The other parts of the video won’t be touched. You can make adjustments to ensure the picture track is only displayed at required moments. And that’s how to blur part of a video using OpenShot.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-7"><a href="#Conclusion-7" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>● Now that you know how to blur out part of a video, you can have fun and censor anything you want in your clips. Use Filmora to blur moving and still parts on your video.</p>
