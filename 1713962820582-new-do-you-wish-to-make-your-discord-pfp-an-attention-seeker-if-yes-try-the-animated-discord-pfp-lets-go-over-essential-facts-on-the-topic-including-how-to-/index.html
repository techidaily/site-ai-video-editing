Therefore, if your video is one hour, your custom settings will run through the clip’s entire length.<br>Anchor To In Point only saves the section of the clip where your custom settings are active. Additionally, the software will add all pre-existing luts to the section without scaling.</li>
<li>Additionally, you can repeat the process and export your LUTs in the following formats:<br>.look exports the LUT as an Adobe Premiere Pro file to a location on your device.<br>.cube saves the Lumetri preset you can use on other color grading software.

<li>Once you finish your editing, click on the Lumetri Pop Up menu and choose Save Preset.</li>
<li>Fill the respective fields with your custom information and click OK. The program will then save the clip to the location you specify.</li>
<li>You can save custom luts in the following ways:<br>Scale only applies the new lut to the video. As such, all other luts you use are deleted. Therefore, if your video is one hour, your custom settings will run through the clip’s entire length.<br>Anchor To In Point only saves the section of the clip where your custom settings are active. Additionally, the software will add all pre-existing luts to the section without scaling.</li>
<li>Additionally, you can repeat the process and export your LUTs in the following formats:<br>.look exports the LUT as an Adobe Premiere Pro file to a location on your device.<br>.cube saves the Lumetri preset you can use on other color grading software.
