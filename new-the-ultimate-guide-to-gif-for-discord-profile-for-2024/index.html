<p>Congratulations on getting here! You finally cropped your video using the VLC media player.</p>
<p>Although there are disadvantages to using this as your cropping tool. Like for example you want the real-time preview of what you’ve changed in your video. This would be a turn off for some that want their outputs to be shown to them immediately. Aside from this, there is a chance that you will forget one step to make and thus, the whole process would need to start over from scratch. Lastly, is the freedom to batch crop multiple videos. This is especially important for those that need to have many clips in one video. A user might lose the continuity of the story within his video.</p>
<p>While one of its strong suits is the affordability of the software. It is completely free and has no additional charges that may surprise you in the future. Finally, your output won’t have watermarks that could destroy the aesthetics of your video.</p>
<p>What are your experiences with using it as a cropping tool? What would you recommend to improve it? It is up to you the user if you want to continue using this as your partner in removing the excess in your videos.</p>

Classic Montage Ideas in Art and Film</h2><p>Video montages play a major role in films, art productions, and gaming, like the <strong>call of duty montage</strong>.</p>
<p>In terms of the first example, when you watch movies, you might notice this technique used in many movies, utilized more prominently since the 1920s when Sergei Eisenstein coined the term first. These scenes appear as stitched-together shots of the characters showing time passage, enjoying activities or memories.</p>
<p>Different techniques are common, like rhythmic, metric, intellectual, or tonal. For example, the 2000 movie “Requiem for a Dream” showcased an intellectual&#x2F;metric style of video montage to show the disorientating effect of the character under drug influence. A relatively recent example would be Benedict Cumberbatch’s 2016 movie “Doctor Strange”, where the montage shows the titular character’s interaction with the villain (no spoilers).</p>
<h3 id="3-Top-Montages-in-Film-for-All-Times"><a href="#3-Top-Montages-in-Film-for-All-Times" class="headerlink" title="3 Top Montages in Film for All Times"></a>3 Top Montages in Film for All Times</h3><p>If the above two examples did not fully express <strong>what is a montage video</strong>, seeing more examples should help. For this, here are three of the top montage examples available in Film History, each version representing a separate video montage style.</p>
<p><strong>1. Rocky (1976)</strong></p>
<p>One of the most notable montages is available in the 1976 action movie, the Sylvester Stallone-starrer “Rocky”. The type of video montage that is visible in this movie is rhythmic in nature, showcasing the training the character undergoes. This is edited with a musical background score, summarising some shots’ full training progression process.</p>
<p>To add an emotive tone to the video, music is added to the video clip that engages audiences to feel the character’s passion. A rhythmic style of video montage technique is used to cut the shorts as per the content. The lengths of each clip are not similar and differ as per the action going on in the scene.</p>
<p><strong>2. Mulan (1998)</strong></p>
<p>Video montages are also visible in animated movies, as seen in the 1998 version of Disney’s “Mulan”. The scene in question is where the song “I’ll Make a Man Out of You” plays while Mulan undergoes strict training for the military from the male lead. A sequence of shots showing her progress is shown.</p>
<p>Here, the video montage is shown with the background music that perfectly aligns with what is occurring in the video. The visuals and the audio in the background cohesively show the main character’s struggle, which creates an emotional response in the audience. Therefore, the style of video montage here falls under tonal or overtonal categories.</p>
<p>Watch this <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMX5zkYnGB0" >video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to get an idea of how music and visuals can partner for tonal video montages.</p>
<p><strong>3. Creed (2015)</strong></p>
<p>Like in the Rocky movie, its 2015 sequel, “Creed”, also has a video montage. Here, the clips in the sequence are also used to depict the intense training progress. However, where it differs from the rhythmic formula is that the sequence highlights the emotional journey or determination of Adonis Creed to succeed.</p>
<p>Plus, this video montage is a homage to the original version; the tonal effect is further noticeable in the scene of Rocky’s health deterioration against Creed’s training. Thus, it juxtaposes the two scenes, creating an emotional impact on viewers to root for the main character.</p>

<p>Part 1. Classic Montage Ideas in Art and Film</p>
<p>Video montages play a major role in films, art productions, and gaming, like the <strong>call of duty montage</strong>.</p>
<p>In terms of the first example, when you watch movies, you might notice this technique used in many movies, utilized more prominently since the 1920s when Sergei Eisenstein coined the term first. These scenes appear as stitched-together shots of the characters showing time passage, enjoying activities or memories.</p>
<p>Different techniques are common, like rhythmic, metric, intellectual, or tonal. For example, the 2000 movie “Requiem for a Dream” showcased an intellectual&#x2F;metric style of video montage to show the disorientating effect of the character under drug influence. A relatively recent example would be Benedict Cumberbatch’s 2016 movie “Doctor Strange”, where the montage shows the titular character’s interaction with the villain (no spoilers).</p>
<h3 id="3-Top-Montages-in-Film-for-All-Times-1"><a href="#3-Top-Montages-in-Film-for-All-Times-1" class="headerlink" title="3 Top Montages in Film for All Times"></a>3 Top Montages in Film for All Times</h3><p>If the above two examples did not fully express <strong>what is a montage video</strong>, seeing more examples should help. For this, here are three of the top montage examples available in Film History, each version representing a separate video montage style.</p>
<p><strong>1. Rocky (1976)</strong></p>
<p>One of the most notable montages is available in the 1976 action movie, the Sylvester Stallone-starrer “Rocky”. The type of video montage that is visible in this movie is rhythmic in nature, showcasing the training the character undergoes. This is edited with a musical background score, summarising some shots’ full training progression process.</p>
<p>To add an emotive tone to the video, music is added to the video clip that engages audiences to feel the character’s passion. A rhythmic style of video montage technique is used to cut the shorts as per the content. The lengths of each clip are not similar and differ as per the action going on in the scene.</p>
<p><strong>2. Mulan (1998)</strong></p>
<p>Video montages are also visible in animated movies, as seen in the 1998 version of Disney’s “Mulan”. The scene in question is where the song “I’ll Make a Man Out of You” plays while Mulan undergoes strict training for the military from the male lead. A sequence of shots showing her progress is shown.</p>
<p>Here, the video montage is shown with the background music that perfectly aligns with what is occurring in the video. The visuals and the audio in the background cohesively show the main character’s struggle, which creates an emotional response in the audience. Therefore, the style of video montage here falls under tonal or overtonal categories.</p>

<p><strong>3. Creed (2015)</strong></p>
<p>Like in the Rocky movie, its 2015 sequel, “Creed”, also has a video montage. Here, the clips in the sequence are also used to depict the intense training progress. However, where it differs from the rhythmic formula is that the sequence highlights the emotional journey or determination of Adonis Creed to succeed.</p>
<p>Plus, this video montage is a homage to the original version; the tonal effect is further noticeable in the scene of Rocky’s health deterioration against Creed’s training. Thus, it juxtaposes the two scenes, creating an emotional impact on viewers to root for the main character.</p>

<h2 id="Part-2-Creative-Montage-Ideas-for-Social-Media-1"><a href="#Part-2-Creative-Montage-Ideas-for-Social-Media-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Creative Montage Ideas for Social Media"></a>Part 2. Creative Montage Ideas for Social Media</h2><p>Of course, movies and TV shows are the only types of media where video montage techniques are useful. Many non-professionals use options like a <strong>fortnite montage editor</strong> to create and edit montage videos for other projects they can share across platforms. Some even create video montages to create videos for social media.</p>
<p>These include vlog-like videos that people record and then edit together into a montage which different techniques. Plus, some users create montages of different things that interest them, like gameplay. Then, they share those videos across social media for views, like on TikTok or YouTube.</p>
<h3 id="·-Gaming-Montages-1"><a href="#·-Gaming-Montages-1" class="headerlink" title="· Gaming Montages"></a>· Gaming Montages</h3><p>Different creators focus on developing <strong>gaming montage</strong>s to create projects for the games they operate. These can include videos showcasing the skills or gameplays of the creation, all explaining a specific theme in some cases.</p>
<p>There are different games that the users focus on for showcasing their gaming prowess in action. Common examples include Fortnite, Call of Duty, CSGO, or <strong>PUBG montage</strong> videos.</p>

<h3 id="·-Wedding-Montages-1"><a href="#·-Wedding-Montages-1" class="headerlink" title="· Wedding Montages"></a>· Wedding Montages</h3><p>Many users turn to edit video montages for specific occasions, adding clips of different moments instead of one long-running documentary. They incorporate stylish effects like slow motion and transitions, incorporate a moving background score, and more.</p>
<p>Many top influencers and celebrities have used this technique for their wedding videos on social media. Additionally, regular people also adopt the style.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-AR-and-the-Technology-Used-for-Augmented-Reality-Development"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-AR-and-the-Technology-Used-for-Augmented-Reality-Development" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is AR and the Technology Used for Augmented Reality Development?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What is AR and the Technology Used for Augmented Reality Development?</strong></h2><p>Expanding the acronym, AR stands for Augmented Reality, a relatively newer concept in the world of graphic imaging and other computer based real-time applications. Talking of the exact explanation, augmented reality refers to a responsive synchronization of real world elements into digital platforms, while upgrading the same with high end perceptual information generated from specialized computer systems.</p>
<p>The entire concept of augmented reality rests on 3 major aspects, viz., a synchronized combination of the virtual and real world environments, a responsive interaction of associated elements in real-time, and a precise 3-dimensional registration of virtual and real elements. The aforesaid aspects of augmented reality are often guaranteed by a number of sensory modalities, like that of auditory, visual, somatosensory, olfactory and haptic ones.</p>
<p><strong>Technology Behind Augmented Reality</strong></p>
<p>As far as the technology behind the development of <strong>augmented reality video</strong> is concerned, the overall implementation is categorized into 3 different tasks. The process is initiated with generating concise, high resolution images of real world elements, followed by creating an overlay of computer generated 3D images on the previously generated real world images. This is further succeeded by facilitating an interactive user engagement and interaction within the simulated surroundings.</p>
<p>The process of technology implementation is seconded by a responsive display mechanism which can be done conveniently on any one among glasses, smartphones, screens, head-mounted displays and handheld devices. Concerning the factor of output credibility, head-mounted displays take the credit of generating a much more immersive augmented reality in comparison to the other display alternatives.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-Is-the-Difference-Between-Augmented-Reality-and-Virtual-Reality"><a href="#Part-2-What-Is-the-Difference-Between-Augmented-Reality-and-Virtual-Reality" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What Is the Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality?"></a>Part 2 <strong>What Is the Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality?</strong></h2><p>Advancements in technology has treated the world with a multitude of concepts to simulate real-time elements into digital environments. In addition to augmented reality, the techniques of virtual and alternate reality have come into focus in recent times to address the diversely specific needs of digital and real world integration.</p>
<p>Lack of proper awareness, however, leads to the treatment of these fundamentally different concepts as one and the same thing. Considering the credibility of such technologies towards addressing certain specific purposes, it becomes important to understand the difference among these apparently similar concepts. Having said that, let us make an attempt to realise the dissimilarity between augmented and virtual reality in the following section:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Underlying Concept</strong></p>
<p>Stressing on the parameter of conceptual utility, augmented reality refers to the integration of digital aspects into a real-time surrounding, most probably through a smartphone or camera, whereas, virtual reality on the other hand, is responsible for the replacement of a real-time setting with a simulated environment.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Existence Constraints</strong></p>
<p>Talking about augmented reality, the technique showcases the coexistence of the real and virtual surroundings, with the primary goal of supplying extra information about the real-time environment, which can be accessed without a content search. Conversely, virtual reality is predominantly concerned with bringing about a complete shift of the user’s actual ambiances to an entirely fabricated environment that undertakes an independent existence.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> User Control</p>
<p>Speaking on the extent of user control, augmented reality allows you to monitor your real world presence, mostly with a smartphone, while users of virtual reality are entirely controlled by the system, with strictly no self-access. Also, you would require a headset equipment to make use of virtual reality.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-AR-and-the-Technology-Used-for-Augmented-Reality-Development-1"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-AR-and-the-Technology-Used-for-Augmented-Reality-Development-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is AR and the Technology Used for Augmented Reality Development?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What is AR and the Technology Used for Augmented Reality Development?</strong></h2><p>Expanding the acronym, AR stands for Augmented Reality, a relatively newer concept in the world of graphic imaging and other computer based real-time applications. Talking of the exact explanation, augmented reality refers to a responsive synchronization of real world elements into digital platforms, while upgrading the same with high end perceptual information generated from specialized computer systems.</p>
<p>The entire concept of augmented reality rests on 3 major aspects, viz., a synchronized combination of the virtual and real world environments, a responsive interaction of associated elements in real-time, and a precise 3-dimensional registration of virtual and real elements. The aforesaid aspects of augmented reality are often guaranteed by a number of sensory modalities, like that of auditory, visual, somatosensory, olfactory and haptic ones.</p>
<p><strong>Technology Behind Augmented Reality</strong></p>
<p>As far as the technology behind the development of <strong>augmented reality video</strong> is concerned, the overall implementation is categorized into 3 different tasks. The process is initiated with generating concise, high resolution images of real world elements, followed by creating an overlay of computer generated 3D images on the previously generated real world images. This is further succeeded by facilitating an interactive user engagement and interaction within the simulated surroundings.</p>
<p>The process of technology implementation is seconded by a responsive display mechanism which can be done conveniently on any one among glasses, smartphones, screens, head-mounted displays and handheld devices. Concerning the factor of output credibility, head-mounted displays take the credit of generating a much more immersive augmented reality in comparison to the other display alternatives.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-Is-the-Difference-Between-Augmented-Reality-and-Virtual-Reality-1"><a href="#Part-2-What-Is-the-Difference-Between-Augmented-Reality-and-Virtual-Reality-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What Is the Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality?"></a>Part 2 <strong>What Is the Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality?</strong></h2><p>Advancements in technology has treated the world with a multitude of concepts to simulate real-time elements into digital environments. In addition to augmented reality, the techniques of virtual and alternate reality have come into focus in recent times to address the diversely specific needs of digital and real world integration.</p>
<p>Lack of proper awareness, however, leads to the treatment of these fundamentally different concepts as one and the same thing. Considering the credibility of such technologies towards addressing certain specific purposes, it becomes important to understand the difference among these apparently similar concepts. Having said that, let us make an attempt to realise the dissimilarity between augmented and virtual reality in the following section:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Underlying Concept</strong></p>
<p>Stressing on the parameter of conceptual utility, augmented reality refers to the integration of digital aspects into a real-time surrounding, most probably through a smartphone or camera, whereas, virtual reality on the other hand, is responsible for the replacement of a real-time setting with a simulated environment.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Existence Constraints</strong></p>
<p>Talking about augmented reality, the technique showcases the coexistence of the real and virtual surroundings, with the primary goal of supplying extra information about the real-time environment, which can be accessed without a content search. Conversely, virtual reality is predominantly concerned with bringing about a complete shift of the user’s actual ambiances to an entirely fabricated environment that undertakes an independent existence.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> User Control</p>
<p>Speaking on the extent of user control, augmented reality allows you to monitor your real world presence, mostly with a smartphone, while users of virtual reality are entirely controlled by the system, with strictly no self-access. Also, you would require a headset equipment to make use of virtual reality.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-AR-and-the-Technology-Used-for-Augmented-Reality-Development-2"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-AR-and-the-Technology-Used-for-Augmented-Reality-Development-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is AR and the Technology Used for Augmented Reality Development?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What is AR and the Technology Used for Augmented Reality Development?</strong></h2><p>Expanding the acronym, AR stands for Augmented Reality, a relatively newer concept in the world of graphic imaging and other computer based real-time applications. Talking of the exact explanation, augmented reality refers to a responsive synchronization of real world elements into digital platforms, while upgrading the same with high end perceptual information generated from specialized computer systems.</p>
<p>The entire concept of augmented reality rests on 3 major aspects, viz., a synchronized combination of the virtual and real world environments, a responsive interaction of associated elements in real-time, and a precise 3-dimensional registration of virtual and real elements. The aforesaid aspects of augmented reality are often guaranteed by a number of sensory modalities, like that of auditory, visual, somatosensory, olfactory and haptic ones.</p>
<p><strong>Technology Behind Augmented Reality</strong></p>
<p>As far as the technology behind the development of <strong>augmented reality video</strong> is concerned, the overall implementation is categorized into 3 different tasks. The process is initiated with generating concise, high resolution images of real world elements, followed by creating an overlay of computer generated 3D images on the previously generated real world images. This is further succeeded by facilitating an interactive user engagement and interaction within the simulated surroundings.</p>
<p>The process of technology implementation is seconded by a responsive display mechanism which can be done conveniently on any one among glasses, smartphones, screens, head-mounted displays and handheld devices. Concerning the factor of output credibility, head-mounted displays take the credit of generating a much more immersive augmented reality in comparison to the other display alternatives.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-Is-the-Difference-Between-Augmented-Reality-and-Virtual-Reality-2"><a href="#Part-2-What-Is-the-Difference-Between-Augmented-Reality-and-Virtual-Reality-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What Is the Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality?"></a>Part 2 <strong>What Is the Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality?</strong></h2><p>Advancements in technology has treated the world with a multitude of concepts to simulate real-time elements into digital environments. In addition to augmented reality, the techniques of virtual and alternate reality have come into focus in recent times to address the diversely specific needs of digital and real world integration.</p>
<p>Lack of proper awareness, however, leads to the treatment of these fundamentally different concepts as one and the same thing. Considering the credibility of such technologies towards addressing certain specific purposes, it becomes important to understand the difference among these apparently similar concepts. Having said that, let us make an attempt to realise the dissimilarity between augmented and virtual reality in the following section:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Underlying Concept</strong></p>
<p>Stressing on the parameter of conceptual utility, augmented reality refers to the integration of digital aspects into a real-time surrounding, most probably through a smartphone or camera, whereas, virtual reality on the other hand, is responsible for the replacement of a real-time setting with a simulated environment.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Existence Constraints</strong></p>
<p>Talking about augmented reality, the technique showcases the coexistence of the real and virtual surroundings, with the primary goal of supplying extra information about the real-time environment, which can be accessed without a content search. Conversely, virtual reality is predominantly concerned with bringing about a complete shift of the user’s actual ambiances to an entirely fabricated environment that undertakes an independent existence.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> User Control</p>
<p>Speaking on the extent of user control, augmented reality allows you to monitor your real world presence, mostly with a smartphone, while users of virtual reality are entirely controlled by the system, with strictly no self-access. Also, you would require a headset equipment to make use of virtual reality.</p>

While there are manifold varieties of augmented reality usage, the following section highlights the best examples of integrating AR into brand marketing:</p>
<h3 id="01Walmart-Inventory-Control-2"><a href="#01Walmart-Inventory-Control-2" class="headerlink" title="01Walmart- Inventory Control"></a>01Walmart- Inventory Control</h3><p>With the aim to examine the dual credibility of its brand stores as online fulfillment as well as physical shopping centers, Walmart in October 2020, announced the proposition of its 4 shopping units as ‘test centers’ of augmented reality, where the latter was supposed to aid in the management and tracking of company inventories.</p>
<p>The technology was implemented through a smartphone application to quicken the transportation process of item packages from the inventory to the sales area. The utility works when the employees hold a handheld device that highlights the dispatch ready boxes in an <strong>augmented reality stock video</strong>, instead of scanning each box individually.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-AR-and-the-Technology-Used-for-Augmented-Reality-Development-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-AR-and-the-Technology-Used-for-Augmented-Reality-Development-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is AR and the Technology Used for Augmented Reality Development?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What is AR and the Technology Used for Augmented Reality Development?</strong></h2><p>Expanding the acronym, AR stands for Augmented Reality, a relatively newer concept in the world of graphic imaging and other computer based real-time applications. Talking of the exact explanation, augmented reality refers to a responsive synchronization of real world elements into digital platforms, while upgrading the same with high end perceptual information generated from specialized computer systems.</p>
<p>The entire concept of augmented reality rests on 3 major aspects, viz., a synchronized combination of the virtual and real world environments, a responsive interaction of associated elements in real-time, and a precise 3-dimensional registration of virtual and real elements. The aforesaid aspects of augmented reality are often guaranteed by a number of sensory modalities, like that of auditory, visual, somatosensory, olfactory and haptic ones.</p>
<p><strong>Technology Behind Augmented Reality</strong></p>
<p>As far as the technology behind the development of <strong>augmented reality video</strong> is concerned, the overall implementation is categorized into 3 different tasks. The process is initiated with generating concise, high resolution images of real world elements, followed by creating an overlay of computer generated 3D images on the previously generated real world images. This is further succeeded by facilitating an interactive user engagement and interaction within the simulated surroundings.</p>
<p>The process of technology implementation is seconded by a responsive display mechanism which can be done conveniently on any one among glasses, smartphones, screens, head-mounted displays and handheld devices. Concerning the factor of output credibility, head-mounted displays take the credit of generating a much more immersive augmented reality in comparison to the other display alternatives.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-Is-the-Difference-Between-Augmented-Reality-and-Virtual-Reality-3"><a href="#Part-2-What-Is-the-Difference-Between-Augmented-Reality-and-Virtual-Reality-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What Is the Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality?"></a>Part 2 <strong>What Is the Difference Between Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality?</strong></h2><p>Advancements in technology has treated the world with a multitude of concepts to simulate real-time elements into digital environments. In addition to augmented reality, the techniques of virtual and alternate reality have come into focus in recent times to address the diversely specific needs of digital and real world integration.</p>
<p>Lack of proper awareness, however, leads to the treatment of these fundamentally different concepts as one and the same thing. Considering the credibility of such technologies towards addressing certain specific purposes, it becomes important to understand the difference among these apparently similar concepts. Having said that, let us make an attempt to realise the dissimilarity between augmented and virtual reality in the following section:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Underlying Concept</strong></p>
<p>Stressing on the parameter of conceptual utility, augmented reality refers to the integration of digital aspects into a real-time surrounding, most probably through a smartphone or camera, whereas, virtual reality on the other hand, is responsible for the replacement of a real-time setting with a simulated environment.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Existence Constraints</strong></p>
<p>Talking about augmented reality, the technique showcases the coexistence of the real and virtual surroundings, with the primary goal of supplying extra information about the real-time environment, which can be accessed without a content search. Conversely, virtual reality is predominantly concerned with bringing about a complete shift of the user’s actual ambiances to an entirely fabricated environment that undertakes an independent existence.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> User Control</p>
<p>Speaking on the extent of user control, augmented reality allows you to monitor your real world presence, mostly with a smartphone, while users of virtual reality are entirely controlled by the system, with strictly no self-access. Also, you would require a headset equipment to make use of virtual reality.</p>

While there are manifold varieties of augmented reality usage, the following section highlights the best examples of integrating AR into brand marketing:</p>
<h3 id="01Walmart-Inventory-Control-3"><a href="#01Walmart-Inventory-Control-3" class="headerlink" title="01Walmart- Inventory Control"></a>01Walmart- Inventory Control</h3><p>With the aim to examine the dual credibility of its brand stores as online fulfillment as well as physical shopping centers, Walmart in October 2020, announced the proposition of its 4 shopping units as ‘test centers’ of augmented reality, where the latter was supposed to aid in the management and tracking of company inventories.</p>
<p>The technology was implemented through a smartphone application to quicken the transportation process of item packages from the inventory to the sales area. The utility works when the employees hold a handheld device that highlights the dispatch ready boxes in an <strong>augmented reality stock video</strong>, instead of scanning each box individually.</p>
