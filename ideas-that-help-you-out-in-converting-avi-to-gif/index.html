<p>Download Wondershare Uniconvereter software from the official link to your PC&#x2F;Mac (With Mojave). As the home interface appears, click on the “Toolbox” tab and choose the “GIF Maker” option.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Upload the AVI File</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-converting-avi-to-gif-2.jpg"
                      alt="upload avi file uniconverter"
                ></p>
<p>In the GIF Maker window, click on the “Import” icon to upload AVI files from your PC. On the right pane, select the start and stop times of the videos for GIF-making.</p>
<p>The next thing to do is select the output size and frame rate of the desired GIF output. On the bottom, click on the “File Location” to choose the directory for the output file.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Convert</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-converting-avi-to-gif-3.jpg"
                      alt="create gif"
                ></p>
<p>The end step is to convert AVI to gif by clicking on the “Create GIF” button to begin the process.</p>
<h3 id="02Convert-AVI-to-GIF-with-VLC-Media-Player"><a href="#02Convert-AVI-to-GIF-with-VLC-Media-Player" class="headerlink" title="02Convert AVI to GIF with VLC Media Player"></a>02Convert AVI to GIF with VLC Media Player</h3><p>VLC is a cross-platform media player so you can use it on your Mac and Windows to convert AVI to Gif. It’s free and comes with numerous functions and support other than playing media. It can be used as a GIF maker too because of the snapshot feature.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Launch VLC Media Player</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-converting-avi-to-gif-4.jpg"
                      alt="launch vlc"
                ></p>
<p>Run VLC Media Player and then click on “Media” &gt; “Open File” to upload the AVI file from your PC or Mac.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Select the Video Frame</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-converting-avi-to-gif-5.jpg"
                      alt="select video frame vlc"
                ></p>
<p>As you can see, the video will start running on your VLC media player screen. Now, select the video frame for getting the desired animation. Next, go to the “Video” menu and choose “Take Snapshop”. This step will save the video frame in the PNG format to the My Pictures folder.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Open MSPaint</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-converting-avi-to-gif-6.jpg"
                      alt="open ms paint"
                ></p>
<p>You will have to open MSPaint on your PC. When it opens, click on the “File” menu and then open the snapshot that you had taken in the previous step. Again, click on “File” &gt; “Save As” &gt; “GIF” to download your GIF.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Consistency Across Projects:</strong> If you’re managing multiple projects or a series of videos, having a standard format ensures that all your content has a uniform look and feel. Consistency is a hallmark of professional-grade content. It’s not just about the visuals – maintaining a uniform audio quality and format is equally significant. With a preset, you no longer need to remember the minutiae of each setting, ensuring consistency effortlessly.</li>
<li><strong>Speed Up Your Workflow:</strong> Every minute you spend adjusting the sequence settings is a minute less you have for cutting, color correcting, audio mixing, or adding those special effects that make your videos pop. Over time, those minutes can add up to hours. By using a custom sequence preset, you can jump straight into the creative part of editing without the preliminary setup.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Common Mistakes:</strong> Have you ever rendered an entire project only to find that the frame rate was off or the audio was set to the wrong sample rate? These kinds of errors can occur when setting up a new sequence from scratch each time. By relying on a preset, you mitigate the risks of such oversights.</li>
<li><strong>Personalized Templates for Different Platforms:</strong> Different platforms may have varying preferred settings. For instance, the ideal video format for YouTube might differ from that of Instagram or TikTok. Instead of Googling these settings each time, you can have a custom sequence preset ready for each platform, ensuring your content is optimized wherever it’s destined.</li>
<li><strong>Ease of Collaboration:</strong> If you’re working as part of a team, having standard sequence presets ensures everyone is on the same page. This is particularly handy when multiple editors are working on different segments of the same project. With custom presets, you’re not just aligning sequences but also visions.</li>

<p>Incorporating this practice into your editing routine might initially seem trivial, but its benefits compound with time.</p>
