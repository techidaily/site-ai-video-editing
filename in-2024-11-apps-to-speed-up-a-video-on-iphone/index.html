It may go from basic editing to VFX and so on. Speed ramping is also an important feature of editing. Creators who make cinematics or B-rolls often may have used this feature.</p>
<p>Changing the speed of the whole video doesn’t look good in most situations therefore speed ramping feature was created. Speed Ramping means gradually changing the speed of a clip over time. It isn’t a complex thing but doing it correctly in the right amount at the right time can change the feel of the whole video. It catches the attention of viewers through different scenes of a clip.</p>
<p>So, here we have mentioned some iPhone video editing softwares that can at least do basic speed changes. but most of them can also do advanced speed ramping. These are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Filmora Go:</strong></p>

It also supports multiple layers. It has built-in effects, transitions, and presets to speed up the editing process.</p>
<p>It is a paid video editor but you can try it for free, free trial includes most of the features but it leaves a watermark on export.</p>
<p><strong>~Features:</strong></p>
<ul>

<li>Supports multiple images and video layers.</li>
<li>Have many presets and filters for fast pace editing.</li>
<li>Have cool features like chroma key, masking, keyframing, e.t.c.</li>
<li>Supports “Pixabay’s” stock library.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>~Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Its UI doesn’t support editing in landscape orientation.</li>
<li>It doesn’t support 4k video resolution.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid iPhone Video speeding Softwares?</em></strong></p>
<p>It usually depends on your needs. If you just want a speed editor to make slow-mo or timelapse videos for your social media then you should go for free video editors, as they are easy to use and provide better speed ramping features than some paid video editors mentioned here.</p>
<p>But as a content creator if you want more features alongside speed ramping then you should go for paid softwares mentioned above. As mobile video editors are quite affordable and some of them have features like that of some PC softwares.</p>
<p><strong>FAQs about Speed ramping feature and softwares:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) What is Speed Ramping and where it is used?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Speed Ramping is different from just changing the speed of the whole clip. It means changing the speed of the video gradually, so the clip doesn’t feel jumpy.</p>
<p>It is done to give viewers a smooth experience between different parts of the clip. like the fast-forward clip is used to show the passage of time. and the slow-mo is used to emphasize something or produce tension, while a mix of both is used in ads and action scenes, e.t.c.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) How to do Speed Ramping?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Speed Ramping methods vary from software to software. Either you can do it by adding keyframes and changing speed with time or you can add or adjust curves for speed change. If your software doesn’t support the speed ramping feature, you can split a clip into parts and apply speed change to them differently. For some of the best iPhone softwares, we have mentioned the speed ramping steps above.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) What FPS is best for Slo-mo videos?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Shooting at 60 Fps is ideal as it gives a smooth and crisp video and you can make slow motion easily if required, you can slow it down up to 40% of its speed while maintaining the quality. It is supported in almost most devices nowadays. And if you want to create super slo-mo for your cinematics or product video then 120 or 240 fps is preferable. But higher fps often have disadvantages as it is harder to apply visual effects or masks. So choose the frame rate according to your requirements.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) Does changing the speed of video affect its audio?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, changing the speed of video affects the audio, It affects its pitch (tempo). Increasing its speed increases the pitch of the audio making it sound shrill while decreasing the speed of the video or making slow-mo decreases the pitch making it sound deep.</p>
<p>Although, some softwares provide the feature to maintain the pitch while changing the speed of the clip.</p>
<p><strong>~Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Its UI doesn’t support editing in landscape orientation.</li>
<li>It doesn’t support 4k video resolution.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid iPhone Video speeding Softwares?</em></strong></p>
<p>It usually depends on your needs. If you just want a speed editor to make slow-mo or timelapse videos for your social media then you should go for free video editors, as they are easy to use and provide better speed ramping features than some paid video editors mentioned here.</p>

<p><strong>FAQs about Speed ramping feature and softwares:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) What is Speed Ramping and where it is used?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Speed Ramping is different from just changing the speed of the whole clip. It means changing the speed of the video gradually, so the clip doesn’t feel jumpy.</p>
<p>It is done to give viewers a smooth experience between different parts of the clip. like the fast-forward clip is used to show the passage of time. and the slow-mo is used to emphasize something or produce tension, while a mix of both is used in ads and action scenes, e.t.c.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) How to do Speed Ramping?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Speed Ramping methods vary from software to software. Either you can do it by adding keyframes and changing speed with time or you can add or adjust curves for speed change. If your software doesn’t support the speed ramping feature, you can split a clip into parts and apply speed change to them differently. For some of the best iPhone softwares, we have mentioned the speed ramping steps above.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) What FPS is best for Slo-mo videos?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Shooting at 60 Fps is ideal as it gives a smooth and crisp video and you can make slow motion easily if required, you can slow it down up to 40% of its speed while maintaining the quality. It is supported in almost most devices nowadays. And if you want to create super slo-mo for your cinematics or product video then 120 or 240 fps is preferable. But higher fps often have disadvantages as it is harder to apply visual effects or masks. So choose the frame rate according to your requirements.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) Does changing the speed of video affect its audio?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, changing the speed of video affects the audio, It affects its pitch (tempo). Increasing its speed increases the pitch of the audio making it sound shrill while decreasing the speed of the video or making slow-mo decreases the pitch making it sound deep.</p>
<p>Although, some softwares provide the feature to maintain the pitch while changing the speed of the clip.</p>
<p><strong>~Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Its UI doesn’t support editing in landscape orientation.</li>
<li>It doesn’t support 4k video resolution.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid iPhone Video speeding Softwares?</em></strong></p>
<p>It usually depends on your needs. If you just want a speed editor to make slow-mo or timelapse videos for your social media then you should go for free video editors, as they are easy to use and provide better speed ramping features than some paid video editors mentioned here.</p>
<p>But as a content creator if you want more features alongside speed ramping then you should go for paid softwares mentioned above. As mobile video editors are quite affordable and some of them have features like that of some PC softwares.</p>
<p><strong>FAQs about Speed ramping feature and softwares:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) What is Speed Ramping and where it is used?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Speed Ramping is different from just changing the speed of the whole clip. It means changing the speed of the video gradually, so the clip doesn’t feel jumpy.</p>
<p>It is done to give viewers a smooth experience between different parts of the clip. like the fast-forward clip is used to show the passage of time. and the slow-mo is used to emphasize something or produce tension, while a mix of both is used in ads and action scenes, e.t.c.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) How to do Speed Ramping?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Speed Ramping methods vary from software to software. Either you can do it by adding keyframes and changing speed with time or you can add or adjust curves for speed change. If your software doesn’t support the speed ramping feature, you can split a clip into parts and apply speed change to them differently. For some of the best iPhone softwares, we have mentioned the speed ramping steps above.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) What FPS is best for Slo-mo videos?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Shooting at 60 Fps is ideal as it gives a smooth and crisp video and you can make slow motion easily if required, you can slow it down up to 40% of its speed while maintaining the quality. It is supported in almost most devices nowadays. And if you want to create super slo-mo for your cinematics or product video then 120 or 240 fps is preferable. But higher fps often have disadvantages as it is harder to apply visual effects or masks. So choose the frame rate according to your requirements.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) Does changing the speed of video affect its audio?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, changing the speed of video affects the audio, It affects its pitch (tempo). Increasing its speed increases the pitch of the audio making it sound shrill while decreasing the speed of the video or making slow-mo decreases the pitch making it sound deep.</p>
<p>Although, some softwares provide the feature to maintain the pitch while changing the speed of the clip.</p>
<p><strong>~Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Its UI doesn’t support editing in landscape orientation.</li>
<li>It doesn’t support 4k video resolution.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid iPhone Video speeding Softwares?</em></strong></p>
<p>It usually depends on your needs. If you just want a speed editor to make slow-mo or timelapse videos for your social media then you should go for free video editors, as they are easy to use and provide better speed ramping features than some paid video editors mentioned here.</p>
<p>But as a content creator if you want more features alongside speed ramping then you should go for paid softwares mentioned above. As mobile video editors are quite affordable and some of them have features like that of some PC softwares.</p>
<p><strong>FAQs about Speed ramping feature and softwares:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) What is Speed Ramping and where it is used?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Speed Ramping is different from just changing the speed of the whole clip. It means changing the speed of the video gradually, so the clip doesn’t feel jumpy.</p>
<p>It is done to give viewers a smooth experience between different parts of the clip. like the fast-forward clip is used to show the passage of time. and the slow-mo is used to emphasize something or produce tension, while a mix of both is used in ads and action scenes, e.t.c.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) How to do Speed Ramping?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Speed Ramping methods vary from software to software. Either you can do it by adding keyframes and changing speed with time or you can add or adjust curves for speed change. If your software doesn’t support the speed ramping feature, you can split a clip into parts and apply speed change to them differently. For some of the best iPhone softwares, we have mentioned the speed ramping steps above.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) What FPS is best for Slo-mo videos?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Shooting at 60 Fps is ideal as it gives a smooth and crisp video and you can make slow motion easily if required, you can slow it down up to 40% of its speed while maintaining the quality. It is supported in almost most devices nowadays. And if you want to create super slo-mo for your cinematics or product video then 120 or 240 fps is preferable. But higher fps often have disadvantages as it is harder to apply visual effects or masks. So choose the frame rate according to your requirements.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) Does changing the speed of video affect its audio?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, changing the speed of video affects the audio, It affects its pitch (tempo). Increasing its speed increases the pitch of the audio making it sound shrill while decreasing the speed of the video or making slow-mo decreases the pitch making it sound deep.</p>
<p>Although, some softwares provide the feature to maintain the pitch while changing the speed of the clip.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Adding video to the timelines will allow you to create a workspace to edit your video.</p>
<p>Now let’s move on to how we will add the text tile to our video.</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Add-the-Text-Tile"><a href="#Step3-Add-the-Text-Tile" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Add the Text Tile"></a>Step3 Add the Text Tile</h5><p>It is time to add the text tile you will animate behind the object. To do that, follow the steps mentioned as such.:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the <strong>Titles</strong> icon on the bar above the import library.</li>
<li>A drop-down option will be available on the left side.</li>
<li>Scroll down to the <strong>Plain text</strong>.</li>
<li>Here, you can see many text tiles to add to your video.</li>
<li>You can choose anyone you like.</li>
<li>The most commonly used tile is the <strong>Basic 6</strong>.</li>
<li>When you add the text tile to the timeline, you must ensure that the text is of equal length to the video.</li>
<li>To do that, drag the right corner of the text tile and drag it to the right to match the length of the video.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h5 id="Step4-Edit-the-Text-Tile"><a href="#Step4-Edit-the-Text-Tile" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Edit the Text Tile"></a>Step4 Edit the Text Tile</h5><p>After you have added the text tile you desire, you need to type in the text. For this article, we will keep it simple. We will be typing a simple statement such as “<strong>Hello, World.</strong>“</p>
<ul>
<li>Double-click the Text tile to open the settings menu.</li>
<li>After the settings menu is opened, type in the text box on the import window.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will notice changes on the main window that your text has changed.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="edit the text tile"

<li>Look above the text window, and you will see the type of text font selected.</li>
<li>Click on the drop-down option and choose whatever you like.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s move on to animate the text tile.</p>
<h5 id="Step5-Animate-the-text-tile"><a href="#Step5-Animate-the-text-tile" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Animate the text tile"></a>Step5 Animate the text tile</h5><p>After adding text, it is time to animate it. This animation will decide how your text will appear behind the target object.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, you must open the text settings by <strong>double-clicking</strong> on the text tile in the timeline.</li>
<li>In the settings opened in the import window, you will have to click on the animation tab in the upper left corner, aside from the <strong>Preset</strong></li>
<li>Now scroll down to where you will see the <strong>Right Roll</strong></li>
<li>Click on <strong>Right Roll</strong> and then click on the <strong>OK</strong> in the bottom right corner of the import window.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-6.png"
                      alt="animate the text"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You may notice now that the text appears in front of our object. Don’t worry now! We are getting there. With a few simple steps, we will see the results.</p>
<p>Now let us move on to the more significant part of the editing, masking the object. Again, look ahead to see how you can mask the object!</p>
<h5 id="Step6-Mask-the-Object"><a href="#Step6-Mask-the-Object" class="headerlink" title="Step6 Mask the Object"></a>Step6 Mask the Object</h5><p>To mask our object, we will need to be technical. We will begin by adding the same footage of the static object on our timeline. Follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drag and drop the static object footage above the timeline text. Make sure the text stays in the middle of the sandwich.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-7.png"
                      alt="add the main video above the text tile"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>We will hide the video in the first track to simplify things. In addition, this will make our editing easier.</li>
<li>We will have to look in the effects library to insert the masking effect.</li>
<li>You can see the <strong>Effects</strong> icon on the bar at the top.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Effects</strong>.</li>
<li>You will see the search bar at the top of the import window.</li>
<li>In the search bar, type in Image mask.</li>
<li>Drag the <strong>Image mask</strong> effect on the video above the text tile.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now the masking effect has been added. But we would have to adjust so that it stays upon our object.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> on the video and the settings option will open up.</li>
<li>Go into the <strong>Effects</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You must select your target object’s mask shape exactly as its shape.</p>
<ul>
<li>We have to mask out a building, so that we will need a vertical rectangle.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-8.png"
                      alt="change the shape of the image mask"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>After you have selected the shape of your object, we will need to convert it to the object’s size so that it only masks the building.</li>
<li>To do that, scroll down below the import window to the settings.</li>
<li>Here you can see the X, Y, and width settings.</li>
<li>First, move the width bar so that it matches the width of the building.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="change the width of the mask"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Now drag the X bar until the mask is confined to the building. You would have created the mask only limited to the building.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="change the position of the mask by dragging x"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Once you complete this step, click OK in the bottom right corner.</li>
<li>Now un-hide the original video that you imported in the beginning.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, play the video in the main play window from the beginning.</p>

                      alt="final result of the static video"
                ></p>
<p>You have successfully created a text behind the object effect. Now that you know how to add text behind static objects let us move to learn how to add text to a video that has high contrast and a clean background.</p>

<p>Now that you have added the text, it is time to animate it.</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Take-a-snapshot"><a href="#Step3-Take-a-snapshot" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Take a snapshot"></a>Step3 Take a snapshot</h5><p>After typing in the text, you will notice in the main play window that your text still appears in front of your object. Therefore, we want to take it behind the object. To do so, first, you will need to take a snapshot.</p>
<p>Follow the steps mentioned to take a snapshot:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hide the main video. You can see the Eye icon aside from your main video in the edit column on the left side of the timeline.</li>
<li>Click on the Eye icon to hide the main video.</li>
<li>In the <strong>main play</strong> window, you will notice that the screen turns black, which leaves only the text on the screen.</li>
</ul>

                ></p>
<ul>
<li>In the main play screen, you can notice a small <strong>camera icon</strong>.</li>
<li>This camera icon is used to take snapshots of your screen.</li>
<li>Click on the camera icon to take a snapshot of your screen.</li>
<li>Your snapshot will now be saved in the main import window.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="snapshot is saved in the import library"
                ></p>
<p>Now that we have taken a snapshot, we will need to import it into the timeline. Scroll below for more.</p>
<h5 id="Step4-Add-the-snapshot"><a href="#Step4-Add-the-snapshot" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Add the snapshot"></a>Step4 Add the snapshot</h5><p>After taking it, your goal is to import it into the timeline. To perform this action, perform the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before adding the snapshot to the timeline, we must delete the main text tile.</li>
<li>Then drag and drop the snapshot from the import library into the timeline above the video.</li>
<li>Make sure that the snapshot is aligned well with the length of the video.</li>
<li>If it is <strong>longer</strong> than the video, drag it from the right to match the length of the video.</li>
<li>If its length is <strong>smaller</strong> than the video, drag it to the right to increase its length.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adjust the length of the snapshot"
                ></p>
<p>After adding the snapshot, we will have to change its blending mode.</p>
<h5 id="Step5-Change-the-blending-of-the-snapshot"><a href="#Step5-Change-the-blending-of-the-snapshot" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Change the blending of the snapshot"></a>Step5 Change the blending of the snapshot</h5><p>To create the effect of your text behind the video, you must alter the main text’s blending mode. In this case, it will be the snapshot we took.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Changing the blending mode of the snapshot will allow it to blend with the transparent background and will create the effect of the text behind the object in the video.</p>
<p>Follow the steps mentioned below to change the blending of the snapshot:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> the snapshot.</li>
<li>If you select the compositing tab, the blending options will pop up.</li>
<li>From default, it would be set to <strong>Normal</strong>. Click on the <strong>Normal</strong></li>
<li>It will show a drop-down option.</li>
<li>Scroll down below until you can see an option labeled Then click on <strong>Overlay.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="change the blending mode to overlay"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>And press <strong>OK</strong> in the bottom right corner to confirm your changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>The text can be blended with the background.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>Eye icon</strong> to un-hide the video from the timeline.</li>
<li>Now play the video from the start from the main play screen to see the final changes.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Adding video to the timelines will allow you to create a workspace to edit your video.</p>
<p>Now let’s move on to how we will add the text tile to our video.</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Add-the-Text-Tile-1"><a href="#Step3-Add-the-Text-Tile-1" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Add the Text Tile"></a>Step3 Add the Text Tile</h5><p>It is time to add the text tile you will animate behind the object. To do that, follow the steps mentioned as such.:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the <strong>Titles</strong> icon on the bar above the import library.</li>
<li>A drop-down option will be available on the left side.</li>
<li>Scroll down to the <strong>Plain text</strong>.</li>
<li>Here, you can see many text tiles to add to your video.</li>
<li>You can choose anyone you like.</li>
<li>The most commonly used tile is the <strong>Basic 6</strong>.</li>
<li>When you add the text tile to the timeline, you must ensure that the text is of equal length to the video.</li>
<li>To do that, drag the right corner of the text tile and drag it to the right to match the length of the video.</li>
</ul>
<p><img

For this article, we will keep it simple. We will be typing a simple statement such as “<strong>Hello, World.</strong>“</p>
<ul>
<li>Double-click the Text tile to open the settings menu.</li>
<li>After the settings menu is opened, type in the text box on the import window.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will notice changes on the main window that your text has changed.</p>
<p><img

<li>Look above the text window, and you will see the type of text font selected.</li>
<li>Click on the drop-down option and choose whatever you like.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s move on to animate the text tile.</p>
<h5 id="Step5-Animate-the-text-tile-1"><a href="#Step5-Animate-the-text-tile-1" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Animate the text tile"></a>Step5 Animate the text tile</h5><p>After adding text, it is time to animate it. This animation will decide how your text will appear behind the target object.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, you must open the text settings by <strong>double-clicking</strong> on the text tile in the timeline.</li>
<li>In the settings opened in the import window, you will have to click on the animation tab in the upper left corner, aside from the <strong>Preset</strong></li>
<li>Now scroll down to where you will see the <strong>Right Roll</strong></li>
<li>Click on <strong>Right Roll</strong> and then click on the <strong>OK</strong> in the bottom right corner of the import window.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You may notice now that the text appears in front of our object. Don’t worry now! We are getting there. With a few simple steps, we will see the results.</p>
<p>Now let us move on to the more significant part of the editing, masking the object. Again, look ahead to see how you can mask the object!</p>
<h5 id="Step6-Mask-the-Object-1"><a href="#Step6-Mask-the-Object-1" class="headerlink" title="Step6 Mask the Object"></a>Step6 Mask the Object</h5><p>To mask our object, we will need to be technical. We will begin by adding the same footage of the static object on our timeline. Follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drag and drop the static object footage above the timeline text. Make sure the text stays in the middle of the sandwich.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-7.png"
                      alt="add the main video above the text tile"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>We will hide the video in the first track to simplify things. In addition, this will make our editing easier.</li>
<li>We will have to look in the effects library to insert the masking effect.</li>
<li>You can see the <strong>Effects</strong> icon on the bar at the top.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Effects</strong>.</li>
<li>You will see the search bar at the top of the import window.</li>
<li>In the search bar, type in Image mask.</li>
<li>Drag the <strong>Image mask</strong> effect on the video above the text tile.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now the masking effect has been added. But we would have to adjust so that it stays upon our object.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> on the video and the settings option will open up.</li>
<li>Go into the <strong>Effects</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You must select your target object’s mask shape exactly as its shape.</p>
<ul>
<li>We have to mask out a building, so that we will need a vertical rectangle.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="change the shape of the image mask"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>After you have selected the shape of your object, we will need to convert it to the object’s size so that it only masks the building.</li>
<li>To do that, scroll down below the import window to the settings.</li>
<li>Here you can see the X, Y, and width settings.</li>
<li>First, move the width bar so that it matches the width of the building.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="change the width of the mask"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Now drag the X bar until the mask is confined to the building. You would have created the mask only limited to the building.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="change the position of the mask by dragging x"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Once you complete this step, click OK in the bottom right corner.</li>
<li>Now un-hide the original video that you imported in the beginning.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, play the video in the main play window from the beginning.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="final result of the static video"
                ></p>
<p>You have successfully created a text behind the object effect. Now that you know how to add text behind static objects let us move to learn how to add text to a video that has high contrast and a clean background.</p>

<ul>
<li>Our next step would be to add the text.</li>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> on the text tile. Doing so will open the settings menu in the import window.</li>
<li>Type in the text that you want. For reference, we will keep it simple such as, <strong>“Hello world.”</strong></li>
<li>You can also adjust the font of your text.</li>
<li>Above the type box, a drop-down option will show you the range of fonts available.</li>
<li>Select the font you desire.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now that you have added the text, it is time to animate it.</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Take-a-snapshot-1"><a href="#Step3-Take-a-snapshot-1" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Take a snapshot"></a>Step3 Take a snapshot</h5><p>After typing in the text, you will notice in the main play window that your text still appears in front of your object. Therefore, we want to take it behind the object. To do so, first, you will need to take a snapshot.</p>
<p>Follow the steps mentioned to take a snapshot:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hide the main video. You can see the Eye icon aside from your main video in the edit column on the left side of the timeline.</li>
<li>Click on the Eye icon to hide the main video.</li>
<li>In the <strong>main play</strong> window, you will notice that the screen turns black, which leaves only the text on the screen.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="taking a snapshot"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>In the main play screen, you can notice a small <strong>camera icon</strong>.</li>
<li>This camera icon is used to take snapshots of your screen.</li>
<li>Click on the camera icon to take a snapshot of your screen.</li>
<li>Your snapshot will now be saved in the main import window.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="snapshot is saved in the import library"
                ></p>
<p>Now that we have taken a snapshot, we will need to import it into the timeline. Scroll below for more.</p>
<h5 id="Step4-Add-the-snapshot-1"><a href="#Step4-Add-the-snapshot-1" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Add the snapshot"></a>Step4 Add the snapshot</h5><p>After taking it, your goal is to import it into the timeline. To perform this action, perform the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before adding the snapshot to the timeline, we must delete the main text tile.</li>
<li>Then drag and drop the snapshot from the import library into the timeline above the video.</li>
<li>Make sure that the snapshot is aligned well with the length of the video.</li>
<li>If it is <strong>longer</strong> than the video, drag it from the right to match the length of the video.</li>
<li>If its length is <strong>smaller</strong> than the video, drag it to the right to increase its length.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adjust the length of the snapshot"
                ></p>
<p>After adding the snapshot, we will have to change its blending mode.</p>
<h5 id="Step5-Change-the-blending-of-the-snapshot-1"><a href="#Step5-Change-the-blending-of-the-snapshot-1" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Change the blending of the snapshot"></a>Step5 Change the blending of the snapshot</h5><p>To create the effect of your text behind the video, you must alter the main text’s blending mode. In this case, it will be the snapshot we took.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Changing the blending mode of the snapshot will allow it to blend with the transparent background and will create the effect of the text behind the object in the video.</p>
<p>Follow the steps mentioned below to change the blending of the snapshot:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> the snapshot.</li>
<li>If you select the compositing tab, the blending options will pop up.</li>
<li>From default, it would be set to <strong>Normal</strong>. Click on the <strong>Normal</strong></li>
<li>It will show a drop-down option.</li>
<li>Scroll down below until you can see an option labeled Then click on <strong>Overlay.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-18.png"
                      alt="change the blending mode to overlay"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>And press <strong>OK</strong> in the bottom right corner to confirm your changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>The text can be blended with the background.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>Eye icon</strong> to un-hide the video from the timeline.</li>
<li>Now play the video from the start from the main play screen to see the final changes.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

And if you work with videos, knowing which clips to use and where to cut is essential in conveying your story and increasing its impact. So, if you are a beginner and want to familiarise yourself with steps and terms used in video editing, in this article, we will go through the steps you will need to cut your video file in Adobe Premiere Pro and Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<p><em>This guide uses Adobe Premiere Pro 2022 and Wondershare Filmora X.</em></p>
<h2 id="How-to-cut-video-in-Adobe-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#How-to-cut-video-in-Adobe-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="How to cut video in Adobe Premiere Pro?"></a>How to cut video in Adobe Premiere Pro?</h2><p>Once you have Adobe Premiere Pro open on your computer, follow the steps listed below.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Create a new project in Premiere Pro.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-1.jpeg"
                      alt="cut-video-in-premiere"
                ></p>
<p>During project creation, we recommend keeping an eye on the file name set and the storage location; this can help reduce the time spent in locating the Premiere Project.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-2.jpeg"
                      alt="cut-video-in-premiere"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Import a video file into Premiere Pro with a double click in the marked area and choose the file from its stored location.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-3.jpeg"
                      alt="cut-video-in-premiere"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Double click on any imported media to activate it and send it to the Source Window.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-4.jpeg"
                      alt="cut-video-in-premiere"
                ></p>
<p>You can continue to import more media by double-clicking within the marked area. For better organization, users can also create <strong>Bins</strong>, which are folders within a Premiere Pro File that are often in use to sort out imported media.</p>
<p><em>Users can create Bins with a right-click in the red box marked area (refer to image above).</em></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Select either the whole clip or a part of it from the Source Window and drag it onto the Timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-5.jpeg"
                      alt="cut-video-in-premiere"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Select the Razor Tool from the Tools Window. Now, pick the point where you want to introduce a cut and confirm with your left mouse button; this will split your video track into two parts.</p>
<p>Make a second cut where desired, following which you can move around the newly generated clip or delete it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/cut-video-in-premiere-6.jpeg"
                      alt="cut-video-in-premiere"
                ></p>
<p>**Tip:**You can also select the Razor Tool by pressing C on the keyboard_._</p>
<p>We also recommend using the <em>Snap in Timeline</em> feature (activated with (S) on your keyboard or by choosing the magnet option), which will match your mouse pointer with the Playhead to ensure your cut will match the exact frame shown on your screen.</p>
<p>-—————————————————————————————————————————————-</p>
<p><strong>Some more tips for Adobe Premiere Pro:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Using the I and O keys on your keyboard while playing a video in the Source Window will allow you to set an <strong>In Point</strong>and an <strong>Out Point.</strong> These markers will allow you to move a specific part of your video file into the Timeline, thus, reducing the amount of time spent making the right cut.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>We have tagged the Mark In and Mark Out buttons with a Green Box in the image below.</em></p>
<ol>
<li>Clicking on the Step Frame Buttons [marked in Yellow] will also help increase the accuracy of your cut by allowing you to select the exact moment you desire.</li>
<li>You can also mark a Point of Interest in your video file with the help of Markers in Premiere Pro. These afford you the ability to come back to the moment at a later time and see why it interested you in the first place, as editing sessions can often take hours at an end.</li>

Opening the application throws you straight into a project, and following this, you can import a video file and begin editing. From the process you will learn below, it is easy to assume that Wondershare Filmora is more convenient for beginners and provides software features that match paid professional software.</p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>

<p>For macOS 10.14 or later</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you don’t have Wondershare Filmora installed, you can get the video editor by visiting its <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >official website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Once the setup program download completes, execute it and begin the installation process.</p>
<p>Once you have the editing software open, follow the steps listed below.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Import a video file by clicking on the import window.</p>
<p>The default project setting for Filmora X is 1920x1080 at 25 frames per second. Users can change this to match their video file by going into Project Settings under the File tab or by accepting the automatic prompt that appears when dragging the video file onto the Timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you have a PC with weak hardware, Wondershare Filmora gives you the option to create Video Proxies that will reduce the load on your computer by creating smaller clips that are lower in size, resulting in a smoother and faster experience. You can also do this in Premiere Pro, but Filmora does it for you automatically once given permission.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Drag the video file onto the Timeline to begin previewing it in the Playback Window and commence editing operations.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="cut-video-in-premiere"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Locate where you want to cut in the video file and click on the orange scissors option to split the video file.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="cut-video-in-premiere"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> You can also use the keyboard shortcut (CTRL+B) to cut without using a mouse click, in case you make use of a trackpad while editing.</p>
<p>The Bottom Line</p>
<p>As said earlier, knowing where to cut is essential in improving the feel of your video, and we hope this guide showed you exactly how to perform the actions to create your best project. If you are a beginner, the simplistic approach of Wondershare Filmora will be more welcoming and easier to navigate. In addition, the software is also free to download, with added features that you can activate by paying a monthly, yearly, or one-time fee. Adobe Premiere Pro is an option worth considering if you plan on using third-party plugins and other applications from the Creative Cloud Suite.</p>

<p>The Bottom Line</p>
<p>As said earlier, knowing where to cut is essential in improving the feel of your video, and we hope this guide showed you exactly how to perform the actions to create your best project. If you are a beginner, the simplistic approach of Wondershare Filmora will be more welcoming and easier to navigate. In addition, the software is also free to download, with added features that you can activate by paying a monthly, yearly, or one-time fee. Adobe Premiere Pro is an option worth considering if you plan on using third-party plugins and other applications from the Creative Cloud Suite.</p>
<p>During project creation, we recommend keeping an eye on the file name set and the storage location; this can help reduce the time spent in locating the Premiere Project.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Import a video file into Premiere Pro with a double click in the marked area and choose the file from its stored location.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="cut-video-in-premiere"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Double click on any imported media to activate it and send it to the Source Window.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="cut-video-in-premiere"
                ></p>
<p>You can continue to import more media by double-clicking within the marked area. For better organization, users can also create <strong>Bins</strong>, which are folders within a Premiere Pro File that are often in use to sort out imported media.</p>
<p><em>Users can create Bins with a right-click in the red box marked area (refer to image above).</em></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Select either the whole clip or a part of it from the Source Window and drag it onto the Timeline.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Select the Razor Tool from the Tools Window. Now, pick the point where you want to introduce a cut and confirm with your left mouse button; this will split your video track into two parts.</p>
<p>Make a second cut where desired, following which you can move around the newly generated clip or delete it.</p>

                ></p>
<p>**Tip:**You can also select the Razor Tool by pressing C on the keyboard_._</p>
<p>We also recommend using the <em>Snap in Timeline</em> feature (activated with (S) on your keyboard or by choosing the magnet option), which will match your mouse pointer with the Playhead to ensure your cut will match the exact frame shown on your screen.</p>

People tend to rely on several effects to exceed the quality of the beloved videos. VHS is the most used effect, popular in professional and personal videos. It stands for “Video Home System” and is often integrated with noises, color bleeding, and smooth glitches.</p>
<p>With <strong>VHS-style</strong> videos, you can not only make videos more high-class but can also intuitively define their worth. If you are new to this field, you should get familiar with the VHS effects in video. This context will provide basic information about <strong>VHS tapes</strong> and how to add VHS effects to videos.</p>

An Overview of the 70s Sensation</h2><p>From definition to usability, every piece of information plays an important role in your videography journey. Don’t worry if you don’t have video editing skills or know what <strong>VHS means</strong>. This section will provide you with reliable information about this:</p>
<h3 id="What-Do-You-Mean-by-VHS-Technology"><a href="#What-Do-You-Mean-by-VHS-Technology" class="headerlink" title="What Do You Mean by VHS Technology?"></a>What Do You Mean by VHS Technology?</h3><p>VHS, also known as Video Home System, are the auditory artifacts and visual glitches you see in the pictures. It creates a sense of distortion in the video, making the viewer think the camera equipment is malfunctioning. From the 1980s to the 1990s, this effect gained considerable popularity among video creators and viewers.</p>
<p>In recent years, retro lovers have brought this intuitive effect again into a trend to create a perfect flashback scene. The nostalgic and vintage appeal of these effects is insane. VHS is not just one effect because it divides into further categories. You are also free to select the VHS effects according to the theme of your video and the scene you are going to create.</p>
<h3 id="Key-Aspects-of-The-VHS-Effects"><a href="#Key-Aspects-of-The-VHS-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Key Aspects of The VHS Effects"></a>Key Aspects of The VHS Effects</h3><p>Several key aspects are crucial to making high-quality VHS effects in the videos. You can see some of the key aspects listed and discussed here:</p>
<ul>
<li>**Tracking Lines of VHS:**The <strong>VHS tapes</strong> are integrated with magnetic strips to sort audio and video signals. However, over time, these tapes degraded, leading to glitches in playback with noticeable distortion.</li>
<li>**Video Color Bleeding:**You must have noticed that color is bleeding in the VHS videos. In this, the colors in the videos are quite smudged and mixed. This together adds the unique yet smoother distortion in the videos.</li>
<li>**Vintage and Glitching:**Vintage and glitches are essential to videos with VHS effects. This was initially caused by the limitations of playback equipment and signal interference. At this time, people add <strong>glitch VHS</strong> to the videos in a manual manner to add a sense of interference in the scene.</li>
<li>**Noise and Jitters:**VHS tapes are known to be susceptible to wrappings and jitters. It causes a slightly unstable effect in the videos in the form of distorted objects. Moreover, the grainy and noisy appearance due to analog recording technology is also a part of this effect.</li>
</ul>
