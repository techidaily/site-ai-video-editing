<p>Part 2: Using Filmora to combine, merge, and join clips</p>
<p>To join videos, first, import them.</p>

                ></p>
<p>You can drag the files from Windows File Explorer to the User’s Album or click the “Import” button on the window and choose files from your computer. All imported files will appear in thumbnail format in the User’s Album. To preview a file in the right-hand preview window, double-click it.</p>

                      alt="combine-video-instagram-"
                ></p>
<p>Move videos from the User’s Album to the video track on the Timeline after that. All video files will be combined into a single video with no transition. However, you can use the following method to add transitions between video clips.</p>

                      alt="combine-video-instagram-"
                ></p>

<p>Apple’s iMovie app is available for free on iPhones, iPad, and Mac. Here’s how to combine two or more videos for an Instagram post:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Get iMovie and open it on your iPhone.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Select Movie from the Create Project menu.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Choose your movies. To see only the clips, go to the top left and tap Media, then Video. Choose a video and press the check button.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Tap Create Movie after selecting two or more video clips.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Swipe horizontally to the point where one video clip ends and another begins if desired. You can edit or remove the transition effect between videos by tapping the two triangle icon.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Optional: You can also experiment with other iMovie features such as adding music, text, and video speed changes. You can tap a video clip, tap the tiny plus icon, and zoom in and out with two fingers.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When you’re done, tap Done in the top left corner.</p>
</li>
<li><p>From the bottom, tap the share button and select Save Video.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Your iPhone’s Photos app now contains the merged clip. Open Instagram and make an individual post with the final combined Video.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is how you can combine multiple clips into one Instagram video. I hope you found this quick tutorial helpful. Of course, you can merge two or more clips into one single video file using any other video editing app besides the ones listed above.</p>

Anyone can do it, but before you get started, we will share some do’s and don’ts to help you get the best results.</p>
<p>In fact, there are many ways to set up a green screen, but the most cost-efficient way is with a green screen fabric. If you are using a green fabric as a DIY green screen, make sure you steam or iron it out, whether taping it to a wall or hanging it off the rack. Keep in mind the green screen should not leave any wrinkles.</p>
<p>It is because wrinkles will make lighting the green screen a nightmare, and uneven lighting will leave you with shadows and disappointing results. It would help if you also pulled the green screen tight to get a seamless background. The better you do with the setup, the easier it will be the key it out later</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Lighting-a-Green-Screen"><a href="#Part-3-Lighting-a-Green-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Lighting a Green Screen"></a>Part 3: Lighting a Green Screen</h2><p>It doesn’t matter how nice your green screen is. You won’t get good results if you don’t light it properly. When you light a green screen, be aware of these things.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure there are at least six feet of space between you and your green screen; therefore, you’re not casting a shadow that cannot be keyed out later.</li>
<li>Remember, any shadow on the green screen is bad. The lighting on the screen should be flat, even, and one-dimensional meaning. Please don’t place the screen leaning at an angle since they’ll make it harder to light evenly.</li>
<li>Do light yourself and your background separately. It will ensure your subject wouldn’t bleed into the green, which will create a halo around them.</li>
<li>After you key out the green screen and lighting, your subjects should emulate the lighting from your final footage. For example, if you know sunlight is coming from the left light, your subject is from the left direction as well.</li>
</ul>

However, don’t stop there. Clicking the chroma key button is not enough to guarantee perfectly keyed footage, so play around with the offset tolerance edge thickness and edge feather. Lastly, adjust it to make sure your edit looks as good as possible.</p>

<p>Color grading photography refers to a post-production process that improves your images by altering their color. The result of an excellent color grading process is an image that looks more appealing and refined. It’s what gives a picture some professional touch.</p>

Many people use both of them interchangeably, and that’s wrong. Although color grading and color correction are post-production processes that enhance image colors, they perform different roles.</p>
<p>Here’s how to differentiate color grading from color correction:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Differentiating Factor</th>
<th>Color Grading ;</th>
<th>Color Correction</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>Definition</td>
<td>Color grading is a process that enhances an image’s color by stylizing or giving it a cinematic appearance.</td>
<td>Color correction is a process that adjusts color mistakes in an image by giving it a consistent appearance. This process balances colors by adjusting whites and blacks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Purpose</td>
<td>The primary aim of color grading an image is to evoke specific emotions in the viewers. Color grading leverages the emotional and psychological effects of colors to manipulate the viewers’ moods. You can use color grading to give your images different tones or themes like fear, femininity, youthfulness, passion, anger, sadness, etc.</td>
<td>Unlike color grading, the color correction does very little in setting the tone or mood that an image carries. Instead, it corrects specific mistakes in the image to make it look as natural to the human eyes as possible. Generally, camera lenses and the human eyes view pictures differently. Color correction changes a photo’s look to make it more appealing to humans than the camera. It makes black colors appear darker and adds more white to whites to create the desired effect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Stage in the production process</td>
<td>Color grading typically comes after color correction in the post-production process. That’s because the effects of color grading are more appealing on a color-corrected picture.</td>
<td>Color correction comes before color grading. This process does the major work of balancing colors and correcting errors. Color grading only fine-tunes what color correction has done, giving it a professional finish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Example</td>
<td>One of the most obvious examples of color grading is in motion pictures. For example, Sci-Fi movies typically have a very saturated blue color. However, you will notice a little redder in romantic movies. Note that filmmakers can use different color grades in movies to draw attention to specific details or represent changes in the storyline. Color grading produces the same effects in pictures.</td>
<td>Color correction is most prominent in documentaries to make pictures and videos look more real to the human eye. Other times, color corrections just adjust one color to merge the rest of the image or video.</td>

<h2 id="Terms-and-Tools-Used-In-Color-Grading"><a href="#Terms-and-Tools-Used-In-Color-Grading" class="headerlink" title="Terms and Tools Used In Color Grading"></a>Terms and Tools Used In Color Grading</h2><p>These are the most common terminologies photo editors use when color grading an image:</p>
<h4 id="●-Hue"><a href="#●-Hue" class="headerlink" title="● Hue"></a>● Hue</h4><p>Hue is the general name for describing pure color. That means it defines color without alluding to its brightness, vividness, etc. It describes a color’s position in the color wheel.</p>
<h4 id="●-Saturation"><a href="#●-Saturation" class="headerlink" title="● Saturation"></a>● Saturation</h4><p>When a photo editor talks about saturation, they refer to the hue concentration that defines a specific color. Saturation describes color shades and focuses on how colorful they are. Examples of colors with zero saturation are white, black, and grey.</p>

                ></p>
<h4 id="●-Luminance"><a href="#●-Luminance" class="headerlink" title="● Luminance"></a>● Luminance</h4><p>Luminous describes how bright, well-lighted or dark a color is. Highlights, mids, and shadows can influence luminance.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="color grading photography - luminance"
                ></p>
<h4 id="●-Additive-Color"><a href="#●-Additive-Color" class="headerlink" title="● Additive Color"></a>● Additive Color</h4><p>Additive colors are non-primary colors. However, they typically result from mixing primary colors (blue, red, green).</p>
<h4 id="●-Color-Cast"><a href="#●-Color-Cast" class="headerlink" title="● Color Cast"></a>● Color Cast</h4><p>Color cast means that the image’s coloring doesn’t look as natural as it should be. This usually happens when different light sources get mixed.</p>
<h4 id="●-Temperature"><a href="#●-Temperature" class="headerlink" title="● Temperature"></a>● Temperature</h4><p>Temperature defines how cool or warm a color is. Cool temperatures typically describe blues and purples, while orange and red represent the warmth.</p>
<h3 id="The-essential-tools-for-color-grading-include"><a href="#The-essential-tools-for-color-grading-include" class="headerlink" title="The essential tools for color grading include"></a>The essential tools for color grading include</h3><h4 id="●-White-Balance"><a href="#●-White-Balance" class="headerlink" title="● White Balance"></a>● White Balance</h4><p>White balance helps to make your photos look more natural by correcting color cast issues. After using white balance, the result is that the whites in your pictures would look exactly like the human eye will perceive it. White balance adjusts your image’s color cast to make them look warmer or cooler.</p>
<h4 id="●-Brightness-and-Contrast"><a href="#●-Brightness-and-Contrast" class="headerlink" title="● Brightness and Contrast"></a>● Brightness and Contrast</h4><p>Brightness and contrast are essential in color grading and are among the most used photo editing tools. Different sliders control brightness and contrast during editing. It’s important to note that your image’s brightness will affect the contrast and vice-versa. That’s why they usually appear together, even if they refer to different tools.</p>
<h4 id="●-The-Three-Way-Color-Corrector"><a href="#●-The-Three-Way-Color-Corrector" class="headerlink" title="● The Three-Way Color Corrector"></a>● The Three-Way Color Corrector</h4><p>Many photographers refer to the three-way corrector as the color correction’s workhorse. That’s because this tool adjusts hue, saturation, brightness, and contrast in a single interface. The three-way corrector performs the job of three tools in one interface. Using the three-way corrector ensures that you work faster than usual.</p>
<h4 id="●-The-Fast-Color-Corrector"><a href="#●-The-Fast-Color-Corrector" class="headerlink" title="● The Fast Color Corrector"></a>● The Fast Color Corrector</h4><p>The fast color corrector is like the three-way corrector. However, there are many limitations with the number of potential looks you can achieve with this tool. The fast color corrector primarily focuses on adjusting tint and saturation. Its major advantage over the three-way corrector is its user-friendliness and simplicity.</p>
<h4 id="●-Curves"><a href="#●-Curves" class="headerlink" title="● Curves"></a>● Curves</h4><p>While using curves is pretty complicated, the tool offers impressive functionality that you can’t refuse. Curves are very powerful and precise. Their main function is to overhaul or remove your image’s brightness altogether to give it a distinctive look.</p>
<h4 id="●-The-Unsharp-Mask-and-Sharpening-Tools"><a href="#●-The-Unsharp-Mask-and-Sharpening-Tools" class="headerlink" title="● The Unsharp Mask and Sharpening Tools"></a>● The Unsharp Mask and Sharpening Tools</h4><p>With the unsharp mask and sharpening tools, you can give your picture’s edges a sharp illusion by modifying the contrast. This is typically useful for images that you shoot in dark conditions.</p>
<p>Sharp pictures are always a lovely sight. However, these tools can’t correct pictures taken out of focus. To get the best results from these tools. Then you can start moving them back till you get your desired sharpness.</p>
<h4 id="●-Color-Match"><a href="#●-Color-Match" class="headerlink" title="● Color Match"></a>● Color Match</h4><p>As the make implies, color match tools modify a target picture’s colors to fit the reference image. This is an automatic process and helps to save time.</p>
<h2 id="Common-Steps-To-Color-Grade-a-Photo"><a href="#Common-Steps-To-Color-Grade-a-Photo" class="headerlink" title="Common Steps To Color Grade a Photo"></a>Common Steps To Color Grade a Photo</h2><p>These are the essential stages for color grading your images:</p>
<p>● Step 1:<br>The first step in color grading is deciding how warm or cool you want your image to look. Then, modify the white balance to suit your desired warmth or coolness.</p>
<p>● Step 2:<br>After adjusting the white balance, the next step is to adjust saturation or hue.</p>
<p>● Step 3:<br>The next step is to focus on the histogram. A histogram is a common feature in many photo editing software that informs you of your image’s tonal values. The goal in this stage is to ensure equal color distribution. Keep adjusting your image till the colors are even.</p>
<p>● Step 4:<br>Work on your highlights and shadows by modifying the green, red, and blue curves. Also, adjust your vibrancy setting for a good effect.</p>
<p>● Step 5:<br>Explore split toning. Split toning is a process that involves adding colors to highlight and shadows independently. Learning how to split tone can make a difference in your photo editing.</p>

<ul>
<li>About oversaturation or under-saturation. Your saturation should be just right to produce the perfect result. So, always be sure to pay maximum attention to this process. This tip is particularly useful when working with portraits.</li>
<li>Remember that color grading doesn’t fix a bad shot. So, be sure to improve your photography skills and take the best shots for excellent color grading results.</li>

<p>Here’s how to differentiate color grading from color correction:</p>
<table>

</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>Definition</td>
<td>Color grading is a process that enhances an image’s color by stylizing or giving it a cinematic appearance.</td>
<td>Color correction is a process that adjusts color mistakes in an image by giving it a consistent appearance. This process balances colors by adjusting whites and blacks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Purpose</td>
<td>The primary aim of color grading an image is to evoke specific emotions in the viewers. Color grading leverages the emotional and psychological effects of colors to manipulate the viewers’ moods. You can use color grading to give your images different tones or themes like fear, femininity, youthfulness, passion, anger, sadness, etc.</td>
<td>Unlike color grading, the color correction does very little in setting the tone or mood that an image carries. Instead, it corrects specific mistakes in the image to make it look as natural to the human eyes as possible. Generally, camera lenses and the human eyes view pictures differently. Color correction changes a photo’s look to make it more appealing to humans than the camera. It makes black colors appear darker and adds more white to whites to create the desired effect.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Stage in the production process</td>
<td>Color grading typically comes after color correction in the post-production process. That’s because the effects of color grading are more appealing on a color-corrected picture.</td>
<td>Color correction comes before color grading. This process does the major work of balancing colors and correcting errors. Color grading only fine-tunes what color correction has done, giving it a professional finish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Example</td>
<td>One of the most obvious examples of color grading is in motion pictures. For example, Sci-Fi movies typically have a very saturated blue color. However, you will notice a little redder in romantic movies. Note that filmmakers can use different color grades in movies to draw attention to specific details or represent changes in the storyline. Color grading produces the same effects in pictures.</td>
<td>Color correction is most prominent in documentaries to make pictures and videos look more real to the human eye. Other times, color corrections just adjust one color to merge the rest of the image or video.</td>

Color correction changes a photo’s look to make it more appealing to humans than the camera. It makes black colors appear darker and adds more white to whites to create the desired effect.</td>

<tr>
<td>Stage in the production process</td>
<td>Color grading typically comes after color correction in the post-production process. That’s because the effects of color grading are more appealing on a color-corrected picture.</td>
<td>Color correction comes before color grading. This process does the major work of balancing colors and correcting errors. Color grading only fine-tunes what color correction has done, giving it a professional finish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Example</td>
<td>One of the most obvious examples of color grading is in motion pictures. For example, Sci-Fi movies typically have a very saturated blue color. However, you will notice a little redder in romantic movies. Note that filmmakers can use different color grades in movies to draw attention to specific details or represent changes in the storyline. Color grading produces the same effects in pictures.</td>
<td>Color correction is most prominent in documentaries to make pictures and videos look more real to the human eye. Other times, color corrections just adjust one color to merge the rest of the image or video.</td>

<h2 id="Terms-and-Tools-Used-In-Color-Grading-3"><a href="#Terms-and-Tools-Used-In-Color-Grading-3" class="headerlink" title="Terms and Tools Used In Color Grading"></a>Terms and Tools Used In Color Grading</h2><p>These are the most common terminologies photo editors use when color grading an image:</p>
<h4 id="●-Hue-3"><a href="#●-Hue-3" class="headerlink" title="● Hue"></a>● Hue</h4><p>Hue is the general name for describing pure color. That means it defines color without alluding to its brightness, vividness, etc. It describes a color’s position in the color wheel.</p>
<h4 id="●-Saturation-3"><a href="#●-Saturation-3" class="headerlink" title="● Saturation"></a>● Saturation</h4><p>When a photo editor talks about saturation, they refer to the hue concentration that defines a specific color. Saturation describes color shades and focuses on how colorful they are. Examples of colors with zero saturation are white, black, and grey.</p>

                      alt="color grading photography - saturation"
                ></p>
<h4 id="●-Luminance-3"><a href="#●-Luminance-3" class="headerlink" title="● Luminance"></a>● Luminance</h4><p>Luminous describes how bright, well-lighted or dark a color is. Highlights, mids, and shadows can influence luminance.</p>

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="color grading photography - luminance"
                ></p>
<h4 id="●-Additive-Color-3"><a href="#●-Additive-Color-3" class="headerlink" title="● Additive Color"></a>● Additive Color</h4><p>Additive colors are non-primary colors. However, they typically result from mixing primary colors (blue, red, green).</p>
<h4 id="●-Color-Cast-3"><a href="#●-Color-Cast-3" class="headerlink" title="● Color Cast"></a>● Color Cast</h4><p>Color cast means that the image’s coloring doesn’t look as natural as it should be. This usually happens when different light sources get mixed.</p>
<h4 id="●-Temperature-3"><a href="#●-Temperature-3" class="headerlink" title="● Temperature"></a>● Temperature</h4><p>Temperature defines how cool or warm a color is. Cool temperatures typically describe blues and purples, while orange and red represent the warmth.</p>
<h3 id="The-essential-tools-for-color-grading-include-3"><a href="#The-essential-tools-for-color-grading-include-3" class="headerlink" title="The essential tools for color grading include"></a>The essential tools for color grading include</h3><h4 id="●-White-Balance-3"><a href="#●-White-Balance-3" class="headerlink" title="● White Balance"></a>● White Balance</h4><p>White balance helps to make your photos look more natural by correcting color cast issues. After using white balance, the result is that the whites in your pictures would look exactly like the human eye will perceive it. White balance adjusts your image’s color cast to make them look warmer or cooler.</p>
<h4 id="●-Brightness-and-Contrast-3"><a href="#●-Brightness-and-Contrast-3" class="headerlink" title="● Brightness and Contrast"></a>● Brightness and Contrast</h4><p>Brightness and contrast are essential in color grading and are among the most used photo editing tools. Different sliders control brightness and contrast during editing. It’s important to note that your image’s brightness will affect the contrast and vice-versa. That’s why they usually appear together, even if they refer to different tools.</p>
<h4 id="●-The-Three-Way-Color-Corrector-3"><a href="#●-The-Three-Way-Color-Corrector-3" class="headerlink" title="● The Three-Way Color Corrector"></a>● The Three-Way Color Corrector</h4><p>Many photographers refer to the three-way corrector as the color correction’s workhorse. That’s because this tool adjusts hue, saturation, brightness, and contrast in a single interface. The three-way corrector performs the job of three tools in one interface. Using the three-way corrector ensures that you work faster than usual.</p>
<h4 id="●-The-Fast-Color-Corrector-3"><a href="#●-The-Fast-Color-Corrector-3" class="headerlink" title="● The Fast Color Corrector"></a>● The Fast Color Corrector</h4><p>The fast color corrector is like the three-way corrector. However, there are many limitations with the number of potential looks you can achieve with this tool. The fast color corrector primarily focuses on adjusting tint and saturation. Its major advantage over the three-way corrector is its user-friendliness and simplicity.</p>
<h4 id="●-Curves-3"><a href="#●-Curves-3" class="headerlink" title="● Curves"></a>● Curves</h4><p>While using curves is pretty complicated, the tool offers impressive functionality that you can’t refuse. Curves are very powerful and precise. Their main function is to overhaul or remove your image’s brightness altogether to give it a distinctive look.</p>
<h4 id="●-The-Unsharp-Mask-and-Sharpening-Tools-3"><a href="#●-The-Unsharp-Mask-and-Sharpening-Tools-3" class="headerlink" title="● The Unsharp Mask and Sharpening Tools"></a>● The Unsharp Mask and Sharpening Tools</h4><p>With the unsharp mask and sharpening tools, you can give your picture’s edges a sharp illusion by modifying the contrast. This is typically useful for images that you shoot in dark conditions.</p>
<p>Sharp pictures are always a lovely sight. However, these tools can’t correct pictures taken out of focus. To get the best results from these tools. Then you can start moving them back till you get your desired sharpness.</p>
<h4 id="●-Color-Match-3"><a href="#●-Color-Match-3" class="headerlink" title="● Color Match"></a>● Color Match</h4><p>As the make implies, color match tools modify a target picture’s colors to fit the reference image. This is an automatic process and helps to save time.</p>
<h2 id="Common-Steps-To-Color-Grade-a-Photo-3"><a href="#Common-Steps-To-Color-Grade-a-Photo-3" class="headerlink" title="Common Steps To Color Grade a Photo"></a>Common Steps To Color Grade a Photo</h2><p>These are the essential stages for color grading your images:</p>
<p>● Step 1:<br>The first step in color grading is deciding how warm or cool you want your image to look. Then, modify the white balance to suit your desired warmth or coolness.</p>
<p>● Step 2:<br>After adjusting the white balance, the next step is to adjust saturation or hue.</p>
<p>● Step 3:<br>The next step is to focus on the histogram. A histogram is a common feature in many photo editing software that informs you of your image’s tonal values. The goal in this stage is to ensure equal color distribution. Keep adjusting your image till the colors are even.</p>
<p>● Step 4:<br>Work on your highlights and shadows by modifying the green, red, and blue curves. Also, adjust your vibrancy setting for a good effect.</p>
<p>● Step 5:<br>Explore split toning. Split toning is a process that involves adding colors to highlight and shadows independently. Learning how to split tone can make a difference in your photo editing.</p>
<h2 id="Tips-For-Color-Grading-Photography-3"><a href="#Tips-For-Color-Grading-Photography-3" class="headerlink" title="Tips For Color Grading Photography"></a>Tips For Color Grading Photography</h2><p>The following best practices will enhance your color grading:</p>
<ul>
<li>About oversaturation or under-saturation. Your saturation should be just right to produce the perfect result. So, always be sure to pay maximum attention to this process. This tip is particularly useful when working with portraits.</li>
<li>Remember that color grading doesn’t fix a bad shot. So, be sure to improve your photography skills and take the best shots for excellent color grading results.</li>
<li>Shoot your images in RAW. Doing this guarantees more control over your pictures’ colors.</li>
<li>Always experiment with different looks until you get your precise effect. Lightroom is one of the best color grading apps to use.</li>
<li>Exercise maximum caution when manipulating backgrounds. Don’t do too much, especially when you’re taking an indoor shot. That’s because manipulating indoor backgrounds too much can mismatch the foreground and background, making your portrait look weird.</li>
</ul>
