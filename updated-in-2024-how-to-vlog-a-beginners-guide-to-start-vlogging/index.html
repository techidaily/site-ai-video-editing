<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Remove-the-Background-of-a-Photo-in-PowerPoint"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Remove-the-Background-of-a-Photo-in-PowerPoint" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 How to Remove the Background of a Photo in PowerPoint"></a>Part 1 How to Remove the Background of a Photo in PowerPoint</h2><p>If there is anything that a designer hates in his precious photo, then it’s the background. It hides and distracts from the main subject at hand. You can use various photo editing tools to remove the background from PNG images or JPG. However, they may not do the job as easily as you are thinking.</p>
<p>Yes, we know that you may be wondering about Adobe Photoshop now. It can be used for removing the background too but are you ready to pay for it? No, right? This is when you can depend on PowerPoint to erase the background of a photo without any hassle. Make sure you have PowerPoint 2010 or a later version installed before beginning. Because the earlier Microsoft PowerPoint versions don’t have a background removal feature.</p>
<p>Step 1: Open the image in a new tab</p>
<p>Launch PowerPoint on your desktop or Mac and change the layout of the slide to “Blank”. Next, insert your image, which has a solid or high-contrast background. Such pictures are easier to transform and edit.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/things-you-need-to-know-about-transparent-png-remove-and-convert-1.jpg"
                      alt="import picture powerpoint"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Select the “Remove Background” option</p>
<p>Click on your image to get the “Picture Format” in the menu toolbar. On the left top side, choose the “Remove Background” option. Now, PowerPoint will try to remove the background automatically. If the final picture that you are getting is not satisfactory, move to the next step.</p>

                      alt="click remove background powerpoint"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: Select the Area</p>
<p>From the given options in the toolbar, mark the areas that you want to keep or remove in the final result. As you can view, how some parts of the pictures have been cut. So, spread the box to cover the entire area of the image, which you want to keep. Remember, purple-highlighted areas are removed automatically.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>If you want to ensure a better result, use the cursor. Start hovering over the background and the main subject to get the plus and minus sign. These signs are useful for getting a precise image at the end. The Minus sign allows you to mark the areas to be removed. The plus sign can be used to keep the marked areas in the final picture.</p>
<p>Step 4: Finishing Touches</p>
<p>Check your image carefully and see whether any area is left to be removed or not. You can zoom in to find the tiniest spot. When you are satisfied with every detail, click anywhere outside of the image to stop further edits. Congratulations! Your transparent PNG is ready to save. Go to “File”&gt;”Save As” and find the option to save your picture in PNG transparent format.</p>

Kapwing makes it really simple and fast, but the best part is that you can get it done for free.</p>
<p>Step 1: Add Your JPG</p>
<p>Launch Kapwing in any browser of your choice. Log in using your account or sign up with a new one. Now, you will be redirected to the Kapwing studio, where you can do all the editing and conversion. Upload your image to the “Kapwing Studio” and use the “Remove Image from Background” tool.</p>

                ></p>
<p>If the image is already saved on your device, simply hit “Click to Upload” or, if you wish, drag and drop the JPG image to initiate the conversion. On the other hand, in case the image is not available, you can copy and paste from a URL in the “Paste an image or video URL” box.</p>
<p>Step 2: Pick a Tool</p>
<p>After the image upload finishes, the next thing is to start removing its background. Go to the right side of the “Image” tab and click on the “Erase” button. Otherwise, you can use the “Remove Background from Image” tool to start.</p>

<p>Apart from that, the Magic Wand tool is amazing for removing a particular area at once. You can remove the picture background in less time and effort. If you want to remove a certain area of the same color, then the Magic Wand is the best tool to use. It eliminates similar groups of pixels together. To modify the sensitivity, move the same dial to the right as you did while selecting the “Erase” tool.</p>
<p>For some impressive results, adjust the zoom and choose “Move” to select the pixels you want to remove.</p>
<p>Step 3: Make the PNG and Download</p>
<p>After everything has been set, it’s time to download your PNG transparent file. Click “Done” and then move back to the Kapwing Studio for additional features.

However, they may not do the job as easily as you are thinking.</p>
<p>Yes, we know that you may be wondering about Adobe Photoshop now. It can be used for removing the background too but are you ready to pay for it? No, right? This is when you can depend on PowerPoint to erase the background of a photo without any hassle. Make sure you have PowerPoint 2010 or a later version installed before beginning. Because the earlier Microsoft PowerPoint versions don’t have a background removal feature.</p>
<p>Step 1: Open the image in a new tab</p>
<p>Launch PowerPoint on your desktop or Mac and change the layout of the slide to “Blank”. Next, insert your image, which has a solid or high-contrast background. Such pictures are easier to transform and edit.</p>

                      alt="click remove background powerpoint"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: Select the Area</p>
<p>From the given options in the toolbar, mark the areas that you want to keep or remove in the final result. As you can view, how some parts of the pictures have been cut. So, spread the box to cover the entire area of the image, which you want to keep. Remember, purple-highlighted areas are removed automatically.</p>

These signs are useful for getting a precise image at the end. The Minus sign allows you to mark the areas to be removed. The plus sign can be used to keep the marked areas in the final picture.</p>
<p>Step 4: Finishing Touches</p>
<p>Check your image carefully and see whether any area is left to be removed or not. You can zoom in to find the tiniest spot. When you are satisfied with every detail, click anywhere outside of the image to stop further edits. Congratulations! Your transparent PNG is ready to save. Go to “File”&gt;”Save As” and find the option to save your picture in PNG transparent format.</p>

<p>Apart from that, the Magic Wand tool is amazing for removing a particular area at once. You can remove the picture background in less time and effort. If you want to remove a certain area of the same color, then the Magic Wand is the best tool to use. It eliminates similar groups of pixels together. To modify the sensitivity, move the same dial to the right as you did while selecting the “Erase” tool.</p>
<p>For some impressive results, adjust the zoom and choose “Move” to select the pixels you want to remove.</p>
<p>Step 3: Make the PNG and Download</p>
<p>After everything has been set, it’s time to download your PNG transparent file. Click “Done” and then move back to the Kapwing Studio for additional features.

So, if you want to learn to use montages with movies, they need to be the right ones. If you don’t know what Montage is, it is a way of compressing an action or series of actions into a short amount of time. We look at movies because they are a common type of entertainment everyone has seen before, which makes them easier to understand as a concept.</p>
<p>Using Montage is a great way to create engaging video content. There are many people interested in the topic of Montage, so if you get that video out there, you can easily find an audience. When used in conjunction with YouTube advertising, creating videos about Montage could be an excellent business idea for you.</p>
<p>Learning how to use Montage properly can be challenging. The process isn’t intuitive, and using it can feel like hiding random pieces around your page. But, when you watch the right movies, they can help you understand how to use this tool effectively. So, take some time, check out these movies, and learn how to get the most out of Montage!</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-A-Montage"><a href="#What-Is-A-Montage" class="headerlink" title="What Is A Montage?"></a>What Is A Montage?</h2><p>The definition of a montage is a “series of short scenes or episodes forming a unified whole.” That definition can lead to different interpretations of a montage and can be applied to any art medium. A “montage” isn’t just for movies. Music artists use montages to tell stories that often describe their emotions and experiences; writers create poetry and prose contained in such an artistic form, and painters often use this art form. However, many people are most familiar with the term associated with movies: a montage is essentially a collection of images or scenes that populate a movie with music.</p>
<p>If you’ve seen any blockbuster Hollywood films in the last ten years, you’ve probably seen some Montage. The Montage is a sequence that takes place over a set period and shows us how the lead character goes from being an ordinary person to an extraordinary one. The difference between these two states is dramatic, so we see so many montages in movies. They are meant to grab your attention and excitingly introduce a character.</p>
<h2 id="Purpose-of-Montage"><a href="#Purpose-of-Montage" class="headerlink" title="Purpose of Montage"></a>Purpose of Montage</h2><p>Montage movies are made up of a compilation of short yet powerful scenes put together to make one movie or project. Even though these types of movies have become a common genre, there’s a list of reasons why this is popular in movies today.</p>
<ul>
<li>Montage has several uses in movies. Of course, Montage can be used to show events such as battles or dancing. It can also describe emotions, including sadness, happiness, and sarcasm. These different uses of Montage do come with their styles, but they all share a few common traits.</li>
<li>They’re often used to condense periods of storytime into much smaller but more entertaining segments. The word montage is French for “to construct from many parts .”Montages can now be seen everywhere in film and television, from silent films to blockbuster action movies.</li>
<li>This is frequently used in narratives when the story needs to advance quickly. The characters are going somewhere or doing something else not within the context of the moment in time that represents them. A great example of a montage was used in Rocky when Rocky was training for his fight with Apollo Creed.</li>
<li>A montage allows filmmakers to explore a theme using several sequential shots that can’t be covered in a single shot.</li>

<p>Summarize:</p>
<p>If you’re thinking about using Montage, check out movies and trailers in the Action and Comedy genres. Keep in mind that finding material that works well with montages is no accident. They are filled with some of the best soundtracks, action scenes, and comedy routines that can help guide your project through its rough spots. Montage can do amazing things for any movie, so it’s important to learn when and where it should be used.</p>
