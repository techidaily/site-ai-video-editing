Learn How to Loop Your Favorite YouTube Video on Your iPhone, so You Can Play that Part over and Over</h2><p>YouTube videos are a great way to get information fast. But there are times when you want to watch a video over and over again without having to go back to the YouTube app. Here is how you can loop YouTube videos on your iPhone. There are 2 ways to loop YouTube videos on iPhone. One is through the YouTube app and using third-party apps.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why you might want to loop a video on your iPhone. Maybe you’re trying to learn a dance routine, or you want to listen to a song on repeat. You’ve probably seen those cool looping videos on Instagram and Facebook and wondered how people make them. YouTube is a great place to find videos on any topic.</p>
<p>The YouTube app on the iPhone is a great way to watch videos, but it doesn’t have a repeat or loop feature. This means that if you are watching a long video, you will have to keep your phone on and continue watching the video. YouTube is the world’s most popular video-sharing platform with approx. 1.9 billion monthly active users.</p>

Thanks to the advent of digital communication platforms, you can reach out to a diversified range of audience to deliver your content. Such flexibilities may often render your text based information inaccessible to specific classes of viewers on account of demographic and language constraints.</p>
<p>Emojis on the other hand, are free from the aforesaid limitations and have a universal impact on every viewer group, irrespective of geographical and native communication boundaries. True that the recent updates in platform interfaces have worked towards including language translators, the service is often partially or completely inaccurate. In the light of these circumstances, using emojis is of great help with globally accepted and understood symbols.</p>

<p>Then, shoot for the second clip without changing the frame. You will have to go to the place where you dropped the jacket from the first shot.</p>

If you haven’t installed Filmora yet, you can go to their website and download it here:</p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p>
<p>Once you have opened Filmora 11, follow the steps below:</p>
<p>Step1 Bring the first clip to the timeline and cut the clip where you pretend to yank and take off the jacket. Select and delete the unnecessary clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-4.jpg"
                      alt="bring the first clip to the timeline"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 After you have the first part of the effect ready, let’s start working on the clone part using masking.</p>
<p>First, place the second clip on a different window track, and the starting point is where you react to the “clone.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-5.jpg"
                      alt="place the second clip on a different window track"
                ></p>
<p>Then, double-click the second clip and go to the Filmora setting window. Tap on the <strong>Mask</strong> section &gt; <strong>Single line</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-6.jpg"
                      alt="tap on mask section"
                ></p>
<p>On the preview screen, adjust the position of the mask to only show “the clone.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-7.gif"
                      alt="adjust the position of the mask"
                ></p>
<p>Set the blur strength on the setting to make a smoother edge transition.</p>
<p>Step3 If the timing of the two clips doesn’t match, you can fix it using the speed ramping feature on Filmora 11. To use it, double-click the second clip and select <strong>Speed &gt; Speed Ramping &gt; Customize</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-8.jpg"
                      alt="double-click the second clip"
                ></p>
<p>Move the keyframe up to increase the speed. You can adjust it according to your needs.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-9.gif"
                      alt="adjust keyframe"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 Once you are satisfied, adjust the clip length on the timeline and make sure that both clips finish at the same time.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-10.jpg"
                      alt="adjust the clip length"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Extra tip:</strong> Add one more effect to make it more magical.</p>
<p>Step1 Open the <strong>Effects</strong> window and search for “up down 1.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="open the effects window"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Drag and drop the effect onto the timeline where the first cut is set. Adjust the effect length to match the action.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/clone-yourself-12.jpg"
                      alt="drag and drop the effect onto the timeline"
                ></p>
<p>Then, drag and drop the effect again in the transition between the first and the second clip. Adjust it to the appropriate length, then it will give a more dramatic effect.</p>
<p>Step3 You can playback and see how it looks on the preview screen.</p>
