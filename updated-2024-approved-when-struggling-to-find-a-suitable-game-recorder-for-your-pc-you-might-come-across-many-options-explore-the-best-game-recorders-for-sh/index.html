It not only boosts the overall video quality but also helps ensuring the object is engaged throughout the video. Many users fail to apply the motion tracking effect to the videos because they don’t use a reliable tool. The primary motive of this discussion is to provide you with the best-in-class motion tracker.</p>
<p>Not only will we tell you the name of the software, but we will also guide you through the procedure of doing this. Moreover, many of you don’t know what motion tracking is. So, this article will also provide significant information about this.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Motion-Tracking-in-Video-Editing"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Motion-Tracking-in-Video-Editing" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is Motion Tracking in Video Editing?"></a>Part 1: What Is Motion Tracking in Video Editing?</h2><p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Motion tracking <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> helps you analyze the movements of different objects in your video content. This process involves various tasks that can be very helpful in video editing. For example, tracking and identifying the position of elements over time. The main purpose of motion tracking is to add graphics. Moreover, you can also add digital effects to the tracked objects.</p>
<p>You will need special software or video editing tools to perform this process. Here’s how you can understand the motion tracking process with ease:</p>
<h3 id="Selection-of-Object"><a href="#Selection-of-Object" class="headerlink" title="Selection of Object"></a>Selection of Object</h3><p>The editor can select the object that he wants to track in an effective manner. This object can be a person or any moving element that needs tracking. Moreover, it can also be a moving vehicle or a logo as well. Tracking these moving elements in the frame can allow the editor to improve the areas which have high contrast or distinct features.</p>
<h3 id="Tracking-Points"><a href="#Tracking-Points" class="headerlink" title="Tracking Points"></a>Tracking Points</h3><p>Selecting the object allows the software to identify specific points in the frame. These points can have distinct features or a high contrast that may affect the video quality. With the help of <strong>video motion tracking</strong>, the editor can note down these areas and improve them to enhance the viewer experience.</p>
<h3 id="Data-Mapping"><a href="#Data-Mapping" class="headerlink" title="Data Mapping"></a>Data Mapping</h3><p>Once the software tracks the movements, it can be very useful for the editor. This is because it calculates the changes in position and rotation of each point. Moreover, it also maps the tracked data into a visual representation for the coordinating system. Using this system, the movements of the objects can be recreated in a 3D space.</p>
<h3 id="Using-Effects-and-Refinement"><a href="#Using-Effects-and-Refinement" class="headerlink" title="Using Effects and Refinement"></a>Using Effects and Refinement</h3><p>After obtaining the motion tracking data, the video editor can apply different effects on the object. These effects can include adding graphics and text to the scene. Moreover, it can also help in animation or compositing visual elements. To ensure the accurate alignment of the effects, the editor may need to use extra tracking techniques or manual adjustments.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Import Video in Filmora</p>
<p>To get started, launch Filmora on your device, select “New Project,” and choose the “Click here to import media” option. To proceed, add the video you want to apply motion tracking. Once the video is visible in the “Import Media” section, drag it to “Timeline.”</p>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Add Motion Tracking in the Video</p>
<p>Select the video in “Timeline” and click the “Motion Tracking” button from the “Toolbar” present above the “Timeline.” Conversely, double-click the video and choose the “Video” tab from the editing settings.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Customize Motion Tracking and Initiate It</p>
<p>To enable the box customization, double-click the “Motion Tracking Box.” Drag the “Motion Tracking Box” on the moving object and cover the whole object in the box.

Adobe After Effects is a video editing platform that can help you perform <strong>video motion tracking</strong>. If you are a user of this tool, you can learn the steps to <strong>motion track</strong> your video below:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open Adobe After Effects on your computer and import your video files to the timeline of the platform. Add the object you wish to motion track on Adobe After Effects.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="import media to after effects"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Lead to the “Layer” tab from the top and select the “New” option from the drop-down menu. Continue to select “Null Object” to add a layer to the timeline.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select the video clip and continue to the “Animation” tab from the top. Select “Track Motion” from the drop-down menu that appears.

From sparking up personal images with an extra element of fun and entertainment, to supplementing professional edits for effective business promotion strategies, emojis can adhere to just any graphic design concern you can possibly think of.</p>
<p>Diving further into the usage expanse, let us proceed to discuss about some of the most prominent advantages of working with emojis to uplift a graphic artwork in the following section:</p>
<h3 id="01Improved-Message-Clarity"><a href="#01Improved-Message-Clarity" class="headerlink" title="01Improved Message Clarity"></a>01Improved Message Clarity</h3><p>Regardless of the domain of application, emojis are known to amplify the appearance and clarity of your content with a simple graphic add-on. Circulating you information through a text message may often sound uninteresting and under the line. On the other hand, including a suitable emoji caters to define a relation between the text message and the information it intends to convey.</p>
<p>Effective information delivery becomes additionally important when your content is aimed at addressing professional constraints. While the general class of viewers finds it difficult to exactly interpret audio-visual elements, images go well with the diverse audience categories.</p>
<p>People who choose to complement a text-based interaction with emojis to address their audience, easily succeed in establishing a strong emotional connect among their viewers and the message being conveyed. This works to a positively accelerated response from their audience.</p>

Thanks to the advent of digital communication platforms, you can reach out to a diversified range of audience to deliver your content. Such flexibilities may often render your text based information inaccessible to specific classes of viewers on account of demographic and language constraints.</p>
<p>Emojis on the other hand, are free from the aforesaid limitations and have a universal impact on every viewer group, irrespective of geographical and native communication boundaries. True that the recent updates in platform interfaces have worked towards including language translators, the service is often partially or completely inaccurate. In the light of these circumstances, using emojis is of great help with globally accepted and understood symbols.</p>

<p>While the online sources and the IT market offer a hoard of apps and tools that comprise of the most extensive emoji varieties, they may be instances when nothing looks apt with the image context. In such cases, you can actually prefer creating emojis of your own. What’s best is, there is an equal diversity of tools that let you create personalized emojis with utmost ease.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>How can emojis be downloaded free of cost?</strong></p>
<p>If the inbuilt emoji library of your editor application falls short of fetching the exact emoji of your choice, there are hoards of online sources from where you can download specific emoji packs to suit your image editing preferences. The best thing about these sites is their free access and periodically updated libraries that house all the latest emoji options.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Is there a copyright on emojis?</strong></p>
<p>When the talk is centered on copyright protection, the answer to the query is a ‘Yes’ in special reference to individual emojis. But the contradictory fact is, a wide range of such emojis does not land within copyright constraints owing to a variety of reasons. The bottom line is, you can access most of these elements without an official permission.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>What is the universally accepted emoji size for image editing concerns?</strong></p>
<p>With reference to the latest update in emoji size resolutions, the apt pixel dimensions have been set to a 128 x 128 configuration. This is a good 4 times increment to the previous size constraints of 32 x 32 pixels. The resolution works effectively to keep the affordable image quality intact.</p>
