<p>Suppose you want to buy a pair of eyeglasses and don’t know which pair would suit your look. Now you might wish to look at how your face would look on different frames. Here you can use AR and see which pair of glasses would fit you using AR. AR can be used to share and receive various kinds of tacit knowledge. Augmented Reality is often synonymously used for “Computed-mediated reality” and “Mixed- Reality.”</p>
<p>Despite such an exceptional concept, many users raised questions about the privacy issues of this app. AR technology constantly needs to record the real environment, which involves real human beings. Recording their movement breaches their privacy which can cause legal trouble for the user. If the videos are recorded with consent, they will not harm anyone.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Augmented-Reality"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Augmented-Reality" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What Is Augmented Reality?"></a>Part 1 What Is Augmented Reality?</h2><p>Augmented Reality is a technology that uses the real-world environment where virtual objects reside. This process involves an experience where the real or physical world interweaves with virtually created objects. It interweaves so perfectly that the artificial seems a part of the natural. This is an artificial experience, and it adds to the real environment. AR gained popularity in the fields of entertainment and video games.</p>
<p>You might think that AR (Augmented Reality) is the same as VR (Virtual Reality). They are not the same. When someone looks through a VR, everything, including the object’s environment, is virtual or an illusion. When AR is used, the object is virtual, but the environment is real. Suppose you want to buy an item of furniture and you do not know whether it would match your home décor; here, you can use AR to see whether the furniture would fit your décor or not.</p>

<h2 id="How-To-Make-a-Video-Podcast"><a href="#How-To-Make-a-Video-Podcast" class="headerlink" title="How To Make a Video Podcast"></a>How To Make a Video Podcast</h2><p>Starting a video podcast can be quite intimidating, but the truth is; having the proper knowledge will help you do things more correctly.</p>
<p>As we all know, knowledge is the key to success. So, for you to navigate your way around the video podcasting industry easily, you need to consume enough information that will enable you to make fewer wrong decisions.</p>
<p>To help you out, we took our time to do more research on how to record video podcasts, and in this post, we will share all you need to know to record a video podcast that stands out.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-But-first-why-record-with-a-video"><a href="#Part-1-But-first-why-record-with-a-video" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. But first: why record with a video?"></a>Part 1. But first: why record with a video?</h2><p>If you’ve done a little research, you’ll notice many podcasters switched to recording with videos instead of audio. Did they decide to start doing that so we could see their faces? Well, the answer is NO. But before we discuss more on that, you should know what a video podcast is and its types.</p>
<p>You guessed right. A video podcast is a podcast with video. The video element could be a static image or a video recording of the podcast host and the guest. A video podcast will help you do the following;</p>
<p><strong>1. Enhance the visual content</strong></p>
<p>Research shows that humans learn more from what they visualize than what is heard. Yes, this is because 30% of the human brain comprises neurons dedicated to visual processing, and just 3% is dedicated to hearing. Besides, videos are always more engaging compared to audio. So why not combine both to boost your podcast performance?</p>
<p><strong>2. Level up the personality and relatability</strong></p>
<p>Most people have more belief in what they see than what is heard. So, video podcasts allow audiences to easily see your expression and understand your passion for the subject you discuss. It also builds a deeper level of connections between you and them. Also, it helps to add to the originality of your podcast and your brand as a whole.</p>
<p><strong>3. Make the content more accessible</strong></p>
<p>Your podcast show becomes more accessible when it’s in the video. You won’t be limited to just uploading it on podcast platforms but also on social media as a short TikTok trailer, Instagram post, YouTube video, etc. Doing this will get your content in front of a wide range of audience, thus prompting more people to engage with your podcast.</p>
