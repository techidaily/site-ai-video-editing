<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1:</strong> Choosing an Image.</p>
<p>The first step in creating a 3D image is to carefully sort out which moment in your video you wish to convert into 3D. Pick an images or video clips that already have an element that pops out in a forward moving motion.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2:</strong> It should have a smart composition.</p>
<p>Becoming a creator means you need to know more about composition. This can be applicable to anything from making virtual designs to creating GIFs. 3D GIFs requires you to use a special Tumblr ‘frame’ that adds two breaks to the image which creates three horizontal panels. In exceptional cases, you could also use three break points and divide the image into four panels.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3:</strong> Become a content creator.</p>
<p>It’s okay to feel a bit off beat when trying out new skills but the prospects are rewarding. Try taking your own video footage, edit in Photoshop or any similar editing software. You can also opt for instant GIF creator apps that directly converts the footage or image you clicked into a GIF.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4:</strong> Making the split.</p>
<p>The next step would be splitting the image or frame into three panels as guideline for the 3D effects. In Photoshop you can import a GIF and choose ‘View’ from the navigation menu and then click on ‘New Guide’ from the drop down menu. Set the guide to 33% at first and 66% in the second.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5:</strong> Placingthe magical white lines over the guides.</p>
<p>From the shape menu on the sidebar, select the rectangle tool. Right click on this tool to get the shapes menu. Set ‘Fill Colour’ to white and set the weight to five pixels. Click and drag the lines over the guides.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6:</strong> For the final touch.</p>
<p>Merge these line layers and add a layer mask. The objective here is to only mask the panel where the main 3D element of the image which will be moving beyond the guides. How it is done is that you make copies of the frames where the animation goes beyond the guidelines and mask the layers where the element is over the visible layer.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7:</strong>  Enjoy your GIF.</p>
<p>Once you are done masking every frame that you have copied. Replay your GIF to see if everything is in order.</p>

<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Make-3D-Gifs-in-Videos-More-Textured-1"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Make-3D-Gifs-in-Videos-More-Textured-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How to Make 3D Gifs in Videos More Textured"></a>Part 3 How to Make 3D Gifs in Videos More Textured</h2><p>You can use GIF makers to create loops in videos you upload but the trick to making your 3D GIF stand out is about to be explained in the following.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1:</strong> Choosing an Image.</p>
<p>The first step in creating a 3D image is to carefully sort out which moment in your video you wish to convert into 3D. Pick an images or video clips that already have an element that pops out in a forward moving motion.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2:</strong> It should have a smart composition.</p>
<p>Becoming a creator means you need to know more about composition. This can be applicable to anything from making virtual designs to creating GIFs. 3D GIFs requires you to use a special Tumblr ‘frame’ that adds two breaks to the image which creates three horizontal panels. In exceptional cases, you could also use three break points and divide the image into four panels.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3:</strong> Become a content creator.</p>
<p>It’s okay to feel a bit off beat when trying out new skills but the prospects are rewarding. Try taking your own video footage, edit in Photoshop or any similar editing software. You can also opt for instant GIF creator apps that directly converts the footage or image you clicked into a GIF.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4:</strong> Making the split.</p>
<p>The next step would be splitting the image or frame into three panels as guideline for the 3D effects. In Photoshop you can import a GIF and choose ‘View’ from the navigation menu and then click on ‘New Guide’ from the drop down menu. Set the guide to 33% at first and 66% in the second.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5:</strong> Placingthe magical white lines over the guides.</p>
<p>From the shape menu on the sidebar, select the rectangle tool. Right click on this tool to get the shapes menu. Set ‘Fill Colour’ to white and set the weight to five pixels. Click and drag the lines over the guides.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6:</strong> For the final touch.</p>
<p>Merge these line layers and add a layer mask. The objective here is to only mask the panel where the main 3D element of the image which will be moving beyond the guides. How it is done is that you make copies of the frames where the animation goes beyond the guidelines and mask the layers where the element is over the visible layer.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7:</strong>  Enjoy your GIF.</p>
<p>Once you are done masking every frame that you have copied. Replay your GIF to see if everything is in order.</p>

<p>Making and sharing animated GIFs that practically pop out on your friend’s screen can be just the magic one needs to start their day.</p>
<p>3D animated GIFs are growing in popularity and surprisingly, because of a simple trick that even you can try out.</p>
<p>What separates <strong>3D text GIFs</strong> or <strong>3D animation GIFs</strong> from your regular GIFs is that they are bit more difficult but far more fun to make.</p>
<p>3D GIFs are where it feels like the picture is coming out of your screen. Of course, this is just a visual illusion which can be recreated over any video GIF that meets specific parameters.</p>

This approach lets you create convincing 3D GIFs in an easy but deceptive way.</p>
<p>The actual magic behind this trick is the use of white lines that act as reference points separating 3 panels in the image.</p>
<p>Now, any animated elements of the GIF image will seem like they are popping out beyond the pre-set white lines and towards the viewer.</p>
<p>These white lines are used as referencing lines on the screen allowing our brains to bewilder at a passive 3D GIFs coming at us from the screen.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1:</strong> Choosing an Image.</p>
<p>The first step in creating a 3D image is to carefully sort out which moment in your video you wish to convert into 3D. Pick an images or video clips that already have an element that pops out in a forward moving motion.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2:</strong> It should have a smart composition.</p>
<p>Becoming a creator means you need to know more about composition. This can be applicable to anything from making virtual designs to creating GIFs. 3D GIFs requires you to use a special Tumblr ‘frame’ that adds two breaks to the image which creates three horizontal panels. In exceptional cases, you could also use three break points and divide the image into four panels.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3:</strong> Become a content creator.</p>
<p>It’s okay to feel a bit off beat when trying out new skills but the prospects are rewarding. Try taking your own video footage, edit in Photoshop or any similar editing software. You can also opt for instant GIF creator apps that directly converts the footage or image you clicked into a GIF.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4:</strong> Making the split.</p>
<p>The next step would be splitting the image or frame into three panels as guideline for the 3D effects. In Photoshop you can import a GIF and choose ‘View’ from the navigation menu and then click on ‘New Guide’ from the drop down menu. Set the guide to 33% at first and 66% in the second.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5:</strong> Placingthe magical white lines over the guides.</p>
<p>From the shape menu on the sidebar, select the rectangle tool. Right click on this tool to get the shapes menu. Set ‘Fill Colour’ to white and set the weight to five pixels. Click and drag the lines over the guides.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6:</strong> For the final touch.</p>
<p>Merge these line layers and add a layer mask. The objective here is to only mask the panel where the main 3D element of the image which will be moving beyond the guides. How it is done is that you make copies of the frames where the animation goes beyond the guidelines and mask the layers where the element is over the visible layer.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7:</strong>  Enjoy your GIF.</p>
<p>Once you are done masking every frame that you have copied. Replay your GIF to see if everything is in order.</p>

<p>Making and sharing animated GIFs that practically pop out on your friend’s screen can be just the magic one needs to start their day.</p>
<p>3D animated GIFs are growing in popularity and surprisingly, because of a simple trick that even you can try out.</p>
<p>What separates <strong>3D text GIFs</strong> or <strong>3D animation GIFs</strong> from your regular GIFs is that they are bit more difficult but far more fun to make.</p>
<p>3D GIFs are where it feels like the picture is coming out of your screen. Of course, this is just a visual illusion which can be recreated over any video GIF that meets specific parameters.</p>

This approach lets you create convincing 3D GIFs in an easy but deceptive way.</p>
<p>The actual magic behind this trick is the use of white lines that act as reference points separating 3 panels in the image.</p>
<p>Now, any animated elements of the GIF image will seem like they are popping out beyond the pre-set white lines and towards the viewer.</p>
<p>These white lines are used as referencing lines on the screen allowing our brains to bewilder at a passive 3D GIFs coming at us from the screen.</p>
<p>You can recreate this same affect with a few popular <strong>GIF makers</strong>.</p>
