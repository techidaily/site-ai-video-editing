As Well Framing and Lighting of the Setup Are Illustrated in This Article</h2><p>To visually represent the story in the music video, cinematography shots are helpful. It’ll obviously and pleasing and eye-catchy effect in your video. These major requirements for making that cinematography can be covered as the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Light a subject</li>
<li>Create atmosphere</li>
<li>Light a set</li>
<li>Camera techniques</li>
<li>Aspect ratio</li>
<li>Framing</li>
<li>Camera movement</li>
</ol>
<p>Before, we go deeper to the details on how to make a cinematography for music, let us know first about the cinematography for music video. Everything is represented in this article, from the camera movement to the setting of the lights in the studio. You will also learn about aspect ratio and framing while making shots from the DSLR.</p>
<h2 id="What-Is-Cinematography"><a href="#What-Is-Cinematography" class="headerlink" title="What Is Cinematography?"></a>What Is Cinematography?</h2><p>Cinematography covers all aspects of how a movie or music video is made, including choosing the lighting for the scene. The type of camera equipment to use, how to frame your photographs, and how to decide on camera movement are also included in this. Let’s move toward the next lines to get the cool cinematography on display.</p>
<h2 id="Light-a-subject"><a href="#Light-a-subject" class="headerlink" title="Light a subject"></a>Light a subject</h2><p>Although you may assume that cinematography is just concerned with the usage of the camera, lighting plays an equally important role. While planning your photographs, you should think about how the scene is lit and how your subject is illuminated.</p>

<p>The cinematographer should consider the hard and soft lights for perfect illustrations during shooting. These are depicted with the following requirements!</p>
<h3 id="Hard-light-and-soft-light"><a href="#Hard-light-and-soft-light" class="headerlink" title="Hard light and soft light"></a>Hard light and soft light</h3><p>The cinematographers mainly focus on the hard and soft lights during filmmaking. The <strong>hard lights</strong> give a softer look to the subject. They are pointing to the light sources which are closer to the subject in the video. It makes the photographs and shots harsher and more dramatic.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="hard light on the subject"
                ></p>
<p>The <strong>soft light</strong> is trying to wrap around the subject. It gives diffused shadows and soft edges to the character of the music video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="note"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> To get better results of the soft look, you need to add diffusion to lower the intensity.</p>
<h2 id="Create-Atmosphere"><a href="#Create-Atmosphere" class="headerlink" title="Create Atmosphere"></a>Create Atmosphere</h2><p>You need a haze machine to create the atmosphere and give the environment true vibes. The haze machine gives a foggy appearance in every shoot and scene.</p>

<h2 id="Light-a-Set"><a href="#Light-a-Set" class="headerlink" title="Light a Set"></a>Light a Set</h2><p>To give proper lights in the set is illustrated with the help of an example as shown below!</p>
<h3 id="Examples"><a href="#Examples" class="headerlink" title="Examples"></a>Examples</h3><p>In this music video of the 3lau’s, the main prop used is a bus, which is presented in the middle of the set and lit very well. The bus is rounded by many tungsten lights, which give a resemblance to those street lights. They are set up automatically in such a way that this stimulates the real movement of the bus on the road.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="lighting a set"
                ></p>
<p>The three projectors are set to give the street footage at the back scene to add more realism.</p>

<p>In the close-up scenes, there is a requirement for a wider field of view which also depends on the aspect ratio of shooting.</p>
<h2 id="Aspect-Ratio"><a href="#Aspect-Ratio" class="headerlink" title="Aspect Ratio"></a>Aspect Ratio</h2><p>In filmy view, the most appropriate aspect ratio is 2.35, which is also a cinematic ratio. There is also another ratio of 16:9, which is a wider ratio. While 2.35 gives a more narrow perspective as compared to the prior one.</p>

However, if you wish to design elusive video presentations on the device, it is no difficult either. Having understood the credibility and design process of still presentations, let us move ahead with getting an insight into crafting classic masterpieces of video slideshows on a Mac device in what follows next:</p>
<p><strong>User’s Guide to Create a Video Slideshow in a Mac Device</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Download and Install a Suitable Video Editor Application</strong></p>
<p>Browsing the IT market, you can easily pick your preferred Mac compatible video editing software to address the concern of <strong>how to make a slideshow on Mac</strong>. As of now, let us try hands at understanding the creation process through the Movavi Slideshow Maker application.</p>

<p>Having talked enough about how to create slideshow presentations with images on a Mac device in the previous section, let us now dive into making a classic video presentation on the same, in what follows next. As already stated; select ‘Create a Movie in Manual Mode’ from the software’s main interface to begin with the creation process.</p>

<p>04 [How to Convert JPG to Transparent PNG](#Part 4)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-a-Transparent-PNG-Background"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-a-Transparent-PNG-Background" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What Is a Transparent PNG Background?"></a>Part 1 What Is a Transparent PNG Background?</h2><p>Transparent backgrounds are essentially faded overlays to any graphic content, like, an image or a video, that are useful in emphasizing the main element in the substance. Compatible to a variety of image and video formats, these are the talk of the trend, owing to their excellent content promotion utility. These are the latest and creative examples of information presentation, along with being among the best branding tools that can potentially make your content fresh and unique.</p>
<p>Using a transparent background as a brand promotion tool helps to project forward the major highlights of your product with a supportive background image, like the brand logo. This helps the audience to have a general idea of your brand. Apart from this, you can also assure the authenticity and quality of your brand by using a watermark in the background image.</p>
<p>Images with transparent backgrounds are the current promotion trends, owing to their convenient compatibility with any web design and the flexibility to mix with the most diverse color palettes and different elements on the product webpage. These can further be easily rendered in 3D to present realistic product images.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Differences-Among-PNG-vs-JPG-vs-GIF"><a href="#Part-2-Differences-Among-PNG-vs-JPG-vs-GIF" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Differences Among PNG vs JPG vs GIF"></a>Part 2 Differences Among PNG vs JPG vs GIF</h2><p>Diversity in requirement and usage has led to the advent of a variety of image formats, each suited to a specific purpose. On account of this variation, it becomes a confusing task to select the best image format that can fetch the most affordable images results in cohesion with exact user needs.</p>
<p>It is recommenced to use the JPG image format for natural stills that have a smooth variations in intensity and color. If your content requires image transparency, or contains texts and elements that have a sharp contrast image, like a brand logo, you should ideally prefer the PNG image format, while the GIF format is best suited for presenting animated content. As an explanation to the above usage constraints, here’s a comparison of the popular PNG, JPG and GIF image formats in the light of some common credibility parameters.</p>
<h3 id="01Compression"><a href="#01Compression" class="headerlink" title="01Compression"></a>01Compression</h3><p>Image compression facilitates a quick data transmission across different web based platforms, owing to the reduced file size. While compression can be either lossy or lossless, choose an image format that maintains the size credibility in resonance with your data needs. A lossless compression guarantees the retrieval of original image, but a lossy compression fails to do so.</p>
<p><strong>JPG</strong></p>
<p>The JPG format is a lossy compressor that plays on your ability to perceive. The format has the credibility of a 1:10 compression ratio, without comprising with the original image quality. However, a further increased compression ratio may generate perceivable differences in image quality.</p>
<p>The JPG compression utilizes the concept of Discrete Cosine Transform, i.e., a color averaging of the image pixels in close proximity. Hence, it is suitable to use this format for natural and scenic stills, having a smooth color and intensity transition. Preferring this image format for a transmission of high contrast and sharpened images is however, not advisable.</p>
<p><strong>PNG</strong></p>
<p>This format supports the Deflate Compression technique and neither introduces artefacts, nor cuts down on the image quality. Choose the PNG image format for a lossless and high quality compression in comparison to JPG. This one is a more effective format with higher image quality, sharper image presentation and occupies a larger memory space on your device.</p>
<p>You can rely on PNG images for presenting data with text, shapes and logos with high contrast pixelation. It is however, not a good choice for transferring digital images that have a high resolution.</p>
<p><strong>GIF</strong></p>
<p>Working on the LZW Compression Algorithm, this image format was originally used to showcase simple website graphics, when the PNG format was still at a developing stage. However, with the advancement of PNG as a more effective compression format, the use of GIF is now restricted to animated content sharing.</p>
<h3 id="02Transparency"><a href="#02Transparency" class="headerlink" title="02Transparency"></a>02Transparency</h3><p>Transparency is tern used to describe some invisible content. This is suitable to use in image backgrounds when you need to lay extra stress on the main content, like the logo of your product with a cohesive brand text, etc. the transparent background used here facilitates the use of a particular image with a series of background and color variations.</p>
<p><strong>JPG</strong></p>
<p>The JPG format has a limitation of not being compatible with image transparency, and hence is not suitable for related applications.</p>
<p><strong>PNG</strong></p>
<p>The PNG format gives you the liberty to use image transparency in two selective ways. You can either choose to make your image partially transparent by an alpha channel insertion for a smooth edge-background blend, or use index transparency to make the pixels of any particular color as transparent. PNG8 AND PNG24 versions of the format are supportive of index and alpha channel transparencies respectively.</p>
<p><strong>GIF</strong></p>
<p>This format inherently supports index transparency and declares a chosen color on the palette as transparent. Owing to the absence of alpha channel transparency, there is an unsatisfactory blend of edges with the image background. The unevenness becomes more prominent in case of highly detailed and rounded images.</p>
<p>While it is possible to mitigate this loss to some extent with the use of image dithering, the GIF format is still not a preferred choice for creating images with transparent backgrounds. The PNG format is instead, more credible on that aspect.</p>
<h3 id="03Color"><a href="#03Color" class="headerlink" title="03Color"></a>03Color</h3><p>Color is a visibly strong parameter of difference among the JPG, PNG and GIF image formats, with each one supporting as specific number of colors on the palette.</p>
<p><strong>JPG</strong></p>
<p>The color palette of JPG images is a huge inventory of 16 million colors, rendering them suitable for storing natural stills having a smooth color transition.</p>
<p><strong>PNG</strong></p>
<p>The two versions of PNG format differ on color variance. While PNG8 permits 256 colors, the PNG24 format supports 16 million colors, similar to the JPG format. Consider using the PNG8 format for an image with simple shapes and lesser variations in color. It is, on the other hand better to use the PNG24 format for images with transparent backgrounds, high image quality and complex shapes with detailed edges.</p>
<p><strong>GIF</strong></p>
<p>The GIF format is a host to 256 colors, one of which becomes transparent on using index transparency and the other 255 support different color variations.</p>
<h3 id="04Animation"><a href="#04Animation" class="headerlink" title="04Animation"></a>04Animation</h3><p>Animation here, is not necessarily restricted to having frame rates, but refers to a certain periodic movement of specific image sections with time. Out of JPG, PNG and GIF, only the last one is compatible with GIFs. You can use this utility to crate and share eye catching banners and advertisements. The advent of GIF specific content platforms, such as, GIPHY, Tumblr, etc., has further uplifted GIF reach and usage.</p>
<p>A variety of image formats are available to choose from for catering to specific content requirements. However, you can always optimize the format selection in cohesion with the current need.</p>

                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Download Adobe Photoshop</strong></p>
<p>Navigate to Adobe’s official website and download the Photoshop application in your device. Install and launch the same to reach the app’s welcome interface.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-9.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Inage Selection"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Make a Layered Image File</strong></p>
<p>In the main interface, open a selected image and navigate to the ‘Layers Panel’ in the right of the image window. However, if the ‘Layers Panel’ does not show up by default, reach to the top toolbar and hit the ‘Window’ tab. From the drop sown menu that follows, select ‘Layers’.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-10.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Image Layering Interface"
                ></p>
<p>In this panel, double tap the ‘Background‘layer. This causes the ‘Rename Layer’ dialog box to appear. You can either enter a suitable name or continue with the default ‘Layer 0’ name. When you are done, click on ‘OK’.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-11.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Layer Rename Interface"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Let’s Get Creating!</strong></p>
<p>In the application interface, navigate to the toolbar at the left and choose the ‘Magic Wand’ tool. Again, reach to the ‘Options’ bar at the top and choose ‘Select Subject’. This will facilitate the selection of the min object of the image, irrespective of its background and the selection will be visible as ‘marching ants’ around the object.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-12.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Magic Wand Tool Selection"
                ></p>
<p>If you find the selection to be improper, use the ‘Magic Wand’ to ward off excessive background portions by choosing the ’Subtract From Selection’ option, or even add some extra product portions, suited to your requirement. While making your selection, take care to include any holes in the product image.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Subject Selection"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Background Deletion</strong></p>
<p>When you are left with only the selected product, navigate to the top toolbar and hit the ’Select’ tab and choose ‘Inverse’ from the drop down menu that follows. You can alternatively use the ‘Shift+Ctrl+I’ command for a Windows device, or enter ‘Shift+Command+I’ command, in case you are using a Mac supported device.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-14.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application-Background Inverse Interface"
                ></p>
<p>Make a selection of the inverse background and tap ‘Backspace’ or ‘Delete’ in your Windows and Mac devices respectively. This will cause your background to get transparent. In the Photoshop application, a gray-white checkerboard represents a transparent background.</p>
<p>In case you require deselecting any selection, enter ‘Ctrl+D’ in Windows or ‘Command+D’ in a Mac device.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-15.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Section Deselect"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Save Your Creation in a Web Compatible Format</strong></p>
<p>When you are done creating the transparent background artwork, it becomes equally important to save your creation in a web compatible format to export them on different media platforms and product websites.</p>
<p>Talking of the preferable image format, it is highly recommended to use the PNG24 one, owing to its flexibility of alpha channel transparency, which permits partially transparent image backgrounds along with layered transparency. This in turn makes it possible to integrate the image with varying color backgrounds on different sites and platforms without hollow pixelation.</p>
<p>To save your artwork in the PNG24 file format, navigate to the application toolbar bat the top and hit the ‘File’ tab and choose the ‘Export’ option from the drop sown menu that appears. Select the ‘Export As’ option from the ‘Export’ popup menu.</p>
<p>For an older Photoshop version, hit the ‘Export’ tab and choose ‘Save for Web’ from the dropdown menu, followed by selecting the PNG24 option. A format dialog box appears where you can set the transparency settings. To do this, navigate to ‘File Settings’ at the right, choose the PNG file format and check the ‘Transparency’ box. Avoid checking the ‘Smaller Size’ box, else the image will get saved in the PNG8 format.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-16.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Image Export Interface"
                ></p>
<p>In the left of the screen, the image file size is displayed. Maintain an affordable file size, preferably within 200 KB, to avoid slower image loading on the sharing platform. You can adjust this in the ‘Image Size’ option at the right.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-17.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Transparency and Size Settings Interface"
                ></p>
<p>Set a conveniently reduced dimension, while taking care not to set an extremely small size, else it will produce a pixelated output on the site. It is preferable to set a 50-100% larger image size for a convenient display across different devices.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Final Save</strong></p>
<p>Once you are satisfied with all the image settings, tap ‘Export All’ to save your artwork locally in your device. In the ‘File Save’ dialog box, choose a preferred device location, enter a suitable file name and choose the .png extension. At last, click on ‘Save’.</p>

If your content requires image transparency, or contains texts and elements that have a sharp contrast image, like a brand logo, you should ideally prefer the PNG image format, while the GIF format is best suited for presenting animated content. As an explanation to the above usage constraints, here’s a comparison of the popular PNG, JPG and GIF image formats in the light of some common credibility parameters.</p>
<h3 id="01Compression-1"><a href="#01Compression-1" class="headerlink" title="01Compression"></a>01Compression</h3><p>Image compression facilitates a quick data transmission across different web based platforms, owing to the reduced file size. While compression can be either lossy or lossless, choose an image format that maintains the size credibility in resonance with your data needs. A lossless compression guarantees the retrieval of original image, but a lossy compression fails to do so.</p>
<p><strong>JPG</strong></p>
<p>The JPG format is a lossy compressor that plays on your ability to perceive. The format has the credibility of a 1:10 compression ratio, without comprising with the original image quality. However, a further increased compression ratio may generate perceivable differences in image quality.</p>
<p>The JPG compression utilizes the concept of Discrete Cosine Transform, i.e., a color averaging of the image pixels in close proximity. Hence, it is suitable to use this format for natural and scenic stills, having a smooth color and intensity transition. Preferring this image format for a transmission of high contrast and sharpened images is however, not advisable.</p>
<p><strong>PNG</strong></p>
<p>This format supports the Deflate Compression technique and neither introduces artefacts, nor cuts down on the image quality. Choose the PNG image format for a lossless and high quality compression in comparison to JPG. This one is a more effective format with higher image quality, sharper image presentation and occupies a larger memory space on your device.</p>
<p>You can rely on PNG images for presenting data with text, shapes and logos with high contrast pixelation. It is however, not a good choice for transferring digital images that have a high resolution.</p>
<p><strong>GIF</strong></p>
<p>Working on the LZW Compression Algorithm, this image format was originally used to showcase simple website graphics, when the PNG format was still at a developing stage. However, with the advancement of PNG as a more effective compression format, the use of GIF is now restricted to animated content sharing.</p>
<h3 id="02Transparency-1"><a href="#02Transparency-1" class="headerlink" title="02Transparency"></a>02Transparency</h3><p>Transparency is tern used to describe some invisible content. This is suitable to use in image backgrounds when you need to lay extra stress on the main content, like the logo of your product with a cohesive brand text, etc. the transparent background used here facilitates the use of a particular image with a series of background and color variations.</p>
<p><strong>JPG</strong></p>
<p>The JPG format has a limitation of not being compatible with image transparency, and hence is not suitable for related applications.</p>
<p><strong>PNG</strong></p>
<p>The PNG format gives you the liberty to use image transparency in two selective ways. You can either choose to make your image partially transparent by an alpha channel insertion for a smooth edge-background blend, or use index transparency to make the pixels of any particular color as transparent. PNG8 AND PNG24 versions of the format are supportive of index and alpha channel transparencies respectively.</p>
<p><strong>GIF</strong></p>
<p>This format inherently supports index transparency and declares a chosen color on the palette as transparent. Owing to the absence of alpha channel transparency, there is an unsatisfactory blend of edges with the image background. The unevenness becomes more prominent in case of highly detailed and rounded images.</p>
<p>While it is possible to mitigate this loss to some extent with the use of image dithering, the GIF format is still not a preferred choice for creating images with transparent backgrounds. The PNG format is instead, more credible on that aspect.</p>
<h3 id="03Color-1"><a href="#03Color-1" class="headerlink" title="03Color"></a>03Color</h3><p>Color is a visibly strong parameter of difference among the JPG, PNG and GIF image formats, with each one supporting as specific number of colors on the palette.</p>
<p><strong>JPG</strong></p>
<p>The color palette of JPG images is a huge inventory of 16 million colors, rendering them suitable for storing natural stills having a smooth color transition.</p>
<p><strong>PNG</strong></p>
<p>The two versions of PNG format differ on color variance. While PNG8 permits 256 colors, the PNG24 format supports 16 million colors, similar to the JPG format. Consider using the PNG8 format for an image with simple shapes and lesser variations in color. It is, on the other hand better to use the PNG24 format for images with transparent backgrounds, high image quality and complex shapes with detailed edges.</p>
<p><strong>GIF</strong></p>
<p>The GIF format is a host to 256 colors, one of which becomes transparent on using index transparency and the other 255 support different color variations.</p>
<h3 id="04Animation-1"><a href="#04Animation-1" class="headerlink" title="04Animation"></a>04Animation</h3><p>Animation here, is not necessarily restricted to having frame rates, but refers to a certain periodic movement of specific image sections with time. Out of JPG, PNG and GIF, only the last one is compatible with GIFs. You can use this utility to crate and share eye catching banners and advertisements. The advent of GIF specific content platforms, such as, GIPHY, Tumblr, etc., has further uplifted GIF reach and usage.</p>
<p>A variety of image formats are available to choose from for catering to specific content requirements. However, you can always optimize the format selection in cohesion with the current need.</p>

                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Download Adobe Photoshop</strong></p>
<p>Navigate to Adobe’s official website and download the Photoshop application in your device. Install and launch the same to reach the app’s welcome interface.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Inage Selection"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Make a Layered Image File</strong></p>
<p>In the main interface, open a selected image and navigate to the ‘Layers Panel’ in the right of the image window. However, if the ‘Layers Panel’ does not show up by default, reach to the top toolbar and hit the ‘Window’ tab. From the drop sown menu that follows, select ‘Layers’.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Let’s Get Creating!</strong></p>
<p>In the application interface, navigate to the toolbar at the left and choose the ‘Magic Wand’ tool. Again, reach to the ‘Options’ bar at the top and choose ‘Select Subject’. This will facilitate the selection of the min object of the image, irrespective of its background and the selection will be visible as ‘marching ants’ around the object.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Magic Wand Tool Selection"
                ></p>
<p>If you find the selection to be improper, use the ‘Magic Wand’ to ward off excessive background portions by choosing the ’Subtract From Selection’ option, or even add some extra product portions, suited to your requirement. While making your selection, take care to include any holes in the product image.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Subject Selection"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Background Deletion</strong></p>
<p>When you are left with only the selected product, navigate to the top toolbar and hit the ’Select’ tab and choose ‘Inverse’ from the drop down menu that follows. You can alternatively use the ‘Shift+Ctrl+I’ command for a Windows device, or enter ‘Shift+Command+I’ command, in case you are using a Mac supported device.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-14.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application-Background Inverse Interface"
                ></p>
<p>Make a selection of the inverse background and tap ‘Backspace’ or ‘Delete’ in your Windows and Mac devices respectively. This will cause your background to get transparent. In the Photoshop application, a gray-white checkerboard represents a transparent background.</p>
<p>In case you require deselecting any selection, enter ‘Ctrl+D’ in Windows or ‘Command+D’ in a Mac device.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-15.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Section Deselect"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Save Your Creation in a Web Compatible Format</strong></p>
<p>When you are done creating the transparent background artwork, it becomes equally important to save your creation in a web compatible format to export them on different media platforms and product websites.</p>
<p>Talking of the preferable image format, it is highly recommended to use the PNG24 one, owing to its flexibility of alpha channel transparency, which permits partially transparent image backgrounds along with layered transparency. This in turn makes it possible to integrate the image with varying color backgrounds on different sites and platforms without hollow pixelation.</p>
<p>To save your artwork in the PNG24 file format, navigate to the application toolbar bat the top and hit the ‘File’ tab and choose the ‘Export’ option from the drop sown menu that appears. Select the ‘Export As’ option from the ‘Export’ popup menu.</p>
<p>For an older Photoshop version, hit the ‘Export’ tab and choose ‘Save for Web’ from the dropdown menu, followed by selecting the PNG24 option. A format dialog box appears where you can set the transparency settings. To do this, navigate to ‘File Settings’ at the right, choose the PNG file format and check the ‘Transparency’ box. Avoid checking the ‘Smaller Size’ box, else the image will get saved in the PNG8 format.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-16.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Image Export Interface"
                ></p>
<p>In the left of the screen, the image file size is displayed. Maintain an affordable file size, preferably within 200 KB, to avoid slower image loading on the sharing platform. You can adjust this in the ‘Image Size’ option at the right.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-17.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Transparency and Size Settings Interface"
                ></p>
<p>Set a conveniently reduced dimension, while taking care not to set an extremely small size, else it will produce a pixelated output on the site. It is preferable to set a 50-100% larger image size for a convenient display across different devices.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Final Save</strong></p>
<p>Once you are satisfied with all the image settings, tap ‘Export All’ to save your artwork locally in your device. In the ‘File Save’ dialog box, choose a preferred device location, enter a suitable file name and choose the .png extension. At last, click on ‘Save’.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-a-Transparent-PNG-Background-2"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-a-Transparent-PNG-Background-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What Is a Transparent PNG Background?"></a>Part 1 What Is a Transparent PNG Background?</h2><p>Transparent backgrounds are essentially faded overlays to any graphic content, like, an image or a video, that are useful in emphasizing the main element in the substance. Compatible to a variety of image and video formats, these are the talk of the trend, owing to their excellent content promotion utility. These are the latest and creative examples of information presentation, along with being among the best branding tools that can potentially make your content fresh and unique.</p>

<h2 id="Part-2-Differences-Among-PNG-vs-JPG-vs-GIF-2"><a href="#Part-2-Differences-Among-PNG-vs-JPG-vs-GIF-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Differences Among PNG vs JPG vs GIF"></a>Part 2 Differences Among PNG vs JPG vs GIF</h2><p>Diversity in requirement and usage has led to the advent of a variety of image formats, each suited to a specific purpose. On account of this variation, it becomes a confusing task to select the best image format that can fetch the most affordable images results in cohesion with exact user needs.</p>
<p>It is recommenced to use the JPG image format for natural stills that have a smooth variations in intensity and color. If your content requires image transparency, or contains texts and elements that have a sharp contrast image, like a brand logo, you should ideally prefer the PNG image format, while the GIF format is best suited for presenting animated content. As an explanation to the above usage constraints, here’s a comparison of the popular PNG, JPG and GIF image formats in the light of some common credibility parameters.</p>
<h3 id="01Compression-2"><a href="#01Compression-2" class="headerlink" title="01Compression"></a>01Compression</h3><p>Image compression facilitates a quick data transmission across different web based platforms, owing to the reduced file size. While compression can be either lossy or lossless, choose an image format that maintains the size credibility in resonance with your data needs. A lossless compression guarantees the retrieval of original image, but a lossy compression fails to do so.</p>
<p><strong>JPG</strong></p>
<p>The JPG format is a lossy compressor that plays on your ability to perceive. The format has the credibility of a 1:10 compression ratio, without comprising with the original image quality. However, a further increased compression ratio may generate perceivable differences in image quality.</p>
<p>The JPG compression utilizes the concept of Discrete Cosine Transform, i.e., a color averaging of the image pixels in close proximity. Hence, it is suitable to use this format for natural and scenic stills, having a smooth color and intensity transition. Preferring this image format for a transmission of high contrast and sharpened images is however, not advisable.</p>
<p><strong>PNG</strong></p>
<p>This format supports the Deflate Compression technique and neither introduces artefacts, nor cuts down on the image quality. Choose the PNG image format for a lossless and high quality compression in comparison to JPG. This one is a more effective format with higher image quality, sharper image presentation and occupies a larger memory space on your device.</p>
<p>You can rely on PNG images for presenting data with text, shapes and logos with high contrast pixelation. It is however, not a good choice for transferring digital images that have a high resolution.</p>
<p><strong>GIF</strong></p>
<p>Working on the LZW Compression Algorithm, this image format was originally used to showcase simple website graphics, when the PNG format was still at a developing stage. However, with the advancement of PNG as a more effective compression format, the use of GIF is now restricted to animated content sharing.</p>
<h3 id="02Transparency-2"><a href="#02Transparency-2" class="headerlink" title="02Transparency"></a>02Transparency</h3><p>Transparency is tern used to describe some invisible content. This is suitable to use in image backgrounds when you need to lay extra stress on the main content, like the logo of your product with a cohesive brand text, etc. the transparent background used here facilitates the use of a particular image with a series of background and color variations.</p>
<p><strong>JPG</strong></p>
<p>The JPG format has a limitation of not being compatible with image transparency, and hence is not suitable for related applications.</p>
<p><strong>PNG</strong></p>
<p>The PNG format gives you the liberty to use image transparency in two selective ways. You can either choose to make your image partially transparent by an alpha channel insertion for a smooth edge-background blend, or use index transparency to make the pixels of any particular color as transparent. PNG8 AND PNG24 versions of the format are supportive of index and alpha channel transparencies respectively.</p>
<p><strong>GIF</strong></p>
<p>This format inherently supports index transparency and declares a chosen color on the palette as transparent. Owing to the absence of alpha channel transparency, there is an unsatisfactory blend of edges with the image background. The unevenness becomes more prominent in case of highly detailed and rounded images.</p>
<p>While it is possible to mitigate this loss to some extent with the use of image dithering, the GIF format is still not a preferred choice for creating images with transparent backgrounds. The PNG format is instead, more credible on that aspect.</p>
<h3 id="03Color-2"><a href="#03Color-2" class="headerlink" title="03Color"></a>03Color</h3><p>Color is a visibly strong parameter of difference among the JPG, PNG and GIF image formats, with each one supporting as specific number of colors on the palette.</p>
<p><strong>JPG</strong></p>
<p>The color palette of JPG images is a huge inventory of 16 million colors, rendering them suitable for storing natural stills having a smooth color transition.</p>
<p><strong>PNG</strong></p>
<p>The two versions of PNG format differ on color variance. While PNG8 permits 256 colors, the PNG24 format supports 16 million colors, similar to the JPG format. Consider using the PNG8 format for an image with simple shapes and lesser variations in color. It is, on the other hand better to use the PNG24 format for images with transparent backgrounds, high image quality and complex shapes with detailed edges.</p>
<p><strong>GIF</strong></p>
<p>The GIF format is a host to 256 colors, one of which becomes transparent on using index transparency and the other 255 support different color variations.</p>
<h3 id="04Animation-2"><a href="#04Animation-2" class="headerlink" title="04Animation"></a>04Animation</h3><p>Animation here, is not necessarily restricted to having frame rates, but refers to a certain periodic movement of specific image sections with time. Out of JPG, PNG and GIF, only the last one is compatible with GIFs. You can use this utility to crate and share eye catching banners and advertisements. The advent of GIF specific content platforms, such as, GIPHY, Tumblr, etc., has further uplifted GIF reach and usage.</p>
<p>A variety of image formats are available to choose from for catering to specific content requirements. However, you can always optimize the format selection in cohesion with the current need.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Make a Layered Image File</strong></p>
<p>In the main interface, open a selected image and navigate to the ‘Layers Panel’ in the right of the image window. However, if the ‘Layers Panel’ does not show up by default, reach to the top toolbar and hit the ‘Window’ tab. From the drop sown menu that follows, select ‘Layers’.</p>

                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Magic Wand Tool Selection"
                ></p>
<p>If you find the selection to be improper, use the ‘Magic Wand’ to ward off excessive background portions by choosing the ’Subtract From Selection’ option, or even add some extra product portions, suited to your requirement. While making your selection, take care to include any holes in the product image.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Background Deletion</strong></p>
<p>When you are left with only the selected product, navigate to the top toolbar and hit the ’Select’ tab and choose ‘Inverse’ from the drop down menu that follows. You can alternatively use the ‘Shift+Ctrl+I’ command for a Windows device, or enter ‘Shift+Command+I’ command, in case you are using a Mac supported device.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application-Background Inverse Interface"
                ></p>
<p>Make a selection of the inverse background and tap ‘Backspace’ or ‘Delete’ in your Windows and Mac devices respectively. This will cause your background to get transparent. In the Photoshop application, a gray-white checkerboard represents a transparent background.</p>
<p>In case you require deselecting any selection, enter ‘Ctrl+D’ in Windows or ‘Command+D’ in a Mac device.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Section Deselect"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Save Your Creation in a Web Compatible Format</strong></p>
<p>When you are done creating the transparent background artwork, it becomes equally important to save your creation in a web compatible format to export them on different media platforms and product websites.</p>
<p>Talking of the preferable image format, it is highly recommended to use the PNG24 one, owing to its flexibility of alpha channel transparency, which permits partially transparent image backgrounds along with layered transparency. This in turn makes it possible to integrate the image with varying color backgrounds on different sites and platforms without hollow pixelation.</p>
<p>To save your artwork in the PNG24 file format, navigate to the application toolbar bat the top and hit the ‘File’ tab and choose the ‘Export’ option from the drop sown menu that appears. Select the ‘Export As’ option from the ‘Export’ popup menu.</p>
<p>For an older Photoshop version, hit the ‘Export’ tab and choose ‘Save for Web’ from the dropdown menu, followed by selecting the PNG24 option. A format dialog box appears where you can set the transparency settings. To do this, navigate to ‘File Settings’ at the right, choose the PNG file format and check the ‘Transparency’ box.

Compatible to a variety of image and video formats, these are the talk of the trend, owing to their excellent content promotion utility.

<h2 id="Part-2-Differences-Among-PNG-vs-JPG-vs-GIF-3"><a href="#Part-2-Differences-Among-PNG-vs-JPG-vs-GIF-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Differences Among PNG vs JPG vs GIF"></a>Part 2 Differences Among PNG vs JPG vs GIF</h2><p>Diversity in requirement and usage has led to the advent of a variety of image formats, each suited to a specific purpose. On account of this variation, it becomes a confusing task to select the best image format that can fetch the most affordable images results in cohesion with exact user needs.</p>
<p>It is recommenced to use the JPG image format for natural stills that have a smooth variations in intensity and color. If your content requires image transparency, or contains texts and elements that have a sharp contrast image, like a brand logo, you should ideally prefer the PNG image format, while the GIF format is best suited for presenting animated content. As an explanation to the above usage constraints, here’s a comparison of the popular PNG, JPG and GIF image formats in the light of some common credibility parameters.</p>
<h3 id="01Compression-3"><a href="#01Compression-3" class="headerlink" title="01Compression"></a>01Compression</h3><p>Image compression facilitates a quick data transmission across different web based platforms, owing to the reduced file size. While compression can be either lossy or lossless, choose an image format that maintains the size credibility in resonance with your data needs. A lossless compression guarantees the retrieval of original image, but a lossy compression fails to do so.</p>
<p><strong>JPG</strong></p>
<p>The JPG format is a lossy compressor that plays on your ability to perceive. The format has the credibility of a 1:10 compression ratio, without comprising with the original image quality. However, a further increased compression ratio may generate perceivable differences in image quality.</p>
<p>The JPG compression utilizes the concept of Discrete Cosine Transform, i.e., a color averaging of the image pixels in close proximity. Hence, it is suitable to use this format for natural and scenic stills, having a smooth color and intensity transition. Preferring this image format for a transmission of high contrast and sharpened images is however, not advisable.</p>
<p><strong>PNG</strong></p>
<p>This format supports the Deflate Compression technique and neither introduces artefacts, nor cuts down on the image quality. Choose the PNG image format for a lossless and high quality compression in comparison to JPG. This one is a more effective format with higher image quality, sharper image presentation and occupies a larger memory space on your device.</p>
<p>You can rely on PNG images for presenting data with text, shapes and logos with high contrast pixelation. It is however, not a good choice for transferring digital images that have a high resolution.</p>
<p><strong>GIF</strong></p>
<p>Working on the LZW Compression Algorithm, this image format was originally used to showcase simple website graphics, when the PNG format was still at a developing stage. However, with the advancement of PNG as a more effective compression format, the use of GIF is now restricted to animated content sharing.</p>
<h3 id="02Transparency-3"><a href="#02Transparency-3" class="headerlink" title="02Transparency"></a>02Transparency</h3><p>Transparency is tern used to describe some invisible content. This is suitable to use in image backgrounds when you need to lay extra stress on the main content, like the logo of your product with a cohesive brand text, etc. the transparent background used here facilitates the use of a particular image with a series of background and color variations.</p>
<p><strong>JPG</strong></p>
<p>The JPG format has a limitation of not being compatible with image transparency, and hence is not suitable for related applications.</p>
<p><strong>PNG</strong></p>
<p>The PNG format gives you the liberty to use image transparency in two selective ways. You can either choose to make your image partially transparent by an alpha channel insertion for a smooth edge-background blend, or use index transparency to make the pixels of any particular color as transparent. PNG8 AND PNG24 versions of the format are supportive of index and alpha channel transparencies respectively.</p>
<p><strong>GIF</strong></p>
<p>This format inherently supports index transparency and declares a chosen color on the palette as transparent. Owing to the absence of alpha channel transparency, there is an unsatisfactory blend of edges with the image background. The unevenness becomes more prominent in case of highly detailed and rounded images.</p>
<p>While it is possible to mitigate this loss to some extent with the use of image dithering, the GIF format is still not a preferred choice for creating images with transparent backgrounds. The PNG format is instead, more credible on that aspect.</p>
<h3 id="03Color-3"><a href="#03Color-3" class="headerlink" title="03Color"></a>03Color</h3><p>Color is a visibly strong parameter of difference among the JPG, PNG and GIF image formats, with each one supporting as specific number of colors on the palette.</p>
<p><strong>JPG</strong></p>
<p>The color palette of JPG images is a huge inventory of 16 million colors, rendering them suitable for storing natural stills having a smooth color transition.</p>
<p><strong>PNG</strong></p>
<p>The two versions of PNG format differ on color variance. While PNG8 permits 256 colors, the PNG24 format supports 16 million colors, similar to the JPG format. Consider using the PNG8 format for an image with simple shapes and lesser variations in color. It is, on the other hand better to use the PNG24 format for images with transparent backgrounds, high image quality and complex shapes with detailed edges.</p>
<p><strong>GIF</strong></p>
<p>The GIF format is a host to 256 colors, one of which becomes transparent on using index transparency and the other 255 support different color variations.</p>
<h3 id="04Animation-3"><a href="#04Animation-3" class="headerlink" title="04Animation"></a>04Animation</h3><p>Animation here, is not necessarily restricted to having frame rates, but refers to a certain periodic movement of specific image sections with time. Out of JPG, PNG and GIF, only the last one is compatible with GIFs. You can use this utility to crate and share eye catching banners and advertisements. The advent of GIF specific content platforms, such as, GIPHY, Tumblr, etc., has further uplifted GIF reach and usage.</p>
<p>A variety of image formats are available to choose from for catering to specific content requirements. However, you can always optimize the format selection in cohesion with the current need.</p>

<p>In the main interface, open a selected image and navigate to the ‘Layers Panel’ in the right of the image window. However, if the ‘Layers Panel’ does not show up by default, reach to the top toolbar and hit the ‘Window’ tab. From the drop sown menu that follows, select ‘Layers’.</p>

                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-10.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Image Layering Interface"
                ></p>
<p>In this panel, double tap the ‘Background‘layer. This causes the ‘Rename Layer’ dialog box to appear. You can either enter a suitable name or continue with the default ‘Layer 0’ name. When you are done, click on ‘OK’.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-11.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Layer Rename Interface"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Let’s Get Creating!</strong></p>
<p>In the application interface, navigate to the toolbar at the left and choose the ‘Magic Wand’ tool. Again, reach to the ‘Options’ bar at the top and choose ‘Select Subject’. This will facilitate the selection of the min object of the image, irrespective of its background and the selection will be visible as ‘marching ants’ around the object.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-12.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Magic Wand Tool Selection"
                ></p>
<p>If you find the selection to be improper, use the ‘Magic Wand’ to ward off excessive background portions by choosing the ’Subtract From Selection’ option, or even add some extra product portions, suited to your requirement. While making your selection, take care to include any holes in the product image.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-13.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Subject Selection"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Background Deletion</strong></p>
<p>When you are left with only the selected product, navigate to the top toolbar and hit the ’Select’ tab and choose ‘Inverse’ from the drop down menu that follows. You can alternatively use the ‘Shift+Ctrl+I’ command for a Windows device, or enter ‘Shift+Command+I’ command, in case you are using a Mac supported device.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-14.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application-Background Inverse Interface"
                ></p>
<p>Make a selection of the inverse background and tap ‘Backspace’ or ‘Delete’ in your Windows and Mac devices respectively. This will cause your background to get transparent. In the Photoshop application, a gray-white checkerboard represents a transparent background.</p>
<p>In case you require deselecting any selection, enter ‘Ctrl+D’ in Windows or ‘Command+D’ in a Mac device.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-15.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Section Deselect"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Save Your Creation in a Web Compatible Format</strong></p>
<p>When you are done creating the transparent background artwork, it becomes equally important to save your creation in a web compatible format to export them on different media platforms and product websites.</p>
<p>Talking of the preferable image format, it is highly recommended to use the PNG24 one, owing to its flexibility of alpha channel transparency, which permits partially transparent image backgrounds along with layered transparency. This in turn makes it possible to integrate the image with varying color backgrounds on different sites and platforms without hollow pixelation.</p>
<p>To save your artwork in the PNG24 file format, navigate to the application toolbar bat the top and hit the ‘File’ tab and choose the ‘Export’ option from the drop sown menu that appears. Select the ‘Export As’ option from the ‘Export’ popup menu.</p>
<p>For an older Photoshop version, hit the ‘Export’ tab and choose ‘Save for Web’ from the dropdown menu, followed by selecting the PNG24 option. A format dialog box appears where you can set the transparency settings. To do this, navigate to ‘File Settings’ at the right, choose the PNG file format and check the ‘Transparency’ box. Avoid checking the ‘Smaller Size’ box, else the image will get saved in the PNG8 format.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-16.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Image Export Interface"
                ></p>
<p>In the left of the screen, the image file size is displayed. Maintain an affordable file size, preferably within 200 KB, to avoid slower image loading on the sharing platform. You can adjust this in the ‘Image Size’ option at the right.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Ideas-that-will-help-you-out-in-making-transparent-image-17.JPG"
                      alt="Photoshop Graphic Design Application- Transparency and Size Settings Interface"
                ></p>
<p>Set a conveniently reduced dimension, while taking care not to set an extremely small size, else it will produce a pixelated output on the site. It is preferable to set a 50-100% larger image size for a convenient display across different devices.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Final Save</strong></p>
<p>Once you are satisfied with all the image settings, tap ‘Export All’ to save your artwork locally in your device. In the ‘File Save’ dialog box, choose a preferred device location, enter a suitable file name and choose the .png extension. At last, click on ‘Save’.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2: Import Media File</strong></p>

<p>You can alternatively, navigate to the ‘Select Color’ option and choose ‘Color Picker’ at its right, reach the image section you wish to make transparent and make a single click.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Filmora- Image Transparency Adjustments"
                ></p>
