<p>AR or <strong>Augmented Reality</strong> and VR or Virtual Reality are quite a common discussion in the world of technology. Similarly, the technology-driven workspaces demand a seamless workspace collaboration post-pandemic. People are used to working from home and the workspace culture is changing rapidly due to such habits. 59% of the US workers want to continue WFH according to a study by TalentLyft. To cut the cost of daily travel and dedicate more quality time to work, employees are prioritizing online offices. On the other hand, employers are willing to save office space and other expenses with such a professional routine. That’s where the idea of augmented reality video conferencing is hitting to keep the collaboration between workers alive for a synchronized workflow.</p>

While AR is an enhanced version of the real world, VR is totally virtual. As a basic concept, note that, augmented reality is an arrangement of the user’s real-world view whereas virtual reality is totally an illusion based on a video. AR can be accessed from a phone to set the camera with a view and a virtual arrangement would be present within it. For example, if there’s a room in the real world, with an <strong>AR video conference</strong>, people can be adjusted virtually.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="ar in conference"
                ></p>
<p>Virtual reality, as the name suggests, is totally in control of the system. With goggles or headsets, one can view computer-generated video with 360 degrees of technical effects to be seemed as real. This technology is mainly applicable for a video currently and there’re more scopes to experiment further.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="vr video streaming"
                ></p>
<p>Here comes the question, how these technologies can be merged with a permanent business structure that can be as effective as the older system, and there’s scope for even better results? Well, according to a study by FinancesOnline, 72% of the US customers find AR for better collaboration and 69% think it increases the efficiency in the workspace. Also, 49% of the IT experts believe that AR can access real-time information sooner.</p>
<p>The key idea behind <strong>augmented reality conferencing</strong> is to omit the parameters like distance, time, and space expenses and motivate positive collaboration in business workflow. There are multiple advantages of this technology for both employees and employers. As people are getting accustomed to the virtual setting in any professional or personal work from home, the plan to shift to a semi-virtual or virtual office structure is not vague now. In fact, this adaptation might take place sooner than expected as a long-term effect of the pandemic.</p>
<p><strong>How</strong> augmented reality conferencing <strong>and virtual reality video streaming will be working?</strong></p>
<p>AR and VR can be implemented through different technologies and hardware devices. As a result, employees can attend a meeting from home, just with a mobile application that enables the office structure in the room. Or, 2-3 members can be present physically in a meeting room while others are joining from remote places through VR. A 3D video streaming would overshadow the physical absence of the teammates. At the same time, the resources can be shared in no time for reference and transparent communication.</p>
<p>So, how exactly a business can be affected by <strong>augmented reality video conferencing</strong> on a large scale? Here’s a keen observation from both perspectives.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> Employers can hire people from remote places based on their skills and without worrying about the distance and timezone gap.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Additional resources like bigger office space, electricity, and water can be saved if <strong>augmented reality video conferencing</strong> is in a complete performance.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Positive collaboration can be expected while the employees have more energy and a comfortable environment to work in. As a result, productivity might take a boost as well.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>AR video conference</strong> serves a better experience than normal video conference in Zoom or Google meeting.</p>

So, there’s no practical feedback on the process of installation, usage, and maintenance.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It would be expensive and time-consuming to set up a virtual reality conference system in a big office with n number of people.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Technical fault from the office or from employees’ home can cost serious penalties in the business workflow.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Hardware limitations like limited battery life, expensive headsets, and wireless connection are required and these things can cause problems while implementation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It can be uncomfortable to wear headsets for a long time during <strong>augmented reality conferencing</strong> andpeople can experience motion sickness due to this.</p>

With Filmora, it would be easier to manage all the videos during an <strong>augmented reality video conferencing</strong>. There are multiple effects like “Motion Tracking”, “Keyframing”, “Audio ducking”, “Speed Control”, and “Color matching” that are required while managing a virtual conference with multiple people. It’s important to match the environment thoroughly so there’s no lack of concentration and inferiority in the system.</p>

<p>AR or <strong>Augmented Reality</strong> and VR or Virtual Reality are quite a common discussion in the world of technology. Similarly, the technology-driven workspaces demand a seamless workspace collaboration post-pandemic. People are used to working from home and the workspace culture is changing rapidly due to such habits. 59% of the US workers want to continue WFH according to a study by TalentLyft. To cut the cost of daily travel and dedicate more quality time to work, employees are prioritizing online offices. On the other hand, employers are willing to save office space and other expenses with such a professional routine. That’s where the idea of augmented reality video conferencing is hitting to keep the collaboration between workers alive for a synchronized workflow.</p>

While AR is an enhanced version of the real world, VR is totally virtual. As a basic concept, note that, augmented reality is an arrangement of the user’s real-world view whereas virtual reality is totally an illusion based on a video. AR can be accessed from a phone to set the camera with a view and a virtual arrangement would be present within it. For example, if there’s a room in the real world, with an <strong>AR video conference</strong>, people can be adjusted virtually.</p>

<p>Virtual reality, as the name suggests, is totally in control of the system. With goggles or headsets, one can view computer-generated video with 360 degrees of technical effects to be seemed as real. This technology is mainly applicable for a video currently and there’re more scopes to experiment further.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Here comes the question, how these technologies can be merged with a permanent business structure that can be as effective as the older system, and there’s scope for even better results? Well, according to a study by FinancesOnline, 72% of the US customers find AR for better collaboration and 69% think it increases the efficiency in the workspace. Also, 49% of the IT experts believe that AR can access real-time information sooner.</p>
<p>The key idea behind <strong>augmented reality conferencing</strong> is to omit the parameters like distance, time, and space expenses and motivate positive collaboration in business workflow. There are multiple advantages of this technology for both employees and employers. As people are getting accustomed to the virtual setting in any professional or personal work from home, the plan to shift to a semi-virtual or virtual office structure is not vague now. In fact, this adaptation might take place sooner than expected as a long-term effect of the pandemic.</p>
<p><strong>How</strong> augmented reality conferencing <strong>and virtual reality video streaming will be working?</strong></p>
<p>AR and VR can be implemented through different technologies and hardware devices. As a result, employees can attend a meeting from home, just with a mobile application that enables the office structure in the room. Or, 2-3 members can be present physically in a meeting room while others are joining from remote places through VR. A 3D video streaming would overshadow the physical absence of the teammates.
