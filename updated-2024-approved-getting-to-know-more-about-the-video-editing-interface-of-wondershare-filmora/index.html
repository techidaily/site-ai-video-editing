A video editing interface is important when it comes to choosing editing software. The more user-friendly the interface, the easier it is to use the particular tool for editing. Many video editing software is available, but not every tool is popular. One of the reasons is their interface is not friendly enough for the user.</p>
<p>However, getting to know the <strong>software’s interface</strong> is as crucial as using the tool. Being familiar with the interface will help you understand the tool even better. An interface is like a map; if you’re familiar with the map, you can edit your videos using the tool. This article will explain the user interface design of Wondershare Filmora in detail.</p>

Next, navigate to the folder on your hard drive where the material you wish to edit is located.

<p>Import with Instant Cutter Tool is now available in the Import menu. The Instant Cutter Tool was created to make trimming 4K and other huge video files simple.

<p>Filmora’s Media tab, underneath the Load button, will hold the documents you import into the interface. When you have to seek the videos and photos you want to add to the timeline, working with several different files in a single project becomes considerably more difficult. You can utilize the My Album feature to create folders and organize your files to reduce clutter and frustration.</p>
<p>Click the Add a New Folder icon at the bottom of the “My Project” section in the upper right corner of the screen. You can sort the footage numerically or in another way that improves your productivity and reduces the hassle you spend looking through files.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Arrange The Video and Audio Files on The Timeline</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Since raw footage frequently contains errors orbits that don’t belong in your video, simply drag them from the Media tab and place them on the timeline if you want to delete or trim your videos. You may add as many clips as you would like, but each additional one will be added after the last one, and you must drag the files to the proper position on the timeline to reorganize them.</p>
<p><img

<p>To evaluate the video clips you’ve uploaded to the timeline, press Play or use the Spacebar. You may also use the playhead to navigate to a specific place in the film. Place the playhead at the precise location where the segment of the video you want to cut begins, then repeat the process on the other end.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Apply Visual Effects</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You may now separate the audio and video files, add music, make transitions between the clips, or apply one of Filmora’s many graphic effects after deleting all the undesirable sections from your video clips.</p>

                ></p>
<p>If you want to place opening titles, end credits, or subtitles on your video, click the Text &#x2F;Credit icon. The software includes a variety of text templates that you can use for various reasons. Drag and drop the theme you chose to the proper spot on the timeline, then use the software’s preview box to add the required text.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Hit the Export button when you’re sure there’s nothing further you want to do with your project. You can quickly select the video file type in the Format section in the Output window and customize the video for Smartphones, iPads, or gaming consoles like the PS4 or Xbox One.</p>
<p>Choose the type that better serves the project you’re working on from the Format tab, then provide the video a title and choose the location on your storage device where it will be exported. You may choose the video resolution, modify the frame rate, and choose an encoder by clicking the Settings button.</p>
<p>Users who do not want to preserve their videos on their storage devices can export them to Vimeo or YouTube. Because the rendering and uploading procedures occur simultaneously, exporting videos helps users save time waiting to submit the video online. To properly distribute your films on these social media networks, you’ll need a YouTube channel or a Facebook account.</p>

Since post-production may take several days, sometimes months, prepare yourself patiently and remember that you are not in a race; take it slowly.</p>
<p>To start making your first video in Filmora, follow the instructions below:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Start Filmora and Choose Your Preferred Aspect Ratio</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When you’re ready to get started on a new video, double-click Filmora’s desktop icon. The software’s greeting screen will prompt you to create a new project or open an existing one. You can also select the aspect ratio here to save time when editing.</p>

                      alt="mp4-video-editor"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Make a New Project</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Allow the editor to load after clicking New Project on the software’s welcome screen. After gaining access to Fillmora’s video editor, you may hit the Register button to activate the software.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-3.jpg"
                      alt="mp4-video-editor"
                ></p>
<p>Select the aspect ratio for the final edit of your video by going to the File menu and selecting Project Settings. You’ll be able to choose from various dimensions, including the typical 16:9 or 4:3 ratios, the less popular 9:16 aspect ratio for vertically oriented films, and the 1:1 aspect ratio for square-shaped videos. You may also adjust the aspect ratio to suit your requirements.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Import Your Files</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You can find the Import button in the upper left corner of the film editor; hit it and choose Import Media Files. Next, navigate to the folder on your hard drive where the material you wish to edit is located. Select the Import button after selecting the video, audio, or photo files you wish to utilize in your project.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>Import with Instant Cutter Tool is now available in the Import menu. The Instant Cutter Tool was created to make trimming 4K and other huge video files simple. Filmora also can quickly edit videos captured with action cameras. You may easily enhance your films with the lens correction tools or the Fish Eye Distortion feature.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Organize Your Clips</strong></li>
</ol>

                ></p>
<p>Filmora’s Media tab, underneath the Load button, will hold the documents you import into the interface. When you have to seek the videos and photos you want to add to the timeline, working with several different files in a single project becomes considerably more difficult. You can utilize the My Album feature to create folders and organize your files to reduce clutter and frustration.</p>
<p>Click the Add a New Folder icon at the bottom of the “My Project” section in the upper right corner of the screen. You can sort the footage numerically or in another way that improves your productivity and reduces the hassle you spend looking through files.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Arrange The Video and Audio Files on The Timeline</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Since raw footage frequently contains errors orbits that don’t belong in your video, simply drag them from the Media tab and place them on the timeline if you want to delete or trim your videos. You may add as many clips as you would like, but each additional one will be added after the last one, and you must drag the files to the proper position on the timeline to reorganize them.</p>

Since post-production may take several days, sometimes months, prepare yourself patiently and remember that you are not in a race; take it slowly.</p>
<p>To start making your first video in Filmora, follow the instructions below:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Start Filmora and Choose Your Preferred Aspect Ratio</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When you’re ready to get started on a new video, double-click Filmora’s desktop icon. The software’s greeting screen will prompt you to create a new project or open an existing one. You can also select the aspect ratio here to save time when editing.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="mp4-video-editor"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Make a New Project</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Allow the editor to load after clicking New Project on the software’s welcome screen. After gaining access to Fillmora’s video editor, you may hit the Register button to activate the software.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-3.jpg"
                      alt="mp4-video-editor"
                ></p>
<p>Select the aspect ratio for the final edit of your video by going to the File menu and selecting Project Settings. You’ll be able to choose from various dimensions, including the typical 16:9 or 4:3 ratios, the less popular 9:16 aspect ratio for vertically oriented films, and the 1:1 aspect ratio for square-shaped videos. You may also adjust the aspect ratio to suit your requirements.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Import Your Files</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You can find the Import button in the upper left corner of the film editor; hit it and choose Import Media Files. Next, navigate to the folder on your hard drive where the material you wish to edit is located. Select the Import button after selecting the video, audio, or photo files you wish to utilize in your project.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="mp4-video-editor"
                ></p>
<p>Import with Instant Cutter Tool is now available in the Import menu. The Instant Cutter Tool was created to make trimming 4K and other huge video files simple. Filmora also can quickly edit videos captured with action cameras. You may easily enhance your films with the lens correction tools or the Fish Eye Distortion feature.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Organize Your Clips</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>Filmora’s Media tab, underneath the Load button, will hold the documents you import into the interface. When you have to seek the videos and photos you want to add to the timeline, working with several different files in a single project becomes considerably more difficult. You can utilize the My Album feature to create folders and organize your files to reduce clutter and frustration.</p>
<p>Click the Add a New Folder icon at the bottom of the “My Project” section in the upper right corner of the screen. You can sort the footage numerically or in another way that improves your productivity and reduces the hassle you spend looking through files.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Arrange The Video and Audio Files on The Timeline</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Since raw footage frequently contains errors orbits that don’t belong in your video, simply drag them from the Media tab and place them on the timeline if you want to delete or trim your videos. You may add as many clips as you would like, but each additional one will be added after the last one, and you must drag the files to the proper position on the timeline to reorganize them.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="mp4-video-editor"
                ></p>
<p>To evaluate the video clips you’ve uploaded to the timeline, press Play or use the Spacebar. You may also use the playhead to navigate to a specific place in the film. Place the playhead at the precise location where the segment of the video you want to cut begins, then repeat the process on the other end.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Apply Visual Effects</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You may now separate the audio and video files, add music, make transitions between the clips, or apply one of Filmora’s many graphic effects after deleting all the undesirable sections from your video clips.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="mp4-video-editor"
                ></p>
<p>If you want to place opening titles, end credits, or subtitles on your video, click the Text &#x2F;Credit icon. The software includes a variety of text templates that you can use for various reasons. Drag and drop the theme you chose to the proper spot on the timeline, then use the software’s preview box to add the required text.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Export Your Final Output</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>

<p>That said, if you simply need to make minor edits or aren’t planning on editing films for a long time, the most exemplary free video editing programs listed above can be handy.

Since post-production may take several days, sometimes months, prepare yourself patiently and remember that you are not in a race; take it slowly.</p>
<p>To start making your first video in Filmora, follow the instructions below:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Start Filmora and Choose Your Preferred Aspect Ratio</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When you’re ready to get started on a new video, double-click Filmora’s desktop icon. The software’s greeting screen will prompt you to create a new project or open an existing one. You can also select the aspect ratio here to save time when editing.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="mp4-video-editor"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Make a New Project</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Allow the editor to load after clicking New Project on the software’s welcome screen. After gaining access to Fillmora’s video editor, you may hit the Register button to activate the software.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mp4-video-editor-3.jpg"
                      alt="mp4-video-editor"
                ></p>
<p>Select the aspect ratio for the final edit of your video by going to the File menu and selecting Project Settings. You’ll be able to choose from various dimensions, including the typical 16:9 or 4:3 ratios, the less popular 9:16 aspect ratio for vertically oriented films, and the 1:1 aspect ratio for square-shaped videos. You may also adjust the aspect ratio to suit your requirements.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Import Your Files</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You can find the Import button in the upper left corner of the film editor; hit it and choose Import Media Files. Next, navigate to the folder on your hard drive where the material you wish to edit is located. Select the Import button after selecting the video, audio, or photo files you wish to utilize in your project.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="mp4-video-editor"
                ></p>
<p>Import with Instant Cutter Tool is now available in the Import menu. The Instant Cutter Tool was created to make trimming 4K and other huge video files simple. Filmora also can quickly edit videos captured with action cameras. You may easily enhance your films with the lens correction tools or the Fish Eye Distortion feature.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Organize Your Clips</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="mp4-video-editor"
                ></p>
<p>Filmora’s Media tab, underneath the Load button, will hold the documents you import into the interface. When you have to seek the videos and photos you want to add to the timeline, working with several different files in a single project becomes considerably more difficult. You can utilize the My Album feature to create folders and organize your files to reduce clutter and frustration.</p>
<p>Click the Add a New Folder icon at the bottom of the “My Project” section in the upper right corner of the screen. You can sort the footage numerically or in another way that improves your productivity and reduces the hassle you spend looking through files.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Arrange The Video and Audio Files on The Timeline</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Since raw footage frequently contains errors orbits that don’t belong in your video, simply drag them from the Media tab and place them on the timeline if you want to delete or trim your videos. You may add as many clips as you would like, but each additional one will be added after the last one, and you must drag the files to the proper position on the timeline to reorganize them.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="mp4-video-editor"
                ></p>
<p>To evaluate the video clips you’ve uploaded to the timeline, press Play or use the Spacebar. You may also use the playhead to navigate to a specific place in the film. Place the playhead at the precise location where the segment of the video you want to cut begins, then repeat the process on the other end.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Apply Visual Effects</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You may now separate the audio and video files, add music, make transitions between the clips, or apply one of Filmora’s many graphic effects after deleting all the undesirable sections from your video clips.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="mp4-video-editor"
                ></p>
<p>If you want to place opening titles, end credits, or subtitles on your video, click the Text &#x2F;Credit icon. The software includes a variety of text templates that you can use for various reasons. Drag and drop the theme you chose to the proper spot on the timeline, then use the software’s preview box to add the required text.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Export Your Final Output</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="mp4-video-editor"
                ></p>
<p>Hit the Export button when you’re sure there’s nothing further you want to do with your project. You can quickly select the video file type in the Format section in the Output window and customize the video for Smartphones, iPads, or gaming consoles like the PS4 or Xbox One.</p>
<p>Choose the type that better serves the project you’re working on from the Format tab, then provide the video a title and choose the location on your storage device where it will be exported. You may choose the video resolution, modify the frame rate, and choose an encoder by clicking the Settings button.</p>
<p>Users who do not want to preserve their videos on their storage devices can export them to Vimeo or YouTube. Because the rendering and uploading procedures occur simultaneously, exporting videos helps users save time waiting to submit the video online. To properly distribute your films on these social media networks, you’ll need a YouTube channel or a Facebook account.</p>
