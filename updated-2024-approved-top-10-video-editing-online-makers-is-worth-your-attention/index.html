                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>Run the setup and let the system complete the installation. Depending on the version, more or less, the software will look like this as you will open it on your system.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-clips-davinci-8.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Import Your Videos to Merge</strong></p>
<p>Click on the “Import Media Files Here” button to choose the videos you want to merge.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>For instance, here, you can see two different video clips on the timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Place Videos on the Same Timeline to Merge</strong></p>
<p>First of all, you must plan the order of the clips because it will help you place the video clips correctly.</p>
<p>So, use your mouse and select the clip.</p>
<p>For example, you can see that there are two clips below. The first clip is named “Islands,” and the second clip is called “Beach.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>Then, move the selected clip (“second clip” is selected for demonstration) and place it right next to the first clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>You must keep in mind that there shouldn’t be any gap between the clips.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>Or else the final result will have a “black space” between the clips.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Export Your File</strong></p>
<p>When you are done merging clips on the timeline, click on the “Export” button to save the combined video in your system.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>Run the setup and let the system complete the installation. Depending on the version, more or less, the software will look like this as you will open it on your system.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Import Your Videos to Merge</strong></p>
<p>Click on the “Import Media Files Here” button to choose the videos you want to merge.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-clips-davinci-9.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>For instance, here, you can see two different video clips on the timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Place Videos on the Same Timeline to Merge</strong></p>
<p>First of all, you must plan the order of the clips because it will help you place the video clips correctly.</p>
<p>So, use your mouse and select the clip.</p>
<p>For example, you can see that there are two clips below. The first clip is named “Islands,” and the second clip is called “Beach.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-clips-davinci-11.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>Then, move the selected clip (“second clip” is selected for demonstration) and place it right next to the first clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-clips-davinci-12.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>You must keep in mind that there shouldn’t be any gap between the clips.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-clips-davinci-13.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>Or else the final result will have a “black space” between the clips.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-clips-davinci-14.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Export Your File</strong></p>
<p>When you are done merging clips on the timeline, click on the “Export” button to save the combined video in your system.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-clips-davinci-15.jpeg"

                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Place Videos on the Same Timeline to Merge</strong></p>
<p>First of all, you must plan the order of the clips because it will help you place the video clips correctly.</p>
<p>So, use your mouse and select the clip.</p>
<p>For example, you can see that there are two clips below. The first clip is named “Islands,” and the second clip is called “Beach.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-clips-davinci-11.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>Then, move the selected clip (“second clip” is selected for demonstration) and place it right next to the first clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-clips-davinci-12.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>You must keep in mind that there shouldn’t be any gap between the clips.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-clips-davinci-13.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>Or else the final result will have a “black space” between the clips.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-clips-davinci-14.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Export Your File</strong></p>
<p>When you are done merging clips on the timeline, click on the “Export” button to save the combined video in your system.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/merge-clips-davinci-15.jpeg"
                      alt="merge-clips-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>You can merge several clips in just four steps without wasting your time looking around for options and losing the video quality.</p>
