A video blur app allows you to blur any part of your video, including the face. It also lets users add blur video effects to their streams. With that in mind, here are some of the applications you can use to blur faces in videos if you are using an iPhone.</p>
<h4 id="1-Blur-Video-Background"><a href="#1-Blur-Video-Background" class="headerlink" title="1. Blur Video Background"></a>1. Blur Video Background</h4><p>Compatible with iOS 13.0 or later, Blur Video Background can help you blur out moving objects or apply blur filters to videos. You can try radial or rectangular blur shapes and then resize the tool to blur perfectly. Users can also choose from a range of blurry effects, including Pixelate and Gaussian blur.</p>
<p>Additionally, this video blur app allows you to blur multiple objects in your videos. The application has a video keyframe feature that allows users to obscure moving objects and faces in a video. All you have to do is place the keyframe on the area of the video you would like to conceal and keep adjusting the position. Indeed, this video blur app has made censoring videos a breeze.</p>
<p>You can choose from several blurred backgrounds, such as Sepia, Matrix, Fade, or Vignette, and renovate your movies. When you complete making the edits, you can export your video in 4K resolution, Full HD, or HD. What’s more? You can share your edited videos through social profiles with ease.</p>
<p>To learn how to blur part of a video on iPhone using this application, you first need to launch the app on your device. You can select videos from the Gallery or record one directly with your iPhone camera. Next, you have to choose the blur shape you prefer: either circular blur or rectangular blur.</p>
<p>Use your finger to drag the blurred area on the face to get a pixelated face. Once you have done this, you need to adjust the strength of the blur tool with the slider until you get the desired blurred faces. Export your video by tapping the save icon. Getting censored videos or blurry faces has never been this easier.</p>

Check them as below.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Have a theme</strong></p>
<p>First of all, have a theme for a slideshow based on which the other elements can be selected. The theme or the story you want to portray can be based on the target audience and the purpose of creating a slideshow. For instance, if you want to generate sales from your products, create a slideshow that shows the benefits of your products and compares them with others in the same category.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Keep it simple</strong></p>
<p>The real purpose of a slideshow presentation is to convey your data or message in a simple manner that can be easily related. Since the slides move one after the other in a slideshow, they should be created in a manner so that the viewer can quickly understand them.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Keep minimum text</strong></p>
<p>Though text can be included in a slideshow, keep them to a minimum. A slideshow is a creative presentation having pictures, videos, graphs, and several other elements. So, keep the text whenever necessary and don’t include too much-written content. Moreover, a viewer can relate to and recall the product, brand, or service more through a message rather than a text.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Include compelling visuals</strong></p>
<p>Include relevant visuals like videos and images into your slideshow. Make sure that the files are in high resolution and clear and support the theme or the message you are trying to convey through the presentation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Add effects, filters, overlays, and other elements</strong></p>
<p>Instead of adding the raw image and video footage, edit and customize them to make them more interesting and engaging. There are several professional video editing tools like Wondershare Filmora and others that can help you add effects, transitions, overlays, filters, and customize files as needed. Additional elements like graphs, charts, and more can also be added to the presentation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Use Templates</strong></p>
<p>Templates are ready-made design that helps you create a slideshow presentation quickly and easily. The templates in a variety of designs in different categories are available for you to choose the most suitable one. You can check the collection of templates from various online sites and tools.</p>

Check them as below.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Have a theme</strong></p>
<p>First of all, have a theme for a slideshow based on which the other elements can be selected. The theme or the story you want to portray can be based on the target audience and the purpose of creating a slideshow. For instance, if you want to generate sales from your products, create a slideshow that shows the benefits of your products and compares them with others in the same category.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Keep it simple</strong></p>
<p>The real purpose of a slideshow presentation is to convey your data or message in a simple manner that can be easily related. Since the slides move one after the other in a slideshow, they should be created in a manner so that the viewer can quickly understand them.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Keep minimum text</strong></p>
<p>Though text can be included in a slideshow, keep them to a minimum. A slideshow is a creative presentation having pictures, videos, graphs, and several other elements. So, keep the text whenever necessary and don’t include too much-written content. Moreover, a viewer can relate to and recall the product, brand, or service more through a message rather than a text.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Include compelling visuals</strong></p>
<p>Include relevant visuals like videos and images into your slideshow. Make sure that the files are in high resolution and clear and support the theme or the message you are trying to convey through the presentation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Add effects, filters, overlays, and other elements</strong></p>
<p>Instead of adding the raw image and video footage, edit and customize them to make them more interesting and engaging. There are several professional video editing tools like Wondershare Filmora and others that can help you add effects, transitions, overlays, filters, and customize files as needed. Additional elements like graphs, charts, and more can also be added to the presentation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Use Templates</strong></p>
<p>Templates are ready-made design that helps you create a slideshow presentation quickly and easily. The templates in a variety of designs in different categories are available for you to choose the most suitable one. You can check the collection of templates from various online sites and tools.</p>

Check them as below.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Have a theme</strong></p>
<p>First of all, have a theme for a slideshow based on which the other elements can be selected. The theme or the story you want to portray can be based on the target audience and the purpose of creating a slideshow. For instance, if you want to generate sales from your products, create a slideshow that shows the benefits of your products and compares them with others in the same category.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Keep it simple</strong></p>
<p>The real purpose of a slideshow presentation is to convey your data or message in a simple manner that can be easily related. Since the slides move one after the other in a slideshow, they should be created in a manner so that the viewer can quickly understand them.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Keep minimum text</strong></p>
<p>Though text can be included in a slideshow, keep them to a minimum. A slideshow is a creative presentation having pictures, videos, graphs, and several other elements. So, keep the text whenever necessary and don’t include too much-written content. Moreover, a viewer can relate to and recall the product, brand, or service more through a message rather than a text.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Include compelling visuals</strong></p>
<p>Include relevant visuals like videos and images into your slideshow. Make sure that the files are in high resolution and clear and support the theme or the message you are trying to convey through the presentation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Add effects, filters, overlays, and other elements</strong></p>
<p>Instead of adding the raw image and video footage, edit and customize them to make them more interesting and engaging. There are several professional video editing tools like Wondershare Filmora and others that can help you add effects, transitions, overlays, filters, and customize files as needed. Additional elements like graphs, charts, and more can also be added to the presentation.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Use Templates</strong></p>
<p>Templates are ready-made design that helps you create a slideshow presentation quickly and easily. The templates in a variety of designs in different categories are available for you to choose the most suitable one. You can check the collection of templates from various online sites and tools.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Match-Paint-Color-Without-a-Sample"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Match-Paint-Color-Without-a-Sample" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 How to Match Paint Color Without a Sample"></a>Part 1 How to Match Paint Color Without a Sample</h2><p>We will be discussing three methods in which you will get the perfect answer to the question of how can I <strong>match my paint color</strong> perfectly. So, let us jump right into the first method without further delay.</p>
<h3 id="01Method-1-Perfect-Match-Paint-without-a-sample"><a href="#01Method-1-Perfect-Match-Paint-without-a-sample" class="headerlink" title="01Method 1 Perfect Match Paint without a sample"></a>01<strong>Method 1 Perfect Match Paint without a sample</strong></h3><p>The following steps will help you attain <strong>Perfect Match Paint</strong> without the necessity of a sample.</p>
<p><strong>Step Clean the print area</strong></p>
<p>The first and the most essential step is to make the area where you will be painting clean and tidy. As time passes, fingerprints, marks, dust, and many other things accumulate and make the area dirty. And if you do not clean the same, then the paint you do on it becomes much darker, dull, and gives a shabby outlook.</p>
<p>Use a damp sponge, and if possible, it is better to use soap on the sponge. And most importantly, you will have to let the area dry out completely before you put it on to test the paint. Moreover, the new paint adheres much better than before when you clean the area.</p>

                      alt="clean area"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step Scraping off</strong></p>
<p>The next step requires you to use a utility knife. And with that utility knife, you will have to scrap an inch or 2.5 cm of your wall paint. It is because, when you have a sample, you can easily bring that to the store for <strong>paint matching near me</strong>. Use a plastic bag to secure the sample price. It will prevent the paint of the sample to smudge or getting any marks or destruction.</p>
<p>And after you <strong>find paint colors</strong> that match the ones you need, try to dab a little of that paint on the sample. As a result, you will precisely know how perfectly the new shade of paint matches with the new one. It ensures optimum precision and can be the <strong>best way to match paint</strong>.</p>

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="scrapping off"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step Bring the object if possible</strong></p>
<p>The best way to maintain absolute precision in the match is by bringing an object to the store. You can also opt for a <strong>car paint match near me</strong>. If you bring the object with the color for matching, it ensures perfect matching and 10precision. Nowadays, the technology is highly advanced and will help you obtain the best paint match.</p>
<h3 id="02Method-2-Using-a-sample"><a href="#02Method-2-Using-a-sample" class="headerlink" title="02Method 2 Using a sample"></a>02<strong>Method 2 Using a sample</strong></h3><p>Since we have discussed the steps for matching paint without the sample, you must know how to match color with the help of samples. So, here are the steps for doing so.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Click a Picture of the original hue</strong></p>
<p>This step is necessary for better precision and matching the color as perfectly as possible. Clock a picture of the original color sample. The color in the photo might not be absolutely precise. But it can help to a large extent to match the color as perfectly as possible. You can easily take the sample to any renowned color matching store, like, <strong>dupli color paint match</strong> and have the perfect color matching done.</p>
<p>And it is better to not one picture or from just one angel. It will be best to take numerous snaps and that too, from different angles, sides and lighting conditions. It will help you get the original color shades in different angles, shades and lights, and it increases the possibility of matching the color as impeccably as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Bring home more than one sample</strong></p>
<p>You will see numerous samples of paints that you feel will match the color you brought from your home as a sample of the original color. You might not be sure which sample perfectly matches the original sample color at that exact moment. However, if you find a sample that seems t match perfectly, you must not make your decision right at that moment. Because in the store, the lighting, angles, and many other factors play a hugely influential role in enhancing the shades of the sample colors.</p>
<p>So, the color you see in the store often does not remain the same in natural light settings; it might get a bit darker or lighter. So, it is always better to bring home those samples that you feel match the original shade of the sample you brought. This increases the possibility of being the most precise and impeccable in matching the colors.</p>

                      alt="samples color match"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: stick the sample and compare.</strong></p>
<p>This is the final step for matching the colors of paint with the help of a sample. After bringing home the samples that you found similar to the original sample, tape them to the wall. Take a sample at a time and use a tap to place them on the wall. You can also tape all the samples side by side, leaving enough gap between them.</p>
<p>It helps better compare and matches the sample’s colors and the wall. A common thing that occurs is that in the daytime, you find one color matching perfectly, whereas, in the nighttime, some other sample color is matching perfectly. In such an instance, it is best to ask the store if they can give you the shade by mixing both the colors: the color that perfectly matched with the sample in the daytime and the color that perfectly matched with the sample in the time.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Paint the samples on the wall</strong></p>
<p>It is an optional step, and you can opt for this step if you are not getting a hundred per cent confidence in choosing the correct color. Try to paint the colors of the samples that you are finding similar to the wall. Since the wall already has the original color, when you paint the sample colors on it, the sample colors clearly distinguish which samples match more impeccably with the actual color.</p>

So now, we will be listing down the steps that will help you match the paints with the help of mobile applications. The steps are given as follows.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1 Install the application</strong></p>
<p>You will find numerous mobile applications meant for matching paint colors. Opt for the ones you find the best and most efficient. Download it and install it on your phone. If you have used a renowned brand for painting, you can use their application. For example, you can use <strong>Asian paints color matching</strong> if you have used their brand of paints before.</p>

                      alt="color matching app"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2 Scan the shade</strong></p>
<p>Now, even the original paint shade. There are factors such as lighting, angel and shadow that you must remover to consider while you scan the color of the original sample.</p>

                      alt="scanning shade in app"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3 Paint the sample</strong></p>
<p>To be most precise and sure, paint the sample of the paint you have chosen. It will be a way of double-checking your division and ensuring a perfect paint match.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="paint sample"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4 Use a color scanner</strong></p>
<p>It is another optional step, but there will be absolutely no doubt in the precision of paint matching if you use it. You can either borrow or buy a paint scanner. If you are not planning to paint again soon, it is best to borrow the paint scanner.</p>

As time passes, fingerprints, marks, dust, and many other things accumulate and make the area dirty. And if you do not clean the same, then the paint you do on it becomes much darker, dull, and gives a shabby outlook.</p>
<p>Use a damp sponge, and if possible, it is better to use soap on the sponge. And most importantly, you will have to let the area dry out completely before you put it on to test the paint. Moreover, the new paint adheres much better than before when you clean the area.</p>

<p><strong>Step Scraping off</strong></p>
<p>The next step requires you to use a utility knife. And with that utility knife, you will have to scrap an inch or 2.5 cm of your wall paint. It is because, when you have a sample, you can easily bring that to the store for <strong>paint matching near me</strong>. Use a plastic bag to secure the sample price. It will prevent the paint of the sample to smudge or getting any marks or destruction.</p>
<p>And after you <strong>find paint colors</strong> that match the ones you need, try to dab a little of that paint on the sample. As a result, you will precisely know how perfectly the new shade of paint matches with the new one. It ensures optimum precision and can be the <strong>best way to match paint</strong>.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step Bring the object if possible</strong></p>
<p>The best way to maintain absolute precision in the match is by bringing an object to the store. You can also opt for a <strong>car paint match near me</strong>. If you bring the object with the color for matching, it ensures perfect matching and 10precision. Nowadays, the technology is highly advanced and will help you obtain the best paint match.</p>
<h3 id="02Method-2-Using-a-sample-1"><a href="#02Method-2-Using-a-sample-1" class="headerlink" title="02Method 2 Using a sample"></a>02<strong>Method 2 Using a sample</strong></h3><p>Since we have discussed the steps for matching paint without the sample, you must know how to match color with the help of samples. So, here are the steps for doing so.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Click a Picture of the original hue</strong></p>
<p>This step is necessary for better precision and matching the color as perfectly as possible. Clock a picture of the original color sample. The color in the photo might not be absolutely precise. But it can help to a large extent to match the color as perfectly as possible. You can easily take the sample to any renowned color matching store, like, <strong>dupli color paint match</strong> and have the perfect color matching done.</p>
<p>And it is better to not one picture or from just one angel. It will be best to take numerous snaps and that too, from different angles, sides and lighting conditions. It will help you get the original color shades in different angles, shades and lights, and it increases the possibility of matching the color as impeccably as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Bring home more than one sample</strong></p>
<p>You will see numerous samples of paints that you feel will match the color you brought from your home as a sample of the original color. You might not be sure which sample perfectly matches the original sample color at that exact moment. However, if you find a sample that seems t match perfectly, you must not make your decision right at that moment. Because in the store, the lighting, angles, and many other factors play a hugely influential role in enhancing the shades of the sample colors.</p>
<p>So, the color you see in the store often does not remain the same in natural light settings; it might get a bit darker or lighter. So, it is always better to bring home those samples that you feel match the original shade of the sample you brought. This increases the possibility of being the most precise and impeccable in matching the colors.</p>

                      alt="samples color match"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: stick the sample and compare.</strong></p>
<p>This is the final step for matching the colors of paint with the help of a sample. After bringing home the samples that you found similar to the original sample, tape them to the wall. Take a sample at a time and use a tap to place them on the wall. You can also tape all the samples side by side, leaving enough gap between them.</p>
<p>It helps better compare and matches the sample’s colors and the wall. A common thing that occurs is that in the daytime, you find one color matching perfectly, whereas, in the nighttime, some other sample color is matching perfectly. In such an instance, it is best to ask the store if they can give you the shade by mixing both the colors: the color that perfectly matched with the sample in the daytime and the color that perfectly matched with the sample in the time.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4: Paint the samples on the wall</strong></p>
<p>It is an optional step, and you can opt for this step if you are not getting a hundred per cent confidence in choosing the correct color. Try to paint the colors of the samples that you are finding similar to the wall. Since the wall already has the original color, when you paint the sample colors on it, the sample colors clearly distinguish which samples match more impeccably with the actual color.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2 Scan the shade</strong></p>
<p>Now, even the original paint shade. There are factors such as lighting, angel and shadow that you must remover to consider while you scan the color of the original sample.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3 Paint the sample</strong></p>
<p>To be most precise and sure, paint the sample of the paint you have chosen. It will be a way of double-checking your division and ensuring a perfect paint match.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Match-Paint-Color-Without-a-Sample-3"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Match-Paint-Color-Without-a-Sample-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 How to Match Paint Color Without a Sample"></a>Part 1 How to Match Paint Color Without a Sample</h2><p>We will be discussing three methods in which you will get the perfect answer to the question of how can I <strong>match my paint color</strong> perfectly. So, let us jump right into the first method without further delay.</p>
<h3 id="01Method-1-Perfect-Match-Paint-without-a-sample-3"><a href="#01Method-1-Perfect-Match-Paint-without-a-sample-3" class="headerlink" title="01Method 1 Perfect Match Paint without a sample"></a>01<strong>Method 1 Perfect Match Paint without a sample</strong></h3><p>The following steps will help you attain <strong>Perfect Match Paint</strong> without the necessity of a sample.</p>
<p><strong>Step Clean the print area</strong></p>
<p>The first and the most essential step is to make the area where you will be painting clean and tidy. As time passes, fingerprints, marks, dust, and many other things accumulate and make the area dirty. And if you do not clean the same, then the paint you do on it becomes much darker, dull, and gives a shabby outlook.</p>
<p>Use a damp sponge, and if possible, it is better to use soap on the sponge. And most importantly, you will have to let the area dry out completely before you put it on to test the paint. Moreover, the new paint adheres much better than before when you clean the area.</p>

                      alt="clean area"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step Scraping off</strong></p>
<p>The next step requires you to use a utility knife. And with that utility knife, you will have to scrap an inch or 2.5 cm of your wall paint. It is because, when you have a sample, you can easily bring that to the store for <strong>paint matching near me</strong>. Use a plastic bag to secure the sample price. It will prevent the paint of the sample to smudge or getting any marks or destruction.</p>
<p>And after you <strong>find paint colors</strong> that match the ones you need, try to dab a little of that paint on the sample. As a result, you will precisely know how perfectly the new shade of paint matches with the new one. It ensures optimum precision and can be the <strong>best way to match paint</strong>.</p>

                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="scrapping off"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step Bring the object if possible</strong></p>
<p>The best way to maintain absolute precision in the match is by bringing an object to the store. You can also opt for a <strong>car paint match near me</strong>. If you bring the object with the color for matching, it ensures perfect matching and 10precision. Nowadays, the technology is highly advanced and will help you obtain the best paint match.</p>
<h3 id="02Method-2-Using-a-sample-3"><a href="#02Method-2-Using-a-sample-3" class="headerlink" title="02Method 2 Using a sample"></a>02<strong>Method 2 Using a sample</strong></h3><p>Since we have discussed the steps for matching paint without the sample, you must know how to match color with the help of samples. So, here are the steps for doing so.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Click a Picture of the original hue</strong></p>
<p>This step is necessary for better precision and matching the color as perfectly as possible. Clock a picture of the original color sample. The color in the photo might not be absolutely precise. But it can help to a large extent to match the color as perfectly as possible. You can easily take the sample to any renowned color matching store, like, <strong>dupli color paint match</strong> and have the perfect color matching done.</p>
<p>And it is better to not one picture or from just one angel. It will be best to take numerous snaps and that too, from different angles, sides and lighting conditions. It will help you get the original color shades in different angles, shades and lights, and it increases the possibility of matching the color as impeccably as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Bring home more than one sample</strong></p>
<p>You will see numerous samples of paints that you feel will match the color you brought from your home as a sample of the original color. You might not be sure which sample perfectly matches the original sample color at that exact moment. However, if you find a sample that seems t match perfectly, you must not make your decision right at that moment. Because in the store, the lighting, angles, and many other factors play a hugely influential role in enhancing the shades of the sample colors.</p>
<p>So, the color you see in the store often does not remain the same in natural light settings; it might get a bit darker or lighter. So, it is always better to bring home those samples that you feel match the original shade of the sample you brought. This increases the possibility of being the most precise and impeccable in matching the colors.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="samples color match"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: stick the sample and compare.</strong></p>
<p>This is the final step for matching the colors of paint with the help of a sample. After bringing home the samples that you found similar to the original sample, tape them to the wall. Take a sample at a time and use a tap to place them on the wall. You can also tape all the samples side by side, leaving enough gap between them.</p>
<p>It helps better compare and matches the sample’s colors and the wall. A common thing that occurs is that in the daytime, you find one color matching perfectly, whereas, in the nighttime, some other sample color is matching perfectly. In such an instance, it is best to ask the store if they can give you the shade by mixing both the colors: the color that perfectly matched with the sample in the daytime and the color that perfectly matched with the sample in the time.</p>

                      alt="taping samples"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Paint the samples on the wall</strong></p>
<p>It is an optional step, and you can opt for this step if you are not getting a hundred per cent confidence in choosing the correct color. Try to paint the colors of the samples that you are finding similar to the wall. Since the wall already has the original color, when you paint the sample colors on it, the sample colors clearly distinguish which samples match more impeccably with the actual color.</p>

So now, we will be listing down the steps that will help you match the paints with the help of mobile applications. The steps are given as follows.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1 Install the application</strong></p>
<p>You will find numerous mobile applications meant for matching paint colors. Opt for the ones you find the best and most efficient. Download it and install it on your phone. If you have used a renowned brand for painting, you can use their application. For example, you can use <strong>Asian paints color matching</strong> if you have used their brand of paints before.</p>

                      alt="color matching app"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2 Scan the shade</strong></p>
<p>Now, even the original paint shade. There are factors such as lighting, angel and shadow that you must remover to consider while you scan the color of the original sample.</p>

                      alt="scanning shade in app"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3 Paint the sample</strong></p>
<p>To be most precise and sure, paint the sample of the paint you have chosen. It will be a way of double-checking your division and ensuring a perfect paint match.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="paint sample"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4 Use a color scanner</strong></p>
<p>It is another optional step, but there will be absolutely no doubt in the precision of paint matching if you use it. You can either borrow or buy a paint scanner. If you are not planning to paint again soon, it is best to borrow the paint scanner.</p>
