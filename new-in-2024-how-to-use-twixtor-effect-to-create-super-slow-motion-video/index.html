But what Twixtor is and why it is utilized are the topics we will cover in this article.</p>
<p>In addition, we will learn how to manipulate its characteristics to get the best possible outcome for our working composition in the Premiere Pro and After Effects plug-ins. Without any further ado, let’s get straight to the business!</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What is Twixtor and How Does It Work?</a></p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Twixtor-and-How-Does-It-Work"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Twixtor-and-How-Does-It-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Twixtor and How Does It Work?"></a>Part 1: What is Twixtor and How Does It Work?</h2><p>Twixtor is a plug-in developed by RevisionFX. It is available for purchase. The plug-in gives users the ability to speed up, slow down, or convert the frame rate of picture sequences, all with special effects. Twixtor can visually estimate what a video is meant to look like in a slow-motion setting using video analysis and interoperability.</p>
<p>Due to the need for unparalleled image quality, RE: Vision Effects developed unique tracking technology that determines every individual pixel’s motion. This technology allows Twixtor to synthesize new innovative frames by warping and interpolating frames from the original sequence, resulting in unprecedented image quality.</p>
<p>Reset the clock to a single-speed setting. Always remember that you can customize the retiming on a frame-by-frame basis!</p>
<p>When items are crossing in the scene, Twixtor is more accurate and shows fewer artifacts than other rendering engines. This reduces the ripping and stretching of items when they cross the frame or exit it completely.</p>
<p>But how does Twixtor work is the million-dollar question! While Premiere includes the ability to slow down your film and has a newer, better-quality version dubbed Optical Flow, it cannot zoom in on your footage (called Pixel Motion in After Effects).</p>
<p>The slow-motion quality is undoubtedly superior to that of simple frame blending, but it is not the finest grade slow motion available. The TWIXTOR from Re: Vision Effects has long been the go-to solution for the most excellent post-slow motion. It is pricey, but it is well worth it.</p>
<p>The Pro edition provides you with the opportunity to fine-tune the pitch of the auto track, as well as the option to employ mattes and alphas to enrich your tracks and the ability to deal with motion vectors from a 3D system, among other features.</p>

The following are the steps you need to learn to perform it yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: After importing the video to the timeline, do some basic editing such as trimming and removing audio from the video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/nest-sequence-premiere-pro.jpg"
                      alt="nest sequence premiere pro"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Nest the sequence to convert the video into a new sequence automatically.</p>

<p>We’ll look at an example to better comprehend what we’re talking about in this post. Before we begin our study of the Twixtor plug-in, let us get acquainted with the software’s operating screen to quickly understand the content of this article as we go through our assessment of the Twixtor plug-in.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> When you launch <strong>After Effects</strong>, go to <strong>File&gt;Import&gt;File</strong> to import your footage. Here you can see the actual frame rate of your film. You may drag your film onto the timeline by right-clicking it and selecting <strong>New Comp from Selection</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select your video from the timeline in the composition, then go to Effects &amp; Presets pane to search Twixtor, and you will find Twixtor or Twixtor Pro under RE: Vision plug-ins, depending on your version. Drag and drop it to the video in the timeline.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: In the Twixtor effect controls, enter the frame rate of the film you found previously. The faster and better your slowed footage will become, the higher the frame rate.</p>
<p>For organizational reasons, After Effects employs the “<strong>tree-ing</strong>“ concept, sometimes known as drop-down menus. Click on the yellow number next to Input: Frame Rate under <strong>Source Control</strong>. It should be set to 29.97 by default. Please set it to the frame rate you discovered previously in the tutorial.</p>

<p>Inserting slow motion cues and changing playback speeds without waiting is possible with renderless editing. It allows you to produce slow-motion films and enables you to insert extremely rapid sequences and cycle between various speeds.</p>
<p>SloPro even enables you to edit your films as they are being recorded, allowing you to choose between slow and fast motion while recording.</p>
<p>This program provides complete support for sharing through social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, allowing you to show off your impressive video creations to the rest of the world. It has already been established that SloPro is one of the few videos editing software that includes optical flow as a stand-alone effect.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: After you’ve imported your video, click on the <strong>red Edit</strong> button in the top-right corner of the screen to bring up the editing window.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Trim the video down to the section that you wish to modify if required using the <strong>Clip In</strong> and <strong>Clip Out</strong> functions. It is divided into clips using the speed in and speeds out controls.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Tap on the top-left box to bring up a list of fast and <strong>slow speed</strong> choices. <strong>Drag the cursor</strong> over the clip to bring up a fast and slow speed options list.</p>
<p>Step 4: If you want to use a slow speed, press the box in the upper right corner and choose <strong>Optical Flow</strong> from the menu.</p>
<p>This will render the clip with optical flow, resulting in the smooth Twixtor effect you are familiar with. There will be a watermark on your video if you use the program’s free version, but you can easily crop it out.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Slow-Mo videos are undoubtedly watch-worthy. They allow us to observe the fine details and appreciate the video content. But creating one isn’t child’s play.

It is available for purchase. The plug-in gives users the ability to speed up, slow down, or convert the frame rate of picture sequences, all with special effects. Twixtor can visually estimate what a video is meant to look like in a slow-motion setting using video analysis and interoperability.</p>
<p>Due to the need for unparalleled image quality, RE: Vision Effects developed unique tracking technology that determines every individual pixel’s motion. This technology allows Twixtor to synthesize new innovative frames by warping and interpolating frames from the original sequence, resulting in unprecedented image quality.</p>
<p>Reset the clock to a single-speed setting. Always remember that you can customize the retiming on a frame-by-frame basis!</p>
<p>When items are crossing in the scene, Twixtor is more accurate and shows fewer artifacts than other rendering engines. This reduces the ripping and stretching of items when they cross the frame or exit it completely.</p>
<p>But how does Twixtor work is the million-dollar question! While Premiere includes the ability to slow down your film and has a newer, better-quality version dubbed Optical Flow, it cannot zoom in on your footage (called Pixel Motion in After Effects).</p>
<p>The slow-motion quality is undoubtedly superior to that of simple frame blending, but it is not the finest grade slow motion available. The TWIXTOR from Re: Vision Effects has long been the go-to solution for the most excellent post-slow motion. It is pricey, but it is well worth it.</p>
<p>The Pro edition provides you with the opportunity to fine-tune the pitch of the auto track, as well as the option to employ mattes and alphas to enrich your tracks and the ability to deal with motion vectors from a 3D system, among other features.</p>

You may drag your film onto the timeline by right-clicking it and selecting <strong>New Comp from Selection</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select your video from the timeline in the composition, then go to Effects &amp; Presets pane to search Twixtor, and you will find Twixtor or Twixtor Pro under RE: Vision plug-ins, depending on your version. Drag and drop it to the video in the timeline.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: In the Twixtor effect controls, enter the frame rate of the film you found previously. The faster and better your slowed footage will become, the higher the frame rate.</p>
<p>For organizational reasons, After Effects employs the “<strong>tree-ing</strong>“ concept, sometimes known as drop-down menus. Click on the yellow number next to Input: Frame Rate under <strong>Source Control</strong>. It should be set to 29.97 by default. Please set it to the frame rate you discovered previously in the tutorial.</p>

<p>Inserting slow motion cues and changing playback speeds without waiting is possible with renderless editing. It allows you to produce slow-motion films and enables you to insert extremely rapid sequences and cycle between various speeds.</p>
<p>SloPro even enables you to edit your films as they are being recorded, allowing you to choose between slow and fast motion while recording.</p>
<p>This program provides complete support for sharing through social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, allowing you to show off your impressive video creations to the rest of the world. It has already been established that SloPro is one of the few videos editing software that includes optical flow as a stand-alone effect.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: After you’ve imported your video, click on the <strong>red Edit</strong> button in the top-right corner of the screen to bring up the editing window.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Trim the video down to the section that you wish to modify if required using the <strong>Clip In</strong> and <strong>Clip Out</strong> functions. It is divided into clips using the speed in and speeds out controls.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Tap on the top-left box to bring up a list of fast and <strong>slow speed</strong> choices. <strong>Drag the cursor</strong> over the clip to bring up a fast and slow speed options list.</p>
<p>Step 4: If you want to use a slow speed, press the box in the upper right corner and choose <strong>Optical Flow</strong> from the menu.</p>
<p>This will render the clip with optical flow, resulting in the smooth Twixtor effect you are familiar with. There will be a watermark on your video if you use the program’s free version, but you can easily crop it out.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Slow-Mo videos are undoubtedly watch-worthy. They allow us to observe the fine details and appreciate the video content. But creating one isn’t child’s play. So, we decided to compile this article to inform our worthy readers on how they can get started using Twixtor on Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects. We hope you had a fun time learning!</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Twixtor-and-How-Does-It-Work-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Twixtor-and-How-Does-It-Work-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Twixtor and How Does It Work?"></a>Part 1: What is Twixtor and How Does It Work?</h2><p>Twixtor is a plug-in developed by RevisionFX. It is available for purchase. The plug-in gives users the ability to speed up, slow down, or convert the frame rate of picture sequences, all with special effects. Twixtor can visually estimate what a video is meant to look like in a slow-motion setting using video analysis and interoperability.</p>
<p>Due to the need for unparalleled image quality, RE: Vision Effects developed unique tracking technology that determines every individual pixel’s motion. This technology allows Twixtor to synthesize new innovative frames by warping and interpolating frames from the original sequence, resulting in unprecedented image quality.</p>
<p>Reset the clock to a single-speed setting. Always remember that you can customize the retiming on a frame-by-frame basis!</p>
<p>When items are crossing in the scene, Twixtor is more accurate and shows fewer artifacts than other rendering engines. This reduces the ripping and stretching of items when they cross the frame or exit it completely.</p>
<p>But how does Twixtor work is the million-dollar question! While Premiere includes the ability to slow down your film and has a newer, better-quality version dubbed Optical Flow, it cannot zoom in on your footage (called Pixel Motion in After Effects).</p>
<p>The slow-motion quality is undoubtedly superior to that of simple frame blending, but it is not the finest grade slow motion available. The TWIXTOR from Re: Vision Effects has long been the go-to solution for the most excellent post-slow motion. It is pricey, but it is well worth it.</p>
<p>The Pro edition provides you with the opportunity to fine-tune the pitch of the auto track, as well as the option to employ mattes and alphas to enrich your tracks and the ability to deal with motion vectors from a 3D system, among other features.</p>

The following are the steps you need to learn to perform it yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: After importing the video to the timeline, do some basic editing such as trimming and removing audio from the video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="nest sequence premiere pro"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Nest the sequence to convert the video into a new sequence automatically.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Go to the Effects tab and search for Twixtor, and then drop the Twixtor Pro to the video clip in the timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="twixtor pro effect premiere pro"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Right-click the video in the timeline again and scroll down to <strong>Show Clip Keyframes</strong> to enable the <strong>Speed</strong> option under <strong>Time Remapping</strong>. You can now enable the GPU acceleration to fast rendering.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong>: Click the Keyframe icon to mark the points where you want to begin with the slow-motion effect, and then mark the end part of the slow-motion effect video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add keyframes to slow motion premiere pro"
                ></p>
<p>Step 7: Now, drag the line lower to add a slo-mo effect to video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="drag line to slow motion twixtor premiere pro"
                ></p>
<p>Remember that your video can sometimes lag if you set the video speed at a meager percentage. To avoid that, utilize settings in a better way to ensure your video works flawlessly.</p>

<p>Speech has a significant impact on the success rate of the entire YouTube adventure, whether storytelling or a standard sales pitch. It helps to have a decent voice and speaking abilities. However, not everyone gets both simultaneously; many individuals employ voice artists to provide voice-overs.</p>
<p>Some freelancers charge $5-$100 for a 5-minute voice-over. However, not everyone can afford an expensive voice artist, especially for longer films or just starting. Here are other options that I discovered as the most acceptable free text to voice generators for YouTube videos.</p>
<p>Let’s take a deeper look at the most excellent free text to speech software for YouTube videos.</p>
<p><strong>Getting Started</strong></p>
<p>Text to speech is a speech synthesis software that speaks aloud digital and textual content. The software offers a wide range of applications and is utilized by everyone from professionals and students to toddlers and adults.</p>
<p>Viewers are emotionally attached to documents such as PDFs, books, novels, and e-learning courses when they hear narration with a human voice. Text-to-speech systems are ideal for multitasking by busy professionals.</p>
<p>It’s no surprise that there are numerous text-to-speech options available. Audiobooks are also becoming more popular for the same reasons.</p>
<p>We’ll go over the best text-to-speech tools available in this guide. We’ve gathered a detailed list of the most exemplary free and commercial text-to-speech applications to help you choose the best option for your needs:</p>
<h2 id="1-Murf"><a href="#1-Murf" class="headerlink" title="#1: Murf"></a><strong>#1:</strong> <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://murf.ai/" >Murf <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><p><strong>It is available on Windows, Mac, Android, iPhone, and Online</strong></p>

<p>Speech has a significant impact on the success rate of the entire YouTube adventure, whether storytelling or a standard sales pitch. It helps to have a decent voice and speaking abilities. However, not everyone gets both simultaneously; many individuals employ voice artists to provide voice-overs.</p>
<p>Some freelancers charge $5-$100 for a 5-minute voice-over. However, not everyone can afford an expensive voice artist, especially for longer films or just starting. Here are other options that I discovered as the most acceptable free text to voice generators for YouTube videos.</p>
<p>Let’s take a deeper look at the most excellent free text to speech software for YouTube videos.</p>
<p><strong>Getting Started</strong></p>
<p>Text to speech is a speech synthesis software that speaks aloud digital and textual content. The software offers a wide range of applications and is utilized by everyone from professionals and students to toddlers and adults.</p>
<p>Viewers are emotionally attached to documents such as PDFs, books, novels, and e-learning courses when they hear narration with a human voice. Text-to-speech systems are ideal for multitasking by busy professionals.</p>
<p>It’s no surprise that there are numerous text-to-speech options available. Audiobooks are also becoming more popular for the same reasons.</p>
<p>We’ll go over the best text-to-speech tools available in this guide. We’ve gathered a detailed list of the most exemplary free and commercial text-to-speech applications to help you choose the best option for your needs:</p>

<p>Speech has a significant impact on the success rate of the entire YouTube adventure, whether storytelling or a standard sales pitch. It helps to have a decent voice and speaking abilities. However, not everyone gets both simultaneously; many individuals employ voice artists to provide voice-overs.</p>
<p>Some freelancers charge $5-$100 for a 5-minute voice-over. However, not everyone can afford an expensive voice artist, especially for longer films or just starting. Here are other options that I discovered as the most acceptable free text to voice generators for YouTube videos.</p>
<p>Let’s take a deeper look at the most excellent free text to speech software for YouTube videos.</p>
<p><strong>Getting Started</strong></p>
<p>Text to speech is a speech synthesis software that speaks aloud digital and textual content. The software offers a wide range of applications and is utilized by everyone from professionals and students to toddlers and adults.</p>
<p>Viewers are emotionally attached to documents such as PDFs, books, novels, and e-learning courses when they hear narration with a human voice. Text-to-speech systems are ideal for multitasking by busy professionals.</p>
<p>It’s no surprise that there are numerous text-to-speech options available. Audiobooks are also becoming more popular for the same reasons.</p>
<p>We’ll go over the best text-to-speech tools available in this guide. We’ve gathered a detailed list of the most exemplary free and commercial text-to-speech applications to help you choose the best option for your needs:</p>

<p>Speech has a significant impact on the success rate of the entire YouTube adventure, whether storytelling or a standard sales pitch. It helps to have a decent voice and speaking abilities. However, not everyone gets both simultaneously; many individuals employ voice artists to provide voice-overs.</p>
<p>Some freelancers charge $5-$100 for a 5-minute voice-over. However, not everyone can afford an expensive voice artist, especially for longer films or just starting. Here are other options that I discovered as the most acceptable free text to voice generators for YouTube videos.</p>
<p>Let’s take a deeper look at the most excellent free text to speech software for YouTube videos.</p>
<p><strong>Getting Started</strong></p>
<p>Text to speech is a speech synthesis software that speaks aloud digital and textual content. The software offers a wide range of applications and is utilized by everyone from professionals and students to toddlers and adults.</p>
<p>Viewers are emotionally attached to documents such as PDFs, books, novels, and e-learning courses when they hear narration with a human voice. Text-to-speech systems are ideal for multitasking by busy professionals.</p>
<p>It’s no surprise that there are numerous text-to-speech options available. Audiobooks are also becoming more popular for the same reasons.</p>
<p>We’ll go over the best text-to-speech tools available in this guide. We’ve gathered a detailed list of the most exemplary free and commercial text-to-speech applications to help you choose the best option for your needs:</p>

<h3 id="01Automatic-Removal-of-Inappropriate-Content"><a href="#01Automatic-Removal-of-Inappropriate-Content" class="headerlink" title="01Automatic Removal of Inappropriate Content"></a>01Automatic Removal of Inappropriate Content</h3><p>One of the main applications of <strong>AI on YouTube</strong> is to remove inappropriate content automatically. YouTube uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to remove the violative and inappropriate content from the platform. As this content was one of the main reasons for the rise in racism and terrorism. To avoid all these harmful after effects, YouTube introduced the “Trashy Video Classifier” to scan and examine the feedback.</p>
<p>Although these algorithms might not be 100% accurate, they can perform the task more easily and efficiently than the manual examination of the content. Due to these algorithms, it has become easier to automatically remove the controversial content from the platform immediately. AI aided feature helps in determining the inappropriate content faster. However, it doesn’t provide 100% accurate results. This is the reason why YouTube has a large team of human specialists to check the accuracy of determining violative content.</p>
<h3 id="02Add-New-Video-Effects"><a href="#02Add-New-Video-Effects" class="headerlink" title="02Add New Video Effects"></a>02Add New Video Effects</h3><p>The introduction of artificial intelligence and machine learning in the market has made it easier to add new video effects without the use of any external equipment. You can now swap out backgrounds from videos with just one click due to the in-built AI features on YouTube. This AI neural feature is prepared by <strong>Google’s AI YouTube</strong> researchers to make it easier for the AI algorithms to understand video patterns. This feature makes it easier for the system to maintain the correct pace with the video.</p>
<h3 id="03Maintain-Age-Restrictions"><a href="#03Maintain-Age-Restrictions" class="headerlink" title="03Maintain Age Restrictions"></a>03Maintain Age Restrictions</h3><p>Being an online platform, YouTube is open to everyone. There are many creators and viewers on the platform with different interests. Moreover, it is accessible to all age groups, which makes it necessary to optimize the content according to the age groups. YouTube has always been very particular about the age-restricted content. A lot of content is published on the platform that can be harmful to the children’s minds and growth. YouTube uses different AI tools and algorithms to maintain the age restrictions of adult content.</p>
<p>YouTube has guaranteed that the mature content will not be accessible to the kids and youngsters aged below 13 years. It has also created a separate application for the kids to maintain the age restrictions from the matured content.</p>
<p>Earlier, the YouTubers used to flag their content as mature themselves, but now the platform is planning to flag the content using machine learning technology. YouTube had also used machine learning technology to thwart the age-restricted content automatically in 2017.</p>
<h3 id="04”Up-Next”-Feature"><a href="#04”Up-Next”-Feature" class="headerlink" title="04”Up Next” Feature"></a>04”Up Next” Feature</h3><p>The “Up Next” feature of YouTube is also a result of artificial intelligence. With many creators uploading a large number of videos every minute, it was becoming difficult for the platform to manage the suggestion engine properly. So, YouTube has introduced the AI technique to streamline the recommendation process to maintain the real-time and latest suggestion.</p>
<p>This feature is a mix of two algorithms, one is used to optimize the suggestion engine according to the search history and watch history of the user, and the other is to determine according to the ranking. As the main aim is to provide the content so that the user can spend his&#x2F;her maximum time watching YouTube videos. This helps in creating a better sidebar full of user-specific recommendations. YouTube’s special recommendation feature ensures to recommend different videos to the different viewers as per their interests.</p>
<h3 id="05Training-on-Depth-Prediction"><a href="#05Training-on-Depth-Prediction" class="headerlink" title="05Training on Depth Prediction"></a>05Training on Depth Prediction</h3><p>YouTube has a lot of data stored that provides easy knowledge of AI algorithms. According to the recent data and announcement, it is now clear that <strong>Google’s AI YouTube</strong> researchers used the “mannequin challenge” to understand depth predictions.</p>
<p>In this challenge, they researched around 2000 groups, with 1 group in each video. Video had many people standing still like they have been frozen and one person was going through the scene to shoot the video. A better understanding of depth prediction can further help in generating the development of Augmented Reality (AR).</p>
<h3 id="06Tackle-Fake-News"><a href="#06Tackle-Fake-News" class="headerlink" title="06Tackle Fake News"></a>06Tackle Fake News</h3><p>Among the different features of the most engaging online platform comes the ability to detect and tackle fake news and misleading content. YouTube can understand and detect fake news. With so many users on different social media platforms, it has now become common to spread fake and false news. Unlike other platforms, YouTube is using artificial intelligence to detect and remove misleading content that is against YouTube’s privacy policy.</p>
<p>YouTube understands that this type of content can be harmful to the audience and can be the reason for disputes among different communities. Hence, giving rise to racism and terrorism. To reduce its wrong impact on society, YouTube is using AI technology and removing this type of fake and misleading content. Around 11 million videos were removed from the platform within a single quarter. The introduction of AI has also proved that the technology works more effectively and efficiently rather than the manual removal of such content.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-Is-YouTube-Using-AI-to-Recommend-Videos"><a href="#Part-2-How-Is-YouTube-Using-AI-to-Recommend-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How Is YouTube Using AI to Recommend Videos?"></a>Part 2 How Is YouTube Using AI to Recommend Videos?</h2><p><img

                ></p>
<p>YouTube aims at finding the perfect video for each user separately and anticipating the users to spend more time on the platform. Keeping both these things in mind, it decided to use AI technology to recommend videos and optimize the suggestion panel. Just like Netflix, AI technology makes it easier for the platform to determine the best suggestions for different viewers. It recommends the videos after researching the user’s age, interests, watch time, etc.</p>
<p>YouTube generally focuses on increasing the watch time of the viewer, that’s why it recommends the videos keeping the user’s interests on priority. The goal is to watch more rather than watch the best.</p>
<p>YouTube uses different AI algorithms to understand things and recommend optimized videos to stand out from the crowd. First of all, it uses AI algorithms to understand the user’s interest by scanning his&#x2F;her search history and watching history. It creates a list based on the findings and then ranks the videos as per the google rankings. Each video on YouTube has a different ranking.</p>

<h3 id="01Automatic-Removal-of-Inappropriate-Content-1"><a href="#01Automatic-Removal-of-Inappropriate-Content-1" class="headerlink" title="01Automatic Removal of Inappropriate Content"></a>01Automatic Removal of Inappropriate Content</h3><p>One of the main applications of <strong>AI on YouTube</strong> is to remove inappropriate content automatically. YouTube uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to remove the violative and inappropriate content from the platform. As this content was one of the main reasons for the rise in racism and terrorism. To avoid all these harmful after effects, YouTube introduced the “Trashy Video Classifier” to scan and examine the feedback.</p>
<p>Although these algorithms might not be 100% accurate, they can perform the task more easily and efficiently than the manual examination of the content. Due to these algorithms, it has become easier to automatically remove the controversial content from the platform immediately. AI aided feature helps in determining the inappropriate content faster. However, it doesn’t provide 100% accurate results. This is the reason why YouTube has a large team of human specialists to check the accuracy of determining violative content.</p>
<h3 id="02Add-New-Video-Effects-1"><a href="#02Add-New-Video-Effects-1" class="headerlink" title="02Add New Video Effects"></a>02Add New Video Effects</h3><p>The introduction of artificial intelligence and machine learning in the market has made it easier to add new video effects without the use of any external equipment.

Moreover, it is accessible to all age groups, which makes it necessary to optimize the content according to the age groups. YouTube has always been very particular about the age-restricted content. A lot of content is published on the platform that can be harmful to the children’s minds and growth. YouTube uses different AI tools and algorithms to maintain the age restrictions of adult content.</p>
<p>YouTube has guaranteed that the mature content will not be accessible to the kids and youngsters aged below 13 years. It has also created a separate application for the kids to maintain the age restrictions from the matured content.</p>
<p>Earlier, the YouTubers used to flag their content as mature themselves, but now the platform is planning to flag the content using machine learning technology. YouTube had also used machine learning technology to thwart the age-restricted content automatically in 2017.</p>

With many creators uploading a large number of videos every minute, it was becoming difficult for the platform to manage the suggestion engine properly. So, YouTube has introduced the AI technique to streamline the recommendation process to maintain the real-time and latest suggestion.</p>
<p>This feature is a mix of two algorithms, one is used to optimize the suggestion engine according to the search history and watch history of the user, and the other is to determine according to the ranking. As the main aim is to provide the content so that the user can spend his&#x2F;her maximum time watching YouTube videos. This helps in creating a better sidebar full of user-specific recommendations.

<h3 id="01Automatic-Removal-of-Inappropriate-Content-3"><a href="#01Automatic-Removal-of-Inappropriate-Content-3" class="headerlink" title="01Automatic Removal of Inappropriate Content"></a>01Automatic Removal of Inappropriate Content</h3><p>One of the main applications of <strong>AI on YouTube</strong> is to remove inappropriate content automatically. YouTube uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to remove the violative and inappropriate content from the platform. As this content was one of the main reasons for the rise in racism and terrorism. To avoid all these harmful after effects, YouTube introduced the “Trashy Video Classifier” to scan and examine the feedback.</p>
<p>Although these algorithms might not be 100% accurate, they can perform the task more easily and efficiently than the manual examination of the content. Due to these algorithms, it has become easier to automatically remove the controversial content from the platform immediately. AI aided feature helps in determining the inappropriate content faster. However, it doesn’t provide 100% accurate results. This is the reason why YouTube has a large team of human specialists to check the accuracy of determining violative content.</p>
<h3 id="02Add-New-Video-Effects-3"><a href="#02Add-New-Video-Effects-3" class="headerlink" title="02Add New Video Effects"></a>02Add New Video Effects</h3><p>The introduction of artificial intelligence and machine learning in the market has made it easier to add new video effects without the use of any external equipment. You can now swap out backgrounds from videos with just one click due to the in-built AI features on YouTube. This AI neural feature is prepared by <strong>Google’s AI YouTube</strong> researchers to make it easier for the AI algorithms to understand video patterns. This feature makes it easier for the system to maintain the correct pace with the video.</p>
<h3 id="03Maintain-Age-Restrictions-3"><a href="#03Maintain-Age-Restrictions-3" class="headerlink" title="03Maintain Age Restrictions"></a>03Maintain Age Restrictions</h3><p>Being an online platform, YouTube is open to everyone. There are many creators and viewers on the platform with different interests. Moreover, it is accessible to all age groups, which makes it necessary to optimize the content according to the age groups. YouTube has always been very particular about the age-restricted content. A lot of content is published on the platform that can be harmful to the children’s minds and growth. YouTube uses different AI tools and algorithms to maintain the age restrictions of adult content.</p>
<p>YouTube has guaranteed that the mature content will not be accessible to the kids and youngsters aged below 13 years. It has also created a separate application for the kids to maintain the age restrictions from the matured content.</p>
<p>Earlier, the YouTubers used to flag their content as mature themselves, but now the platform is planning to flag the content using machine learning technology. YouTube had also used machine learning technology to thwart the age-restricted content automatically in 2017.</p>
<h3 id="04”Up-Next”-Feature-3"><a href="#04”Up-Next”-Feature-3" class="headerlink" title="04”Up Next” Feature"></a>04”Up Next” Feature</h3><p>The “Up Next” feature of YouTube is also a result of artificial intelligence. With many creators uploading a large number of videos every minute, it was becoming difficult for the platform to manage the suggestion engine properly. So, YouTube has introduced the AI technique to streamline the recommendation process to maintain the real-time and latest suggestion.</p>
<p>This feature is a mix of two algorithms, one is used to optimize the suggestion engine according to the search history and watch history of the user, and the other is to determine according to the ranking. As the main aim is to provide the content so that the user can spend his&#x2F;her maximum time watching YouTube videos. This helps in creating a better sidebar full of user-specific recommendations. YouTube’s special recommendation feature ensures to recommend different videos to the different viewers as per their interests.</p>
<h3 id="05Training-on-Depth-Prediction-3"><a href="#05Training-on-Depth-Prediction-3" class="headerlink" title="05Training on Depth Prediction"></a>05Training on Depth Prediction</h3><p>YouTube has a lot of data stored that provides easy knowledge of AI algorithms. According to the recent data and announcement, it is now clear that <strong>Google’s AI YouTube</strong> researchers used the “mannequin challenge” to understand depth predictions.</p>
<p>In this challenge, they researched around 2000 groups, with 1 group in each video. Video had many people standing still like they have been frozen and one person was going through the scene to shoot the video. A better understanding of depth prediction can further help in generating the development of Augmented Reality (AR).</p>
<h3 id="06Tackle-Fake-News-3"><a href="#06Tackle-Fake-News-3" class="headerlink" title="06Tackle Fake News"></a>06Tackle Fake News</h3><p>Among the different features of the most engaging online platform comes the ability to detect and tackle fake news and misleading content. YouTube can understand and detect fake news. With so many users on different social media platforms, it has now become common to spread fake and false news. Unlike other platforms, YouTube is using artificial intelligence to detect and remove misleading content that is against YouTube’s privacy policy.</p>
<p>YouTube understands that this type of content can be harmful to the audience and can be the reason for disputes among different communities. Hence, giving rise to racism and terrorism. To reduce its wrong impact on society, YouTube is using AI technology and removing this type of fake and misleading content. Around 11 million videos were removed from the platform within a single quarter. The introduction of AI has also proved that the technology works more effectively and efficiently rather than the manual removal of such content.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-Is-YouTube-Using-AI-to-Recommend-Videos-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-Is-YouTube-Using-AI-to-Recommend-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How Is YouTube Using AI to Recommend Videos?"></a>Part 2 How Is YouTube Using AI to Recommend Videos?</h2><p><img

<p>YouTube aims at finding the perfect video for each user separately and anticipating the users to spend more time on the platform. Keeping both these things in mind, it decided to use AI technology to recommend videos and optimize the suggestion panel. Just like Netflix, AI technology makes it easier for the platform to determine the best suggestions for different viewers. It recommends the videos after researching the user’s age, interests, watch time, etc.</p>
<p>YouTube generally focuses on increasing the watch time of the viewer, that’s why it recommends the videos keeping the user’s interests on priority. The goal is to watch more rather than watch the best.</p>
<p>YouTube uses different AI algorithms to understand things and recommend optimized videos to stand out from the crowd. First of all, it uses AI algorithms to understand the user’s interest by scanning his&#x2F;her search history and watching history. It creates a list based on the findings and then ranks the videos as per the google rankings. Each video on YouTube has a different ranking.</p>
<p>YouTube has been changing its algorithms over time. Earlier, it used to rank videos according to view counts. But soon people understood the technique and started using the eye-catchy title and thumbnail to gain a large number of views. Due to this, viewers even started complaining about the content and YouTube changed its algorithms to resolve this issue.</p>
<p>YouTube introduced AI and ML technology to customize the recommendations in 2016. This introduction has made things easier for YouTube as well as its viewers. It has now announced to ban the “borderline content”.</p>

<h3 id="Using-Track-Mattes-in-After-Effects"><a href="#Using-Track-Mattes-in-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Using Track Mattes in After Effects"></a>Using Track Mattes in After Effects</h3><p>In Adobe After Effects, a track matte is a layer that defines the transparency of another layer. It acts as a stencil, determining which parts of the underlying layer are visible and which are transparent. Track mattes are used for creating various effects such as text animations, transitions, and seamlessly composing multiple layers. After Effects offers four Track Matte options:</p>

                      alt="alpha track matte"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alpha Matte:</strong> <strong>Alpha matte in After Effects</strong> allows white areas in the matte layer to become visible while black areas become transparent. Effectively, this helps the underlying layer to show through.</li>
<li><strong>Alpha Inverted Matte:</strong> In an alpha inverted matte, black areas in the matte layer are visible, and white areas are transparent. It reverses the transparency values to create unique effects.</li>
<li><strong>Luma Matte:</strong> A luma matte uses the brightness values of the matte layer to determine visibility. Bright areas in the matte layer are visible, while dark areas are transparent.</li>
<li><strong>Luma Inverted Matte:</strong> The luma inverted matte works opposite to the luma matte. The top layer’s dark areas are visible, while bright areas are transparent.</li>
</ul>

                ></p>
<p>You can use any of the <strong>track mattes in After Effects</strong> according to your requirements. Following is a step-by-step guide on how to use track mattes:</p>
<h5 id="Step-1"><a href="#Step-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h5><p>To apply a track matte to your video, you must work with two layers. The top layer acts as the alpha or the luminance layer. The bottom layer acts as the fill. Once you have identified the layers, you can proceed to the next step.</p>
<h5 id="Step-2"><a href="#Step-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h5><p>Go to the “Modes” column and open the dropdown menu next to “Layer List.” Here, select the layer you wish to use as the track matte.</p>

Using <strong>After Effects mask tracking</strong>, you can automatically animate a mask’s position, shape, or path. This is done to match the movement of an object in a video clip. You can now easily deal with complex or fast-moving footage with this feature. To use <strong>Track Mask in After Effects</strong>, you can follow these steps:</p>
<h5 id="Step-1-1"><a href="#Step-1-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h5><p>Import the footage you wish to edit in After Effects. Select the clip you wish to track from the timeline. Then, select the “Pen” tool from the top toolbar or press G on your keyboard. Select the area around the object you wish to mask in the footage.</p>

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-2-1"><a href="#Step-2-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h5><p>Now, open the layer and right-click on the mask name to select “Track Mask.” This will open the mask tracker in the tracker panel at the right. Open the dropdown menu next to the “Method” option. Here, you can find a range of options for tracking methods. Choose the one according to your requirements. If the object isn’t moving much, you can choose a simple option such as “Position.”</p>

<h5 id="Step-3-1"><a href="#Step-3-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 3"></a>Step 3</h5><p>Tap the “Analyze Forward” icon and let the tracker analyze the frames in the clip. Once the process has finished, you can restart your clip and set “Mask Mode” from the timeline to “Subtract.” This will remove the selected object from the clip.</p>

<h3 id="Using-Track-Mattes-in-After-Effects-1"><a href="#Using-Track-Mattes-in-After-Effects-1" class="headerlink" title="Using Track Mattes in After Effects"></a>Using Track Mattes in After Effects</h3><p>In Adobe After Effects, a track matte is a layer that defines the transparency of another layer. It acts as a stencil, determining which parts of the underlying layer are visible and which are transparent. Track mattes are used for creating various effects such as text animations, transitions, and seamlessly composing multiple layers. After Effects offers four Track Matte options:</p>

                      alt="alpha track matte"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alpha Matte:</strong> <strong>Alpha matte in After Effects</strong> allows white areas in the matte layer to become visible while black areas become transparent. Effectively, this helps the underlying layer to show through.</li>
<li><strong>Alpha Inverted Matte:</strong> In an alpha inverted matte, black areas in the matte layer are visible, and white areas are transparent. It reverses the transparency values to create unique effects.</li>
<li><strong>Luma Matte:</strong> A luma matte uses the brightness values of the matte layer to determine visibility. Bright areas in the matte layer are visible, while dark areas are transparent.</li>
<li><strong>Luma Inverted Matte:</strong> The luma inverted matte works opposite to the luma matte. The top layer’s dark areas are visible, while bright areas are transparent.</li>
</ul>

                ></p>
<p>You can use any of the <strong>track mattes in After Effects</strong> according to your requirements. Following is a step-by-step guide on how to use track mattes:</p>
<h5 id="Step-1-2"><a href="#Step-1-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h5><p>To apply a track matte to your video, you must work with two layers. The top layer acts as the alpha or the luminance layer. The bottom layer acts as the fill. Once you have identified the layers, you can proceed to the next step.</p>
<h5 id="Step-2-2"><a href="#Step-2-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h5><p>Go to the “Modes” column and open the dropdown menu next to “Layer List.” Here, select the layer you wish to use as the track matte.</p>

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-3-2"><a href="#Step-3-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 3"></a>Step 3</h5><p>You will see two toggle switches once you select your layer. You can use these switches and the available options to set the transparency for the Track Matte. You can add <strong>alpha matte in After Effects</strong> or other types from here.</p>

Using <strong>After Effects mask tracking</strong>, you can automatically animate a mask’s position, shape, or path. This is done to match the movement of an object in a video clip. You can now easily deal with complex or fast-moving footage with this feature. To use <strong>Track Mask in After Effects</strong>, you can follow these steps:</p>
<h5 id="Step-1-3"><a href="#Step-1-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h5><p>Import the footage you wish to edit in After Effects. Select the clip you wish to track from the timeline. Then, select the “Pen” tool from the top toolbar or press G on your keyboard. Select the area around the object you wish to mask in the footage.</p>

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-2-3"><a href="#Step-2-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h5><p>Now, open the layer and right-click on the mask name to select “Track Mask.” This will open the mask tracker in the tracker panel at the right. Open the dropdown menu next to the “Method” option. Here, you can find a range of options for tracking methods. Choose the one according to your requirements. If the object isn’t moving much, you can choose a simple option such as “Position.”</p>

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step-3-3"><a href="#Step-3-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3"></a>Step 3</h5><p>Tap the “Analyze Forward” icon and let the tracker analyze the frames in the clip. Once the process has finished, you can restart your clip and set “Mask Mode” from the timeline to “Subtract.” This will remove the selected object from the clip.</p>
