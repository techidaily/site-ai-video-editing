<ol>
<li><strong>Trimming the video</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>After dropping the video on the timeline, it is likely to take up a lot of space, especially if it is long.</p>
<p>To trim the video from the beginning, place your cursor at the starting point and wait for the pointer to appear. Then move the point forward. To trim from the end, place the cursor at that point, hold and move the pointer forward till the required point.</p>

<p>Trimming the video does not mean that you lose the parts. It is more like shortening it to fit in place.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Cutting the video</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Unlike trimming, cutting involves getting rid of a section of the video completely. To do so, you need to first of all isolate that section.</p>
<p>With the video on the timeline, move and point your cursor at the starting point of the video and click on the scissors icon at the top. Then move it to the end of the video section and click on the scissors icon again. By so doing, you will have selected that section.</p>

</ol>
<p>The final step is saving or importing your file to prevent its loss. By clicking on the ‘Import’ button, you save the file to the Media Library. By selecting ‘save as’, you select the location where you want to store your file.</p>

<p>5 ways to make a fake facetime call video</p>
<h3 id="1-Filmora"><a href="#1-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="1. Filmora"></a>1. Filmora</h3><p>Compatibility: Windows&#x2F;Mac</p>
<p>Wondershare Filmora is the greatest video editor on the market, without a doubt, and it deserves to be at the top of our list.</p>
<p>You’ll discover some professional tools to help you improve video quality and over 300 creative filters and effects to give your movie a new, fresh look without putting in a lot of effort with the Filmora video editor. This tool is one of the most dependable, aside from the features that allow you to modify video rotation easily.</p>
<h4 id="Steps"><a href="#Steps" class="headerlink" title="Steps"></a>Steps</h4><p><strong>Step 1: Import the photo or video files</strong></p>
<p>Import all your media files, including video, photos, and music. You have two options for importing your videos: drag and drop directly into our software or click import to select the media files you wish to upload.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="fake-facetime-call-video-"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Edit the video</strong></p>
