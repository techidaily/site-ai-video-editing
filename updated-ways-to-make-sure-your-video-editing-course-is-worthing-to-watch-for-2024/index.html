Or you may be a YouTuber with a hi-fi channel with many subscribers, but a podcast is a different thing in general.</p>
<p>This article will look at how to prepare, call guests, warm them up, and give practical ideas about how to host a podcast. Let’s start the article by learning how to get prepared to host a podcast.</p>
<h2 id="1-Get-prepared-to-host-a-podcast"><a href="#1-Get-prepared-to-host-a-podcast" class="headerlink" title="#1 Get prepared to host a podcast"></a>#1 Get prepared to host a podcast</h2><p>A good podcast host always gets prepared, sets up his goals, and gets easy tips to set apart from everyone in the marketplace. For this, you have to follow the below instructions and tips:</p>
<h3 id="1-A-proper-pre-interview-process"><a href="#1-A-proper-pre-interview-process" class="headerlink" title="1. A proper pre-interview process"></a>1. A proper pre-interview process</h3><p>Before starting the podcast, the host should have quality and organic content. The content is related to the guest or any foremost personality related to the topic.</p>
<p>The host should be confident and relaxed to kill the anxiety process. If the host has low confidence, he may suffer from nervousness. This will kill the authenticity.</p>
<h3 id="2-Share-questions-with-the-audience"><a href="#2-Share-questions-with-the-audience" class="headerlink" title="2. Share questions with the audience"></a>2. Share questions with the audience</h3><p>A good understanding of how to pan out a situation makes you a good host. You must share the question on and off during podcasts to build engaging criteria with the audience.</p>
<p>You don’t need to sound the script on the screen like a robot. Scripts can be helpful but only if read in a conversational mood.</p>
<h3 id="3-Find-the-right-location"><a href="#3-Find-the-right-location" class="headerlink" title="3. Find the right location"></a>3. Find the right location</h3><p>A good location means good conversation. A proper set prepared for the guest and the podcast will help you boost your conversation skills and get yourself and the guest into the mood of your show.</p>
<p>Before the show, you can change the settings or have a monotone set that fits every mood.</p>
<h2 id="2-Warm-up-the-audience"><a href="#2-Warm-up-the-audience" class="headerlink" title="#2 Warm up the audience"></a>#2 Warm up the audience</h2><p><strong>Warming up</strong> is a necessary part of the show. A warmup works just like gas in a car before a long drive. You have to do this by asking any question or by telling them an inspirational or motivational story.</p>
<p>A good host must realize that a warm show has a high chance of becoming viral, and you won’t get that if the guest is nervous, tired, or not in the mood.</p>
<h3 id="Tip-1-Setting-the-mood"><a href="#Tip-1-Setting-the-mood" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1. Setting the mood"></a>Tip 1. Setting the mood</h3><p>Your goal is to set the mood of the audience according to the topic. Warming up the audience before getting to the guest.</p>
<p>You have to set the tone according to the topic of your podcast to warm them up. In this way, you need to make the connection between the guest, you, and your voice.</p>
<h3 id="Tip-2-Build-an-emotional-connection"><a href="#Tip-2-Build-an-emotional-connection" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2. Build an emotional connection"></a>Tip 2. Build an emotional connection</h3><p>Building an emotional connection helps to engage the audience till the end of the show. To make this possible, you can share a funny story with them or about a recent event or any recent incident.</p>
<h3 id="Tip-3-Polls-and-questionnaires"><a href="#Tip-3-Polls-and-questionnaires" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3. Polls and questionnaires"></a>Tip 3. Polls and questionnaires</h3><p>Modern media has connected everything through the internet. You need to interact with the audience by asking questions from them and giving them a chance to answer them by live calling or on social media.</p>
<p>You can also do this on Instagram polls or by posting a story and asking them to select an upcoming topic for the podcast. Introducing this concept will boost your podcast views and help you engage more followers on your other social media platforms.</p>
<h2 id="3-Try-to-be-authenticity"><a href="#3-Try-to-be-authenticity" class="headerlink" title="#3 Try to be authenticity"></a>#3 Try to be authenticity</h2><p>You need to have authenticity if you want your podcast to be successful. An authentic show attracts a larger audience, while a show whose mood resembles a person with a multiple personality disorder will throw off the whole vibe of the podcast. And the listeners will eventually press back buttons to escape the colossal wreck.</p>
<h3 id="Tips-to-have-authentic-content"><a href="#Tips-to-have-authentic-content" class="headerlink" title="Tips to have authentic content"></a>Tips to have authentic content</h3><ul>
<li>Your topic may be emotional, happy, or of any other information.</li>
<li>A good host needs to have the skills of a good actor to convey the emotions that the audience will perceive more efficiently.</li>
<li>An idea of how the audience will perceive you and how to make your voice tone with emotions on podcasts.</li>
<li>Don’t go for a more serious tone.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Things to Avoid</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What you should opt away from is, <strong>faking</strong></li>
<li>Don’t try to get <strong>excited</strong> about something that you’re not.</li>
<li>Do not pretend to <strong>care</strong> about something when you do not.</li>
<li>The fakeness will only result in the downfall of your podcast, as the listeners will eventually grow tired and leave.</li>
<li>You must act well and sell yourself more efficiently to develop that trust with the audience.</li>
</ul>
<p>The more the audience trusts you, the more authentic you seem.</p>
<h2 id="4-Storytelling"><a href="#4-Storytelling" class="headerlink" title="#4 Storytelling"></a>#4 Storytelling</h2><p>Tales are as old as time. As time moves on, more and more stories pile up. Your podcast has the potential to be the best if you know how to utilize those storytelling skills of yours. <strong>It’s never about information alone!</strong></p>
<p>You may have a bland topic to discuss or a guest who is tough to break character. These are the situations where your charm and concern will play their part. So you also want to learn how to make your podcasts enjoyable through stories? Then check out the short tips below:</p>
<h3 id="How-to-add-stories-to-your-podcasts"><a href="#How-to-add-stories-to-your-podcasts" class="headerlink" title="How to add stories to your podcasts"></a>How to add stories to your podcasts</h3><ul>
<li>First, you should have the skill to <strong>read</strong> the room and the mood.</li>
<li>If you start telling a story about <strong>yourself</strong> that has no relation to the topic whatsoever will only lead to the guest being annoyed.</li>
<li>You may have <strong>called</strong> the <strong>guest</strong> for a reason. This reason should tally with your topic as it will make you ask about their experience.</li>
<li>Asking the right questions is important.</li>
<li>You’d better not begin with leading statements such as, <strong>“Obi-wan Kenobi is a good TV show.”</strong> the guest may simply reply, <strong>“I do not care.”</strong></li>
<li>You should approach with question statements such as, <strong>“Did you know that your son is a big fan of the Obi-wan Kenobi TV show.”</strong> These are <strong>indulging</strong> questions to help your audience be more involved in your podcasts.</li>
</ul>
<p>The audience and the guest will also develop an interest in the conversation that will lead to a successful show for the day.</p>
<h2 id="5-Transcribe-your-episodes"><a href="#5-Transcribe-your-episodes" class="headerlink" title="#5 Transcribe your episodes"></a>#5 Transcribe your episodes</h2><p>A good podcast also looks to give you quality content for each episode. You may call on guests upon guests and promote your podcasts in many ways. One of the ways you can also allow your podcasts to be recognized more is by the use of transcribing.</p>
<h3 id="What-is-transcribing"><a href="#What-is-transcribing" class="headerlink" title="What is transcribing?"></a>What is transcribing?</h3><p>Transcribing means converting the speech in the audio of your podcasts to a text format. Your podcast may raise some eyes if the content is desirable to the audience.</p>
<p>It may happen your podcast gets around a person whose brother suffers from hearing loss. By a transcription, you offer a chance to let them involved in your podcast. You can accomplish this feat in one of two ways.</p>
<ul>
<li>Either use an AI-powered audio editing program, like Wondershare <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, to get you through the speech-to-text transcription by default or a more auto way.</li>
<li>Convert your text into audio, but this article will not look at it.</li>

<h5 id="Step2Add-subtitles"><a href="#Step2Add-subtitles" class="headerlink" title="Step2Add subtitles"></a>Step2Add subtitles</h5><p>To show the transcription of the podcast’s audio, you have to add sbtitles for better understanding. For this, perform these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select the tile icon on the bar above.</li>
<li>In the window that pops up, select your favorite subtitle format.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="adding subtitle tile"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step3Adjust-the-size"><a href="#Step3Adjust-the-size" class="headerlink" title="Step3Adjust the size"></a>Step3Adjust the size</h5><p>For better playout and matching the audio with subtitles, you have to adjust the size of the video as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add a subtitle tile above the video.</li>
<li>Then adjust the size of the video.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="typing in the speech"
                ></p>
<p>In this way, you have created speech-to-text using a human transcriber rather than an AI. Doing this will ensure no mistakes are recorded and make it even more efficient.</p>
<h2 id="6-Put-yourself-in-audiences’-shoes"><a href="#6-Put-yourself-in-audiences’-shoes" class="headerlink" title="#6 Put yourself in audiences’ shoes"></a>#6 Put yourself in audiences’ shoes</h2><p>And if you feel like the general audience would want to make sense of a particular statement, ask the guest about it. This is what differentiates a good host from a bad one! A general understanding of the audience’s point of view would always allow you to process your podcast accordingly.</p>
<ul>
<li>You should understand the general sentiments of the audience.</li>
<li>When you feel a particular subject will attract more audience, do the process accordingly.</li>
<li>Maybe they like how you process a story and evaluate it. Do that!</li>
</ul>
<p>All qualities of a good podcast are there, and it’s your job to identify them and make the most of them.</p>
<h2 id="7-Understand-why-the-guest-is-here"><a href="#7-Understand-why-the-guest-is-here" class="headerlink" title="#7 Understand why the guest is here"></a>#7 Understand why the guest is here</h2><p>You are the host of the podcast. Your job is to be sincere with the guest. Moreover, useful information or a valued thought might be a reason why the guest has come to your show. Understand that reason and try to make the most of it.</p>
<ul>
<li>The guest might have <strong>heard</strong> about your podcast, or they could be a <strong>constant</strong></li>
<li>Your approach to the guest should <strong>tally</strong> with the topic of the podcast.</li>
<li>The guest might be going through a tough time that makes them a <strong>suitable guest</strong> for that particular episode.</li>
<li>Or it could be that your podcast attracted them, and now they want to use your interview to promote a book or any other service they think is best.</li>
<li>As a host, you should allow the guest to have some <strong>control</strong> over the podcast.</li>
<li>Develop a <strong>sense of trust</strong> between the host and the guest.</li>
<li>The more you allow the guest to speak freely about themselves, the more they will feel interested in your podcast.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your goal should be to captivate the guest as much as you can. If the guest is entertained, the more chances are that they will recommend you to other guests. <strong>An experience gone wrong will be bad for the podcast.</strong></p>
<h2 id="8-Invite-the-right-guest"><a href="#8-Invite-the-right-guest" class="headerlink" title="#8 Invite the right guest"></a>#8 Invite the right guest</h2><p>A podcast can be an excellent tool for attracting the audience to your content. And as podcast hosts guests, your first step is finding the right guests for your audience.</p>
<p>Is it necessary to search for a host before calling? Yes! It’s quite a complicated and sensitive step to call out guests. A guest is the only one who can make or break the Podcast show. It’s important to study the nature of guests too. Because a guest is also considered as a co-host of the show.</p>
<p>If a guest is bored and doesn’t take much interest, then there are 100% chance that the show will fail. To find who is more compatible, we have to take assistance from a tool.</p>
<p>You can do this by plugging your podcast into a tool like <strong>Sparktoro</strong>. Sparktoro allows you to see what your audience is engaging with. It could be other platforms of podcasts such as youtube or other social media platforms.</p>
<p><strong>For example,</strong> If we search for “the art of product podcast” on the Sparktoro website. It will direct us to demographic data, providing information about the content the audience is interacting with.</p>
<ul>
<li>It will show <strong>different hashtags</strong> and <strong>frequently used phrases</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                      alt="sparktoro search"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Here you can see the top words in bios, hashtags, and frequent phrases.</li>
<li>On the left window, you can search for other related podcasts your viewers are watching.</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                      alt="sparktoro search for similar podcasts"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Similarly, you can also use the YouTube option to look at what kind of content your audience watches on youtube.</li>
</ul>
<p>Following the above methods could give you <strong>50-100</strong> potential clients. Your main goal will be creating a list allowing you to call guests on your show. You can divide the list according to the priorities.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Close friends:</strong> the ones who are going to be available whenever you call upon them.</li>
<li><strong>The probable list:</strong> the ones who would most probably agree to come on your podcast.</li>
<li><strong>The premium list:</strong> these guests will resemble a dream list of guests you want to call on your podcast.</li>
</ul>
<p>Start by writing emails and promoting content that will attract these guests. Your chances are increased by how much you polish your podcast into creating <strong>premium content</strong>. The more premium the content is, the more premium your chances are of inviting those dream guests.</p>
<h2 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>Podcasts are tricky to promote. Many other alternatives are available in the market that provides a more Visual representation. And it’s no lie; an audience like to sit and watch rather than sit and listen.</p>
<p>Following the steps, tips, and tricks mentioned above, you can build a strong base for being a good podcast host. Although it will take time to set off on your dreams, consistency and determination will eventually bear fruit.</p>

This is what differentiates a good host from a bad one! A general understanding of the audience’s point of view would always allow you to process your podcast accordingly.</p>
<ul>
<li>You should understand the general sentiments of the audience.</li>
<li>When you feel a particular subject will attract more audience, do the process accordingly.</li>
<li>Maybe they like how you process a story and evaluate it. Do that!</li>
</ul>
<p>All qualities of a good podcast are there, and it’s your job to identify them and make the most of them.</p>
<h2 id="7-Understand-why-the-guest-is-here-1"><a href="#7-Understand-why-the-guest-is-here-1" class="headerlink" title="#7 Understand why the guest is here"></a>#7 Understand why the guest is here</h2><p>You are the host of the podcast. Your job is to be sincere with the guest. Moreover, useful information or a valued thought might be a reason why the guest has come to your show. Understand that reason and try to make the most of it.</p>
<ul>
<li>The guest might have <strong>heard</strong> about your podcast, or they could be a <strong>constant</strong></li>
<li>Your approach to the guest should <strong>tally</strong> with the topic of the podcast.</li>
<li>The guest might be going through a tough time that makes them a <strong>suitable guest</strong> for that particular episode.</li>
<li>Or it could be that your podcast attracted them, and now they want to use your interview to promote a book or any other service they think is best.</li>
<li>As a host, you should allow the guest to have some <strong>control</strong> over the podcast.</li>
<li>Develop a <strong>sense of trust</strong> between the host and the guest.</li>
<li>The more you allow the guest to speak freely about themselves, the more they will feel interested in your podcast.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your goal should be to captivate the guest as much as you can. If the guest is entertained, the more chances are that they will recommend you to other guests. <strong>An experience gone wrong will be bad for the podcast.</strong></p>
<h2 id="8-Invite-the-right-guest-1"><a href="#8-Invite-the-right-guest-1" class="headerlink" title="#8 Invite the right guest"></a>#8 Invite the right guest</h2><p>A podcast can be an excellent tool for attracting the audience to your content. And as podcast hosts guests, your first step is finding the right guests for your audience.</p>
<p>Is it necessary to search for a host before calling? Yes! It’s quite a complicated and sensitive step to call out guests. A guest is the only one who can make or break the Podcast show. It’s important to study the nature of guests too. Because a guest is also considered as a co-host of the show.</p>
<p>If a guest is bored and doesn’t take much interest, then there are 100% chance that the show will fail. To find who is more compatible, we have to take assistance from a tool.</p>
<p>You can do this by plugging your podcast into a tool like <strong>Sparktoro</strong>. Sparktoro allows you to see what your audience is engaging with. It could be other platforms of podcasts such as youtube or other social media platforms.</p>
<p><strong>For example,</strong> If we search for “the art of product podcast” on the Sparktoro website. It will direct us to demographic data, providing information about the content the audience is interacting with.</p>
<ul>
<li>It will show <strong>different hashtags</strong> and <strong>frequently used phrases</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<li>Similarly, you can also use the YouTube option to look at what kind of content your audience watches on youtube.</li>
</ul>
<p>Following the above methods could give you <strong>50-100</strong> potential clients. Your main goal will be creating a list allowing you to call guests on your show. You can divide the list according to the priorities.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Close friends:</strong> the ones who are going to be available whenever you call upon them.</li>
<li><strong>The probable list:</strong> the ones who would most probably agree to come on your podcast.</li>
<li><strong>The premium list:</strong> these guests will resemble a dream list of guests you want to call on your podcast.</li>
</ul>
<p>Start by writing emails and promoting content that will attract these guests. Your chances are increased by how much you polish your podcast into creating <strong>premium content</strong>. The more premium the content is, the more premium your chances are of inviting those dream guests.</p>
<h2 id="The-Bottom-Line-1"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line-1" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>Podcasts are tricky to promote.

<h2 id="Beginners-Guide-to-Green-Screen-Keying"><a href="#Beginners-Guide-to-Green-Screen-Keying" class="headerlink" title="Beginners Guide to Green Screen Keying"></a>Beginners Guide to Green Screen Keying</h2><p>Did they have dinner on Mars? Photographers are becoming more daring with their creations thanks to the advancement in editing software. For example, after effects green screen keying allows you to alter your image’s background during post-production.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/green-screen-key-1.jpg"
                      alt="green screen key"
                ></p>
<p>The following is all you need to know about the green screen key effect and how to apply it using different video editing software. In addition, you will discover why the effect is popular with video editors. Keep reading to find out more.</p>
<h2 id="Part1-What-is-keying-in-green-screen"><a href="#Part1-What-is-keying-in-green-screen" class="headerlink" title="Part1: What is keying in green screen?"></a>Part1: What is keying in green screen?</h2><p>Keying refers to a post-production process of separating and isolating an image’s aspects using color or brightness. Typically, filmmakers use it to remove green screens and make color corrections to add warmth to the subjects’ skin tones.</p>
<p>It involves identifying a color or brightness value that you will make transparent in the photo. In addition, you can use two types of keys during the keying process.</p>
<h3 id="Chroma-Keys"><a href="#Chroma-Keys" class="headerlink" title="Chroma Keys"></a>Chroma Keys</h3><p>These allow you to select a specific color in your image and make everything that features the color transparent. Typically, chrome keys are best for images and videos featuring lots of green or blue backgrounds.</p>
<h3 id="Luma-Keys"><a href="#Luma-Keys" class="headerlink" title="Luma Keys"></a>Luma Keys</h3><p>Alternatively, you can use luma keys to determine which backgrounds will be transparent according to the brightness level. In addition, you can use them to designate the backgrounds you want opaque in your final image.</p>
<p>So, why do filmmakers prefer using a green screen? First, green is not a natural color in human skin tones. As such, it allows you more creative freedom with your shots. In addition, most digital cameras feature more green photosites allowing you to capture more details in your shots and making it the default choice for filmmakers.</p>
<p>However, you can also use a blue screen for your shots if green is your subject’s main color scheme. This is because blue is also rare among human subjects and allows you greater flexibility than any other background alternative.</p>
<p>Using a green screen key is an important skill to learn as a filmmaker. This is because it allows you more creative freedom resulting in more iconic images and photos. Although most video editing software allows you to apply the effect easily, it still requires finesse.</p>
<p>For example, using after effects green screen keying incorrectly can result in spill issues. This is when the green light from your screen bounces back to your subject. As such, you lose some subject detail, and the image appears messy.</p>
<p>Furthermore, not all video editing software includes the green screen key tool. Therefore, always check your software details before purchasing a copy. The next section contains step-by-step guides on performing green screen keying on some of the industry’s most popular software.</p>
<h2 id="Part2-How-to-do-Green-Screen-Keying-in-After-Effects"><a href="#Part2-How-to-do-Green-Screen-Keying-in-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Part2: How to do Green Screen Keying in After Effects?"></a>Part2: How to do Green Screen Keying in After Effects?</h2><p>Adobe After Effects green screen keying tool is arguably one of the top favorites for filmmakers. It features a user-friendly interface, and several keying presets you can use to achieve incredible photo finishes. For example, the Keylight effect is an Academy Award-winning preset you can use to apply professional-quality color keying.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to do green screen keying using Adobe After Effects.</p>
<h3 id="1-Upload-your-footage-to-Adobe-After-Effects"><a href="#1-Upload-your-footage-to-Adobe-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="1. Upload your footage to Adobe After Effects"></a>1. Upload your footage to Adobe After Effects</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/green-screen-key-2.jpg"
                      alt="upload footage to adobe"
                ></p>
<p>Launch the program from your macOS or Windows device, and click on the <strong>New Composition From Footage</strong> option. A pop-up window with your file locations will appear and click on the footage you want to import. Ensure the footage you use is shot using a green screen background to achieve the best results.</p>
<h3 id="2-Using-the-green-screen-key-presets"><a href="#2-Using-the-green-screen-key-presets" class="headerlink" title="2. Using the green screen key presets"></a>2. Using the green screen key presets</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload

                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/green-screen-key-3.jpg"
                      alt="using the green screen key presets"
                ></p>
<p>Once the footage is imported, click on the <strong>Window</strong> menu option on your workspace, and click on <strong>Effects &amp; Presets</strong> from the sub-menu. Once the panel opens, tap <strong>Animation Presets</strong> and highlight the <strong>Keylight + Key Cleaner + Advanced Spill Suppressor</strong> preset from the <strong>Image-Utilities</strong> menu.</p>
<h3 id="3-Drag-and-drop-the-preset-to-your-footage"><a href="#3-Drag-and-drop-the-preset-to-your-footage" class="headerlink" title="3. Drag and drop the preset to your footage"></a>3. Drag and drop the preset to your footage</h3><p>Then drag and drop the effect to your uploaded footage to begin the keying process. The green screen key preset applies three effects to your image:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keylight effect.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The effect allows you to select the background color you want to make transparent. First, select the green screen background by clicking on <strong>Screen Color</strong> and selecting <strong>Color Picker</strong>. Then apply the effect by clicking on the green background closest to your subject.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key cleaner effect.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The key cleaner effect sharpens your subject’s edges for a more detailed finish. In addition, you will rarely adjust its values because it automatically corresponds to the changes you make using the Keylight effect. However, you can adjust the <strong>Additional Edge Radius</strong> and <strong>Reduce Chatter</strong> options to decrease the visible noise of your image. Furthermore, you can use the <strong>Alpha Contrast</strong> adjustment to increase the sharpness of your subject’s edges.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Advanced spill suppressor.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes your green screen background can spill to your subject’s edges resulting in a messy outline. For example, you may find a green outline on your subject’s hair or clothing. The <strong>Advanced Spill Suppressor</strong> eliminates these outlines automatically. You can enable the effect by clicking the check box next to the effect from the <strong>Animation Presets</strong> panel.</p>
<h3 id="4-Apply-a-new-background"><a href="#4-Apply-a-new-background" class="headerlink" title="4. Apply a new background"></a>4. Apply a new background</h3><p>Once you apply the green screen key effect, you can add any custom background to your footage. You need to <strong>Import</strong> the file to your After Effects library and then drag &amp; drop it into your footage’s timeline.</p>
<p>Remember, you must have an active Adobe After Effects license to access the green screen keying feature. In addition, you get access to Adobe Creative Cloud, which offers access to creative asset libraries such as Behance and Adobe Fonts. Alternatively, you can check out the free 7-day trial available to all new users.</p>

                      alt="adjust your green screen settings"
                ></p>
<p>Then, double-click your green screen footage to open the <strong>Edit Panel</strong>. Select the Video Tab and check the <strong>Chroma Key</strong> box to enable the effect. Once done, you can use the following tools to edit your footage:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Alpha Channel</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The tool allows you to edit the footage’s borders, transparency, and shadows by displaying your image in black and white. The areas you have successfully keyed out will be in black and the rest in white or grey, depending on the severity.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Offset</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The offset tool allows you to change the visibility of your background.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Edge Feathering.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You use this tool to soften your subject’s edges during green screen keying.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Edge Thickness.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The edge thickness tool helps you increase the sharpness of your subject’s edges. As such, they appear more detailed resulting in a clear and well-balanced photo.</p>
<h3 id="3-Merge-the-new-background"><a href="#3-Merge-the-new-background" class="headerlink" title="3. Merge the new background"></a>3. Merge the new background</h3><p>Once you complete the green screen keying, merging the new background is next. You do this by seamlessly positioning the background to fit your green screen footage. Then, the Filmora Chroma key tool will merge the images or footage and make it appear as one clip.</p>
<h3 id="4-Export-your-content"><a href="#4-Export-your-content" class="headerlink" title="4. Export your content"></a>4. Export your content</h3><p>Finally, you can export your content in multiple formats to suit your desired platform.

Is there a difference between chroma keying and green screening?"></a>1. Is there a difference between chroma keying and green screening?</h3><p>No. There is no difference between chroma keying and green screening. Both processes involve you replacing a specific color in your image and replacing it with a new background. In addition, some filmmakers use the terms synonymously because green is the best color to use when chroma keying. However, you can also use other colors for your chroma keying, with blue being the next best alternative.</p>
