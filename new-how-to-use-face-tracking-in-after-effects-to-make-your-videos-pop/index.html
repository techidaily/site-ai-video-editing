<p>In Adobe After Effects, there are two <strong>Face Tracking</strong> features, i.e., Outline Only and Detailed Feature. The former will help only to track the face, while the latter provides detailed data on different facial features to help you change the eye color, mouth movements, etc.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we will explore <strong>Face Tracking,</strong> its applications, how it works, and its challenges and drawbacks. We will also provide an easy-to-follow guide on using the Face Tracking feature in Adobe After Effects.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Face-Tracking"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Face-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Face Tracking"></a>Part 1. What Is Face Tracking</h2><p>Face Tracking is a process of identifying or detecting the areas of the face, such as the eyes, nose, and mouth, in a video or image. This effect can be used to track and animate face replacements, retouch footage, or add effects to a user’s face in live footage.</p>
<p>Where It Is Applied</p>
<p>Face Tracking can be used for a variety of applications, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Replacing One Face With Another:</strong> This is helpful if you need to change the face of a character in video footage.</li>
<li><strong>Adding Automatic Effects:</strong> With this feature, you can apply effects to a face in live footage.</li>
<li><strong>Retouching Footage</strong>: Face Tracking can help you retouch a face in a video clip, for instance, you can smooth it or change the skin tone, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Robotic Devices:</strong> Certain robots use Face Tracking technology to perform human tasks.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-Does-Face-Tracking-Work"><a href="#Part-2-How-Does-Face-Tracking-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How Does Face Tracking Work?"></a>Part 2. How Does Face Tracking Work?</h2><p>Face Tracking algorithms usually begin by detecting facial landmarks, such as the eyes, nose, and mouth. Once detected, the AI algorithms use them to track the face as it moves. This information can be used to perform various tasks, such as identifying the person’s emotions or estimating their head pose.</p>
<p>Face Tracking technology is constantly improving and is now being used in various new applications, such as to create 3D models of people’s faces, control robotic devices, and create more realistic avatars for virtual reality systems.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-The-Challenges-And-Drawbacks-Of-Face-Tracking"><a href="#Part-3-The-Challenges-And-Drawbacks-Of-Face-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. The Challenges And Drawbacks Of Face Tracking"></a>Part 3. The Challenges And Drawbacks Of Face Tracking</h2><p>Face Tracking is a technology that has been growing in popularity in recent years. This technology allows computers to detect and track human faces in real-time. While Face Tracking has many potential applications, some challenges and drawbacks also need to be considered:</p>
<p>One of the main challenges with Face Tracking is that it can be difficult to track faces in different lighting conditions. Faces can also be obstructed by objects such as hats or glasses. Another challenge is that things like photographs, makeup, or masks can fool face tracking.</p>
<p>Some privacy concerns need to be considered when using Face Tracking. This technology can be used to collect sensitive data about people without their consent.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges and drawbacks, Face Tracking remains a promising technology with many potential applications, and it can help with many tasks such as identifying a perpetrator, finding a missing person, better security measures in banks and airports, and many more.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-The-Face-Tracking-In-After-Effects"><a href="#Part-4-The-Face-Tracking-In-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. The Face Tracking In After Effects"></a>Part 4. The Face Tracking In After Effects</h2><p>Adobe After Effects is a useful and powerful tool that can be used for various purposes, including Face Tracking. This feature enables you to track the movement of a person’s face and detect specific parts of a face, including eyes, nose, mouth, etc., to let you work with these facial features individually.</p>
<p>For instance, you can change the mouth movement or pupil color without frame-by-frame adjustments. Moreover, you can measure facial features to see the details, such as how open the eye or mouth is.</p>
<p>Features</p>
<p>Here’s a simple and quick rundown of the features of Face Tracking in Adobe After Effects:</p>
<ol>
<li>Help you detect faces and provide isolated data points to help you refine the content.</li>
<li>Retouch the face in a video without adjusting it frame by frame.</li>
<li>Let you export the tracking data to Character Animator for creating performance-based animations.</li>
</ol>
<p>Function</p>
<p>There are two Face Tracking functions in the Tracker panel:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Face Tracking (Outline Only):</strong> This feature will only help you to outline the face in a video clip.</li>
<li><strong>Face Tracking (Detailed Features):</strong> This option will help you if you want to detect the different facial features and parts, including the eye, pupil, eyebrow, mouth, and nose. You can also take exact measurements of the features.</li>
</ul>

The Guidance Of Using Face Tracking In After Effects"></a>Part 5. The Guidance Of Using Face Tracking In After Effects</h2><p>Follow the guidelines below to use Face Tracking in After Effects:</p>
<p>Face Tracking To Outline A Face</p>
<p>Step1Launch the <strong>After Effects</strong> software and click <strong>“File”</strong> in the top <strong>Toolbar.</strong> Select <strong>Import</strong> and click <strong>“File.”</strong> Find the video footage and add it to the <strong>Project panel.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/adding-the-footage-to-the-project-panel.jpg"
                      alt="adding the footage to the project panel"
                ></p>
<p>Step2To add a new layer, drag and drop the video footage from the <strong>Project Panel</strong> to the <strong>Composition.</strong></p>
<p>Step3Drag the blue <strong>current-time indicator</strong> in the <strong>Timeline</strong> to a frame showing the face’s upright and front view.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/dragging-the-blue-cti-to-a-frame-with-the-face-in-the-upright-and-front-position.jpg"
                      alt="dragging the blue cti to a frame with the face in the upright and front position"
                ></p>
<p>Step4Now, you have to draw a <strong>closed mask loosely</strong> around the face. This helps identify the region for locating the facial features. The top mask is used for <strong>Face Tracking</strong> if you have selected multiple masks.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/creating-a-closed-mask-loosely-around-the-face.jpg"
                      alt="creating a closed mask loosely around the face"
                ></p>
<p>Step5Click the <strong>“Window”</strong> option from the top <strong>Toolbar</strong> and scroll down to <strong>“Tracker.”</strong> Select <strong>“Face Tracking (Outline Only)” as</strong> the tracking method in the <strong>Tracker Panel.</strong></p>
<p>Step6To make sure the tracking is working correctly, track forward or backward one frame at a time and click the <strong>“Start”</strong> button to start the analysis process of the frames. Once finished, you can find the <strong>Face Tracking data</strong> within the Composition.</p>
<p>Tracking Detailed Features And Extracting Facial Measurements</p>
<p>For detailed face features tracking, do the following steps in sequence:</p>
<p>Step1Import your file and add it to the <strong>Project</strong> in the <strong>After Effects</strong>. Drop and drag the video clip into a <strong>Composition</strong> from the <strong>Project Panel</strong> to add a layer.</p>
<p>Step2Position the <strong>CTI</strong> to a frame showing the upright and front view of the face, and draw a <strong>closed mask loosely</strong> around the face to define the search region to find the facial features.</p>
<p>Step3Click the <strong>“Window”</strong> option, scroll down to <strong>Tracker</strong> and select it. Choose the **“Face Tracking (Detailed Features)**” option as the tracking method.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/selecting-the-face-tracking-option.jpg"
                      alt="selecting the face tracking option"
                ></p>
<p>Step4Track forward or backward to check the tracking process, and click the <strong>“Start”</strong> button to initiate the analysis process.</p>
<p>Step5Once the analysis is done, you can find the tracking data within a new effect, <strong>“Face Track Point.”</strong> To access the face tracking data, go to <strong>“Window”</strong> and select <strong>“Effects Control”</strong> to go to the <strong>Effects Panel</strong> or check within the <strong>Composition.</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/face-tracking-data-within-the-composition.jpg"
                      alt="face tracking data within the composition"
                ></p>
<p>Step6Move the <strong>CTI</strong> to a frame displaying <strong>neutral facial expressions</strong> or is in the rest pose. The measurements of a face on other frames are dependent on the rest pose frame. Now, click <strong>“Set Rest Pose”</strong> in the Tracker Panel and select <strong>“Extract &amp; Copy Face Measurements”</strong> to add the Face Measurement layer.</p>
<p>Step7When the Face Measurements effect layer is added, <strong>keyframes</strong> are automatically generated based on the <strong>Face Track Points keyframe data.</strong> You can copy the data from the system clipboard for use in <strong>Adobe Character Animator.</strong></p>

It may go from basic editing to VFX and so on. Speed ramping is also an important feature of editing. Creators who make cinematics or B-rolls often may have used this feature.</p>
<p>Changing the speed of the whole video doesn’t look good in most situations therefore speed ramping feature was created. Speed Ramping means gradually changing the speed of a clip over time. It isn’t a complex thing but doing it correctly in the right amount at the right time can change the feel of the whole video. It catches the attention of viewers through different scenes of a clip.</p>
<p>So, here we have mentioned some iPhone video editing softwares that can at least do basic speed changes. but most of them can also do advanced speed ramping. These are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Filmora Go:</strong></p>
<p><strong>It is available on IOS and Android both.</strong></p>
<p>Want to do speed ramping? use Filmora Go. But are you a content creator and want to do more than just video editing? I would still recommend “Filmora Go”. Because it is such a versatile and easy-to-use software made by Wondershare. Like its PC software, it is also packed with many cool features such as chroma key, mask, keyframing, blending, e.t.c. It also supports multiple layers. It has built-in effects, transitions, and presets to speed up the editing process.</p>
<p>It is a paid video editor but you can try it for free, free trial includes most of the features but it leaves a watermark on export.</p>
<p><strong>~Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Has speed curves for smooth speed ramping.</li>
<li>Supports multiple images and video layers.</li>
<li>Have many presets and filters for fast pace editing.</li>
<li>Have cool features like chroma key, masking, keyframing, e.t.c.</li>
<li>Supports “Pixabay’s” stock library.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>~Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Its UI doesn’t support editing in landscape orientation.</li>
<li>It doesn’t support 4k video resolution.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid iPhone Video speeding Softwares?</em></strong></p>
<p>It usually depends on your needs. If you just want a speed editor to make slow-mo or timelapse videos for your social media then you should go for free video editors, as they are easy to use and provide better speed ramping features than some paid video editors mentioned here.</p>
<p>But as a content creator if you want more features alongside speed ramping then you should go for paid softwares mentioned above. As mobile video editors are quite affordable and some of them have features like that of some PC softwares.</p>
<p><strong>FAQs about Speed ramping feature and softwares:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) What is Speed Ramping and where it is used?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Speed Ramping is different from just changing the speed of the whole clip. It means changing the speed of the video gradually, so the clip doesn’t feel jumpy.</p>
<p>It is done to give viewers a smooth experience between different parts of the clip. like the fast-forward clip is used to show the passage of time. and the slow-mo is used to emphasize something or produce tension, while a mix of both is used in ads and action scenes, e.t.c.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) How to do Speed Ramping?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Speed Ramping methods vary from software to software. Either you can do it by adding keyframes and changing speed with time or you can add or adjust curves for speed change. If your software doesn’t support the speed ramping feature, you can split a clip into parts and apply speed change to them differently. For some of the best iPhone softwares, we have mentioned the speed ramping steps above.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) What FPS is best for Slo-mo videos?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Shooting at 60 Fps is ideal as it gives a smooth and crisp video and you can make slow motion easily if required, you can slow it down up to 40% of its speed while maintaining the quality. It is supported in almost most devices nowadays. And if you want to create super slo-mo for your cinematics or product video then 120 or 240 fps is preferable. But higher fps often have disadvantages as it is harder to apply visual effects or masks. So choose the frame rate according to your requirements.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) Does changing the speed of video affect its audio?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, changing the speed of video affects the audio, It affects its pitch (tempo). Increasing its speed increases the pitch of the audio making it sound shrill while decreasing the speed of the video or making slow-mo decreases the pitch making it sound deep.</p>
<p>Although, some softwares provide the feature to maintain the pitch while changing the speed of the clip.</p>
<p><strong>~Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Its UI doesn’t support editing in landscape orientation.</li>
<li>It doesn’t support 4k video resolution.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid iPhone Video speeding Softwares?</em></strong></p>
<p>It usually depends on your needs. If you just want a speed editor to make slow-mo or timelapse videos for your social media then you should go for free video editors, as they are easy to use and provide better speed ramping features than some paid video editors mentioned here.</p>
<p>But as a content creator if you want more features alongside speed ramping then you should go for paid softwares mentioned above. As mobile video editors are quite affordable and some of them have features like that of some PC softwares.</p>
<p><strong>FAQs about Speed ramping feature and softwares:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) What is Speed Ramping and where it is used?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Speed Ramping is different from just changing the speed of the whole clip. It means changing the speed of the video gradually, so the clip doesn’t feel jumpy.</p>
<p>It is done to give viewers a smooth experience between different parts of the clip. like the fast-forward clip is used to show the passage of time. and the slow-mo is used to emphasize something or produce tension, while a mix of both is used in ads and action scenes, e.t.c.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) How to do Speed Ramping?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Speed Ramping methods vary from software to software. Either you can do it by adding keyframes and changing speed with time or you can add or adjust curves for speed change. If your software doesn’t support the speed ramping feature, you can split a clip into parts and apply speed change to them differently. For some of the best iPhone softwares, we have mentioned the speed ramping steps above.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) What FPS is best for Slo-mo videos?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Shooting at 60 Fps is ideal as it gives a smooth and crisp video and you can make slow motion easily if required, you can slow it down up to 40% of its speed while maintaining the quality. It is supported in almost most devices nowadays. And if you want to create super slo-mo for your cinematics or product video then 120 or 240 fps is preferable. But higher fps often have disadvantages as it is harder to apply visual effects or masks. So choose the frame rate according to your requirements.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) Does changing the speed of video affect its audio?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, changing the speed of video affects the audio, It affects its pitch (tempo). Increasing its speed increases the pitch of the audio making it sound shrill while decreasing the speed of the video or making slow-mo decreases the pitch making it sound deep.</p>
<p>Although, some softwares provide the feature to maintain the pitch while changing the speed of the clip.</p>
<p><strong>~Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Its UI doesn’t support editing in landscape orientation.</li>
<li>It doesn’t support 4k video resolution.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>FAQs about Speed ramping feature and softwares:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) What is Speed Ramping and where it is used?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Speed Ramping is different from just changing the speed of the whole clip. It means changing the speed of the video gradually, so the clip doesn’t feel jumpy.</p>
<p>It is done to give viewers a smooth experience between different parts of the clip. like the fast-forward clip is used to show the passage of time. and the slow-mo is used to emphasize something or produce tension, while a mix of both is used in ads and action scenes, e.t.c.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) How to do Speed Ramping?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Speed Ramping methods vary from software to software. Either you can do it by adding keyframes and changing speed with time or you can add or adjust curves for speed change. If your software doesn’t support the speed ramping feature, you can split a clip into parts and apply speed change to them differently. For some of the best iPhone softwares, we have mentioned the speed ramping steps above.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) What FPS is best for Slo-mo videos?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Shooting at 60 Fps is ideal as it gives a smooth and crisp video and you can make slow motion easily if required, you can slow it down up to 40% of its speed while maintaining the quality. It is supported in almost most devices nowadays. And if you want to create super slo-mo for your cinematics or product video then 120 or 240 fps is preferable. But higher fps often have disadvantages as it is harder to apply visual effects or masks. So choose the frame rate according to your requirements.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) Does changing the speed of video affect its audio?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, changing the speed of video affects the audio, It affects its pitch (tempo). Increasing its speed increases the pitch of the audio making it sound shrill while decreasing the speed of the video or making slow-mo decreases the pitch making it sound deep.</p>
<p>Although, some softwares provide the feature to maintain the pitch while changing the speed of the clip.</p>
<p><strong>~Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Its UI doesn’t support editing in landscape orientation.</li>
<li>It doesn’t support 4k video resolution.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid iPhone Video speeding Softwares?</em></strong></p>
<p>It usually depends on your needs. If you just want a speed editor to make slow-mo or timelapse videos for your social media then you should go for free video editors, as they are easy to use and provide better speed ramping features than some paid video editors mentioned here.</p>
<p>But as a content creator if you want more features alongside speed ramping then you should go for paid softwares mentioned above. As mobile video editors are quite affordable and some of them have features like that of some PC softwares.</p>
<p><strong>FAQs about Speed ramping feature and softwares:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) What is Speed Ramping and where it is used?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Speed Ramping is different from just changing the speed of the whole clip. It means changing the speed of the video gradually, so the clip doesn’t feel jumpy.</p>
<p>It is done to give viewers a smooth experience between different parts of the clip. like the fast-forward clip is used to show the passage of time. and the slow-mo is used to emphasize something or produce tension, while a mix of both is used in ads and action scenes, e.t.c.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) How to do Speed Ramping?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Speed Ramping methods vary from software to software. Either you can do it by adding keyframes and changing speed with time or you can add or adjust curves for speed change. If your software doesn’t support the speed ramping feature, you can split a clip into parts and apply speed change to them differently. For some of the best iPhone softwares, we have mentioned the speed ramping steps above.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) What FPS is best for Slo-mo videos?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Shooting at 60 Fps is ideal as it gives a smooth and crisp video and you can make slow motion easily if required, you can slow it down up to 40% of its speed while maintaining the quality. It is supported in almost most devices nowadays. And if you want to create super slo-mo for your cinematics or product video then 120 or 240 fps is preferable. But higher fps often have disadvantages as it is harder to apply visual effects or masks. So choose the frame rate according to your requirements.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Q) Does changing the speed of video affect its audio?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, changing the speed of video affects the audio, It affects its pitch (tempo). Increasing its speed increases the pitch of the audio making it sound shrill while decreasing the speed of the video or making slow-mo decreases the pitch making it sound deep.</p>
<p>Although, some softwares provide the feature to maintain the pitch while changing the speed of the clip.</p>

<p>Congratulations on getting here! You finally cropped your video using the VLC media player.</p>
<p>Although there are disadvantages to using this as your cropping tool. Like for example you want the real-time preview of what you’ve changed in your video. This would be a turn off for some that want their outputs to be shown to them immediately. Aside from this, there is a chance that you will forget one step to make and thus, the whole process would need to start over from scratch. Lastly, is the freedom to batch crop multiple videos. This is especially important for those that need to have many clips in one video. A user might lose the continuity of the story within his video.</p>
<p>While one of its strong suits is the affordability of the software. It is completely free and has no additional charges that may surprise you in the future. Finally, your output won’t have watermarks that could destroy the aesthetics of your video.</p>
<p>What are your experiences with using it as a cropping tool? What would you recommend to improve it? It is up to you the user if you want to continue using this as your partner in removing the excess in your videos.</p>
