Windows Movie Maker comes pre-installed in older Windows versions though it has been discontinued in the latest Windows versions. However, if you are using the latest Windows versions, you can install MiniTool Movie Maker instead. If you are editing your video in Windows Movie Maker, you should know how to save your video in MP4 format.</p>
<p>MP4 file format is the most used video file format, and hence, you should know how to save Windows movie maker mp4 file. Otherwise, you won’t be able to play your video on regular video players on different devices. This is because not all video players support the native Windows Movie Maker file format, but they support MP4 format as it is very common. In this article, we will illustrate the steps for Windows Movie Maker how to save as MP4 file.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Steps-to-Save-Windows-Movie-Maker-Video-as-MP4"><a href="#Part-1-Steps-to-Save-Windows-Movie-Maker-Video-as-MP4" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Steps to Save Windows Movie Maker Video as MP4"></a>Part 1. Steps to Save Windows Movie Maker Video as MP4</h2><p>There are two scenarios you may come across while dealing with Windows Movie Maker MP4 situation. First, you might be editing your video on Windows Movie Maker, and you want to save it in MP4 format. Second, you might have received a video file saved in the native Windows Movie Maker file format and you want to convert it to MP4 file format. In the second scenario, you must opt for a Windows Movie Maker to MP4 converter such as VideoConverterFactory.</p>
<p>For the first scenario where you are editing your video on Windows Movie Maker, the solution is simple. This is because the default file format to save a video file on Windows Movie Maker is MP4. There are other options available such as WMV, but if you opt for the recommended settings, you can easily save your video file in MP4. Here are the steps for Windows Movie Maker to mp4 file format.</p>
<p>Step1Launch Windows Movie Maker on your PC. Create a new project and import your video clips. Split, trim, join, add transitions, effects, and titles as per your requirements.</p>
<p>Step2When you are done editing your video, go to Home tab&gt; Save Movie button available on Share section.</p>

How come Kinemaster is not only a software you can download, pay for, and use on your computer, which, on its behalf, should also be a powerful one? It would be a logical question, but remember, we are in 2022 already, so, no limits are put to the technology of today! On Google Play Store, in the description of the abovementioned app, it reads: “KineMaster makes video editing fun on your phone, tablet, or Chromebook!” – So, why not use this opportunity, to explore new ways of making our content better and as appealing as ever for our viewers?</p>
<p>Even though Kinemaster deserves a bigger article with more explanation of each tool, for now, we will only be focusing on cropping a video in this app. First off, why crop a video at all? – well, sometimes we have a wonderful footage but the aspect ratio just doesn’t work for us. It might be because we want to upload our clip on a platform needing a specific aspect ratio, or, we just need to crop and pan (which means to move around within a clip or an image) because we don’t like some things shown in the original video – we might as well need to zoom in and out, in order to get the best out of our footage. For whatever reason, when you need or just wish to crop a video, it should not be a big deal, and let’s see how KineMaster makes it a good and easy experience.</p>
<p>So, the first thing we do in almost every situation is to access the platform or an application itself! – you guessed it right, download KineMaster from Google Play Store! Once you have it on your phone, open it and enjoy the introduction of the app itself.</p>

<p>So, in this article, you have learned how to crop a video using a mobile app KineMaster, as well as using a software – Wondershare Filmora X. of course, there are many other ways in which you can crop your video and make the best out of it.

<p>Scrolling down, we see a rich list of all the features KineMaster offers to its users, such as: Assets, Projects, Backup and Share, Blending Modes, Reverse, Chroma Key, High Resolution, Video Layers. Simply put, on KineMaster, you can download projects, add more than 2 500 effects, use powerful tools, add cinematic color, etc…</p>

                      alt="crop-video-kinemaster"
                ></p>
<p>This many features make you think – how come it is possible to do all that on a mobile phone? How come Kinemaster is not only a software you can download, pay for, and use on your computer, which, on its behalf, should also be a powerful one? It would be a logical question, but remember, we are in 2022 already, so, no limits are put to the technology of today! On Google Play Store, in the description of the abovementioned app, it reads: “KineMaster makes video editing fun on your phone, tablet, or Chromebook!” – So, why not use this opportunity, to explore new ways of making our content better and as appealing as ever for our viewers?</p>
<p>Even though Kinemaster deserves a bigger article with more explanation of each tool, for now, we will only be focusing on cropping a video in this app. First off, why crop a video at all? – well, sometimes we have a wonderful footage but the aspect ratio just doesn’t work for us. It might be because we want to upload our clip on a platform needing a specific aspect ratio, or, we just need to crop and pan (which means to move around within a clip or an image) because we don’t like some things shown in the original video – we might as well need to zoom in and out, in order to get the best out of our footage. For whatever reason, when you need or just wish to crop a video, it should not be a big deal, and let’s see how KineMaster makes it a good and easy experience.</p>
<p>So, the first thing we do in almost every situation is to access the platform or an application itself! – you guessed it right, download KineMaster from Google Play Store! Once you have it on your phone, open it and enjoy the introduction of the app itself.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="crop-video-kinemaster"
                ></p>
<p>The interesting fact you will notice is that the layout of the app is horizontal, not vertical, unlike in most cases. So, it makes you feel like you are at least close to what video editors who work on their computers represent. The interface of the app is quite enjoyable for your eyes, as it is kind of fun, as well.</p>
<p>It is needless to say that, if you are going to do a specific “operation” to the video, such as cropping, you will already have figured out which one of your footage you want to crop and pan. So, it’s wise to jump on the button which says: Create New.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>This will take you to the editor. Even though in the media section you will find the video you want to work on, but you might be struggling to notice a Crop button. It is because unfortunately, it’s not possible to crop your video right away in KineMaster – first, you will need to add a background, for example, a black one.</p>

                ></p>
<p>After adding it to the editor, you need to tap on the video file which has appeared in the sequence – this will show you different features you can use on the right.

Having learnt about the fundamentals of creating over the top slideshows with Clideo, let us move ahead with working on some of the best tips to complement your already awesome graphic slideshow artwork with the most appealing audio in the following section:</p>

While most of the slideshow creator programs available today are equipped with extensive varieties of inbuilt audio for visibly any presentation setting, you can also opt to choose your own music plan in case you don’t get anything specific.</p>
<p>However, you do need to take care of certain factors when deciding on your music plan, most importantly, the pricing concerns. Go for selecting a royalty free, unlimited audio license via an affordable paid subscription from recognized and leading music hubs and online audio websites.</p>
<h3 id="02Browse-the-Recommended-Audio-Choices"><a href="#02Browse-the-Recommended-Audio-Choices" class="headerlink" title="02Browse the Recommended Audio Choices"></a>02Browse the Recommended Audio Choices</h3><p>When looking through the diversity of music options available on any audio website, do not forget to pay attention to the user and website recommended playlists and music categories. These tend to have a collection of the most preferred audio choices and there are high chances of you getting your exact music piece from within these playlists.</p>
<p>You can further, refine your search within these categories by setting filters of genre and style, in case you have a clear idea of what you exactly need, thus rescuing you from the hustle of browsing through a never ending list of audio files.</p>

When selecting the music elements for your slideshow, make sure that your choices are well in accordance with the content and mood of your creation. The most important aspect here is that the music you choose to add should complement the story being depicted, while captivating the viewer’s attention.</p>
<p>Avoid choosing a random audio just because you have heard a buzz of the same on popular platforms or a peer recommendation, lest the contents and background score of your presentation may take opposite paths and disrupt the information flow, while resulting in a distracted audience. To escape the hustle, you may seek help from the diversity of stock audio websites for a keyword and category oriented music search.</p>
<p>If you are interested in adding depth to your background audio, consider using the stem files of a selected song to obtain the latter’s instrumental note recordings. This will help to add a unique layer to the song, while uplifting its mood to a different level.</p>

All you need to do is, add each track to the presentation elements, while taking care that every inclusion matches with the content it is supposed to complement.</p>
<p>Take care to restrict your choices in line with the length of the slideshow; else you may end up stuffing the footage with too many music pieces, leading to a miscoordinated arrangement. Check if you need just a single song or a complete soundtrack.</p>

While most of the slideshow creator programs available today are equipped with extensive varieties of inbuilt audio for visibly any presentation setting, you can also opt to choose your own music plan in case you don’t get anything specific.</p>
<p>However, you do need to take care of certain factors when deciding on your music plan, most importantly, the pricing concerns. Go for selecting a royalty free, unlimited audio license via an affordable paid subscription from recognized and leading music hubs and online audio websites.</p>
<h3 id="02Browse-the-Recommended-Audio-Choices-1"><a href="#02Browse-the-Recommended-Audio-Choices-1" class="headerlink" title="02Browse the Recommended Audio Choices"></a>02Browse the Recommended Audio Choices</h3><p>When looking through the diversity of music options available on any audio website, do not forget to pay attention to the user and website recommended playlists and music categories. These tend to have a collection of the most preferred audio choices and there are high chances of you getting your exact music piece from within these playlists.</p>
<p>You can further, refine your search within these categories by setting filters of genre and style, in case you have a clear idea of what you exactly need, thus rescuing you from the hustle of browsing through a never ending list of audio files.</p>

When selecting the music elements for your slideshow, make sure that your choices are well in accordance with the content and mood of your creation. The most important aspect here is that the music you choose to add should complement the story being depicted, while captivating the viewer’s attention.</p>
<p>Avoid choosing a random audio just because you have heard a buzz of the same on popular platforms or a peer recommendation, lest the contents and background score of your presentation may take opposite paths and disrupt the information flow, while resulting in a distracted audience. To escape the hustle, you may seek help from the diversity of stock audio websites for a keyword and category oriented music search.</p>
<p>If you are interested in adding depth to your background audio, consider using the stem files of a selected song to obtain the latter’s instrumental note recordings. This will help to add a unique layer to the song, while uplifting its mood to a different level.</p>

All you need to do is, add each track to the presentation elements, while taking care that every inclusion matches with the content it is supposed to complement.</p>
<p>Take care to restrict your choices in line with the length of the slideshow; else you may end up stuffing the footage with too many music pieces, leading to a miscoordinated arrangement. Check if you need just a single song or a complete soundtrack.</p>

While most of the slideshow creator programs available today are equipped with extensive varieties of inbuilt audio for visibly any presentation setting, you can also opt to choose your own music plan in case you don’t get anything specific.</p>
<p>However, you do need to take care of certain factors when deciding on your music plan, most importantly, the pricing concerns. Go for selecting a royalty free, unlimited audio license via an affordable paid subscription from recognized and leading music hubs and online audio websites.</p>
<h3 id="02Browse-the-Recommended-Audio-Choices-2"><a href="#02Browse-the-Recommended-Audio-Choices-2" class="headerlink" title="02Browse the Recommended Audio Choices"></a>02Browse the Recommended Audio Choices</h3><p>When looking through the diversity of music options available on any audio website, do not forget to pay attention to the user and website recommended playlists and music categories. These tend to have a collection of the most preferred audio choices and there are high chances of you getting your exact music piece from within these playlists.</p>
<p>You can further, refine your search within these categories by setting filters of genre and style, in case you have a clear idea of what you exactly need, thus rescuing you from the hustle of browsing through a never ending list of audio files.</p>

When selecting the music elements for your slideshow, make sure that your choices are well in accordance with the content and mood of your creation. The most important aspect here is that the music you choose to add should complement the story being depicted, while captivating the viewer’s attention.</p>
<p>Avoid choosing a random audio just because you have heard a buzz of the same on popular platforms or a peer recommendation, lest the contents and background score of your presentation may take opposite paths and disrupt the information flow, while resulting in a distracted audience. To escape the hustle, you may seek help from the diversity of stock audio websites for a keyword and category oriented music search.</p>
<p>If you are interested in adding depth to your background audio, consider using the stem files of a selected song to obtain the latter’s instrumental note recordings. This will help to add a unique layer to the song, while uplifting its mood to a different level.</p>

All you need to do is, add each track to the presentation elements, while taking care that every inclusion matches with the content it is supposed to complement.</p>
<p>Take care to restrict your choices in line with the length of the slideshow; else you may end up stuffing the footage with too many music pieces, leading to a miscoordinated arrangement. Check if you need just a single song or a complete soundtrack.</p>

While most of the slideshow creator programs available today are equipped with extensive varieties of inbuilt audio for visibly any presentation setting, you can also opt to choose your own music plan in case you don’t get anything specific.</p>
<p>However, you do need to take care of certain factors when deciding on your music plan, most importantly, the pricing concerns. Go for selecting a royalty free, unlimited audio license via an affordable paid subscription from recognized and leading music hubs and online audio websites.</p>
<h3 id="02Browse-the-Recommended-Audio-Choices-3"><a href="#02Browse-the-Recommended-Audio-Choices-3" class="headerlink" title="02Browse the Recommended Audio Choices"></a>02Browse the Recommended Audio Choices</h3><p>When looking through the diversity of music options available on any audio website, do not forget to pay attention to the user and website recommended playlists and music categories. These tend to have a collection of the most preferred audio choices and there are high chances of you getting your exact music piece from within these playlists.</p>
<p>You can further, refine your search within these categories by setting filters of genre and style, in case you have a clear idea of what you exactly need, thus rescuing you from the hustle of browsing through a never ending list of audio files.</p>

When selecting the music elements for your slideshow, make sure that your choices are well in accordance with the content and mood of your creation. The most important aspect here is that the music you choose to add should complement the story being depicted, while captivating the viewer’s attention.</p>
<p>Avoid choosing a random audio just because you have heard a buzz of the same on popular platforms or a peer recommendation, lest the contents and background score of your presentation may take opposite paths and disrupt the information flow, while resulting in a distracted audience. To escape the hustle, you may seek help from the diversity of stock audio websites for a keyword and category oriented music search.</p>
<p>If you are interested in adding depth to your background audio, consider using the stem files of a selected song to obtain the latter’s instrumental note recordings. This will help to add a unique layer to the song, while uplifting its mood to a different level.</p>

All you need to do is, add each track to the presentation elements, while taking care that every inclusion matches with the content it is supposed to complement.</p>
<p>Take care to restrict your choices in line with the length of the slideshow; else you may end up stuffing the footage with too many music pieces, leading to a miscoordinated arrangement. Check if you need just a single song or a complete soundtrack.</p>

At first sight, you’ll see that these two operations are similar because they involve the cutting of videos. Let’s look at the differences between these two operations.</p>
<h3 id="Trimming"><a href="#Trimming" class="headerlink" title="Trimming"></a>Trimming</h3><p>Trimming is the process of cutting off a portion of the end or beginning of your video to reduce its length, leaving the desired content only. Trimming is vital when you want to ensure your video starts swiftly and your viewers will not get bored while waiting for something captivating to occur.</p>
<p>The first seconds of a video are what draw viewers’ attention and convince them to continue watching the entire video. When you apply it intelligently, video trimming allows you to remove unnecessary frames from the beginning and end of your video and leave content that your audience will like.</p>
<h3 id="Cutting"><a href="#Cutting" class="headerlink" title="Cutting"></a>Cutting</h3><p>Cutting is also a fundamental video editing skill, and it involves removing a portion of a video clip by cutting in two places. You’ll then lift out the middle area and combine the leftover video back together.</p>
<p>This operation is helpful when you want to polish your video and cut off meaningless snippets. What’s more? You can apply cutting if you intend to insert a section of your video clip into another one.</p>
<p>You might want to consider cutting when you want to share your video on social networks and need to cut it into pieces due to the video length limits.</p>
<p>People often confuse trimming with cutting because they are all about deleting sections of the video. However, trimming involves deleting the beginning and end of a video, while cutting refers to cutting a part of a video file from somewhere else. Understanding this crucial difference will allow you to edit your videos like a professional.</p>

<p>If you are wondering how to trim videos in Premiere Pro without re-render follow the steps below:</p>

<li>The video will appear in the media library area at the bottom of the screen.</li>
<li>Drag and drop the video from the media library to the timeline. You’ll see the complete video clip duration in the timeline.</li>
<li>You can crop the video by dragging the blue time marker to the duration where you would like to start the video.</li>
<li>Hold the ‘Ctrl’ key on your keyboard, then drag the starting end of the video clip to the time marker position. You’ll remove unnecessary video content from the beginning of your video.</li>
<li>You can trim the video from its other end by following the same steps but from the opposite direction. You can only use this method to trim from one of the ends of your video clip.</li>
<li>Choose the ‘Laser Tool’ located at the side menu of the timeline to trim from the center of the video clip. Now, click on the clip at the position you want to trim, and the application will cut the video from this position.</li>

Essentially, this ensures there is no misalignment when the program converts the video to another format. For example, importing it into another video editor can cause a mis-sync between audio and video if the two tracks are not locked or linked.</p>
<p>Video editing professionals avoid this by locking the two tracks together. As such, you might want to unlink or unlock the two before doing anything. To do this, you need to import the video into the application and take it to the timeline with the associated tracks. Then, select the video track alone.</p>

<h2 id="What-Is-the-Difference-Between-Cutting-and-Trimming-a-Video-3"><a href="#What-Is-the-Difference-Between-Cutting-and-Trimming-a-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="What Is the Difference Between Cutting and Trimming a Video?"></a>What Is the Difference Between Cutting and Trimming a Video?</h2><p>If you are new to video editing, you might find that cutting and trimming video files sound the same to you. At first sight, you’ll see that these two operations are similar because they involve the cutting of videos. Let’s look at the differences between these two operations.</p>
<h3 id="Trimming-3"><a href="#Trimming-3" class="headerlink" title="Trimming"></a>Trimming</h3><p>Trimming is the process of cutting off a portion of the end or beginning of your video to reduce its length, leaving the desired content only. Trimming is vital when you want to ensure your video starts swiftly and your viewers will not get bored while waiting for something captivating to occur.</p>
<p>The first seconds of a video are what draw viewers’ attention and convince them to continue watching the entire video. When you apply it intelligently, video trimming allows you to remove unnecessary frames from the beginning and end of your video and leave content that your audience will like.</p>
<h3 id="Cutting-3"><a href="#Cutting-3" class="headerlink" title="Cutting"></a>Cutting</h3><p>Cutting is also a fundamental video editing skill, and it involves removing a portion of a video clip by cutting in two places. You’ll then lift out the middle area and combine the leftover video back together.</p>
<p>This operation is helpful when you want to polish your video and cut off meaningless snippets. What’s more? You can apply cutting if you intend to insert a section of your video clip into another one.</p>
<p>You might want to consider cutting when you want to share your video on social networks and need to cut it into pieces due to the video length limits.</p>
<p>People often confuse trimming with cutting because they are all about deleting sections of the video. However, trimming involves deleting the beginning and end of a video, while cutting refers to cutting a part of a video file from somewhere else. Understanding this crucial difference will allow you to edit your videos like a professional.</p>

Let’s look at these two methods.</p>
<h3 id="Method-1-Trim-Clips-on-Timeline-3"><a href="#Method-1-Trim-Clips-on-Timeline-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 1:Trim Clips on Timeline"></a>Method 1:Trim Clips on Timeline</h3><p>If you are wondering: What is a timeline? It’s the area Premiere Pro where you arrange your videos and map out the edits you want to apply. You will see all your video clips, transitions, effects, and more laid out in chronological order while you are working on your project. You can Premiere Pro trim video clips on the timeline, and at any point, play your project to check how your edits will look.</p>
<p>Remember that edits on the Premiere Pro timeline don’t alter your source files, and they are previews of how your edits will appear. That means you can untrim a video clip to extend it to its original length without consequence.</p>
<p>To learn how to trim video in Premiere Pro on the timeline, follow the steps below.</p>
<ol>
<li>Double click on the video file you want to trim in Premiere Pro.</li>
<li>Adjust the timings of your edits. Drag the ends of your video clip as if you are resizing a window to shorten or extend by trimming. As your cursor gets closer at the edge of the video clip, you’ll see a red arrow.</li>

<h3 id="How-to-Trim-a-Video-without-Re-Rendering-3"><a href="#How-to-Trim-a-Video-without-Re-Rendering-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Trim a Video without Re-Rendering?"></a>How to Trim a Video without Re-Rendering?</h3><p>When adding a video to Premiere Pro, it will be rendered by this software application to ensure high-quality playback and speed. Rendering takes time afterward, leading to loss of quality; however, it makes sure you have gotten the best video quality as much as possible by removing skipped frames and lag from the video playback.</p>
<p>If you are wondering how to trim videos in Premiere Pro without re-render follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Import your video to Premiere Pro by launching the application and choosing ‘Import Media to Start’. Browse and select the video you want to trim.</li>
<li>The video will appear in the media library area at the bottom of the screen.</li>
<li>Drag and drop the video from the media library to the timeline. You’ll see the complete video clip duration in the timeline.</li>
<li>You can crop the video by dragging the blue time marker to the duration where you would like to start the video.</li>
<li>Hold the ‘Ctrl’ key on your keyboard, then drag the starting end of the video clip to the time marker position. You’ll remove unnecessary video content from the beginning of your video.</li>
<li>You can trim the video from its other end by following the same steps but from the opposite direction. You can only use this method to trim from one of the ends of your video clip.</li>
<li>Choose the ‘Laser Tool’ located at the side menu of the timeline to trim from the center of the video clip. Now, click on the clip at the position you want to trim, and the application will cut the video from this position.</li>
<li>Follow steps 2 to 4 to trim from cuts you’ve just made.</li>
</ol>

Essentially, this ensures there is no misalignment when the program converts the video to another format. For example, importing it into another video editor can cause a mis-sync between audio and video if the two tracks are not locked or linked.</p>
<p>Video editing professionals avoid this by locking the two tracks together. As such, you might want to unlink or unlock the two before doing anything. To do this, you need to import the video into the application and take it to the timeline with the associated tracks. Then, select the video track alone.</p>
