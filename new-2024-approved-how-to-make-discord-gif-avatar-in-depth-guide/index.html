<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Make-a-Material-Transparent-in-Blender"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Make-a-Material-Transparent-in-Blender" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to Make a Material Transparent in Blender"></a>Part 2 How to Make a Material Transparent in Blender</h2><p>Blender is a top class graphic modulation tool; you can use to play with your editing creativity to your heart’s content, catering to a variety of design requirements, while adhering to a distinguished professional outlook. If you are pondering over the perfect task choice to start your editing journey with Blender, you can begin with making a material transparent in the software.</p>
<p>When beginning to create transparent artworks in Blender, you need to be familiar with the Transparent BSDF node. Here’s a quick explanation:</p>
<p><strong>Transparent BSDF Node</strong></p>
<p>When working with Blender, you get to access a variety of graphic nodes that cater to specific design purposes. Likewise, the transparent BSDF, as the name suggests, is an exclusive transparency creation graphic node that is essential to make materials transparent in Blender. Talking of the specific node function, it is there to facilitate the control of different transparency modes, in cohesion with specific user requirements.</p>
<p>Browse through the following section for a guided tutorial to make a material transparent using Blender:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p>Prepare a suitable BSDF material by selecting any image from your device and applying it to the object in the Blender’s viewport.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p>To start working with the Transparent BSDF node, you first need to insert the same into the node tree amongst the Principle BSDF and the Mix Shader nodes. To do this, you need to select ‘Add’ or press ‘Ctrl + A’, followed by locating the same in the ‘Shader’ submenu. Do not forget to add the ‘Mix Shader’ node, which is again, present in the ‘Shader’ submenu, to the node tree.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p>
<p>Plug in the Transparent BSDF output into the top Shader input of the Mix Shader, while dragging the latter into the connecting link between the Material Output and Principle BSDF nodes. This enables the Mix Shader node to pass through the two output generating nodes. The resultant ‘Transparency Effect’ can be seen on the viewpoint object within a few seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong></p>
<p>Make an additional connection of two fresh nodes into the node tree as follows:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Transparent BSDF output to the Mix Shader input</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Principal BSDF output to the Mix Shader input</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Mix Shader output to the Surface input</p>
<p>This will finally fetch a transparent material output for the selected image object.</p>

If you are pondering over the perfect task choice to start your editing journey with Blender, you can begin with making a material transparent in the software.</p>
<p>When beginning to create transparent artworks in Blender, you need to be familiar with the Transparent BSDF node. Here’s a quick explanation:</p>
<p><strong>Transparent BSDF Node</strong></p>
<p>When working with Blender, you get to access a variety of graphic nodes that cater to specific design purposes. Likewise, the transparent BSDF, as the name suggests, is an exclusive transparency creation graphic node that is essential to make materials transparent in Blender. Talking of the specific node function, it is there to facilitate the control of different transparency modes, in cohesion with specific user requirements.</p>
<p>Browse through the following section for a guided tutorial to make a material transparent using Blender:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p>Prepare a suitable BSDF material by selecting any image from your device and applying it to the object in the Blender’s viewport.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p>To start working with the Transparent BSDF node, you first need to insert the same into the node tree amongst the Principle BSDF and the Mix Shader nodes. To do this, you need to select ‘Add’ or press ‘Ctrl + A’, followed by locating the same in the ‘Shader’ submenu. Do not forget to add the ‘Mix Shader’ node, which is again, present in the ‘Shader’ submenu, to the node tree.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p>
<p>Plug in the Transparent BSDF output into the top Shader input of the Mix Shader, while dragging the latter into the connecting link between the Material Output and Principle BSDF nodes. This enables the Mix Shader node to pass through the two output generating nodes. The resultant ‘Transparency Effect’ can be seen on the viewpoint object within a few seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong></p>
<p>Make an additional connection of two fresh nodes into the node tree as follows:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Transparent BSDF output to the Mix Shader input</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Principal BSDF output to the Mix Shader input</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Mix Shader output to the Surface input</p>
<p>This will finally fetch a transparent material output for the selected image object.</p>

If you are pondering over the perfect task choice to start your editing journey with Blender, you can begin with making a material transparent in the software.</p>
<p>When beginning to create transparent artworks in Blender, you need to be familiar with the Transparent BSDF node. Here’s a quick explanation:</p>
<p><strong>Transparent BSDF Node</strong></p>
<p>When working with Blender, you get to access a variety of graphic nodes that cater to specific design purposes. Likewise, the transparent BSDF, as the name suggests, is an exclusive transparency creation graphic node that is essential to make materials transparent in Blender. Talking of the specific node function, it is there to facilitate the control of different transparency modes, in cohesion with specific user requirements.</p>
<p>Browse through the following section for a guided tutorial to make a material transparent using Blender:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p>Prepare a suitable BSDF material by selecting any image from your device and applying it to the object in the Blender’s viewport.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p>To start working with the Transparent BSDF node, you first need to insert the same into the node tree amongst the Principle BSDF and the Mix Shader nodes. To do this, you need to select ‘Add’ or press ‘Ctrl + A’, followed by locating the same in the ‘Shader’ submenu. Do not forget to add the ‘Mix Shader’ node, which is again, present in the ‘Shader’ submenu, to the node tree.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p>
<p>Plug in the Transparent BSDF output into the top Shader input of the Mix Shader, while dragging the latter into the connecting link between the Material Output and Principle BSDF nodes. This enables the Mix Shader node to pass through the two output generating nodes. The resultant ‘Transparency Effect’ can be seen on the viewpoint object within a few seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong></p>
<p>Make an additional connection of two fresh nodes into the node tree as follows:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Transparent BSDF output to the Mix Shader input</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Principal BSDF output to the Mix Shader input</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Mix Shader output to the Surface input</p>
<p>This will finally fetch a transparent material output for the selected image object.</p>

<p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Import Image File</strong></p>
<p>When you are done with the installation, launch the software and navigate to the ’Import’ tab in its welcome interface. Click and tap ‘Import Media File’ from the dropdown that appears to import the desired image to Filmora’s media library.</p>

                      alt="Filmora- Media Import Interface"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Drag to Timeline</strong></p>
<p>The next step is to drag your image selection from the software’s media library to its editor timeline. Either right click the image and select ‘Insert’ option from the submenu that appears, or use the conventional ‘Drag and Drop’ method to accomplish this task.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/Blender-tips-how-to-make-blender-render-transparent-background-9.JPG"
                      alt="Filmora- Image Timeline Dragging"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Transparency Adjustments</strong></p>
<p>Once the image reaches the timeline, tap the same to see the ‘Settings’ tab get opened. Navigate through the tab options until you find ‘Chroma Key Settings’. Enable the ‘Chroma Key’ with a right side toggle to see your selected image get transparent with a ‘Green’ color in the background.</p>
<p>An alternative to the above method is to hit the ‘Color Picker’ option to the right of the ‘Select Color’ tab and navigate to a desired section of the image to make it transparent with a single click.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Filmora- Image Transparency Adjustments"
                ></p>
<p>If you observe partial transparency in the resultant image background, consider making additional adjustments in ’Chroma Key’ setting parameters like, offset, edge thickness, tolerance, edge feather, etc., to ensure that the image background is totally transparent. When the final artwork makes you happy, tap ‘OK’.</p>

<p>To start your creative journey, you can hone your skills by focusing on at least one technique and progressively learning new skills. One of the various video editing techniques you can employ is double exposure. This method is based on an old technique in photography in which a film is exposed twice to create a single image. This article shows you how to use the same method to combine two or more video clips and create a double exposure effect.</p>
<p>You can create artistic videos that tell various stories and captivate viewers by using Filmora. The following steps describe how to create a double exposure effect in Filmora.</p>
<p>Step1 Download the Filmora application</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="filmora download page"
                ></p>
<p>Before you start editing, click <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://bit.ly/3tav2d5" >https://bit.ly/3tav2d5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to download the Filmora app. On the page that appears, click the <strong>Free Download</strong> option. Then, the Filmora installer is automatically downloaded. To start installing Filmora, double-click the installer and click <strong>Agree</strong> to agree with the terms and conditions. Then, wait for approximately 2 minutes for the installation to complete.</p>
<p>Step2 Start a new project in Filmora</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-double-exposure-effect-in-filmora-2.jpg"
                      alt="set up a new project"
                ></p>
<p>After a successful installation, the app automatically runs, and you can start editing videos. Click <strong>New Project</strong> to start a project on a clean canvas.</p>
<p>Before starting a new project, we recommend you plan a theme for your videos. You can incorporate different elements into your videos to convey a dramatic, light, or fun theme. This step will help you communicate the mood and message you want to convey to the audience.</p>
<p>Step3 Select a foreground video</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-double-exposure-effect-in-filmora-3.jpg"
                      alt="add a base video"
                ></p>
<p>To create a trendy double exposure effect, record a video clip with a white or neutral background. Then, import the specified video to Filmora. In the second layer of the video editing pane, drag the video.</p>
<p>The first video is called the foreground video, which serves as the base video to achieve the desired double exposure effect. It is important to choose neutral or calm colors to make it easier for you to remove the background and highlight the main subject of your video.</p>
<p>Step4 Edit the foreground video</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-double-exposure-effect-in-filmora-4.jpg"
                      alt="adjust the color settings of the foreground video"
                ></p>
<p>Edit the foreground video by adjusting the color settings. Click the <strong>Color Correction</strong> icon to open the color settings. In the <strong>Advanced Color Tuning</strong> box that appears, click <strong>Adjust</strong>. In this article, the value of <strong>Exposure</strong> is set to <strong>18,</strong> and <strong>Contrast</strong> is set to <strong>28</strong>. Then, <strong>Vibrance</strong> and <strong>Saturation</strong> are set to <strong>-100</strong>. In the <strong>Light</strong> settings, the values of <strong>Highlights</strong> and <strong>Shadows</strong> are set to <strong>-100</strong>, <strong>Whites</strong> is set to <strong>0</strong>, and <strong>Blacks</strong> is set to <strong>-30</strong>. You can experiment and play with the settings based on the theme that you want to achieve.</p>
<p>Step5 Select a background video</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-double-exposure-effect-in-filmora-5.jpg"
                      alt="import a video clip as a background video"
                ></p>
<p>For the background video, select a video clip and import the video to Filmora. Then, drag the video in a layer below the foreground video.</p>
<p>When you select a background video, make sure that the video is vibrant, colorful, and has lots of texture. For example, you can select landscapes, flowers, leaves, textured patterns, city lights, sunsets, or other graphic components. The colors and lighting in the background video significantly impact the final output’s overall appearance.</p>
<p>Step6 Blend the foreground and background videos</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-double-exposure-effect-in-filmora-6.jpg"
                      alt="produce double exposure effect"
                ></p>
<p>If you want to produce a perfect double-exposed video, blending layers is properly essential. To do this, double click the foreground video. Go to the <strong>Compositing</strong> option and set <strong>Blending Mode</strong> to <strong>Lighten</strong>. You can also configure <strong>Blending Mode</strong> based on your preference.</p>
<p>The steps that are outlined in this article can help you apply double exposure effects to your videos. You can modify your videos to your preferences by using all the resources that Filmora provides.</p>
<p>A simple video clip with a double-exposure effect adds a dramatic and dreamy effect to it. The creator can work with colors, exposures, and brightness to achieve a double-exposure effect. This technique provides creative results and allows the video creator to tell a story to the audience in a manner that a plain video clip cannot convey. It is useful, especially when editing personal or professional videos, such as documentaries, wedding videos, travel vlogs, and other artistic works.</p>
<p>Before, the double-exposure effect could only be achieved by using cameras and specialized photographic skills. These days, creators can use Filmora Video Editor to replicate the double-exposure effect in just a few simple steps.

                      alt="set up a new project"
                ></p>
<p>After a successful installation, the app automatically runs, and you can start editing videos. Click <strong>New Project</strong> to start a project on a clean canvas.</p>
<p>Before starting a new project, we recommend you plan a theme for your videos. You can incorporate different elements into your videos to convey a dramatic, light, or fun theme. This step will help you communicate the mood and message you want to convey to the audience.</p>
<p>Step3 Select a foreground video</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-double-exposure-effect-in-filmora-3.jpg"
                      alt="add a base video"
                ></p>
<p>To create a trendy double exposure effect, record a video clip with a white or neutral background. Then, import the specified video to Filmora. In the second layer of the video editing pane, drag the video.</p>
<p>The first video is called the foreground video, which serves as the base video to achieve the desired double exposure effect. It is important to choose neutral or calm colors to make it easier for you to remove the background and highlight the main subject of your video.</p>
<p>Step4 Edit the foreground video</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-double-exposure-effect-in-filmora-4.jpg"
                      alt="adjust the color settings of the foreground video"
                ></p>
<p>Edit the foreground video by adjusting the color settings. Click the <strong>Color Correction</strong> icon to open the color settings. In the <strong>Advanced Color Tuning</strong> box that appears, click <strong>Adjust</strong>. In this article, the value of <strong>Exposure</strong> is set to <strong>18,</strong> and <strong>Contrast</strong> is set to <strong>28</strong>. Then, <strong>Vibrance</strong> and <strong>Saturation</strong> are set to <strong>-100</strong>. In the <strong>Light</strong> settings, the values of <strong>Highlights</strong> and <strong>Shadows</strong> are set to <strong>-100</strong>, <strong>Whites</strong> is set to <strong>0</strong>, and <strong>Blacks</strong> is set to <strong>-30</strong>. You can experiment and play with the settings based on the theme that you want to achieve.</p>
<p>Step5 Select a background video</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-make-double-exposure-effect-in-filmora-5.jpg"
                      alt="import a video clip as a background video"
                ></p>
<p>For the background video, select a video clip and import the video to Filmora. Then, drag the video in a layer below the foreground video.</p>
<p>When you select a background video, make sure that the video is vibrant, colorful, and has lots of texture. For example, you can select landscapes, flowers, leaves, textured patterns, city lights, sunsets, or other graphic components. The colors and lighting in the background video significantly impact the final output’s overall appearance.</p>
<p>Step6 Blend the foreground and background videos</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="produce double exposure effect"
                ></p>
<p>If you want to produce a perfect double-exposed video, blending layers is properly essential. To do this, double click the foreground video. Go to the <strong>Compositing</strong> option and set <strong>Blending Mode</strong> to <strong>Lighten</strong>. You can also configure <strong>Blending Mode</strong> based on your preference.</p>
<p>The steps that are outlined in this article can help you apply double exposure effects to your videos. You can modify your videos to your preferences by using all the resources that Filmora provides.</p>
<p>A simple video clip with a double-exposure effect adds a dramatic and dreamy effect to it. The creator can work with colors, exposures, and brightness to achieve a double-exposure effect. This technique provides creative results and allows the video creator to tell a story to the audience in a manner that a plain video clip cannot convey. It is useful, especially when editing personal or professional videos, such as documentaries, wedding videos, travel vlogs, and other artistic works.</p>
<p>Before, the double-exposure effect could only be achieved by using cameras and specialized photographic skills. These days, creators can use Filmora Video Editor to replicate the double-exposure effect in just a few simple steps. Filmora Video Editor is an easy-to-use tool that has helped over 85 million video creators from 150 countries around the world. Videos are compatible with iPhone, iPad, Samsung, Amazon, HTC, PSP, and many more. You can also watch quality videos in AVI, VOB, MP4, WMV, 3GP, MKV, AVI, and more.</p>

The video editor also allows creators to have more creative freedom over their videos and share their outputs on different platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram.</p>
