<p>ALTERNATIVE WAY TO ROTATE AVI VIDEO ON ADOBE PREMIERE PRO</p>
<ul>
<li>STEP 1 - Go to the effects window and search for ‘flip’</li>
<li>STEP 2 - Click on ‘Transform’. You can then decide to do a horizontal flip or a vertical flip</li>
<li>STEP 3 - All you need to do is click and drag it on to your clip and it will flip, whether horizontal or vertical</li>
<li>STEP 4 - It is easy to remedy when you click and drag the other to place on your footage, whether horizontal or vertical.</li>
</ul>
<p>TO ROTATE YOUR CLIP</p>
<ul>
<li>STEP 1 - Highlight your footage on the timeline and go to your effects controls window. Underneath ‘motion’, there is the perimeter of rotation. If you click and drag the mouse on the number, it will rotate either clockwise or counter-clockwise. Also, you can type in whatever rotation amount you want</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="rotate-av"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>STEP 2 - It’s also worth mentioning that when you rotate a clip, you’re always rotating around the inker point (the little blue cross in a circle). You can click and drag this through the program monitor to any point on the clip and start rotating it around the inker point. In fact, it doesn’t have to be on the clip; you can make the inker point up further and rotate, and will still rotate around the inker point. If you don’t see this on your program monitor, that’s because you haven’t highlighted the motion.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="rotate-av"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>STEP 3 - A good tip is using guides to help you level and horizontal or whether you are working with on-screen. To get a slant perfectly leveled, there’s an easy way to reference a straight line on your program monitor. On the bottom right of your program monitor is the button [a plus (+) button] editor. Click on it and a box full of tools will pop up which you can work with. Click ‘add show rulers’, ‘show guides’ and ‘safe margins’</li>
</ul>

                      alt="rotate-av"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>STEP 4 - In the ruler section, take your mouse, click and drag it down to the little crosses of your safe margins. The same goes for the vertical ruler; click and drag over. That will create a new guide. For your footage, what you might need to do is get your horizontal guide down to your horizon view. You can go to your rotation and rotate your footage to get straight with your guide. If you are left with black bars at the corners, take off your safe margin rulers and guides and then zoom in on your footage and take off the black bars. To do this, go back to your effect controls</li>
</ul>

</ul>

                      alt="rotate-av"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>STEP 2 - It’s also worth mentioning that when you rotate a clip, you’re always rotating around the inker point (the little blue cross in a circle). You can click and drag this through the program monitor to any point on the clip and start rotating it around the inker point. In fact, it doesn’t have to be on the clip; you can make the inker point up further and rotate, and will still rotate around the inker point. If you don’t see this on your program monitor, that’s because you haven’t highlighted the motion.</li>
</ul>

                      alt="rotate-av"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>STEP 3 - A good tip is using guides to help you level and horizontal or whether you are working with on-screen. To get a slant perfectly leveled, there’s an easy way to reference a straight line on your program monitor. On the bottom right of your program monitor is the button [a plus (+) button] editor. Click on it and a box full of tools will pop up which you can work with. Click ‘add show rulers’, ‘show guides’ and ‘safe margins’</li>
</ul>

                ></p>
<ul>
<li>STEP 4 - In the ruler section, take your mouse, click and drag it down to the little crosses of your safe margins. The same goes for the vertical ruler; click and drag over. That will create a new guide. For your footage, what you might need to do is get your horizontal guide down to your horizon view. You can go to your rotation and rotate your footage to get straight with your guide. If you are left with black bars at the corners, take off your safe margin rulers and guides and then zoom in on your footage and take off the black bars. To do this, go back to your effect controls</li>
</ul>

<p>Video editing is the process of cutting and rearranging multiple clips or segments of video to create a new and more improved video. This involves adding titles, animations, sound effects, music and more. Video editing has not ceased to follow the trend of technology as it keeps thriving tirelessly through the ages. With advancement springing forth from many sides, video editing followed every pace to ensure it’s not left behind. This largely involves gadgets, computers and smartphones.</p>
<p>Before the advent of smartphones, computers have been the only video editing tools, and that culture is preserved even till date as its use has spread round the world. It is therefore evident that film making cannot bypass this process. Improvements have been made over the years on video editing softwares for computers to stay up to date as regards features and usability. There are other video editors which were introduced, and are still being updated such as Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut, Filmora and so on. As the case is today, smartphones have proven to be relevant in the process; they have also come up with video editing applications such as Power Video Director, InShot, Filmora for Android, Kinemaster and many more for Android, iPhone and iPads.</p>
<p>This article aims at giving guides and steps on how to rotate AVI videos using different softwares on different PCs (Windows and Mac) and smartphones (Android and iPhone). This does not leave online video editing softwares behind also.</p>

<p>ALTERNATIVE WAY TO ROTATE AVI VIDEO ON ADOBE PREMIERE PRO</p>
<ul>
<li>STEP 1 - Go to the effects window and search for ‘flip’</li>
<li>STEP 2 - Click on ‘Transform’. You can then decide to do a horizontal flip or a vertical flip</li>
<li>STEP 3 - All you need to do is click and drag it on to your clip and it will flip, whether horizontal or vertical</li>
<li>STEP 4 - It is easy to remedy when you click and drag the other to place on your footage, whether horizontal or vertical.</li>
</ul>
<p>TO ROTATE YOUR CLIP</p>
<ul>
<li>STEP 1 - Highlight your footage on the timeline and go to your effects controls window. Underneath ‘motion’, there is the perimeter of rotation. If you click and drag the mouse on the number, it will rotate either clockwise or counter-clockwise. Also, you can type in whatever rotation amount you want</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="rotate-av"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>STEP 2 - It’s also worth mentioning that when you rotate a clip, you’re always rotating around the inker point (the little blue cross in a circle). You can click and drag this through the program monitor to any point on the clip and start rotating it around the inker point. In fact, it doesn’t have to be on the clip; you can make the inker point up further and rotate, and will still rotate around the inker point. If you don’t see this on your program monitor, that’s because you haven’t highlighted the motion.</li>
</ul>

                      alt="rotate-av"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>STEP 3 - A good tip is using guides to help you level and horizontal or whether you are working with on-screen. To get a slant perfectly leveled, there’s an easy way to reference a straight line on your program monitor. On the bottom right of your program monitor is the button [a plus (+) button] editor. Click on it and a box full of tools will pop up which you can work with. Click ‘add show rulers’, ‘show guides’ and ‘safe margins’</li>
</ul>

                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="rotate-av"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>STEP 4 - In the ruler section, take your mouse, click and drag it down to the little crosses of your safe margins. The same goes for the vertical ruler; click and drag over. That will create a new guide. For your footage, what you might need to do is get your horizontal guide down to your horizon view. You can go to your rotation and rotate your footage to get straight with your guide. If you are left with black bars at the corners, take off your safe margin rulers and guides and then zoom in on your footage and take off the black bars. To do this, go back to your effect controls</li>
</ul>

This involves adding titles, animations, sound effects, music and more. Video editing has not ceased to follow the trend of technology as it keeps thriving tirelessly through the ages. With advancement springing forth from many sides, video editing followed every pace to ensure it’s not left behind. This largely involves gadgets, computers and smartphones.</p>

<p>ALTERNATIVE WAY TO ROTATE AVI VIDEO ON ADOBE PREMIERE PRO</p>
<ul>
<li>STEP 1 - Go to the effects window and search for ‘flip’</li>
<li>STEP 2 - Click on ‘Transform’. You can then decide to do a horizontal flip or a vertical flip</li>
<li>STEP 3 - All you need to do is click and drag it on to your clip and it will flip, whether horizontal or vertical</li>
<li>STEP 4 - It is easy to remedy when you click and drag the other to place on your footage, whether horizontal or vertical.</li>
</ul>
<p>TO ROTATE YOUR CLIP</p>
<ul>
<li>STEP 1 - Highlight your footage on the timeline and go to your effects controls window. Underneath ‘motion’, there is the perimeter of rotation. If you click and drag the mouse on the number, it will rotate either clockwise or counter-clockwise. Also, you can type in whatever rotation amount you want</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="rotate-av"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>STEP 2 - It’s also worth mentioning that when you rotate a clip, you’re always rotating around the inker point (the little blue cross in a circle). You can click and drag this through the program monitor to any point on the clip and start rotating it around the inker point. In fact, it doesn’t have to be on the clip; you can make the inker point up further and rotate, and will still rotate around the inker point. If you don’t see this on your program monitor, that’s because you haven’t highlighted the motion.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="rotate-av"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>STEP 3 - A good tip is using guides to help you level and horizontal or whether you are working with on-screen. To get a slant perfectly leveled, there’s an easy way to reference a straight line on your program monitor. On the bottom right of your program monitor is the button [a plus (+) button] editor. Click on it and a box full of tools will pop up which you can work with. Click ‘add show rulers’, ‘show guides’ and ‘safe margins’</li>
</ul>

                      alt="rotate-av"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>STEP 4 - In the ruler section, take your mouse, click and drag it down to the little crosses of your safe margins. The same goes for the vertical ruler; click and drag over. That will create a new guide. For your footage, what you might need to do is get your horizontal guide down to your horizon view. You can go to your rotation and rotate your footage to get straight with your guide. If you are left with black bars at the corners, take off your safe margin rulers and guides and then zoom in on your footage and take off the black bars. To do this, go back to your effect controls</li>
</ul>
