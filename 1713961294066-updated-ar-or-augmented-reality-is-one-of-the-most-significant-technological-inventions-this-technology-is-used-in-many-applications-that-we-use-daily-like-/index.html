<p>Suppose you want to buy a pair of eyeglasses and don’t know which pair would suit your look. Now you might wish to look at how your face would look on different frames. Here you can use AR and see which pair of glasses would fit you using AR. AR can be used to share and receive various kinds of tacit knowledge. Augmented Reality is often synonymously used for “Computed-mediated reality” and “Mixed- Reality.”</p>
<p>Despite such an exceptional concept, many users raised questions about the privacy issues of this app. AR technology constantly needs to record the real environment, which involves real human beings. Recording their movement breaches their privacy which can cause legal trouble for the user. If the videos are recorded with consent, they will not harm anyone.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Augmented-Reality"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Augmented-Reality" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What Is Augmented Reality?"></a>Part 1 What Is Augmented Reality?</h2><p>Augmented Reality is a technology that uses the real-world environment where virtual objects reside. This process involves an experience where the real or physical world interweaves with virtually created objects. It interweaves so perfectly that the artificial seems a part of the natural. This is an artificial experience, and it adds to the real environment. AR gained popularity in the fields of entertainment and video games.</p>
<p>You might think that AR (Augmented Reality) is the same as VR (Virtual Reality). They are not the same. When someone looks through a VR, everything, including the object’s environment, is virtual or an illusion. When AR is used, the object is virtual, but the environment is real. Suppose you want to buy an item of furniture and you do not know whether it would match your home décor; here, you can use AR to see whether the furniture would fit your décor or not.</p>

Web VTT is similar to SRT but includes more styling options and editing. Web VTT works exceptionally well with media players but might not work efficiently on social media platforms.</p>
<p>Besides that, it also contains metadata making it more robust than SRT. But this is not all that is different between SRT and Web VTT. Let’s dive into the details of how both are different even though they are sometimes used interchangeably:</p>
<h3 id="What-Does-It-Look-Like"><a href="#What-Does-It-Look-Like" class="headerlink" title="What Does It Look Like"></a>What Does It Look Like</h3><p>Mostly, SRT and Web VTT files are similar, so one can easily be converted to another or edited. A Web VTT file starts with Web VTT at the top and the file’s title next to it. An SRT file does not have any of that. Then the caption sequences are separated with blank lines in Web VTT files. The SRT file is messy, with captions not separated by lines but all clustered together.</p>

<h2 id="How-to-Convert-SRT-to-VTT-Manually"><a href="#How-to-Convert-SRT-to-VTT-Manually" class="headerlink" title="How to Convert SRT to VTT Manually?"></a>How to Convert SRT to VTT Manually?</h2><p>Both SRT and Web VTT files are easily editable in Notepad or TextEdit if you are using Mac, so you can manually change both of them there when needed. SRT and Web VTT files are mostly the same, with just a few distinguishable differences.</p>
<p>By understanding those differences between them, you can easily convert an SRT file to Web VTT or a Web VTT file to SRT. Here is how you can convert an SRT to VTT manually:</p>
<p><strong>Step-by-step guidelines to Convert SRT to VTT Manually</strong></p>
<p><strong>Open in Notepad:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In order to convert SRT files into VTT manually, search the SRT file in file explorer and open it in Notepad.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Edit the File and save:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When you open the file, you will see that all the text is quite close together with no black lines to separate sequences. If the file is small, putting blank lines in between would not be too difficult. However, it can be quite a time taking process if the file is large.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="open it in notepad"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>To do it manually, you can add spaces between sequences.</li>
<li>Replace all the periods with commas. Press Crtl+H on your keyboard to open the replace toolbar and select replace all to replace all periods with commas.</li>
<li>The next step is adding WebVTT to the top of the file. You can also add a comment or title for the file right next to it.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adding webvtt"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Lastly, remove 1 from the start of each time code. For example, if the time code is “100:00:11.580,” write “00:00:11.580”.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="replace option"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Change the extension from SRT to VVT:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Now save all the changes, rename it by replacing the suffix “SRT ‘’ with “VVT .’’</li>
</ul>
<p>If you do not see the extension in the name of the file,</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the top menu in Windows Explorer</li>
<li>Go to view</li>
<li>Click on the check box for “File name extensions”</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/convert-srt-to-vtt-10.jpg"
                      alt="check file name extensions"
                ></p>
<p>Now you can easily change the extension from SRT to VVT.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="hit yes and the extension will be changed"
                ></p>
<p>The manual process is not too difficult. It can be extremely time taking to change each time code and adding blank lines in between. However, this is an easy fix when you cannot access a converter.</p>

<h2 id="Is-Web-VTT-the-Same-as-SRT-1"><a href="#Is-Web-VTT-the-Same-as-SRT-1" class="headerlink" title="Is Web VTT the Same as SRT?"></a>Is Web VTT the Same as SRT?</h2><p>While SRT is a popular text file used for captions, Web VTT is not far behind. Web VTT is similar to SRT but includes more styling options and editing. Web VTT works exceptionally well with media players but might not work efficiently on social media platforms.</p>
<p>Besides that, it also contains metadata making it more robust than SRT. But this is not all that is different between SRT and Web VTT. Let’s dive into the details of how both are different even though they are sometimes used interchangeably:</p>
<h3 id="What-Does-It-Look-Like-1"><a href="#What-Does-It-Look-Like-1" class="headerlink" title="What Does It Look Like"></a>What Does It Look Like</h3><p>Mostly, SRT and Web VTT files are similar, so one can easily be converted to another or edited. A Web VTT file starts with Web VTT at the top and the file’s title next to it. An SRT file does not have any of that. Then the caption sequences are separated with blank lines in Web VTT files. The SRT file is messy, with captions not separated by lines but all clustered together.</p>

<h3 id="Timecode-Format-1"><a href="#Timecode-Format-1" class="headerlink" title="Timecode Format"></a>Timecode Format</h3><p>The timecode format for an SRT file begins with hours:minutes: seconds. milliseconds. On the other hand, the timecode format for a Web VTT file is minutes: seconds. milliseconds. This difference in timecode is extremely important to keep in mind while manually editing SRT or Web VTT files.</p>
<h3 id="Metadata-1"><a href="#Metadata-1" class="headerlink" title="Metadata"></a>Metadata</h3><p>A web VTT file includes metadata, unlike an SRT file. This means that a web VTT file includes extra information like author, title, and additional comments.</p>
<h3 id="Basic-Text-Formats-Bold-Italic-Underline-1"><a href="#Basic-Text-Formats-Bold-Italic-Underline-1" class="headerlink" title="Basic Text Formats (Bold, Italic, Underline)"></a>Basic Text Formats (Bold, Italic, Underline)</h3><p>Web VTT is equipped with basic styling formats like bold italic and underline, which makes it more robust than SRT. Its styling formats are supported by all browsers. On the other hand, SRT files do not support any styling.</p>
<h3 id="Advanced-Styling-Fonts-1"><a href="#Advanced-Styling-Fonts-1" class="headerlink" title="Advanced Styling Fonts"></a>Advanced Styling Fonts</h3><p>Web VTT supports a more robust format that includes whistles and bells, distinguishing it from the simpler SRT format. This adds a very nice touch, especially if the text file is for a tv episode.</p>
<h3 id="Support-Changing-The-Position-Of-Subtitles-1"><a href="#Support-Changing-The-Position-Of-Subtitles-1" class="headerlink" title="Support Changing The Position Of Subtitles"></a>Support Changing The Position Of Subtitles</h3><p>Along with all its other fantastic features, Web VTT files also allow you to change the position of the subtitles easily. SRT files do not give you the liberty to do that.</p>
<h3 id="Summary-1"><a href="#Summary-1" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h3><p>So, in short, Web VTT is more user friendly offering a lot more than what a simple SRT file may offer. Apart from differences in styling, time, and text formats, Web VTT files are incredibly easier to read and edit. You can also add comments which will remain hidden from the display.</p>

<h2 id="How-to-Convert-SRT-to-VTT-Manually-1"><a href="#How-to-Convert-SRT-to-VTT-Manually-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Convert SRT to VTT Manually?"></a>How to Convert SRT to VTT Manually?</h2><p>Both SRT and Web VTT files are easily editable in Notepad or TextEdit if you are using Mac, so you can manually change both of them there when needed. SRT and Web VTT files are mostly the same, with just a few distinguishable differences.</p>
<p>By understanding those differences between them, you can easily convert an SRT file to Web VTT or a Web VTT file to SRT. Here is how you can convert an SRT to VTT manually:</p>
<p><strong>Step-by-step guidelines to Convert SRT to VTT Manually</strong></p>
<p><strong>Open in Notepad:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In order to convert SRT files into VTT manually, search the SRT file in file explorer and open it in Notepad.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Edit the File and save:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When you open the file, you will see that all the text is quite close together with no black lines to separate sequences. If the file is small, putting blank lines in between would not be too difficult. However, it can be quite a time taking process if the file is large.</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                      alt="open it in notepad"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>To do it manually, you can add spaces between sequences.</li>
<li>Replace all the periods with commas. Press Crtl+H on your keyboard to open the replace toolbar and select replace all to replace all periods with commas.</li>
<li>The next step is adding WebVTT to the top of the file. You can also add a comment or title for the file right next to it.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="adding webvtt"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Lastly, remove 1 from the start of each time code. For example, if the time code is “100:00:11.580,” write “00:00:11.580”.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="replace option"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Change the extension from SRT to VVT:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Now save all the changes, rename it by replacing the suffix “SRT ‘’ with “VVT .’’</li>
</ul>
<p>If you do not see the extension in the name of the file,</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the top menu in Windows Explorer</li>
<li>Go to view</li>
<li>Click on the check box for “File name extensions”</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="check file name extensions"
                ></p>
<p>Now you can easily change the extension from SRT to VVT.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="hit yes and the extension will be changed"
                ></p>
<p>The manual process is not too difficult. It can be extremely time taking to change each time code and adding blank lines in between. However, this is an easy fix when you cannot access a converter.</p>
