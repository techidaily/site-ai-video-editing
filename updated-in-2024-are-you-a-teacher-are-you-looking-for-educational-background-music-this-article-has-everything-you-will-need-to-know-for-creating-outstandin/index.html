Ideas for Making an Outstanding Educational Teaching Video"></a>Part 1. Ideas for Making an Outstanding Educational Teaching Video</h2><p>Creating an educational video is not enough. There are a few elements that should be kept in mind. Your content should be good enough. Another thing that needs attention is your viewers’ interest. Your educational video is of no use if it cannot sustain the audience’s interest.</p>

<h3 id="·-Digital-Storytelling"><a href="#·-Digital-Storytelling" class="headerlink" title="· Digital Storytelling"></a>· Digital Storytelling</h3><p>How can digital storytelling help in educational videos? Well, it’s simple. You need to attract and motivate students to study. For this purpose, digital storytelling is the best choice. You can merge different images and videos.</p>
<p>Add cute images from your institute. Insert videos of students working together. All these will attract the student to study.</p>
<h3 id="·-Get-Dressed"><a href="#·-Get-Dressed" class="headerlink" title="· Get Dressed"></a>· Get Dressed</h3><p>Do you think someone will listen to you with interest if you don’t have a personality? What we wear, how we present ourselves show our personality. If you want to create stunning educational videos, then work a little on yourself first.</p>
<p>Before you start recording, make sure you are well dressed. The more formally you present yourself, the more your students will be attracted.</p>
<h3 id="·-Plan-Everything"><a href="#·-Plan-Everything" class="headerlink" title="· Plan Everything"></a>· Plan Everything</h3><p>A pro tip for creating outstanding educational videos is your planning. Before properly planning everything, you should never start making a video. You need to gather everything you might need during the video. You should properly compose yourself before you start speaking and teaching.</p>
<p>You should make a mind map of how you will explain things. A storyboard for the sequence of actions should be specified well before. It helps stay on top of things.</p>
<h3 id="·-Busy-World"><a href="#·-Busy-World" class="headerlink" title="· Busy World"></a>· Busy World</h3><p>What if the video you want to watch is too long and you don’t have that much time? We are very busy in different aspects. For this purpose, it is essential to keep in mind that the educational video should be concise. The video must deliver the actual concept but in a short span of time.</p>
<h3 id="·-Audience-Hunt"><a href="#·-Audience-Hunt" class="headerlink" title="· Audience Hunt"></a>· Audience Hunt</h3><p>You should have clear knowledge regarding your audience.

If You Want to Comment on a YouTube Live Chat, You Can Follow the Guide Below</h2><p>YouTube continues to grow in popularity. On this platform, users of YouTube can view and upload videos as well as debate them live. Live chat on YouTube is described in this article.</p>
<p>Let’s start off!</p>

<h2 id="1-What-is-YouTube-live-chat"><a href="#1-What-is-YouTube-live-chat" class="headerlink" title="1. What is YouTube live chat?"></a>1. What is YouTube live chat?</h2><p>Every day, more than 30 million individuals use YouTube to upload and watch entertaining videos. Many individuals are interested in having a conversation with the video’s producer or later on discussing these films with others. You can now have live video chats on YouTube using the Google+ Hangouts On Air service because Google’s YouTube has opened up its live streaming service to all users in good standing.</p>
<p>The live chat box appears to the right of the video player as soon as the live stream starts. Both the video and the live chat’s material will be archived once the live stream stops. People can rewatch the video with live chat if necessary.</p>
<p>On YouTube, there are two different live chat views:</p>
<ul>
<li>Best chat: The messages that may hurt you are filtered out in this display.</li>
<li>Live chat: No messages are filtered in this display.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the live chat will not be available if the channel or live stream is intended for children.</p>
<h2 id="2-How-to-comment-on-YouTube-live-chat"><a href="#2-How-to-comment-on-YouTube-live-chat" class="headerlink" title="2. How to comment on YouTube live chat?"></a>2. How to comment on YouTube live chat?</h2><p>YouTube users would like to comment on the live chat when the stream starts. Here are the steps for posting a comment in the YouTube Live Chat</p>
<p>Step1Create a YouTube account and sign in using your username and email. You cannot post any messages at tall if you are not signed into your YouTube account.</p>
<p>Step2Join the live stream. Click the live stream that you want to watch after selecting it.</p>
<p>Step3Click where it says, “Live Chat” and start typing anything you want to publish in the chat box. Next, select the</p>
<p>send button.</p>
<p>Additionally, a number of YouTube viewers frequently lament their inability to comment on livestreams or the fact that their messages keep disappearing. Because certain comments are flagged as spam and filtered, this is the cause. There is no other option but to post constructive criticism. If the streamer is one you enjoy or if you don’t want to miss the author’s next live stream. Then choose “HIDE Chat” if you don’t want to see any comments at all. The procedures below can be used if you simply want to have a private conversation or reply to someone.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>You now know what YouTube live chat is and how to participate in it thanks to this post. I hope it will be beneficial to you.</p>
