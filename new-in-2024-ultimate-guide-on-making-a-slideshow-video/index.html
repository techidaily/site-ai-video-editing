<ul>
<li>First, install the Wondershare Filmora.</li>
<li>Then, launch this application on your PC or Mac</li>

<h5 id="Step2-Import-your-Photos-and-Videos"><a href="#Step2-Import-your-Photos-and-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Import your Photos and Videos"></a>Step2 Import your Photos and Videos</h5><p>Importing your videos and pictures to Filmora’s media panel is best to have them all in one folder. Therefore, when you open Wondershare Filmora, you will notice the main import window in the top left corner.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click in the center of the <strong>import</strong> window upon the import icon.</li>
<li><strong>Browse</strong> from the PC library to where your target Videos and Photos are stored.</li>
<li>Please select the required videos and photos and <strong>Open</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-2.png"
                      alt="import your videos and photos"
                ></p>
<p>Your next step will be to add the imported videos and images to the timeline.</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Add-your-Photos-and-Videos-to-the-Timeline"><a href="#Step3-Add-your-Photos-and-Videos-to-the-Timeline" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Add your Photos and Videos to the Timeline"></a>Step3 Add your Photos and Videos to the Timeline</h5><p>When you have multiple videos and photos, you can add all of them simultaneously. Or you can also add them one by one wherever you need. Follow the steps mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Right-click</strong> on the photo or video you want.</li>
<li>Keep holding the Right-click and drag it down to the timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-3.png"
                      alt="add your photos and videos to your timeline"
                ></p>
<p>Now that we have imported your photos and videos into the timeline, it is time to align and add text.</p>
<h5 id="Step4-Add-the-Title"><a href="#Step4-Add-the-Title" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Add the Title"></a>Step4 Add the Title</h5><p>To create an attractive slideshow, you will need to add a title before the start of the video. Doing so will allow you to gain more viewers and audiences.</p>
<p><strong>Add a Black Screen</strong></p>
<p>The black screen will eventually act like a canvas to give your title a good look. To add a black screen, follow the steps mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>media</strong> icon from the bar above the import window.</li>
<li>You will notice many tabs on the left-hand side under a drop-down bar.</li>
<li>Scroll below to find the <strong>sample media</strong></li>
<li>Download the black color if it is not downloaded already.</li>
<li>Click and drag it down below to the start of your video.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-4.png"
                      alt="adding a black screen"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Add a Title Tile</strong></p>
<p>Now that we have our canvas, we will now add the title. Above the import media library, there will be a <strong>Title</strong> icon.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>title</strong> icon, and select the title that you want for your video by browsing and scrolling down.</li>
<li>For this purpose, we will use a simple title tile called “<strong>Title 29</strong>.”</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can find the same title by scrolling, browsing, or searching in the search bar above the import library.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click and drag the title onto the black screen that we added.</li>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> the title to open its settings.</li>
<li>Here you can type in the text that you want.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-5.png"
                      alt="add a title"
                ></p>
<p>You can also change its font. When you click on the font bar, a drop-down option will pop up, and you choose whichever you like.</p>
<ul>
<li>Change the <strong>animation</strong> of the text title from the top left corner <strong>animation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Change The Timing of The Title</strong></p>
<p>You can also adjust the timing of the title by below steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>advanced option</strong> in the bottom right corner, and settings will pop up.</li>
<li>Find the title bar and drag it to the right side to increase the timing of the title.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-6.png"
                      alt="change the timing of the title"
                ></p>
<p>After adding the title, it’s time to go with fading effect as shown below!</p>
<h5 id="Step5-Add-a-Fade-effect"><a href="#Step5-Add-a-Fade-effect" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Add a Fade effect"></a>Step5 Add a Fade effect</h5><p>You can also add a fade transition to the start of your video. It will blend the title with the first clip. Follow the steps mentioned to add the transition effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Search the <strong>Fade</strong> option from the Transitions tab above the import window</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> A fade transition will allow your title to fade into the first clip creating a visually pleasing effect.</p>
<ul>
<li>Download the <strong>Fade</strong> transition and <strong>drag</strong> it between the Black screen and the first clip.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-7.png"
                      alt="adding a fade effect"
                ></p>
<p>Now that we have added a transition, it is time to move on to our music!</p>
<h5 id="Step6-Add-The-Music"><a href="#Step6-Add-The-Music" class="headerlink" title="Step6 Add The Music"></a>Step6 Add The Music</h5><p>You can add your music to the slideshow from your PC library, but make sure you have the music rights. It is better to use stock audio by following the steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>Audio</strong> icon on the bar above the import window, and the list will pop up.</li>
<li>Please browse the library to find music that best suits your video and download it.</li>
<li>Then add it to the timeline’s audio track.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Add Beat Detection</strong></p>
<p>To match your video clips properly with the music, so it remains in sync, you can adjust it with the beat of the music. To add beat detection, follow the steps mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right-Click on the audio that you selected in the audio library.</li>
<li>You will see a pop-up list, and in the options, you will see Beat detection.</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Beat detection</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-8.png"
                      alt="adding beat detection"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Then click on the audio and drag it below on the timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Match The Video With The Audio Markers</strong></p>
<p>To have the full advantage of beat detection, you must adjust your videos and photos to the markers. Follow the steps mentioned below to do so:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-9.png"
                      alt="matching the video with the audio"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Check that the video clips are in sync with the marker on the audio.</li>
<li>For this, drag one video end to a marker or as many videos as you want.</li>
<li>Ultimately, you will create a timeline in which your videos sync with the audio beat.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/make-slideshow-video-10.png"
                      alt="synced video with audio"
                ></p>
<p>After syncing your videos and photos to the audio, it is time to move on to the scaling and background blur.</p>
<h5 id="Step7-Scale-and-Blur-The-Background"><a href="#Step7-Scale-and-Blur-The-Background" class="headerlink" title="Step7 Scale and Blur The Background"></a>Step7 Scale and Blur The Background</h5><p>Now, some of the pictures you have added must-have black borders. It usually means that your image is shorter than the aspect ratio.</p>
<p>If you leave the picture&#x2F;photo as it is, the black borders will make it look shorter and out of proportion. As a result, it gives a generally poor look, as shown below.</p>

<p>To counter this problem, follow some easy steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> on the picture with black borders, and it will open the settings list.</li>
<li>Go into the <strong>Transform</strong> Here you can see multiple settings.</li>
<li>Increase the size of your photo to match the aspect ratio.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="scaling of the photo"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Add a Background Blur Effect</strong></p>
<p>In some cases where you have taken a portrait photo where the picture is vertical, it ultimately stays out of proportion to the aspect ratio.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Simply scaling the image to match the aspect ratio size is not sensible in this case. Doing so will hide the many pretty features of a portrait.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="photo with black borders"
                ></p>
<p>To counter this problem, you can add a blur effect. This effect will turn your background blur, matching the aspect ratio. Follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>Effects</strong> tab above the import window and search for <strong>Blur</strong>.</li>
<li>Download the blur effect that suits you best and then <strong>drag</strong> the blur effect above your photo in the timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will notice the background turn to a blur in the main play screen.</p>

<p>When you have adjusted the slideshow transitions, it is time to move on to the effects and filters.</p>

<ul>
<li>Click in the center of the <strong>import</strong> window upon the import icon.</li>
<li><strong>Browse</strong> from the PC library to where your target Videos and Photos are stored.</li>
<li>Please select the required videos and photos and <strong>Open</strong></li>

                      alt="import your videos and photos"
                ></p>
<p>Your next step will be to add the imported videos and images to the timeline.</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Add-your-Photos-and-Videos-to-the-Timeline-1"><a href="#Step3-Add-your-Photos-and-Videos-to-the-Timeline-1" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Add your Photos and Videos to the Timeline"></a>Step3 Add your Photos and Videos to the Timeline</h5><p>When you have multiple videos and photos, you can add all of them simultaneously. Or you can also add them one by one wherever you need. Follow the steps mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Right-click</strong> on the photo or video you want.</li>
<li>Keep holding the Right-click and drag it down to the timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                      alt="add your photos and videos to your timeline"
                ></p>
<p>Now that we have imported your photos and videos into the timeline, it is time to align and add text.</p>
<h5 id="Step4-Add-the-Title-1"><a href="#Step4-Add-the-Title-1" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Add the Title"></a>Step4 Add the Title</h5><p>To create an attractive slideshow, you will need to add a title before the start of the video. Doing so will allow you to gain more viewers and audiences.</p>
<p><strong>Add a Black Screen</strong></p>
<p>The black screen will eventually act like a canvas to give your title a good look. To add a black screen, follow the steps mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>media</strong> icon from the bar above the import window.</li>
<li>You will notice many tabs on the left-hand side under a drop-down bar.</li>

                      alt="adding a black screen"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Add a Title Tile</strong></p>
<p>Now that we have our canvas, we will now add the title. Above the import media library, there will be a <strong>Title</strong> icon.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>title</strong> icon, and select the title that you want for your video by browsing and scrolling down.</li>
<li>For this purpose, we will use a simple title tile called “<strong>Title 29</strong>.”</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can find the same title by scrolling, browsing, or searching in the search bar above the import library.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click and drag the title onto the black screen that we added.</li>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> the title to open its settings.</li>
<li>Here you can type in the text that you want.</li>

<p>After adding the title, it’s time to go with fading effect as shown below!</p>
<h5 id="Step5-Add-a-Fade-effect-1"><a href="#Step5-Add-a-Fade-effect-1" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Add a Fade effect"></a>Step5 Add a Fade effect</h5><p>You can also add a fade transition to the start of your video. It will blend the title with the first clip. Follow the steps mentioned to add the transition effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Search the <strong>Fade</strong> option from the Transitions tab above the import window</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> A fade transition will allow your title to fade into the first clip creating a visually pleasing effect.</p>
<ul>
<li>Download the <strong>Fade</strong> transition and <strong>drag</strong> it between the Black screen and the first clip.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="adding a fade effect"
                ></p>
<p>Now that we have added a transition, it is time to move on to our music!</p>
<h5 id="Step6-Add-The-Music-1"><a href="#Step6-Add-The-Music-1" class="headerlink" title="Step6 Add The Music"></a>Step6 Add The Music</h5><p>You can add your music to the slideshow from your PC library, but make sure you have the music rights. It is better to use stock audio by following the steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>Audio</strong> icon on the bar above the import window, and the list will pop up.</li>
<li>Please browse the library to find music that best suits your video and download it.</li>
<li>Then add it to the timeline’s audio track.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Add Beat Detection</strong></p>
<p>To match your video clips properly with the music, so it remains in sync, you can adjust it with the beat of the music. To add beat detection, follow the steps mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right-Click on the audio that you selected in the audio library.</li>
<li>You will see a pop-up list, and in the options, you will see Beat detection.</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Beat detection</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adding beat detection"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Then click on the audio and drag it below on the timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Match The Video With The Audio Markers</strong></p>
<p>To have the full advantage of beat detection, you must adjust your videos and photos to the markers. Follow the steps mentioned below to do so:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="matching the video with the audio"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Check that the video clips are in sync with the marker on the audio.</li>
<li>For this, drag one video end to a marker or as many videos as you want.</li>
<li>Ultimately, you will create a timeline in which your videos sync with the audio beat.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="synced video with audio"
                ></p>
<p>After syncing your videos and photos to the audio, it is time to move on to the scaling and background blur.</p>
<h5 id="Step7-Scale-and-Blur-The-Background-1"><a href="#Step7-Scale-and-Blur-The-Background-1" class="headerlink" title="Step7 Scale and Blur The Background"></a>Step7 Scale and Blur The Background</h5><p>Now, some of the pictures you have added must-have black borders. It usually means that your image is shorter than the aspect ratio.</p>
<p>If you leave the picture&#x2F;photo as it is, the black borders will make it look shorter and out of proportion. As a result, it gives a generally poor look, as shown below.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p>To counter this problem, follow some easy steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> on the picture with black borders, and it will open the settings list.</li>
<li>Go into the <strong>Transform</strong> Here you can see multiple settings.</li>
<li>Increase the size of your photo to match the aspect ratio.</li>
</ul>

                      alt="scaling of the photo"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Add a Background Blur Effect</strong></p>
<p>In some cases where you have taken a portrait photo where the picture is vertical, it ultimately stays out of proportion to the aspect ratio.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Simply scaling the image to match the aspect ratio size is not sensible in this case. Doing so will hide the many pretty features of a portrait.</p>

                      alt="photo with black borders"
                ></p>
<p>To counter this problem, you can add a blur effect. This effect will turn your background blur, matching the aspect ratio. Follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>Effects</strong> tab above the import window and search for <strong>Blur</strong>.</li>
<li>Download the blur effect that suits you best and then <strong>drag</strong> the blur effect above your photo in the timeline.</li>

While most of the slideshow creator programs available today are equipped with extensive varieties of inbuilt audio for visibly any presentation setting, you can also opt to choose your own music plan in case you don’t get anything specific.</p>
<p>However, you do need to take care of certain factors when deciding on your music plan, most importantly, the pricing concerns. Go for selecting a royalty free, unlimited audio license via an affordable paid subscription from recognized and leading music hubs and online audio websites.</p>
<h3 id="02Browse-the-Recommended-Audio-Choices"><a href="#02Browse-the-Recommended-Audio-Choices" class="headerlink" title="02Browse the Recommended Audio Choices"></a>02Browse the Recommended Audio Choices</h3><p>When looking through the diversity of music options available on any audio website, do not forget to pay attention to the user and website recommended playlists and music categories. These tend to have a collection of the most preferred audio choices and there are high chances of you getting your exact music piece from within these playlists.</p>
<p>You can further, refine your search within these categories by setting filters of genre and style, in case you have a clear idea of what you exactly need, thus rescuing you from the hustle of browsing through a never ending list of audio files.</p>

When selecting the music elements for your slideshow, make sure that your choices are well in accordance with the content and mood of your creation. The most important aspect here is that the music you choose to add should complement the story being depicted, while captivating the viewer’s attention.</p>
<p>Avoid choosing a random audio just because you have heard a buzz of the same on popular platforms or a peer recommendation, lest the contents and background score of your presentation may take opposite paths and disrupt the information flow, while resulting in a distracted audience. To escape the hustle, you may seek help from the diversity of stock audio websites for a keyword and category oriented music search.</p>
<p>If you are interested in adding depth to your background audio, consider using the stem files of a selected song to obtain the latter’s instrumental note recordings. This will help to add a unique layer to the song, while uplifting its mood to a different level.</p>

While most of the slideshow creator programs available today are equipped with extensive varieties of inbuilt audio for visibly any presentation setting, you can also opt to choose your own music plan in case you don’t get anything specific.</p>
<p>However, you do need to take care of certain factors when deciding on your music plan, most importantly, the pricing concerns. Go for selecting a royalty free, unlimited audio license via an affordable paid subscription from recognized and leading music hubs and online audio websites.</p>
<h3 id="02Browse-the-Recommended-Audio-Choices-1"><a href="#02Browse-the-Recommended-Audio-Choices-1" class="headerlink" title="02Browse the Recommended Audio Choices"></a>02Browse the Recommended Audio Choices</h3><p>When looking through the diversity of music options available on any audio website, do not forget to pay attention to the user and website recommended playlists and music categories. These tend to have a collection of the most preferred audio choices and there are high chances of you getting your exact music piece from within these playlists.</p>
<p>You can further, refine your search within these categories by setting filters of genre and style, in case you have a clear idea of what you exactly need, thus rescuing you from the hustle of browsing through a never ending list of audio files.</p>

When selecting the music elements for your slideshow, make sure that your choices are well in accordance with the content and mood of your creation. The most important aspect here is that the music you choose to add should complement the story being depicted, while captivating the viewer’s attention.</p>
<p>Avoid choosing a random audio just because you have heard a buzz of the same on popular platforms or a peer recommendation, lest the contents and background score of your presentation may take opposite paths and disrupt the information flow, while resulting in a distracted audience. To escape the hustle, you may seek help from the diversity of stock audio websites for a keyword and category oriented music search.</p>
<p>If you are interested in adding depth to your background audio, consider using the stem files of a selected song to obtain the latter’s instrumental note recordings. This will help to add a unique layer to the song, while uplifting its mood to a different level.</p>

All you need to do is, add each track to the presentation elements, while taking care that every inclusion matches with the content it is supposed to complement.</p>
<p>Take care to restrict your choices in line with the length of the slideshow; else you may end up stuffing the footage with too many music pieces, leading to a miscoordinated arrangement. Check if you need just a single song or a complete soundtrack.</p>

While most of the slideshow creator programs available today are equipped with extensive varieties of inbuilt audio for visibly any presentation setting, you can also opt to choose your own music plan in case you don’t get anything specific.</p>
<p>However, you do need to take care of certain factors when deciding on your music plan, most importantly, the pricing concerns. Go for selecting a royalty free, unlimited audio license via an affordable paid subscription from recognized and leading music hubs and online audio websites.</p>
<h3 id="02Browse-the-Recommended-Audio-Choices-2"><a href="#02Browse-the-Recommended-Audio-Choices-2" class="headerlink" title="02Browse the Recommended Audio Choices"></a>02Browse the Recommended Audio Choices</h3><p>When looking through the diversity of music options available on any audio website, do not forget to pay attention to the user and website recommended playlists and music categories. These tend to have a collection of the most preferred audio choices and there are high chances of you getting your exact music piece from within these playlists.</p>
<p>You can further, refine your search within these categories by setting filters of genre and style, in case you have a clear idea of what you exactly need, thus rescuing you from the hustle of browsing through a never ending list of audio files.</p>

When selecting the music elements for your slideshow, make sure that your choices are well in accordance with the content and mood of your creation. The most important aspect here is that the music you choose to add should complement the story being depicted, while captivating the viewer’s attention.</p>
<p>Avoid choosing a random audio just because you have heard a buzz of the same on popular platforms or a peer recommendation, lest the contents and background score of your presentation may take opposite paths and disrupt the information flow, while resulting in a distracted audience. To escape the hustle, you may seek help from the diversity of stock audio websites for a keyword and category oriented music search.</p>
<p>If you are interested in adding depth to your background audio, consider using the stem files of a selected song to obtain the latter’s instrumental note recordings. This will help to add a unique layer to the song, while uplifting its mood to a different level.</p>

All you need to do is, add each track to the presentation elements, while taking care that every inclusion matches with the content it is supposed to complement.</p>
<p>Take care to restrict your choices in line with the length of the slideshow; else you may end up stuffing the footage with too many music pieces, leading to a miscoordinated arrangement. Check if you need just a single song or a complete soundtrack.</p>

While most of the slideshow creator programs available today are equipped with extensive varieties of inbuilt audio for visibly any presentation setting, you can also opt to choose your own music plan in case you don’t get anything specific.</p>
<p>However, you do need to take care of certain factors when deciding on your music plan, most importantly, the pricing concerns. Go for selecting a royalty free, unlimited audio license via an affordable paid subscription from recognized and leading music hubs and online audio websites.</p>
<h3 id="02Browse-the-Recommended-Audio-Choices-3"><a href="#02Browse-the-Recommended-Audio-Choices-3" class="headerlink" title="02Browse the Recommended Audio Choices"></a>02Browse the Recommended Audio Choices</h3><p>When looking through the diversity of music options available on any audio website, do not forget to pay attention to the user and website recommended playlists and music categories. These tend to have a collection of the most preferred audio choices and there are high chances of you getting your exact music piece from within these playlists.</p>
<p>You can further, refine your search within these categories by setting filters of genre and style, in case you have a clear idea of what you exactly need, thus rescuing you from the hustle of browsing through a never ending list of audio files.</p>

When selecting the music elements for your slideshow, make sure that your choices are well in accordance with the content and mood of your creation. The most important aspect here is that the music you choose to add should complement the story being depicted, while captivating the viewer’s attention.</p>
<p>Avoid choosing a random audio just because you have heard a buzz of the same on popular platforms or a peer recommendation, lest the contents and background score of your presentation may take opposite paths and disrupt the information flow, while resulting in a distracted audience. To escape the hustle, you may seek help from the diversity of stock audio websites for a keyword and category oriented music search.</p>
<p>If you are interested in adding depth to your background audio, consider using the stem files of a selected song to obtain the latter’s instrumental note recordings. This will help to add a unique layer to the song, while uplifting its mood to a different level.</p>

All you need to do is, add each track to the presentation elements, while taking care that every inclusion matches with the content it is supposed to complement.</p>
<p>Take care to restrict your choices in line with the length of the slideshow; else you may end up stuffing the footage with too many music pieces, leading to a miscoordinated arrangement. Check if you need just a single song or a complete soundtrack.</p>
