<h2 id="What-Is-Fortnite"><a href="#What-Is-Fortnite" class="headerlink" title="What Is Fortnite?"></a>What Is Fortnite?</h2><p>Fortnite is a popular online game developed by the American game studio Epic Games. The video game was released in 2017, and it’s available in three-game mode versions with the same game engine and gameplay. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fortnite: Save the World: Set on contemporary Earth, Save the World is a co-op hybrid third-person shooter (TPS), tower defense (TD), and survival game. The game allows a maximum of four players to fight off creatures that look like zombies and defend objects with traps or fortifications they have built.</li>
<li>Fortnite Battle Royale: This is a free-to-play (F2P) battle royale video game that allows up to one hundred players to fight against each other until only one person remains.</li>
<li>Fortnite Creative: Released in 2018, Fortnite Creative allows players to create battle arenas and worlds. They can then share these predetermined structures with up to 16 other players for a range of multiplayer game modes that have customizable rules.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since its release, Fortnite has become a worldwide phenomenon, with more than 350 million people playing the game across the globe. In the first year of Fortnite’s release, players downloaded its mobile version 78 million times.</p>
<p>The game became such a global hit because it’s free to play. It’s also available on most gaming platforms and features an engaging theme. Additionally, because Battle Royale allows up to 100 gamers to fight it out until they find the last man standing, this means the replayability of this online video game is infinite. What’s more? Each game is unique.</p>
<p>Fortnite has also become popular because users can purchase DLC (downloadable content) to enhance their gaming experience.</p>

<p>Listening has always been more enjoyable, easier, and faster than reading. We understand better when we are listening. So it is good news for us that our life has been made even easier with the development of <strong>TTS</strong> technology or <strong>Text-to-Speech technology</strong>.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, <strong>TTS</strong> or <strong>Text-to-Speech</strong> is a technology that can convert texts to speech or voices. In other words, it is a technology that reads aloud any type of digital text so one can just listen to it without having to manually read those texts himself&#x2F;herself.

<p>Listening has always been more enjoyable, easier, and faster than reading. We understand better when we are listening. So it is good news for us that our life has been made even easier with the development of <strong>TTS</strong> technology or <strong>Text-to-Speech technology</strong>.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, <strong>TTS</strong> or <strong>Text-to-Speech</strong> is a technology that can convert texts to speech or voices. In other words, it is a technology that reads aloud any type of digital text so one can just listen to it without having to manually read those texts himself&#x2F;herself. Text-to-Speech is also known as <strong>speech synthesis</strong>, which means artificial human speech production.</p>
<p>Though Text-to-Speech might sound like a new technology to most people, it has been here for a long time now. It’s just that only the big companies and some authorities had access to it in the past. But now, we can easily find this technology around us. Some of the popular examples would be audiobooks, read-aloud functions on websites, voice assistants like Alexa, Siri, etc.</p>
<p>While text-to-speech service is widely used for convenience and ease of life, its importance is not just limited to that. This technology has been extremely helpful for those with visible imparities and those who cannot read or write. Not only that, but it also has a great contribution to the field of education, business, and technology itself.</p>
<p>So now that we’re a little familiar with this Text to Speech system, it’s about time we have a look at some of the best Text to Speech software or say, Text to Speech converters. In this article, we’ll be covering the <strong>Top 20 Best Text to Speech Software</strong> with their price, features, and cons along with the platforms they are available for like Windows, Mac, Android, iPhone, and Online:</p>

<p>Listening has always been more enjoyable, easier, and faster than reading. We understand better when we are listening. So it is good news for us that our life has been made even easier with the development of <strong>TTS</strong> technology or <strong>Text-to-Speech technology</strong>.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, <strong>TTS</strong> or <strong>Text-to-Speech</strong> is a technology that can convert texts to speech or voices. In other words, it is a technology that reads aloud any type of digital text so one can just listen to it without having to manually read those texts himself&#x2F;herself. Text-to-Speech is also known as <strong>speech synthesis</strong>, which means artificial human speech production.</p>
<p>Though Text-to-Speech might sound like a new technology to most people, it has been here for a long time now. It’s just that only the big companies and some authorities had access to it in the past. But now, we can easily find this technology around us. Some of the popular examples would be audiobooks, read-aloud functions on websites, voice assistants like Alexa, Siri, etc.</p>
<p>While text-to-speech service is widely used for convenience and ease of life, its importance is not just limited to that. This technology has been extremely helpful for those with visible imparities and those who cannot read or write. Not only that, but it also has a great contribution to the field of education, business, and technology itself.</p>
<p>So now that we’re a little familiar with this Text to Speech system, it’s about time we have a look at some of the best Text to Speech software or say, Text to Speech converters. In this article, we’ll be covering the <strong>Top 20 Best Text to Speech Software</strong> with their price, features, and cons along with the platforms they are available for like Windows, Mac, Android, iPhone, and Online:</p>

<p>Listening has always been more enjoyable, easier, and faster than reading. We understand better when we are listening. So it is good news for us that our life has been made even easier with the development of <strong>TTS</strong> technology or <strong>Text-to-Speech technology</strong>.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, <strong>TTS</strong> or <strong>Text-to-Speech</strong> is a technology that can convert texts to speech or voices. In other words, it is a technology that reads aloud any type of digital text so one can just listen to it without having to manually read those texts himself&#x2F;herself. Text-to-Speech is also known as <strong>speech synthesis</strong>, which means artificial human speech production.</p>
<p>Though Text-to-Speech might sound like a new technology to most people, it has been here for a long time now. It’s just that only the big companies and some authorities had access to it in the past. But now, we can easily find this technology around us. Some of the popular examples would be audiobooks, read-aloud functions on websites, voice assistants like Alexa, Siri, etc.</p>
<p>While text-to-speech service is widely used for convenience and ease of life, its importance is not just limited to that. This technology has been extremely helpful for those with visible imparities and those who cannot read or write. Not only that, but it also has a great contribution to the field of education, business, and technology itself.</p>
<p>So now that we’re a little familiar with this Text to Speech system, it’s about time we have a look at some of the best Text to Speech software or say, Text to Speech converters. In this article, we’ll be covering the <strong>Top 20 Best Text to Speech Software</strong> with their price, features, and cons along with the platforms they are available for like Windows, Mac, Android, iPhone, and Online:</p>

<p>Making and sharing animated GIFs that practically pop out on your friend’s screen can be just the magic one needs to start their day.</p>
<p>3D animated GIFs are growing in popularity and surprisingly, because of a simple trick that even you can try out.</p>
<p>What separates <strong>3D text GIFs</strong> or <strong>3D animation GIFs</strong> from your regular GIFs is that they are bit more difficult but far more fun to make.</p>
<p>3D GIFs are where it feels like the picture is coming out of your screen. Of course, this is just a visual illusion which can be recreated over any video GIF that meets specific parameters.</p>

This approach lets you create convincing 3D GIFs in an easy but deceptive way.</p>
<p>The actual magic behind this trick is the use of white lines that act as reference points separating 3 panels in the image.</p>
<p>Now, any animated elements of the GIF image will seem like they are popping out beyond the pre-set white lines and towards the viewer.</p>
<p>These white lines are used as referencing lines on the screen allowing our brains to bewilder at a passive 3D GIFs coming at us from the screen.</p>
<p>You can recreate this same affect with a few popular <strong>GIF makers</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1:</strong> Choosing an Image.</p>
<p>The first step in creating a 3D image is to carefully sort out which moment in your video you wish to convert into 3D. Pick an images or video clips that already have an element that pops out in a forward moving motion.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2:</strong> It should have a smart composition.</p>
<p>Becoming a creator means you need to know more about composition. This can be applicable to anything from making virtual designs to creating GIFs. 3D GIFs requires you to use a special Tumblr ‘frame’ that adds two breaks to the image which creates three horizontal panels. In exceptional cases, you could also use three break points and divide the image into four panels.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3:</strong> Become a content creator.</p>
<p>It’s okay to feel a bit off beat when trying out new skills but the prospects are rewarding. Try taking your own video footage, edit in Photoshop or any similar editing software. You can also opt for instant GIF creator apps that directly converts the footage or image you clicked into a GIF.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4:</strong> Making the split.</p>
<p>The next step would be splitting the image or frame into three panels as guideline for the 3D effects. In Photoshop you can import a GIF and choose ‘View’ from the navigation menu and then click on ‘New Guide’ from the drop down menu. Set the guide to 33% at first and 66% in the second.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5:</strong> Placingthe magical white lines over the guides.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1:</strong> Choosing an Image.</p>
<p>The first step in creating a 3D image is to carefully sort out which moment in your video you wish to convert into 3D. Pick an images or video clips that already have an element that pops out in a forward moving motion.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2:</strong> It should have a smart composition.</p>
<p>Becoming a creator means you need to know more about composition. This can be applicable to anything from making virtual designs to creating GIFs. 3D GIFs requires you to use a special Tumblr ‘frame’ that adds two breaks to the image which creates three horizontal panels. In exceptional cases, you could also use three break points and divide the image into four panels.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3:</strong> Become a content creator.</p>
<p>It’s okay to feel a bit off beat when trying out new skills but the prospects are rewarding. Try taking your own video footage, edit in Photoshop or any similar editing software. You can also opt for instant GIF creator apps that directly converts the footage or image you clicked into a GIF.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4:</strong> Making the split.</p>
<p>The next step would be splitting the image or frame into three panels as guideline for the 3D effects. In Photoshop you can import a GIF and choose ‘View’ from the navigation menu and then click on ‘New Guide’ from the drop down menu. Set the guide to 33% at first and 66% in the second.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1:</strong> Choosing an Image.</p>
<p>The first step in creating a 3D image is to carefully sort out which moment in your video you wish to convert into 3D. Pick an images or video clips that already have an element that pops out in a forward moving motion.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2:</strong> It should have a smart composition.</p>
<p>Becoming a creator means you need to know more about composition. This can be applicable to anything from making virtual designs to creating GIFs. 3D GIFs requires you to use a special Tumblr ‘frame’ that adds two breaks to the image which creates three horizontal panels. In exceptional cases, you could also use three break points and divide the image into four panels.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3:</strong> Become a content creator.</p>
<p>It’s okay to feel a bit off beat when trying out new skills but the prospects are rewarding. Try taking your own video footage, edit in Photoshop or any similar editing software. You can also opt for instant GIF creator apps that directly converts the footage or image you clicked into a GIF.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4:</strong> Making the split.</p>
<p>The next step would be splitting the image or frame into three panels as guideline for the 3D effects. In Photoshop you can import a GIF and choose ‘View’ from the navigation menu and then click on ‘New Guide’ from the drop down menu. Set the guide to 33% at first and 66% in the second.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5:</strong> Placingthe magical white lines over the guides.</p>
<p>From the shape menu on the sidebar, select the rectangle tool. Right click on this tool to get the shapes menu. Set ‘Fill Colour’ to white and set the weight to five pixels. Click and drag the lines over the guides.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6:</strong> For the final touch.</p>
<p>Merge these line layers and add a layer mask. The objective here is to only mask the panel where the main 3D element of the image which will be moving beyond the guides. How it is done is that you make copies of the frames where the animation goes beyond the guidelines and mask the layers where the element is over the visible layer.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7:</strong>  Enjoy your GIF.</p>
<p>Once you are done masking every frame that you have copied. Replay your GIF to see if everything is in order.</p>

<p>Making and sharing animated GIFs that practically pop out on your friend’s screen can be just the magic one needs to start their day.</p>
<p>3D animated GIFs are growing in popularity and surprisingly, because of a simple trick that even you can try out.</p>
<p>What separates <strong>3D text GIFs</strong> or <strong>3D animation GIFs</strong> from your regular GIFs is that they are bit more difficult but far more fun to make.</p>
<p>3D GIFs are where it feels like the picture is coming out of your screen. Of course, this is just a visual illusion which can be recreated over any video GIF that meets specific parameters.</p>

This approach lets you create convincing 3D GIFs in an easy but deceptive way.</p>
<p>The actual magic behind this trick is the use of white lines that act as reference points separating 3 panels in the image.</p>
<p>Now, any animated elements of the GIF image will seem like they are popping out beyond the pre-set white lines and towards the viewer.</p>
<p>These white lines are used as referencing lines on the screen allowing our brains to bewilder at a passive 3D GIFs coming at us from the screen.</p>

<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Make-3D-Gifs-in-Videos-More-Textured-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Make-3D-Gifs-in-Videos-More-Textured-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How to Make 3D Gifs in Videos More Textured"></a>Part 3 How to Make 3D Gifs in Videos More Textured</h2><p>You can use GIF makers to create loops in videos you upload but the trick to making your 3D GIF stand out is about to be explained in the following.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 1:</strong> Choosing an Image.</p>
<p>The first step in creating a 3D image is to carefully sort out which moment in your video you wish to convert into 3D. Pick an images or video clips that already have an element that pops out in a forward moving motion.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 2:</strong> It should have a smart composition.</p>
<p>Becoming a creator means you need to know more about composition. This can be applicable to anything from making virtual designs to creating GIFs. 3D GIFs requires you to use a special Tumblr ‘frame’ that adds two breaks to the image which creates three horizontal panels. In exceptional cases, you could also use three break points and divide the image into four panels.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 3:</strong> Become a content creator.</p>
<p>It’s okay to feel a bit off beat when trying out new skills but the prospects are rewarding. Try taking your own video footage, edit in Photoshop or any similar editing software. You can also opt for instant GIF creator apps that directly converts the footage or image you clicked into a GIF.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 4:</strong> Making the split.</p>
<p>The next step would be splitting the image or frame into three panels as guideline for the 3D effects. In Photoshop you can import a GIF and choose ‘View’ from the navigation menu and then click on ‘New Guide’ from the drop down menu. Set the guide to 33% at first and 66% in the second.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 5:</strong> Placingthe magical white lines over the guides.</p>
<p>From the shape menu on the sidebar, select the rectangle tool. Right click on this tool to get the shapes menu. Set ‘Fill Colour’ to white and set the weight to five pixels. Click and drag the lines over the guides.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 6:</strong> For the final touch.</p>
<p>Merge these line layers and add a layer mask. The objective here is to only mask the panel where the main 3D element of the image which will be moving beyond the guides. How it is done is that you make copies of the frames where the animation goes beyond the guidelines and mask the layers where the element is over the visible layer.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Step 7:</strong>  Enjoy your GIF.</p>
<p>Once you are done masking every frame that you have copied. Replay your GIF to see if everything is in order.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus Tip:</strong> Use <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> to easily edit your videos using amazing tools, filters and affects.
