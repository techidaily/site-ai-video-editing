Color combinations help us to make these designs more attractive. But earlier, there were some limitations in Canva regarding the color picker tool; designers had to use browser extensions like ColorZilla to match the color combinations perfectly. They faced many problems while selecting the perfect color of their choice while designing their pins, social media content, logos, online invitations, etc. They had to find the perfect color code of their choice from an external source and paste it into the Canva, which was simply very time-consuming.</p>
<p>The most-awaited color picker tool was introduced in Canva at the end of November 202This new design tool makes the design very convenient while using Canva for graphic designing. With this tool, you don’t need to spend hours searching for the right color that matches the background. Color picker helps you to find a perfect color match according to the image, logo, or anything else uploaded on Canva.</p>

<p>But before using this new <strong>color match tool</strong>, you must ensure that:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You are using the updated version of the Canva desktop app.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You have the latest version of the browsers like Chrome, Mozilla, Internet Explorer, etc.</p>

<p>With Windows Movie Maker, how do you fade out a video? Though fading out is a beneficial effect for decorating and improving the appearance of your film.</p>
<p><strong>Part 1. In Windows Movie Maker, how to fade to black</strong></p>
<p>When fading out a video on Windows, Windows Movie Maker is a robust and professional option.

As a result, advanced editors will find that the capabilities in this package fall short of their expectations. You do not need to download any additional software on Windows if you use Windows Movie Maker to apply a fade-out effect to a video.</p>
<p>Step 1: Locate the section on visual effects.</p>
<p>It is necessary first to download Windows Movie Maker from a reputable website. Then, in the upper portion of the movie maker’s interface, find the “Visual effects” tab. Go to the “Visual effects” section and click the “More” button. After then, the “Available effects” column on the left will appear. You’ve completed approximately half of the steps to fade a video out thus far.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="video-fade-to-black-"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: For video, add a fade-out effect.</strong></p>
<p>Now that you’ve found the “Available effects,” scroll the slider down until you reach the fade-out selections. To fade out a video with Windows Movie Maker, select the “Fade out” effect and click the “Add” button beneath it. To apply the fade-out effect, remember to click “Apply” afterward. So the “Fade out” effect on the video has been added.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="video-fade-to-black-"
                ></p>
<p>The third step is the wind-up procedure.</p>
<p>Finally, this movie maker allows you to preview the video to check the effects by using the “Play” button to complete the process. All stages have now been completed, and you can save the film to your folder. This software also allows you to post it on social media sites.
