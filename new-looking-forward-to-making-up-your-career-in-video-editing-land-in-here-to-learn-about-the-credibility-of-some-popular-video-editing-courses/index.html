Everyone wants to add these superpower effects to their clips. We have covered several of these tutorials, and here we are with a new one; <em>the Super&#x2F;Ninja Jump effect.</em></p>
<p>This effect is for the quick movement of a subject from one position to another. Naruto is the prime example where ninjas are made to move around by this effect. Anime creators use this ninja effect a lot.</p>
<p>This article includes tutorials on what to shoot and how to add the Super Jump effect using <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

<p>Keep the following important tips in mind while shooting clips using your phone or camera.</p>
<p><strong>● Use Wide-Angle</strong></p>
<p>Always use the wide-angle view to ensure everything is in focus with a good depth of field.</p>
<p><strong>● The Camera Should Be Steady</strong></p>
<p>Make sure that the phone or camera is on a steady surface to avoid any turbulence or frame shifting.</p>
<p><strong>● Sufficient Light</strong></p>
<p>Make sure there is sufficient light and ambiance. Once you have set your camera, these are the three shots you have to take:</p>

He should jump as high as he can, folding his legs so his body is in a ball position while in the air. The distance should be proper—not very far away.</p>

Here is a step-by-step guide for editing these shots.</p>
<h3 id="Steps-To-Edit-These-Clips"><a href="#Steps-To-Edit-These-Clips" class="headerlink" title="Steps To Edit These Clips"></a>Steps To Edit These Clips</h3><p>The tools we are going to use in this editing are masking, time ramping, speed ramping, keyframing, the Boris FX effect, and many more.</p>
<p><strong>Open Wondershare Filmora and Add Video Tracks</strong></p>
<p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
<p>Step1 Select the empty background clip (shot 3) and place it on the first video track timeline.</p>
<p>Step2 Now place the jumping clip (shot 4) on the top.</p>
<p><strong>Adding a Freeze Frame</strong></p>
<p>A freeze frame is a type of still image that is created by simply freezing the action. Most of the time, this is used in the last shot of a movie to capture a moment in time. Here are the steps to adding a free frame.</p>
<p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
<p>Step1 Move the playhead up to the point where the subject’s body appears smallest.</p>
<p>Step2 Add a freeze frame at this point by right-clicking on the playhead and selecting the speed option.</p>
<p>Step3 Make a cut at the start of the freeze frame, keep it for 8 frames and delete the rest.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Masking of the Video Clips</strong></p>
<p>Masking is a tool in editing software that allows you to hide, duplicate, show, or adjust footage by selecting a specific section of the video or using video overlays. The steps for adding the masking effect are given below:</p>
<p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
<p>Step1 Now click on the clip view to open the “settings” window.</p>
<p>Step2 Click on the “mask” section and select the circle mask and create the mask of the jumping subject.</p>
<p>Step3 Hide the first track clip so that mask can be viewed better and edited effectively.</p>
<p>Step4 Adjust the scale, position, and shape of the mask and make the edges smoother to match the object.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Boris Fx Effect</strong></p>
<p>Boris FX is a video editing and visual effects software. Filmora supports six continuum units-professional quality effects plugins from award-winning developer Boris FX.</p>
<p>To add these effects to your videos, follow the steps below:</p>
<p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
<p>Step1 Go to the “effects” window and open the Boris FX effects.</p>
<p>Step2 Select the directional blur from the bcc blur category.</p>
<p>Step3 Drag the effect to the freeze frame.</p>
<p>Step4 Now clicking on freeze frame, its settings will open.</p>
<p>Step5 Adjust the degree and angle of blur to get a perfect mask object. Turn ON the first video track.</p>
<p>Step6 Add the landing clip (shot 2) on top of the first video track after the freezing frame.</p>
<p>Step7 Find the point where the subject starts to descend toward the floor. Cut the clip here and delete the previous part.</p>
<p>Step8 Move the clip next to the freeze frame clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/super-jump-effect-6.gif"
                      alt="borax fx effect"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Keyframing</strong></p>
<p>Now we have to add animation in the freezing frame so that the masked shadow can be shown moving from the back towards the front, a speedy moving shadow. This is probably the most crucial step in editing.</p>
<p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
<p>Step1 Click on the freezing frame, and in the settings window, open “animation.”</p>
<p>Step2 Click on the customized option. Add the first keyframe at the start of the clip.</p>
<p>Step3 Now move two frames and add another keyframe with the position of the masked shadow as it is moving out of frame.</p>
<p>Step4 Now move two frames keeping the settings the same.</p>
<p>Step5 Add another keyframe at the end with your masked shadow appearing half from the top of the frame.</p>
<p>This step is a bit tricky to understand, but the most important. Once it is done, your animation will give the impression of an object moving like a flash from the back to the front of view.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="keyframing"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Speed Ramping</strong></p>
<p>Once the keyframing is done, your super jump effect is roughly ready. All you have to do now is synchronize the speed of jumping, moving shadow, and landing. Here we will use the “speed ramping” tool.</p>
<p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
<p>Step1 Click on the clip, and in the settings window, choose “speed.”</p>
<p>Step2 Click on customize and increase the speed of any frame or clip.</p>
<p>Step3 Move the play head on the frame that you intend to increase the speed of, and move the frame on the speed window to speed up that part.</p>
<p>Once you have done speed ramping on both clips, your editing is done. Now play the video and see how the clip looks and if your super jump effect is remarkable or not.</p>

<p>After Effects (AE) does not require any introduction as it is one of the most preferred video editing tools for commercial and professional purposes. However, this editing software is a bit complex for beginners. A <strong>freeze-frame</strong> is basically for holding the video on a single frame for an extended period. When it comes to clip editing, Adobe After Effects is a tool that no one can miss as it has plenty of editing tools and features that other tools do not have. In addition, AE offers a layer-based editing tool that provides the most professional way to edit videos, whereby users can add transition, multiple layers, effects, audio, etc., at the same instant.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Among many other features, one of the essential features of AE that we will talk about is a freeze-frame. Now the question is, what is freeze-frame? The freeze-frame stops or freezes stop the specific frame that users should focus on or feature. Simply, select or pick the frame required to be frozen and follow the steps to freeze the frame of their choice. This article will explain how you can <strong>frame hold in After Effects</strong> by following a few simple steps.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Freeze-frame-in-After-Effects"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Freeze-frame-in-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 How to Freeze-frame in After Effects"></a>Part 1 <strong>How to Freeze-frame in After Effects</strong></h2><p>This part explains how to <strong>hold a frame in After Effects</strong> and the working of the freeze-frame button. After Effects requires ample resources, and the layers need to be solo for the editing process to speed up. However, sometimes you may need to see other objects in the scene, and that is where the freeze-frame button will be helpful. This freeze-frame Effect temporarily freezes the selected layers while you continue editing the video and does not overload the After Effects editor. In addition, you can press the button again to remove the freeze. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use <strong>Adobe After Effects to freeze-frame</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Add Video Clip to Adobe After Effects</strong></p>
<p>First, make sure you have the AE composition open, and the video clip added. Next is to find the point where you want the video to “pause” or freeze by moving the time position indicator on the timeline.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Choose Layer for Freezing Frame</strong></p>
<p>Next, select the layer and then right-click on the layer to find Time in the menu that appears, and under Time find Freeze-frame and click it. Once done, the entire layer will get stuck on that frame.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add Multiple Layers for Effects</strong></p>
<p>Start the same way before and repeat it several times by splitting the layer, which means that After Effects will take the layer at the time position indicator and cut it into two layers. To achieve this, use the keyboard shortcut Command+Shift+D if you are using a Mac or Control+Shift+D if you are using a Windows operating system.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Zoom in</strong></p>
<p>Next, hit the plus (+) sign a few times to zoom into the timeline, move forward one frame, select the new layer, the one on top, and split the layer again using the keyboard shortcut, and now have three layers.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>What does freeze do in After Effects?</strong></p>
<p>With After Effects holding the last frame (freeze-frame), you can instantly add multiple layers, effects, transitions, audio, and other media. In addition, the <strong>freeze-frame in After Effect</strong> pauses or stops the specific frame that you want to feature or focus.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Why can’t I freeze-frame in After Effects?</strong></p>
<p>The reason you cannot <strong>freeze-frame in After Effect</strong> could be a result of the greyed-out features. With this grey-out feature, a freeze-frame cannot be created or added from a sequence, as you will be required to go back to the original clip to create a freeze-frame or any other type of Effect.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>How do you Freeze the current frame for the duration of the layer in After Effects 2020?</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> First, in the Composition or the Timeline panel, pick the layer.</p>

<p>After Effects (AE) does not require any introduction as it is one of the most preferred video editing tools for commercial and professional purposes. However, this editing software is a bit complex for beginners. A <strong>freeze-frame</strong> is basically for holding the video on a single frame for an extended period. When it comes to clip editing, Adobe After Effects is a tool that no one can miss as it has plenty of editing tools and features that other tools do not have. In addition, AE offers a layer-based editing tool that provides the most professional way to edit videos, whereby users can add transition, multiple layers, effects, audio, etc., at the same instant.</p>

<p>Among many other features, one of the essential features of AE that we will talk about is a freeze-frame. Now the question is, what is freeze-frame? The freeze-frame stops or freezes stop the specific frame that users should focus on or feature. Simply, select or pick the frame required to be frozen and follow the steps to freeze the frame of their choice. This article will explain how you can <strong>frame hold in After Effects</strong> by following a few simple steps.</p>

After Effects requires ample resources, and the layers need to be solo for the editing process to speed up. However, sometimes you may need to see other objects in the scene, and that is where the freeze-frame button will be helpful. This freeze-frame Effect temporarily freezes the selected layers while you continue editing the video and does not overload the After Effects editor. In addition, you can press the button again to remove the freeze. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use <strong>Adobe After Effects to freeze-frame</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Add Video Clip to Adobe After Effects</strong></p>
<p>First, make sure you have the AE composition open, and the video clip added. Next is to find the point where you want the video to “pause” or freeze by moving the time position indicator on the timeline.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Choose Layer for Freezing Frame</strong></p>
<p>Next, select the layer and then right-click on the layer to find Time in the menu that appears, and under Time find Freeze-frame and click it. Once done, the entire layer will get stuck on that frame.</p>

<p>After Effects (AE) does not require any introduction as it is one of the most preferred video editing tools for commercial and professional purposes. However, this editing software is a bit complex for beginners. A <strong>freeze-frame</strong> is basically for holding the video on a single frame for an extended period. When it comes to clip editing, Adobe After Effects is a tool that no one can miss as it has plenty of editing tools and features that other tools do not have. In addition, AE offers a layer-based editing tool that provides the most professional way to edit videos, whereby users can add transition, multiple layers, effects, audio, etc., at the same instant.</p>

<p>Among many other features, one of the essential features of AE that we will talk about is a freeze-frame. Now the question is, what is freeze-frame? The freeze-frame stops or freezes stop the specific frame that users should focus on or feature. Simply, select or pick the frame required to be frozen and follow the steps to freeze the frame of their choice. This article will explain how you can <strong>frame hold in After Effects</strong> by following a few simple steps.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Freeze-frame-in-After-Effects-3"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Freeze-frame-in-After-Effects-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 How to Freeze-frame in After Effects"></a>Part 1 <strong>How to Freeze-frame in After Effects</strong></h2><p>This part explains how to <strong>hold a frame in After Effects</strong> and the working of the freeze-frame button. After Effects requires ample resources, and the layers need to be solo for the editing process to speed up. However, sometimes you may need to see other objects in the scene, and that is where the freeze-frame button will be helpful. This freeze-frame Effect temporarily freezes the selected layers while you continue editing the video and does not overload the After Effects editor. In addition, you can press the button again to remove the freeze. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use <strong>Adobe After Effects to freeze-frame</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Add Video Clip to Adobe After Effects</strong></p>
<p>First, make sure you have the AE composition open, and the video clip added. Next is to find the point where you want the video to “pause” or freeze by moving the time position indicator on the timeline.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Choose Layer for Freezing Frame</strong></p>
<p>Next, select the layer and then right-click on the layer to find Time in the menu that appears, and under Time find Freeze-frame and click it. Once done, the entire layer will get stuck on that frame.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to freeze-frame in After Effect 01"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Add Multiple Layers for Effects</strong></p>
<p>Start the same way before and repeat it several times by splitting the layer, which means that After Effects will take the layer at the time position indicator and cut it into two layers. To achieve this, use the keyboard shortcut Command+Shift+D if you are using a Mac or Control+Shift+D if you are using a Windows operating system.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Zoom in</strong></p>
<p>Next, hit the plus (+) sign a few times to zoom into the timeline, move forward one frame, select the new layer, the one on top, and split the layer again using the keyboard shortcut, and now have three layers.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Finally, export and save it on your device when you are satisfied with the result.</p>
<p>Thus, you successfully used the <strong>After Effects Freeze Frame</strong> to bring cinematic effects to your video.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>What does freeze do in After Effects?</strong></p>
<p>With After Effects holding the last frame (freeze-frame), you can instantly add multiple layers, effects, transitions, audio, and other media. In addition, the <strong>freeze-frame in After Effect</strong> pauses or stops the specific frame that you want to feature or focus.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Why can’t I freeze-frame in After Effects?</strong></p>
<p>The reason you cannot <strong>freeze-frame in After Effect</strong> could be a result of the greyed-out features. With this grey-out feature, a freeze-frame cannot be created or added from a sequence, as you will be required to go back to the original clip to create a freeze-frame or any other type of Effect.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>How do you Freeze the current frame for the duration of the layer in After Effects 2020?</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> First, in the Composition or the Timeline panel, pick the layer.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Place the current-time indicator on the frame that you want to freeze.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Choose Layer &gt; Time &gt; Freeze-frame.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Compared-with-Filmora-What-Are-the-Advantages-of-Freeze-frame-After-Effects-3"><a href="#Part-3-Compared-with-Filmora-What-Are-the-Advantages-of-Freeze-frame-After-Effects-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Compared with Filmora, What Are the Advantages of Freeze-frame After Effects?"></a>Part 3 <strong>Compared with Filmora, What Are the Advantages of Freeze-frame After Effects?</strong></h2><p>A freeze-frame can be any frame from a video clip you would like to turn into an <strong>After Effects still frame</strong> or still image. Another perfect way to explain a freeze-frame called a still image is that it is like pressing the pause button on remote control, making a statue, or taking a photo.</p>
<p>Other Advantages of Freeze-frame in Adobe After Effect is that:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The images can be worked upon quickly without discussion or rehearsed and planned.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> They are instrumental as an immediate way of communicating ideas or telling a story.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> They can be valuable to represent people or objects and even abstract concepts like emotions or atmospheres.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> As there are no lines to learn, frame hold in After Effects can help shyer performers to gain confidence.</p>
<p>More so, with the Filmora Video Editor, you can freeze a frame of your video clip, and it also allows users to set the duration of the freeze automatically.</p>

<p>This GoPro for YouTubers offered excessive controls to its user base, with commands that were able to neutralize and optimize video enhancement. What a great choice!</p>

<p>This is a hugely different camera across the complete GoPro series. Fusion is known for many things, out of which the size comes out to be the main reason for its popularity. This iteration in GoPro cameras provides 5.2K video resolution quality under a pocket-sized model. Although it is quite durable compared to the other cameras in the market for vlogging, the price tag across this device is usually not much acceptable for users.</p>
<p>It is a bold choice to have Fusion as your GoPro for vlogging, which also allows adding audio across the 360-degree feature. This is sensational.</p>
