            <h2 id="Detailed-Tutorial-to-Crop-a-Video-in-KineMaster"><a href="#Detailed-Tutorial-to-Crop-a-Video-in-KineMaster" class="headerlink" title="Detailed Tutorial to Crop a Video in KineMaster"></a>Detailed Tutorial to Crop a Video in KineMaster</h2><p>“Create. Edit. Share. Transform your videos with KineMaster! Powerful tools, easy to use.” – a few words we read when we come up with the official web-site of KineMaster, a mobile video editing application.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-kinemaster-1.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-kinemaster"
                ></p>
<p>Scrolling down, we see a rich list of all the features KineMaster offers to its users, such as: Assets, Projects, Backup and Share, Blending Modes, Reverse, Chroma Key, High Resolution, Video Layers. Simply put, on KineMaster, you can download projects, add more than 2 500 effects, use powerful tools, add cinematic color, etc…</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-kinemaster-2.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-kinemaster"
                ></p>
<p>This many features make you think – how come it is possible to do all that on a mobile phone? How come Kinemaster is not only a software you can download, pay for, and use on your computer, which, on its behalf, should also be a powerful one? It would be a logical question, but remember, we are in 2022 already, so, no limits are put to the technology of today! On Google Play Store, in the description of the abovementioned app, it reads: “KineMaster makes video editing fun on your phone, tablet, or Chromebook!” – So, why not use this opportunity, to explore new ways of making our content better and as appealing as ever for our viewers?</p>
<p>Even though Kinemaster deserves a bigger article with more explanation of each tool, for now, we will only be focusing on cropping a video in this app. First off, why crop a video at all? – well, sometimes we have a wonderful footage but the aspect ratio just doesn’t work for us. It might be because we want to upload our clip on a platform needing a specific aspect ratio, or, we just need to crop and pan (which means to move around within a clip or an image) because we don’t like some things shown in the original video – we might as well need to zoom in and out, in order to get the best out of our footage. For whatever reason, when you need or just wish to crop a video, it should not be a big deal, and let’s see how KineMaster makes it a good and easy experience.</p>
<p>So, the first thing we do in almost every situation is to access the platform or an application itself! – you guessed it right, download KineMaster from Google Play Store! Once you have it on your phone, open it and enjoy the introduction of the app itself.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-kinemaster-3.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-kinemaster"
                ></p>
<p>The interesting fact you will notice is that the layout of the app is horizontal, not vertical, unlike in most cases. So, it makes you feel like you are at least close to what video editors who work on their computers represent. The interface of the app is quite enjoyable for your eyes, as it is kind of fun, as well.</p>
<p>It is needless to say that, if you are going to do a specific “operation” to the video, such as cropping, you will already have figured out which one of your footage you want to crop and pan. So, it’s wise to jump on the button which says: Create New.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-kinemaster-4.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-kinemaster"
                ></p>
<p>This will take you to the editor. Even though in the media section you will find the video you want to work on, but you might be struggling to notice a Crop button. It is because unfortunately, it’s not possible to crop your video right away in KineMaster – first, you will need to add a background, for example, a black one.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-kinemaster-5.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-kinemaster"
                ></p>
<p>Then, you will go back to the menu and find Media section again to add the video clip you want to crop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-kinemaster-6.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-kinemaster"
                ></p>
<p>After adding it to the editor, you need to tap on the video file which has appeared in the sequence – this will show you different features you can use on the right. You have to scroll down a little and Voila! – here you find Cropping. After having clicked on that, a little cropping window will appear on the screen.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-kinemaster-7.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-kinemaster"
                ></p>
<p>You can resize the clip, and in order to crop the video, turning on the mask option is needed.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="crop-video-kinemaster"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-kinemaster-9.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-kinemaster"
                ></p>
<p>After you have finished cropping and resizing it to your liking, you need to click on the icon on the top right, and it will take you to the Save and Share page.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="crop-video-kinemaster"
                ></p>
<p>There, you will choose the Resolution and Frame rate, and Save as Video.</p>

<p>So, in this article, you have learned how to crop a video using a mobile app KineMaster, as well as using a software – Wondershare Filmora X. of course, there are many other ways in which you can crop your video and make the best out of it.

<p>Scrolling down, we see a rich list of all the features KineMaster offers to its users, such as: Assets, Projects, Backup and Share, Blending Modes, Reverse, Chroma Key, High Resolution, Video Layers. Simply put, on KineMaster, you can download projects, add more than 2 500 effects, use powerful tools, add cinematic color, etc…</p>

                      alt="crop-video-kinemaster"
                ></p>
<p>This many features make you think – how come it is possible to do all that on a mobile phone? How come Kinemaster is not only a software you can download, pay for, and use on your computer, which, on its behalf, should also be a powerful one? It would be a logical question, but remember, we are in 2022 already, so, no limits are put to the technology of today! On Google Play Store, in the description of the abovementioned app, it reads: “KineMaster makes video editing fun on your phone, tablet, or Chromebook!” – So, why not use this opportunity, to explore new ways of making our content better and as appealing as ever for our viewers?</p>
<p>Even though Kinemaster deserves a bigger article with more explanation of each tool, for now, we will only be focusing on cropping a video in this app. First off, why crop a video at all? – well, sometimes we have a wonderful footage but the aspect ratio just doesn’t work for us. It might be because we want to upload our clip on a platform needing a specific aspect ratio, or, we just need to crop and pan (which means to move around within a clip or an image) because we don’t like some things shown in the original video – we might as well need to zoom in and out, in order to get the best out of our footage. For whatever reason, when you need or just wish to crop a video, it should not be a big deal, and let’s see how KineMaster makes it a good and easy experience.</p>
<p>So, the first thing we do in almost every situation is to access the platform or an application itself! – you guessed it right, download KineMaster from Google Play Store! Once you have it on your phone, open it and enjoy the introduction of the app itself.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="crop-video-kinemaster"
                ></p>
<p>The interesting fact you will notice is that the layout of the app is horizontal, not vertical, unlike in most cases. So, it makes you feel like you are at least close to what video editors who work on their computers represent. The interface of the app is quite enjoyable for your eyes, as it is kind of fun, as well.</p>
<p>It is needless to say that, if you are going to do a specific “operation” to the video, such as cropping, you will already have figured out which one of your footage you want to crop and pan. So, it’s wise to jump on the button which says: Create New.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>This will take you to the editor. Even though in the media section you will find the video you want to work on, but you might be struggling to notice a Crop button. It is because unfortunately, it’s not possible to crop your video right away in KineMaster – first, you will need to add a background, for example, a black one.</p>

                ></p>
<p>After adding it to the editor, you need to tap on the video file which has appeared in the sequence – this will show you different features you can use on the right.

<p>So, in this article, you have learned how to crop a video using a mobile app KineMaster, as well as using a software – Wondershare Filmora X. of course, there are many other ways in which you can crop your video and make the best out of it. The technology and innovation gives us the opportunity to have great results with as little work as just a few minutes. You might need to crop your video for your channel on Youtube, or for your page on social media, or an official web-page of your company; last but not least is cropping and editing your video for your own pleasure, which is also a great way to interact with the virtual world around us.</p>
<p>Scrolling down, we see a rich list of all the features KineMaster offers to its users, such as: Assets, Projects, Backup and Share, Blending Modes, Reverse, Chroma Key, High Resolution, Video Layers. Simply put, on KineMaster, you can download projects, add more than 2 500 effects, use powerful tools, add cinematic color, etc…</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-kinemaster-2.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-kinemaster"
                ></p>
<p>This many features make you think – how come it is possible to do all that on a mobile phone? How come Kinemaster is not only a software you can download, pay for, and use on your computer, which, on its behalf, should also be a powerful one? It would be a logical question, but remember, we are in 2022 already, so, no limits are put to the technology of today! On Google Play Store, in the description of the abovementioned app, it reads: “KineMaster makes video editing fun on your phone, tablet, or Chromebook!” – So, why not use this opportunity, to explore new ways of making our content better and as appealing as ever for our viewers?</p>
<p>Even though Kinemaster deserves a bigger article with more explanation of each tool, for now, we will only be focusing on cropping a video in this app. First off, why crop a video at all? – well, sometimes we have a wonderful footage but the aspect ratio just doesn’t work for us. It might be because we want to upload our clip on a platform needing a specific aspect ratio, or, we just need to crop and pan (which means to move around within a clip or an image) because we don’t like some things shown in the original video – we might as well need to zoom in and out, in order to get the best out of our footage. For whatever reason, when you need or just wish to crop a video, it should not be a big deal, and let’s see how KineMaster makes it a good and easy experience.</p>
<p>So, the first thing we do in almost every situation is to access the platform or an application itself! – you guessed it right, download KineMaster from Google Play Store! Once you have it on your phone, open it and enjoy the introduction of the app itself.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-kinemaster-3.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-kinemaster"
                ></p>
<p>The interesting fact you will notice is that the layout of the app is horizontal, not vertical, unlike in most cases. So, it makes you feel like you are at least close to what video editors who work on their computers represent. The interface of the app is quite enjoyable for your eyes, as it is kind of fun, as well.</p>
<p>It is needless to say that, if you are going to do a specific “operation” to the video, such as cropping, you will already have figured out which one of your footage you want to crop and pan. So, it’s wise to jump on the button which says: Create New.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-kinemaster-4.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-kinemaster"
                ></p>
<p>This will take you to the editor. Even though in the media section you will find the video you want to work on, but you might be struggling to notice a Crop button. It is because unfortunately, it’s not possible to crop your video right away in KineMaster – first, you will need to add a background, for example, a black one.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-kinemaster-5.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-kinemaster"
                ></p>
<p>Then, you will go back to the menu and find Media section again to add the video clip you want to crop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="crop-video-kinemaster"
                ></p>
<p>After adding it to the editor, you need to tap on the video file which has appeared in the sequence – this will show you different features you can use on the right. You have to scroll down a little and Voila! – here you find Cropping. After having clicked on that, a little cropping window will appear on the screen.</p>

                      alt="crop-video-kinemaster"
                ></p>
<p>You can resize the clip, and in order to crop the video, turning on the mask option is needed.</p>

                      alt="crop-video-kinemaster"
                ></p>
<p>After you have finished cropping and resizing it to your liking, you need to click on the icon on the top right, and it will take you to the Save and Share page.</p>

Obviously, it’ll be a treat for you!</p>
<p>Planning and preparing before the shoot is the key to making a music video successful. You can only achieve this after location scouting and emerging with the best one. And scheduling for big projects before the day is more important. Let’s directly move towards the things to consider before shooting!</p>
<h2 id="Location-scouting"><a href="#Location-scouting" class="headerlink" title="Location scouting"></a>Location scouting</h2><p>The pleasant and eye-catchy location always makes your music video trending or flopping. You should first go with your budget and then come up with location ideas. In the upcoming tip, we will use 3lau’s song “Tokyo” as an example.</p>

                ></p>
<p>If you are going with large projects, you need to consider the following requirements!</p>
<h3 id="1-Availability-of-electricity"><a href="#1-Availability-of-electricity" class="headerlink" title="1. Availability of electricity"></a>1. Availability of electricity</h3><p>You need rig lights and a large lighting setup to make your video more glow and give them aesthetic vibes. For this, make sure you choose a location where light is readily available.</p>
<h3 id="2-Separate-room"><a href="#2-Separate-room" class="headerlink" title="2. Separate room"></a>2. Separate room</h3><p>During shooting for big projects, you need room to store all gear and sensitive equipment in one place for many days.</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="3-Check-the-size"><a href="#3-Check-the-size" class="headerlink" title="3. Check the size"></a>3. Check the size</h3><p>The foremost thing in choosing the location is to check the Height and Width of the studio. They should be enough to rig the lights in the studio easily and place every required thing in a decided space.</p>
<p>For Example, while shooting a 3lau song, there is a need for a bus to come into the studio easily, but there is an issue in entering the bus due to height issues of the door. Due to this, the director changed the location at the spot to sort out this issue.</p>

<p>The weather is also a major factor when shooting a video, which you must check before the shoot days. After selecting and scouting the location, now it’s time to make a schedule which you’ll get in hand in the below lines!</p>
<h2 id="Scheduling-for-the-Music-Video"><a href="#Scheduling-for-the-Music-Video" class="headerlink" title="Scheduling for the Music Video"></a>Scheduling for the Music Video</h2><p>If you have a big project and more scenes to shoot, it’s better to make a whole plan about each and everything. You have to make a schedule of using even a single light at a specific time and space. The following are the main considerations you should take care of!</p>
<h3 id="1-Pre-Rig-Day"><a href="#1-Pre-Rig-Day" class="headerlink" title="1. Pre-Rig Day"></a>1. Pre-Rig Day</h3><p>You need to come to the setup before the filming day to check the main things like electricity, measure exact spaces, check the lightning setup, loaded everything such as the bus, crew, and gears.</p>
<p><img

<h3 id="2-A-Call-Sheet"><a href="#2-A-Call-Sheet" class="headerlink" title="2. A Call Sheet"></a>2. A Call Sheet</h3><p>A call sheet is a daily shot list given to the cast and crew to follow the timelines, and it contains the phone number of everyone, their location, and the time to arrive on set. It also includes the nearest hospital, sunset, and sun-rising timing.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When you wrap up for day 1, you have another call sheet for day 2, day 3, and so on!</p>
<h3 id="3-Do-Planning"><a href="#3-Do-Planning" class="headerlink" title="3. Do Planning"></a>3. Do Planning</h3><p>You need to work efficiently and smartly to maintain everything according to the plan. You can cut the filming into halves to have a better lighting setup and character availability. On the shot day, you must change the lighting and rigging setup as little as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
<p>On day 1 of the Tokyo song, the filming is done in two halves; the first half day goes towards filming everything in the bus, and the other half day, there is a shoot of everything outside the bus.</p>
<p>While in day 2, there is a filming of every memory. For this, there are setups of rooms and homes for making perfect shots according to the requirements of a music video.</p>

<h3 id="4-Take-No-Stress"><a href="#4-Take-No-Stress" class="headerlink" title="4. Take No Stress"></a>4. Take No Stress</h3><p>You should not blow up and take stress during shoot day because it’ll obviously cause chaos in every little scene and give a bad impression to the music video. You just should work hard and get all done.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-8"><a href="#Conclusion-8" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>After checking and following the above tips for location scouting and scheduling, you’ll obviously come up with an amazing filming setup and music video. There is no need to worry, just get the whole planning and then do all scenes one after the other patiently.</p>
<p>Filming with people is not always bulky and flopping, but if you have a cooperative team and follow all the timelines of shooting. Then you’ll rock the music video!</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> When you wrap up for day 1, you have another call sheet for day 2, day 3, and so on!</p>
<h3 id="3-Do-Planning-1"><a href="#3-Do-Planning-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Do Planning"></a>3. Do Planning</h3><p>You need to work efficiently and smartly to maintain everything according to the plan. You can cut the filming into halves to have a better lighting setup and character availability. On the shot day, you must change the lighting and rigging setup as little as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
<p>On day 1 of the Tokyo song, the filming is done in two halves; the first half day goes towards filming everything in the bus, and the other half day, there is a shoot of everything outside the bus.</p>
<p>While in day 2, there is a filming of every memory. For this, there are setups of rooms and homes for making perfect shots according to the requirements of a music video.</p>

                      alt="day 2 of filming tokyo song"
                ></p>
<h3 id="4-Take-No-Stress-1"><a href="#4-Take-No-Stress-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Take No Stress"></a>4. Take No Stress</h3><p>You should not blow up and take stress during shoot day because it’ll obviously cause chaos in every little scene and give a bad impression to the music video. You just should work hard and get all done.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion-9"><a href="#Conclusion-9" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>After checking and following the above tips for location scouting and scheduling, you’ll obviously come up with an amazing filming setup and music video. There is no need to worry, just get the whole planning and then do all scenes one after the other patiently.</p>
<p>Filming with people is not always bulky and flopping, but if you have a cooperative team and follow all the timelines of shooting. Then you’ll rock the music video!</p>
