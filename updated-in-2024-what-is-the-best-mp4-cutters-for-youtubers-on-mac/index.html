<p><strong>Steps of Decoding HDR Video to SDR with Handbrake</strong></p>
<p>Before converting your HDR video to SDR, make sure you have downloaded Handbrake on your computer.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Open</strong> the Handbrake app.</li>
<li>To import your video to Handbrake, click on <strong>File,</strong> then <strong>Source Selection.</strong> You can also drag and drop the video to scan it.

But, what do you do if you want to send the video to someone whose phone is incompatible with HDR? The video will appear too bright and washed out.</p>
<p>By converting the video to SDR, you can send them the video without burning their retinas. This method to convert HDR videos to SDR is especially for Samsung Galaxy phones. The gallery app initially used to have a built-in option to do that, but it’s not there anymore. While the original option is removed, you can still use the method below to convert an HDR video to SDR with just a few taps.</p>
<ul>
<li>To convert HDR10+ video to SDR on a Samsung Galaxy phone, you can directly proceed with it on your phone.</li>
<li>Head to and open Gallery, choose your HDR10+ video and tap three dots in the bottom right corner.</li>
<li>From the pop-up menu, select <strong>Open in Video Player.</strong></li>
<li>Once the video opens in the video player, click on another three dots in the top right corner.</li>
<li>From there, tap on the <strong>Editor</strong></li>
<li>In the editor, tap again on three dots on the bottom right and now select Size and Format.</li>
<li>From this menu, you can change the resolution of the video as well as its format. From the format drop-down, you can select SDR to convert your video to SDR.</li>
<li>Make sure you do not tap on <strong>Save;</strong> instead, click on the three dots again and tap on Save as Copy. This will leave your original HDR video untouched and save a copy for the SDR video.</li>

Viewers with HDR-compatible devices will see ‘HDR’ after every video quality option in the video settings (1080p HDR).</p>
<p>However, the videos uploaded as HDR on youtube can be viewed on HDR unsupported devices too. This happens because youtube automatically converts all HDR videos to SDR to be viewed on non-HDR devices. Here is a brief introduction to the steps of converting HDR to SDR on Youtube:</p>
<ul>
<li>Record the metadata by exporting it from an HDR-supported application like <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The metadata should be in a codec or container to be played by Youtube correctly.</li>
<li>Grade your HDR properly as Rec. 2020 with PQ or HLG. Ensure the videos are graded correctly using an HDR transfer function to retain the quality. If you are unsure about the videos graded as HDR, you should not use this method because it can distort the video.</li>
<li>rectly using an HDR transfer function to retain the quality. If you are not sure about the videos graded as HDR, you should not use this method because it can distort the video.</li>

                      alt="color grading with wondershare filmora"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Once done, upload it on Youtube. If it detects HDR metadata during the upload, Youtube automatically produces an SDR conversion for non-HDR compatible devices.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Downloading the video from HDR unsupported devices will save an SDR video.</li>

<p>This method seems easy but has greater risks involved such as distortion of video if improper HDR grading is done.</p>

Is SDR better than HDR?"></a>1. Is SDR better than HDR?</h3><p>SDR is Standard Dynamic Range, while HDR stands for High Dynamic Range. HDR is the latest technology concerning quality, clear and detailed images. HDR is perfect for videos that require high contrast, shadows, and mixed light.</p>
<p>HDR is definitely better than SDR because the “High” definition takes everything to the next level. However, SDR is frequently used as most devices are not compatible with HDR.</p>
<h3 id="2-Why-is-HDR-smaller-than-SDR"><a href="#2-Why-is-HDR-smaller-than-SDR" class="headerlink" title="2. Why is HDR smaller than SDR?"></a>2. Why is HDR smaller than SDR?</h3><p>Undoubtedly, HDR provides better image quality, colors, and clarity than SDR, but why is the file size smaller then? The answer is quite simple. HDR10 files are equipped with HVAC. HVAC is a very efficient file compressor that compresses the file while keeping its quality intact. SDR files are not compressed with SDR; hence the file size is much bigger.</p>
<h3 id="3-Why-does-HDR-look-washed-out"><a href="#3-Why-does-HDR-look-washed-out" class="headerlink" title="3. Why does HDR look washed out?"></a>3. Why does HDR look washed out?</h3><p>An HDR video might look too bright or washed out if your device is incompatible with HDR color space. Unlike the iPhone 12 or Samsung Galaxy S22, phones have a built-in HDR recording feature. However, older versions may not be able to enjoy the clarity and colors offered by an HDR recording. Hence when an HDR video is sent to someone with an older phone, it looks as if the video is washed out.</p>
<h2 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h2><p>While HDR might be a superior color space, SDR is frequently used for video clips so maximum people can enjoy the video despite what their devices are compatible with. You can easily convert an HDR video to SDR using <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or any other methods listed above.</p>
<p>An important point to note is that HDR videos converted to SDR might look a little off sometimes with darker shadows and sharpness. It might be a better idea to record in SDR rather than convert it to SDR later. However, converting is still a popular way to go with an HDR video; you will also have a beautiful high-quality video and an SDR copy.</p>

Viewers with HDR-compatible devices will see ‘HDR’ after every video quality option in the video settings (1080p HDR).</p>
<p>However, the videos uploaded as HDR on youtube can be viewed on HDR unsupported devices too. This happens because youtube automatically converts all HDR videos to SDR to be viewed on non-HDR devices. Here is a brief introduction to the steps of converting HDR to SDR on Youtube:</p>
<ul>
<li>Record the metadata by exporting it from an HDR-supported application like <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The metadata should be in a codec or container to be played by Youtube correctly.</li>
<li>Grade your HDR properly as Rec. 2020 with PQ or HLG. Ensure the videos are graded correctly using an HDR transfer function to retain the quality. If you are unsure about the videos graded as HDR, you should not use this method because it can distort the video.</li>

Is SDR better than HDR?"></a>1. Is SDR better than HDR?</h3><p>SDR is Standard Dynamic Range, while HDR stands for High Dynamic Range. HDR is the latest technology concerning quality, clear and detailed images. HDR is perfect for videos that require high contrast, shadows, and mixed light.</p>
<p>HDR is definitely better than SDR because the “High” definition takes everything to the next level. However, SDR is frequently used as most devices are not compatible with HDR.</p>
<h3 id="2-Why-is-HDR-smaller-than-SDR-1"><a href="#2-Why-is-HDR-smaller-than-SDR-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Why is HDR smaller than SDR?"></a>2. Why is HDR smaller than SDR?</h3><p>Undoubtedly, HDR provides better image quality, colors, and clarity than SDR, but why is the file size smaller then? The answer is quite simple. HDR10 files are equipped with HVAC. HVAC is a very efficient file compressor that compresses the file while keeping its quality intact. SDR files are not compressed with SDR; hence the file size is much bigger.</p>
<h3 id="3-Why-does-HDR-look-washed-out-1"><a href="#3-Why-does-HDR-look-washed-out-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Why does HDR look washed out?"></a>3. Why does HDR look washed out?</h3><p>An HDR video might look too bright or washed out if your device is incompatible with HDR color space. Unlike the iPhone 12 or Samsung Galaxy S22, phones have a built-in HDR recording feature. However, older versions may not be able to enjoy the clarity and colors offered by an HDR recording. Hence when an HDR video is sent to someone with an older phone, it looks as if the video is washed out.</p>
<h2 id="Final-Words-1"><a href="#Final-Words-1" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h2><p>While HDR might be a superior color space, SDR is frequently used for video clips so maximum people can enjoy the video despite what their devices are compatible with. You can easily convert an HDR video to SDR using <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or any other methods listed above.</p>
<p>An important point to note is that HDR videos converted to SDR might look a little off sometimes with darker shadows and sharpness. It might be a better idea to record in SDR rather than convert it to SDR later. However, converting is still a popular way to go with an HDR video; you will also have a beautiful high-quality video and an SDR copy.</p>

<li>Then on the bottom left corner of your screen, you will see a “speed” icon which is generally the second tool on the interface. Click on it and it will open the playback speed controls for you. Adjusting and dragging on the speed control, you will be able to change the playback speed of the timelapse.</li>
<li>You will need to slow down the playback speed by toggling the speed controls. Set it to a speed lower than 1X which can make it look like a normal video. When you are done, click on the tick mark to save the changes.</li>
<li>Now preview the video and make sure you are satisfied with the conversion. Then go to settings, and customize the video output settings as well as quality. When you are done with these changes, click on the “Export” option to save the video to your device or share it on any platform.</li>

<h2 id="Part-3-Time-lapse-to-Normal-Video-Online-1"><a href="#Part-3-Time-lapse-to-Normal-Video-Online-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Time-lapse to Normal Video Online"></a>Part 3. Time-lapse to Normal Video Online</h2><p>There are situations where users don’t want to go installing extra applications when it comes to executing a task. And if you happen to be such a user who wants to convert your timelapse into a beautiful video, then you can do it online for free. Veed.io is an online platform that allows users to upload and convert time-lapse to normal video online easily.</p>
<p>First, open your browser and enter “veed.io” i.e. “time-lapse to normal video converter online” in your search box. Then the first result that will be shown will be from its official website. Click on that and you will be directed to the veed.io online interface.</p>

                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-video-speed-controller.jpg"
                      alt="open video speed controller"
                ></p>
<p>The interface will have different options like “Sign Up, “Try Sample” etc. From the available options, click on “Upload Your Video”. This will allow you to edit your videos without even creating an account.</p>
<p>Then the interface will direct you to the video creation page. Here you will see a bunch of predefined templates to make videos. Click on the “Create Template” option and the interface will have a “Upload Your Media” box on the screen. Here you can click on it and select your timelapse file or drag and drop it from any source.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-project-video-speed-controller.jpg"
                      alt="add project video speed controller"
                ></p>
<p>After the video is added to the veed.io page, it will take some time to upload it to the project menu. You can add multiple files by clicking on the “Add” option available on the screen. After a short while, you will see the video preview on the screen along with a timeline of the video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/preview-video-speed-controller.jpg"
                      alt="preview video speed controller"
                ></p>
<p>Click on the timeline feature and there will be different tools from veed.io available at the bottom of the interface. Select the speedometer type icon on the screen and this will give you access to control the playback speed of timelapse.</p>
<p>You can drag the cursor from 1X to any desired speed here. Just click on the drag button and lower the speed below 1X to a desirable speed of your choice. In the preview window, check how the video is being rendered.</p>
<p>When you are satisfied with the changes and the video speed seems normal to you, go to the top right corner of the screen and click on the “Export” option. This will ask you to set your preferences for different video settings. Change them according to your requirement and then the video will be downloaded to your device.</p>
