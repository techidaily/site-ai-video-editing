<h4 id="2-Lens-Distortion-Effect"><a href="#2-Lens-Distortion-Effect" class="headerlink" title="2. Lens Distortion Effect"></a>2. Lens Distortion Effect</h4><p>This distortion effect Premiere Pro simulates the distorted lens through which people view the clip.</p>
<p>1. Go to Effects Control&gt;Distortion&gt;Lens Distortion Effect.</p>
<p>2. Choose the settings you want to use from the available options and adjust the slider.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Vertical and Horizontal Decentering control displaces the lens’ focal and makes the image bend and smear. The image will wrap in on itself at extreme settings.</li>
<li>The Curvature setting alters the curvature of the lens. You can specify a positive value to make the image convex, while the negative value makes the image concave.</li>
<li>The Vertical and Horizontal Prism FX setting created results similar to horizontal decentering and vertical, but the image does not wrap in on itself at extreme values.</li>
<li>Use the Fill Color option to specify the background color, and Fill Alpha to make your background transparent.</li>

The Magnify effect acts as a magnifying glass set over an area of an image. You can also use this effect to scale the whole image far beyond 100 percent and still maintain resolution.</p>
<p>1. To use this effect, go to Effect Control&gt;Distortion&gt;Magnify.</p>
<p>2. Next, go to the left side of the Effects Control panel and make the necessary adjustments to suit your preferences.</p>
<ul>
<li>Shape: This control specifies the magnified area shape.</li>
<li>Center: The Center control allows you to specify the center of the magnified section.</li>
<li>Magnification: This setting lets users specify the percentage of the magnification of the area they have selected, while the values represent the scale percentage.</li>
<li>Link: The Link control allows you to specify how the effect will link the Size, Feather, and Magnification amount, to enable them to decrease or increase proportionally. You will disable the Resize Layer option if you set the Link control to any of the available settings except None. Setting the Link control to any setting except None disables Resize Layer. Size &amp; Feather To Magnification allows you to specify that the edge feather and size of the magnified section decrease or increase proportionally regarding the magnification adjustment.</li>
<li>Size: This control allows you to specify the magnified area size in pixels.</li>
<li>Feather: With the Feather option, you can specify the amount of feather the effect applies to the magnified area edge. Lower values will sharpen the edge. Higher values will soften the edge while blending the edge with the layer that’s behind it.</li>
<li>Opacity: This control allows you to specify the transparency of the magnified region.</li>
<li>Scaling: Use this option to specify the kind of scaling the effect is using to magnify an image.</li>
<li>Blending Mode: Use this control to specify the blend mode the effect will use to combine the original clip with the magnified area. The None option shows transparent pixels around the magnified section.</li>
<li>Resize Layer: Selecting this option means the effect will only use the boundaries as the clip’s edge when the magnified region extends beyond the original boundaries of the clip. Deselecting the Resize Layer means that the boundaries of the clip will crop any area of your image outside the bounding box of the original clip.</li>
</ul>

<p>1. Go to Effects Control&gt;Distortion&gt;Lens Distortion Effect.</p>
<p>2. Choose the settings you want to use from the available options and adjust the slider.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Vertical and Horizontal Decentering control displaces the lens’ focal and makes the image bend and smear. The image will wrap in on itself at extreme settings.</li>
<li>The Curvature setting alters the curvature of the lens. You can specify a positive value to make the image convex, while the negative value makes the image concave.</li>
<li>The Vertical and Horizontal Prism FX setting created results similar to horizontal decentering and vertical, but the image does not wrap in on itself at extreme values.</li>
<li>Use the Fill Color option to specify the background color, and Fill Alpha to make your background transparent.</li>

The Magnify effect acts as a magnifying glass set over an area of an image. You can also use this effect to scale the whole image far beyond 100 percent and still maintain resolution.</p>
<p>1. To use this effect, go to Effect Control&gt;Distortion&gt;Magnify.</p>
<p>2. Next, go to the left side of the Effects Control panel and make the necessary adjustments to suit your preferences.</p>
<ul>
<li>Shape: This control specifies the magnified area shape.</li>
<li>Center: The Center control allows you to specify the center of the magnified section.</li>
<li>Magnification: This setting lets users specify the percentage of the magnification of the area they have selected, while the values represent the scale percentage.</li>
<li>Link: The Link control allows you to specify how the effect will link the Size, Feather, and Magnification amount, to enable them to decrease or increase proportionally. You will disable the Resize Layer option if you set the Link control to any of the available settings except None. Setting the Link control to any setting except None disables Resize Layer. Size &amp; Feather To Magnification allows you to specify that the edge feather and size of the magnified section decrease or increase proportionally regarding the magnification adjustment.</li>
<li>Size: This control allows you to specify the magnified area size in pixels.</li>
<li>Feather: With the Feather option, you can specify the amount of feather the effect applies to the magnified area edge. Lower values will sharpen the edge. Higher values will soften the edge while blending the edge with the layer that’s behind it.</li>
<li>Opacity: This control allows you to specify the transparency of the magnified region.</li>
<li>Scaling: Use this option to specify the kind of scaling the effect is using to magnify an image.</li>
<li>Blending Mode: Use this control to specify the blend mode the effect will use to combine the original clip with the magnified area. The None option shows transparent pixels around the magnified section.</li>
<li>Resize Layer: Selecting this option means the effect will only use the boundaries as the clip’s edge when the magnified region extends beyond the original boundaries of the clip. Deselecting the Resize Layer means that the boundaries of the clip will crop any area of your image outside the bounding box of the original clip.</li>

The Magnify effect acts as a magnifying glass set over an area of an image. You can also use this effect to scale the whole image far beyond 100 percent and still maintain resolution.</p>
<p>1. To use this effect, go to Effect Control&gt;Distortion&gt;Magnify.</p>
<p>2. Next, go to the left side of the Effects Control panel and make the necessary adjustments to suit your preferences.</p>
<ul>
<li>Shape: This control specifies the magnified area shape.</li>
<li>Center: The Center control allows you to specify the center of the magnified section.</li>
<li>Magnification: This setting lets users specify the percentage of the magnification of the area they have selected, while the values represent the scale percentage.</li>
<li>Link: The Link control allows you to specify how the effect will link the Size, Feather, and Magnification amount, to enable them to decrease or increase proportionally. You will disable the Resize Layer option if you set the Link control to any of the available settings except None. Setting the Link control to any setting except None disables Resize Layer. Size &amp; Feather To Magnification allows you to specify that the edge feather and size of the magnified section decrease or increase proportionally regarding the magnification adjustment.</li>
<li>Size: This control allows you to specify the magnified area size in pixels.</li>
<li>Feather: With the Feather option, you can specify the amount of feather the effect applies to the magnified area edge. Lower values will sharpen the edge. Higher values will soften the edge while blending the edge with the layer that’s behind it.</li>
<li>Opacity: This control allows you to specify the transparency of the magnified region.</li>
<li>Scaling: Use this option to specify the kind of scaling the effect is using to magnify an image.</li>
<li>Blending Mode: Use this control to specify the blend mode the effect will use to combine the original clip with the magnified area. The None option shows transparent pixels around the magnified section.</li>
<li>Resize Layer: Selecting this option means the effect will only use the boundaries as the clip’s edge when the magnified region extends beyond the original boundaries of the clip. Deselecting the Resize Layer means that the boundaries of the clip will crop any area of your image outside the bounding box of the original clip.</li>

<h4 id="3-Magnify-Effect-3"><a href="#3-Magnify-Effect-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Magnify Effect"></a>3. Magnify Effect</h4><p>This effect allows you to enlarge a selected area of your clip. The Magnify effect acts as a magnifying glass set over an area of an image. You can also use this effect to scale the whole image far beyond 100 percent and still maintain resolution.</p>
<p>1. To use this effect, go to Effect Control&gt;Distortion&gt;Magnify.</p>
<p>2. Next, go to the left side of the Effects Control panel and make the necessary adjustments to suit your preferences.</p>
<ul>
<li>Shape: This control specifies the magnified area shape.</li>
<li>Center: The Center control allows you to specify the center of the magnified section.</li>
<li>Magnification: This setting lets users specify the percentage of the magnification of the area they have selected, while the values represent the scale percentage.</li>
<li>Link: The Link control allows you to specify how the effect will link the Size, Feather, and Magnification amount, to enable them to decrease or increase proportionally. You will disable the Resize Layer option if you set the Link control to any of the available settings except None. Setting the Link control to any setting except None disables Resize Layer. Size &amp; Feather To Magnification allows you to specify that the edge feather and size of the magnified section decrease or increase proportionally regarding the magnification adjustment.</li>
<li>Size: This control allows you to specify the magnified area size in pixels.</li>
<li>Feather: With the Feather option, you can specify the amount of feather the effect applies to the magnified area edge. Lower values will sharpen the edge. Higher values will soften the edge while blending the edge with the layer that’s behind it.</li>
<li>Opacity: This control allows you to specify the transparency of the magnified region.</li>
<li>Scaling: Use this option to specify the kind of scaling the effect is using to magnify an image.</li>
<li>Blending Mode: Use this control to specify the blend mode the effect will use to combine the original clip with the magnified area. The None option shows transparent pixels around the magnified section.</li>
<li>Resize Layer: Selecting this option means the effect will only use the boundaries as the clip’s edge when the magnified region extends beyond the original boundaries of the clip. Deselecting the Resize Layer means that the boundaries of the clip will crop any area of your image outside the bounding box of the original clip.</li>
