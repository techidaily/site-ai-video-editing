For this purpose, the Audio Visualizer as a resource on <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a high-quality option. With this feature, users can typically add audio effects to their video soundtrack with AI technology, aligning the sound properly with the video.</p>
<p>It is possible to choose out of 25 different effects for audio visualization on this software for customized audio effects. You can also drag visual-based effects to the file, which the software mechanism will automatically configure with the sound cohesively.</p>
<p>While this is useful as a functionality, users naturally have concerns about how to handle the Audio Visualization effect to work on video projects and podcasts. Let’s learn the main steps for this process in this post, explained stage by stage in detail.</p>
<h2 id="Launch-the-App"><a href="#Launch-the-App" class="headerlink" title="Launch the App"></a>Launch the App</h2><p>The first step is downloading and installing the software into your device. For this, go to the official website of Wondershare Filmora 11 and click on the Free Download button at the top of the screen. Depending on your device’s operating system, i.e., macOS or Windows, the relevant software installer will download automatically into your device.</p>

                ></p>
<p>You must click on the installed APK file and double-click the Agree button for the process to continue. After you carry out the instructions that appear, the software will begin installing into your device. Wait for the software to install completely, and then the main homepage will open automatically on your screen.</p>
