To make <strong>background blur in After Effects</strong> easily, check the following steps:</p>
<p>Step1 Open Adobe After Effects and upload the video clip you want to edit. Once done, double-click the video you have added to the timeline to select the clip you want to blur.</p>
<p>Step2 Now head to the ROTO brush displayed on top and click on it. The green circle can be used to select the part you would need. In comparison, the red circle can be used to highlight the part that you don’t need. To shift between these two colors, you can press the Alt key. So, carefully use the green color to select the needed part. You can also zoom in to make selections effortlessly.</p>

                      alt="use the roto brush"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 Once you have made the selection, play the video to do the calculations. After giving some time to do calculations, copy the layer from the timeline. To blur the background in the video, search for “Gaussian Blur” in the effects tab. After applying this effect to the copied layer, increase the blur effect and wait for the calculations.</p>
