You edit and color-correct your video project only to find out that the final product is not what you expected. The contract and colors dramatically shift when viewed on a different device. In most cases, this is caused by improperly calibrated monitors, but it could also be your eyes playing tricks on you. <strong>Video scopes</strong> help in preventing this problem ensuring that the color in your video is consistent across devices. With video editing scope, you get the exact representation of the elements that make up your image, including lightness and color values. In this article, we explain what video scopes are and how you can use them in your editing projects.</p>

Introduction to Video Scopes: What are They and Why You Should Use them"></a><strong>Part 1. Introduction to Video Scopes: What are They and Why You Should Use them</strong></h2><p>When grading and color correcting your videos, it is important to accurately assess your video signal. This allows you to know whether you’re crushing the blacks in the night shot or clipping the whites in the clouds. You also get to know the exact saturation and hue your logo has. Video scopes are simply monitoring tools and measurements that are used during video editing to analyze and optimize the technical quality of video signals.</p>

<p>Video scopes are important because your monitor may not be properly calibrated. It will likely give you inaccurate results and cannot be trusted with the video editing process. Since our eyes will naturally adapt to the image, they cannot be trusted either. However, video scopes never lie and will let you know the exact status of your video. In fact, the scope of video editing is beneficial in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increased Accuracy</strong>: Color correction and grading require accurate information that cannot be guaranteed by our eyes. Video scopes are highly accurate, confirming the true color and assuring you are making the correct adjustments</li>
<li><strong>Reliability</strong>: Video scopes provide reliable verification by ensuring you are not influenced by perception or what may appear as the right color grading.</li>
<li><strong>Professional Editing</strong>: The use of scopes in video editing is professional and allows you to make precise corrections of colors.</li>
<li><strong>Matching Color Between Shots</strong>: You can easily use video scopes to match your work and access various shots.</li>
</ul>
<p>Video scopes are indeed useful in video editing. They give you the extra reassurance that your color grading and correction are accurate and representative of what you want. While they may sound intimidating for beginners, video scopes are a useful addition to video editing once you learn how to interpret them.</p>

Essential Video Scopes for Beginners: A List of the Most Common Ones"></a><strong>Part 2. Essential Video Scopes for Beginners: A List of the Most Common Ones</strong></h2><p>Scope in video editing can be a lifesaver, especially when you know what you are doing. Some are readily available for adjustment while recording, but the post-production ones are equally important. They ensure you are making the right adjustments without being interfered with by the appearance of your monitor. The scope of video editing ensures that our video will look the same across all devices. Here are the most commonly used video scopes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#scope1">Waveform Scopes</a></li>
<li><a href="#scope2">Histogram</a></li>
<li><a href="#scope3">RGB Parade</a></li>
<li><a href="#scope4">Vector Scopes</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-Waveform-Scopes"><a href="#1-Waveform-Scopes" class="headerlink" title="1. Waveform Scopes"></a><strong>1. Waveform Scopes</strong></h3><p>Waveform video scope allows you to see how dark or light your image is. In other words, the waveform represents the luminance distribution across your image, allowing you to easily identify the bright and dark elements of your image. The lightness of the picture of the image is represented as a waveform. The rule of thumb is that black is 0 while white is 100 when you are editing HD. Levels below 0 at the bottom of the scope and those above 100 near the top of the scope will be clipped. So, you have to keep your levels within the 0-100 range, which is also the true Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) video. With Ultra-HD standard, the whites can go up to 10,000, which is the High Dynamic Range.</p>

<h3 id="2-Histogram"><a href="#2-Histogram" class="headerlink" title="2. Histogram"></a><strong>2. Histogram</strong></h3><p>The histogram video scope allows you to see the tonal value of your clip. Most people associate histograms with still photography, but it is also useful for video work. Specifically, the histogram represents the highlights, shadows, and midtones of your image. For a standard 8-bit image, pure white has a value of 255 while dark black has a value of 0. The histogram gives you the distribution of colored pixels in every value of lightness or darkness. Although other video scopes like the waveform and vectorscope will do much of the work, a histogram is still a useful measure in video editing.</p>

<h3 id="3-RGB-Parade"><a href="#3-RGB-Parade" class="headerlink" title="3. RGB Parade"></a><strong>3. RGB Parade</strong></h3><p>This is one of the most common post-production video scopes. The RGB parade allows you to see all three colors in one scope. It shows the waveform of the three colors side by side, and not on top of each other. This way, the RGB parade measures the saturation of the colors red, green, and blue in an image. It becomes clear which colors are more saturated compared to others in different areas of the image. To achieve a well-balanced image, keep each color within the lower and upper limits of the video scope. This ensures that the colors are not under or over-saturated.</p>

<h3 id="4-Vector-Scopes"><a href="#4-Vector-Scopes" class="headerlink" title="4. Vector Scopes"></a><strong>4. Vector Scopes</strong></h3><p>This is another common visual post-production scope. It measures the color and color saturation of your image or video on a six-point color wheel. When working with vector scopes, you have two options to choose from: YUV and HLS vector scopes. The YUV vector scopes display the saturation and hue of the colors in the image on the circular graph. The colors in the graph include red, blue, magenta, yellow, and cyan-green. Color becomes more saturated the further it is from the center. On the other hand, the HLS vector scopes show saturation and hue, but in a more detailed picture of the number of pixels that fall into each area of the video scope.</p>

Introduction to Video Scopes: What are They and Why You Should Use them"></a><strong>Part 1. Introduction to Video Scopes: What are They and Why You Should Use them</strong></h2><p>When grading and color correcting your videos, it is important to accurately assess your video signal. This allows you to know whether you’re crushing the blacks in the night shot or clipping the whites in the clouds. You also get to know the exact saturation and hue your logo has. Video scopes are simply monitoring tools and measurements that are used during video editing to analyze and optimize the technical quality of video signals.</p>

<p>Video scopes are important because your monitor may not be properly calibrated. It will likely give you inaccurate results and cannot be trusted with the video editing process. Since our eyes will naturally adapt to the image, they cannot be trusted either. However, video scopes never lie and will let you know the exact status of your video. In fact, the scope of video editing is beneficial in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Increased Accuracy</strong>: Color correction and grading require accurate information that cannot be guaranteed by our eyes. Video scopes are highly accurate, confirming the true color and assuring you are making the correct adjustments</li>
<li><strong>Reliability</strong>: Video scopes provide reliable verification by ensuring you are not influenced by perception or what may appear as the right color grading.</li>
<li><strong>Professional Editing</strong>: The use of scopes in video editing is professional and allows you to make precise corrections of colors.</li>
<li><strong>Matching Color Between Shots</strong>: You can easily use video scopes to match your work and access various shots.</li>
</ul>
<p>Video scopes are indeed useful in video editing. They give you the extra reassurance that your color grading and correction are accurate and representative of what you want. While they may sound intimidating for beginners, video scopes are a useful addition to video editing once you learn how to interpret them.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Essential-Video-Scopes-for-Beginners-A-List-of-the-Most-Common-Ones-1"><a href="#Part-2-Essential-Video-Scopes-for-Beginners-A-List-of-the-Most-Common-Ones-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Essential Video Scopes for Beginners: A List of the Most Common Ones"></a><strong>Part 2. Essential Video Scopes for Beginners: A List of the Most Common Ones</strong></h2><p>Scope in video editing can be a lifesaver, especially when you know what you are doing. Some are readily available for adjustment while recording, but the post-production ones are equally important. They ensure you are making the right adjustments without being interfered with by the appearance of your monitor. The scope of video editing ensures that our video will look the same across all devices. Here are the most commonly used video scopes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#scope1">Waveform Scopes</a></li>
<li><a href="#scope2">Histogram</a></li>
<li><a href="#scope3">RGB Parade</a></li>
<li><a href="#scope4">Vector Scopes</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-Waveform-Scopes-1"><a href="#1-Waveform-Scopes-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Waveform Scopes"></a><strong>1. Waveform Scopes</strong></h3><p>Waveform video scope allows you to see how dark or light your image is. In other words, the waveform represents the luminance distribution across your image, allowing you to easily identify the bright and dark elements of your image. The lightness of the picture of the image is represented as a waveform. The rule of thumb is that black is 0 while white is 100 when you are editing HD. Levels below 0 at the bottom of the scope and those above 100 near the top of the scope will be clipped. So, you have to keep your levels within the 0-100 range, which is also the true Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) video. With Ultra-HD standard, the whites can go up to 10,000, which is the High Dynamic Range.</p>

<h3 id="2-Histogram-1"><a href="#2-Histogram-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Histogram"></a><strong>2. Histogram</strong></h3><p>The histogram video scope allows you to see the tonal value of your clip. Most people associate histograms with still photography, but it is also useful for video work. Specifically, the histogram represents the highlights, shadows, and midtones of your image. For a standard 8-bit image, pure white has a value of 255 while dark black has a value of 0. The histogram gives you the distribution of colored pixels in every value of lightness or darkness. Although other video scopes like the waveform and vectorscope will do much of the work, a histogram is still a useful measure in video editing.</p>

<h3 id="3-RGB-Parade-1"><a href="#3-RGB-Parade-1" class="headerlink" title="3. RGB Parade"></a><strong>3. RGB Parade</strong></h3><p>This is one of the most common post-production video scopes. The RGB parade allows you to see all three colors in one scope. It shows the waveform of the three colors side by side, and not on top of each other. This way, the RGB parade measures the saturation of the colors red, green, and blue in an image. It becomes clear which colors are more saturated compared to others in different areas of the image. To achieve a well-balanced image, keep each color within the lower and upper limits of the video scope. This ensures that the colors are not under or over-saturated.</p>

<h3 id="4-Vector-Scopes-1"><a href="#4-Vector-Scopes-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Vector Scopes"></a><strong>4. Vector Scopes</strong></h3><p>This is another common visual post-production scope. It measures the color and color saturation of your image or video on a six-point color wheel. When working with vector scopes, you have two options to choose from: YUV and HLS vector scopes. The YUV vector scopes display the saturation and hue of the colors in the image on the circular graph. The colors in the graph include red, blue, magenta, yellow, and cyan-green. Color becomes more saturated the further it is from the center. On the other hand, the HLS vector scopes show saturation and hue, but in a more detailed picture of the number of pixels that fall into each area of the video scope.</p>

<p>What is a Lower Third</p>
<p>A lower third is text and&#x2F;or a graphical element put on top of your video for the purpose of sharing information with your audience.</p>
<p>A lower third provides important information but is done without distracting from the actual video content.</p>
<p>Take a look at the shot below. The lower third is used to convey the speaker’s name and profession. This is a type of lower third often used in documentary films and newscasts.</p>
<h2 id="2-Why-Add-A-Lower-Third"><a href="#2-Why-Add-A-Lower-Third" class="headerlink" title="2. Why Add A Lower Third"></a>2. Why Add A Lower Third</h2><p>So the next question a new filmmaker might ask is, “Why add a lower third?”</p>
<p>Funnily enough, despite its name, a lower third does not have to be in the lower third of the video but can be found in other areas of the screen.</p>
<p>In the shot below, the viewer automatically knows he is looking at the rooftops of Alfama, a neighborhood in Lisbon, without someone having to say it - no distractions from the video content.</p>

<p>Why Add A Lower Third</p>
<p>Lower thirds can also create movement. Many lower thirds come gliding onto the screen and add visual interest to a plain shot.</p>
<p>As simple as it may sound, seeing an overlay on a screen or a moving lower third adds professionalism to even the simplest videos. It gives the audience a sense of polish and high perceived value.</p>

<p><strong>Tips:</strong> A lower third lasts approximately 3-6 seconds and is placed in the “title safe area” of your video. A quick explanation of the “title safe area” is that if the video is cropped to fit certain resolutions, your lower third will still appear without the fear of it being cropped out and losing pertinent information for the audience.</p>
<h2 id="3-6-Quick-Tips-to-Add-A-Lower-Third"><a href="#3-6-Quick-Tips-to-Add-A-Lower-Third" class="headerlink" title="3. 6 Quick Tips to Add A Lower Third"></a>3. 6 Quick Tips to Add A Lower Third</h2><p>As simple as putting in a lower third sounds, here are 6 quick tips to ensure a lower third is effective and conveys the right message.</p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> comes equipped with pre-built video-based lower thirds in a ton of unique styles and colors. The cool thing is that you can customize the text easily and quickly, including changing the text color and font style – so you can match your style perfectly.</p>
<p>Tip #1</p>
<h6 id="Use-Readable-Font"><a href="#Use-Readable-Font" class="headerlink" title="Use Readable Font"></a>Use Readable Font</h6><p>Part of communicating information without distraction is to make sure the font used in the lower third is readable. A lower third only graces the screen for 3-6 seconds, so you want it to be short and easy to read at a glance.</p>
<p>Tip #2</p>
<h6 id="Don’t-Make-It-Too-Long"><a href="#Don’t-Make-It-Too-Long" class="headerlink" title="Don’t Make It Too Long"></a>Don’t Make It Too Long</h6><p>There is a limited amount of space to use. If you need to communicate more information, consider using a title slide instead which will give you more space to communicate your ideas. Less is more when it comes to lower thirds.</p>
<p>Tip #3</p>
<h6 id="Use-Branding"><a href="#Use-Branding" class="headerlink" title="Use Branding"></a>Use Branding</h6><p>A lower third is another way to have people remember and recognize your brand. If you have your own branding colors and logo, use it in your lower third.</p>
<p>Tip #4</p>
<h6 id="Use-Templates"><a href="#Use-Templates" class="headerlink" title="Use Templates"></a>Use Templates</h6><p>Pick one style and stick with it. Consistency in video editing helps communicate trust to your audience. It’s fun to use different styles sometimes, but it can be disjointed. With Filmora you can add elements like lower thirds and title to your favorites – so they are easy to use on your different video projects.</p>
<p>Tip #5</p>
<h6 id="Keep-It-Simple"><a href="#Keep-It-Simple" class="headerlink" title="Keep It Simple"></a>Keep It Simple</h6><p>Remember the purpose of your lower third - to convey information without being distracting. Don’t use a lot of text. Brevity is the key. Usually, lower thirds are used to detail a name, profession or a location. The most you want is 2 lines of text. Sometimes you may want to use just one line.</p>
<p>Tip #6</p>
<h6 id="Emphasize-With-Your-Lower-Third"><a href="#Emphasize-With-Your-Lower-Third" class="headerlink" title="Emphasize With Your Lower Third"></a>Emphasize With Your Lower Third</h6><p>Often, I might use a lower third to emphasize a certain point, or to use different wording (than I used in my video) if I think it makes the point clearer. This can be helpful if you make a small mistake in your original video and it makes more sense than adding b-roll over the video.</p>

<p>Why Add A Lower Third</p>
<p>Lower thirds can also create movement. Many lower thirds come gliding onto the screen and add visual interest to a plain shot.</p>
<p>As simple as it may sound, seeing an overlay on a screen or a moving lower third adds professionalism to even the simplest videos. It gives the audience a sense of polish and high perceived value.</p>

<p><strong>Tips:</strong> A lower third lasts approximately 3-6 seconds and is placed in the “title safe area” of your video. A quick explanation of the “title safe area” is that if the video is cropped to fit certain resolutions, your lower third will still appear without the fear of it being cropped out and losing pertinent information for the audience.</p>

<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> comes equipped with pre-built video-based lower thirds in a ton of unique styles and colors. The cool thing is that you can customize the text easily and quickly, including changing the text color and font style – so you can match your style perfectly.</p>
<p>Tip #1</p>
<h6 id="Use-Readable-Font-1"><a href="#Use-Readable-Font-1" class="headerlink" title="Use Readable Font"></a>Use Readable Font</h6><p>Part of communicating information without distraction is to make sure the font used in the lower third is readable. A lower third only graces the screen for 3-6 seconds, so you want it to be short and easy to read at a glance.</p>
<p>Tip #2</p>
<h6 id="Don’t-Make-It-Too-Long-1"><a href="#Don’t-Make-It-Too-Long-1" class="headerlink" title="Don’t Make It Too Long"></a>Don’t Make It Too Long</h6><p>There is a limited amount of space to use. If you need to communicate more information, consider using a title slide instead which will give you more space to communicate your ideas. Less is more when it comes to lower thirds.</p>
<p>Tip #3</p>
<h6 id="Use-Branding-1"><a href="#Use-Branding-1" class="headerlink" title="Use Branding"></a>Use Branding</h6><p>A lower third is another way to have people remember and recognize your brand. If you have your own branding colors and logo, use it in your lower third.</p>
<p>Tip #4</p>
<h6 id="Use-Templates-1"><a href="#Use-Templates-1" class="headerlink" title="Use Templates"></a>Use Templates</h6><p>Pick one style and stick with it. Consistency in video editing helps communicate trust to your audience. It’s fun to use different styles sometimes, but it can be disjointed. With Filmora you can add elements like lower thirds and title to your favorites – so they are easy to use on your different video projects.</p>
<p>Tip #5</p>
<h6 id="Keep-It-Simple-1"><a href="#Keep-It-Simple-1" class="headerlink" title="Keep It Simple"></a>Keep It Simple</h6><p>Remember the purpose of your lower third - to convey information without being distracting. Don’t use a lot of text. Brevity is the key. Usually, lower thirds are used to detail a name, profession or a location. The most you want is 2 lines of text. Sometimes you may want to use just one line.</p>
<p>Tip #6</p>
<h6 id="Emphasize-With-Your-Lower-Third-1"><a href="#Emphasize-With-Your-Lower-Third-1" class="headerlink" title="Emphasize With Your Lower Third"></a>Emphasize With Your Lower Third</h6><p>Often, I might use a lower third to emphasize a certain point, or to use different wording (than I used in my video) if I think it makes the point clearer. This can be helpful if you make a small mistake in your original video and it makes more sense than adding b-roll over the video.</p>

<ul>
<li>You have to start by importing your video in the import library.</li>
<li>From the import library, you can click on the video and drag it down below to the timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Adding video to the timelines will allow you to create a workspace to edit your video.</p>
<p>Now let’s move on to how we will add the text tile to our video.</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Add-the-Text-Tile"><a href="#Step3-Add-the-Text-Tile" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Add the Text Tile"></a>Step3 Add the Text Tile</h5><p>It is time to add the text tile you will animate behind the object. To do that, follow the steps mentioned as such.:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the <strong>Titles</strong> icon on the bar above the import library.</li>
<li>A drop-down option will be available on the left side.</li>
<li>Scroll down to the <strong>Plain text</strong>.</li>
<li>Here, you can see many text tiles to add to your video.</li>
<li>You can choose anyone you like.</li>
<li>The most commonly used tile is the <strong>Basic 6</strong>.</li>
<li>When you add the text tile to the timeline, you must ensure that the text is of equal length to the video.</li>
<li>To do that, drag the right corner of the text tile and drag it to the right to match the length of the video.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<h5 id="Step4-Edit-the-Text-Tile"><a href="#Step4-Edit-the-Text-Tile" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Edit the Text Tile"></a>Step4 Edit the Text Tile</h5><p>After you have added the text tile you desire, you need to type in the text. For this article, we will keep it simple. We will be typing a simple statement such as “<strong>Hello, World.</strong>“</p>
<ul>
<li>Double-click the Text tile to open the settings menu.</li>
<li>After the settings menu is opened, type in the text box on the import window.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will notice changes on the main window that your text has changed.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<ul>
<li>After the text appears, you can make the font look as desired.</li>
<li>Look above the text window, and you will see the type of text font selected.</li>
<li>Click on the drop-down option and choose whatever you like.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s move on to animate the text tile.</p>
<h5 id="Step5-Animate-the-text-tile"><a href="#Step5-Animate-the-text-tile" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Animate the text tile"></a>Step5 Animate the text tile</h5><p>After adding text, it is time to animate it. This animation will decide how your text will appear behind the target object.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, you must open the text settings by <strong>double-clicking</strong> on the text tile in the timeline.</li>
<li>In the settings opened in the import window, you will have to click on the animation tab in the upper left corner, aside from the <strong>Preset</strong></li>
<li>Now scroll down to where you will see the <strong>Right Roll</strong></li>
<li>Click on <strong>Right Roll</strong> and then click on the <strong>OK</strong> in the bottom right corner of the import window.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-6.png"

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You may notice now that the text appears in front of our object. Don’t worry now! We are getting there. With a few simple steps, we will see the results.</p>
<p>Now let us move on to the more significant part of the editing, masking the object. Again, look ahead to see how you can mask the object!</p>
<h5 id="Step6-Mask-the-Object"><a href="#Step6-Mask-the-Object" class="headerlink" title="Step6 Mask the Object"></a>Step6 Mask the Object</h5><p>To mask our object, we will need to be technical. We will begin by adding the same footage of the static object on our timeline. Follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drag and drop the static object footage above the timeline text. Make sure the text stays in the middle of the sandwich.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add the main video above the text tile"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>We will hide the video in the first track to simplify things. In addition, this will make our editing easier.</li>
<li>We will have to look in the effects library to insert the masking effect.</li>
<li>You can see the <strong>Effects</strong> icon on the bar at the top.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Effects</strong>.</li>
<li>You will see the search bar at the top of the import window.</li>
<li>In the search bar, type in Image mask.</li>
<li>Drag the <strong>Image mask</strong> effect on the video above the text tile.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now the masking effect has been added. But we would have to adjust so that it stays upon our object.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> on the video and the settings option will open up.</li>
<li>Go into the <strong>Effects</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You must select your target object’s mask shape exactly as its shape.</p>
<ul>
<li>We have to mask out a building, so that we will need a vertical rectangle.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>After you have selected the shape of your object, we will need to convert it to the object’s size so that it only masks the building.</li>
<li>To do that, scroll down below the import window to the settings.</li>
<li>Here you can see the X, Y, and width settings.</li>
<li>First, move the width bar so that it matches the width of the building.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now that you have added the text, it is time to animate it.</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Take-a-snapshot"><a href="#Step3-Take-a-snapshot" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Take a snapshot"></a>Step3 Take a snapshot</h5><p>After typing in the text, you will notice in the main play window that your text still appears in front of your object. Therefore, we want to take it behind the object. To do so, first, you will need to take a snapshot.</p>
<p>Follow the steps mentioned to take a snapshot:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hide the main video. You can see the Eye icon aside from your main video in the edit column on the left side of the timeline.</li>
<li>Click on the Eye icon to hide the main video.</li>
<li>In the <strong>main play</strong> window, you will notice that the screen turns black, which leaves only the text on the screen.</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                      alt="taking a snapshot"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>In the main play screen, you can notice a small <strong>camera icon</strong>.</li>
<li>This camera icon is used to take snapshots of your screen.</li>
<li>Click on the camera icon to take a snapshot of your screen.</li>
<li>Your snapshot will now be saved in the main import window.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="snapshot is saved in the import library"
                ></p>
<p>Now that we have taken a snapshot, we will need to import it into the timeline. Scroll below for more.</p>
<h5 id="Step4-Add-the-snapshot"><a href="#Step4-Add-the-snapshot" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Add the snapshot"></a>Step4 Add the snapshot</h5><p>After taking it, your goal is to import it into the timeline. To perform this action, perform the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before adding the snapshot to the timeline, we must delete the main text tile.</li>
<li>Then drag and drop the snapshot from the import library into the timeline above the video.</li>
<li>Make sure that the snapshot is aligned well with the length of the video.</li>
<li>If it is <strong>longer</strong> than the video, drag it from the right to match the length of the video.</li>
<li>If its length is <strong>smaller</strong> than the video, drag it to the right to increase its length.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adjust the length of the snapshot"
                ></p>
<p>After adding the snapshot, we will have to change its blending mode.</p>
<h5 id="Step5-Change-the-blending-of-the-snapshot"><a href="#Step5-Change-the-blending-of-the-snapshot" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Change the blending of the snapshot"></a>Step5 Change the blending of the snapshot</h5><p>To create the effect of your text behind the video, you must alter the main text’s blending mode. In this case, it will be the snapshot we took.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Changing the blending mode of the snapshot will allow it to blend with the transparent background and will create the effect of the text behind the object in the video.</p>
<p>Follow the steps mentioned below to change the blending of the snapshot:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> the snapshot.</li>
<li>If you select the compositing tab, the blending options will pop up.</li>
<li>From default, it would be set to <strong>Normal</strong>. Click on the <strong>Normal</strong></li>
<li>It will show a drop-down option.</li>
<li>Scroll down below until you can see an option labeled Then click on <strong>Overlay.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="change the blending mode to overlay"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>And press <strong>OK</strong> in the bottom right corner to confirm your changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>The text can be blended with the background.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>Eye icon</strong> to un-hide the video from the timeline.</li>
<li>Now play the video from the start from the main play screen to see the final changes.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Adding video to the timelines will allow you to create a workspace to edit your video.</p>
<p>Now let’s move on to how we will add the text tile to our video.</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Add-the-Text-Tile-1"><a href="#Step3-Add-the-Text-Tile-1" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Add the Text Tile"></a>Step3 Add the Text Tile</h5><p>It is time to add the text tile you will animate behind the object. To do that, follow the steps mentioned as such.:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the <strong>Titles</strong> icon on the bar above the import library.</li>
<li>A drop-down option will be available on the left side.</li>
<li>Scroll down to the <strong>Plain text</strong>.</li>
<li>Here, you can see many text tiles to add to your video.</li>
<li>You can choose anyone you like.</li>
<li>The most commonly used tile is the <strong>Basic 6</strong>.</li>
<li>When you add the text tile to the timeline, you must ensure that the text is of equal length to the video.</li>
<li>To do that, drag the right corner of the text tile and drag it to the right to match the length of the video.</li>
</ul>
<p><img

For this article, we will keep it simple. We will be typing a simple statement such as “<strong>Hello, World.</strong>“</p>
<ul>
<li>Double-click the Text tile to open the settings menu.</li>
<li>After the settings menu is opened, type in the text box on the import window.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will notice changes on the main window that your text has changed.</p>
<p><img

<li>Look above the text window, and you will see the type of text font selected.</li>
<li>Click on the drop-down option and choose whatever you like.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s move on to animate the text tile.</p>
<h5 id="Step5-Animate-the-text-tile-1"><a href="#Step5-Animate-the-text-tile-1" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Animate the text tile"></a>Step5 Animate the text tile</h5><p>After adding text, it is time to animate it. This animation will decide how your text will appear behind the target object.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, you must open the text settings by <strong>double-clicking</strong> on the text tile in the timeline.</li>
<li>In the settings opened in the import window, you will have to click on the animation tab in the upper left corner, aside from the <strong>Preset</strong></li>
<li>Now scroll down to where you will see the <strong>Right Roll</strong></li>
<li>Click on <strong>Right Roll</strong> and then click on the <strong>OK</strong> in the bottom right corner of the import window.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You may notice now that the text appears in front of our object. Don’t worry now! We are getting there. With a few simple steps, we will see the results.</p>
<p>Now let us move on to the more significant part of the editing, masking the object. Again, look ahead to see how you can mask the object!</p>
<h5 id="Step6-Mask-the-Object-1"><a href="#Step6-Mask-the-Object-1" class="headerlink" title="Step6 Mask the Object"></a>Step6 Mask the Object</h5><p>To mask our object, we will need to be technical. We will begin by adding the same footage of the static object on our timeline. Follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drag and drop the static object footage above the timeline text. Make sure the text stays in the middle of the sandwich.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add the main video above the text tile"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>We will hide the video in the first track to simplify things. In addition, this will make our editing easier.</li>
<li>We will have to look in the effects library to insert the masking effect.</li>
<li>You can see the <strong>Effects</strong> icon on the bar at the top.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Effects</strong>.</li>
<li>You will see the search bar at the top of the import window.</li>
<li>In the search bar, type in Image mask.</li>
<li>Drag the <strong>Image mask</strong> effect on the video above the text tile.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now the masking effect has been added. But we would have to adjust so that it stays upon our object.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> on the video and the settings option will open up.</li>
<li>Go into the <strong>Effects</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You must select your target object’s mask shape exactly as its shape.</p>
<ul>
<li>We have to mask out a building, so that we will need a vertical rectangle.</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                      alt="change the shape of the image mask"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>After you have selected the shape of your object, we will need to convert it to the object’s size so that it only masks the building.</li>
<li>To do that, scroll down below the import window to the settings.</li>
<li>Here you can see the X, Y, and width settings.</li>
<li>First, move the width bar so that it matches the width of the building.</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                      alt="change the width of the mask"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Now drag the X bar until the mask is confined to the building. You would have created the mask only limited to the building.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Once you complete this step, click OK in the bottom right corner.</li>
<li>Now un-hide the original video that you imported in the beginning.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, play the video in the main play window from the beginning.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="final result of the static video"
                ></p>
<p>You have successfully created a text behind the object effect. Now that you know how to add text behind static objects let us move to learn how to add text to a video that has high contrast and a clean background.</p>
<h3 id="Add-text-behind-a-high-contrast-and-clean-background-1"><a href="#Add-text-behind-a-high-contrast-and-clean-background-1" class="headerlink" title="Add text behind a high contrast and clean background"></a>Add text behind a high contrast and clean background</h3><p>Besides the text can be added behind a static object, it can also be added to a clean background with high contrast. But how is it? Let’s dive into it.</p>
<h5 id="Step1-Import-the-video-into-the-timeline-1"><a href="#Step1-Import-the-video-into-the-timeline-1" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Import the video into the timeline"></a>Step1 Import the video into the timeline</h5><ul>
<li>Import the video from the location in your PC media.</li>
<li>When imported, drag and drop it onto the timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add the footage to the timeline"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step2-Add-the-text-tile-1"><a href="#Step2-Add-the-text-tile-1" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Add the text tile"></a>Step2 Add the text tile</h5><p>To add the text to your video, follow the steps mentioned below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the titles icon on the bar above the import window.</li>
<li>On the left drop-down option, scroll down to the titles.</li>
<li>Select the Plain text option.</li>
<li>You will notice that multiple options will pop up in the import window.</li>
<li>Select the text title that suits you best.</li>
<li>After you have selected the text style, drag and drop it down above your video in the timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-13.png"
                      alt="add the text tile above the video"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Our next step would be to add the text.</li>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> on the text tile. Doing so will open the settings menu in the import window.</li>
<li>Type in the text that you want. For reference, we will keep it simple such as, <strong>“Hello world.”</strong></li>
<li>You can also adjust the font of your text.</li>
<li>Above the type box, a drop-down option will show you the range of fonts available.</li>
<li>Select the font you desire.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-14.png"
                      alt="type in the text"
                ></p>
<p>Now that you have added the text, it is time to animate it.</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Take-a-snapshot-1"><a href="#Step3-Take-a-snapshot-1" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Take a snapshot"></a>Step3 Take a snapshot</h5><p>After typing in the text, you will notice in the main play window that your text still appears in front of your object. Therefore, we want to take it behind the object. To do so, first, you will need to take a snapshot.</p>
<p>Follow the steps mentioned to take a snapshot:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hide the main video. You can see the Eye icon aside from your main video in the edit column on the left side of the timeline.</li>
<li>Click on the Eye icon to hide the main video.</li>
<li>In the <strong>main play</strong> window, you will notice that the screen turns black, which leaves only the text on the screen.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-15.png"
                      alt="taking a snapshot"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>In the main play screen, you can notice a small <strong>camera icon</strong>.</li>
<li>This camera icon is used to take snapshots of your screen.</li>
<li>Click on the camera icon to take a snapshot of your screen.</li>
<li>Your snapshot will now be saved in the main import window.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-16.png"
                      alt="snapshot is saved in the import library"
                ></p>
<p>Now that we have taken a snapshot, we will need to import it into the timeline. Scroll below for more.</p>
<h5 id="Step4-Add-the-snapshot-1"><a href="#Step4-Add-the-snapshot-1" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Add the snapshot"></a>Step4 Add the snapshot</h5><p>After taking it, your goal is to import it into the timeline. To perform this action, perform the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before adding the snapshot to the timeline, we must delete the main text tile.</li>
<li>Then drag and drop the snapshot from the import library into the timeline above the video.</li>
<li>Make sure that the snapshot is aligned well with the length of the video.</li>
<li>If it is <strong>longer</strong> than the video, drag it from the right to match the length of the video.</li>
<li>If its length is <strong>smaller</strong> than the video, drag it to the right to increase its length.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-17.png"
                      alt="adjust the length of the snapshot"
                ></p>
<p>After adding the snapshot, we will have to change its blending mode.</p>
<h5 id="Step5-Change-the-blending-of-the-snapshot-1"><a href="#Step5-Change-the-blending-of-the-snapshot-1" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Change the blending of the snapshot"></a>Step5 Change the blending of the snapshot</h5><p>To create the effect of your text behind the video, you must alter the main text’s blending mode. In this case, it will be the snapshot we took.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Changing the blending mode of the snapshot will allow it to blend with the transparent background and will create the effect of the text behind the object in the video.</p>
<p>Follow the steps mentioned below to change the blending of the snapshot:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Double-click</strong> the snapshot.</li>
<li>If you select the compositing tab, the blending options will pop up.</li>
<li>From default, it would be set to <strong>Normal</strong>. Click on the <strong>Normal</strong></li>
<li>It will show a drop-down option.</li>
<li>Scroll down below until you can see an option labeled Then click on <strong>Overlay.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-18.png"
                      alt="change the blending mode to overlay"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>And press <strong>OK</strong> in the bottom right corner to confirm your changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>The text can be blended with the background.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>Eye icon</strong> to un-hide the video from the timeline.</li>
<li>Now play the video from the start from the main play screen to see the final changes.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/add-text-behind-objects-19.gif"
                      alt="final preview"
                ></p>
