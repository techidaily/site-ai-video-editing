<p><strong>A Step-by-Step Guide to Merge FLV files on Windows&#x2F;Mac using Wondershare Filmora</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Launch Wondershare Filmora and load FLV files…</strong></p>
<p>When you run this FLV joiner, simply click <strong>“Import”</strong> to load all of the local FLV files that you want to merge to the User’s album of this FLV video merger. You can also just drag and drop the target files from your PC into the album.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/merge-flv-1.jpg"
                      alt="merge flv"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Merge FLV files into one…</strong></p>
<p>At the bottom of this FLV file merger, there lies a <strong>Timeline</strong>. Drag FLV files from the album to the Timeline and use the slider bar to help you arrange all FLV files in the Timeline without overlapping them. That’s very important as if you put one video to another, the original video will get split. Also, make sure that all FLV files are placed in the sequence in which they are to be played. If not, you can rearrange any video clip with a simple drag-and-drop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="merge flv"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Choose the target format as FLV…</strong></p>
<p>When you are sure that all FLV files are in the correct required order on the Timeline, you can view the effect in real-time in the preview pane. If everything is fine, you are now ready to export this new FLV file. All you have to do is just press the <strong>“Create”</strong></p>
<p>button, then go to the <strong>“Format” tab &gt; “FLV” output format</strong> in the output window.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4: Export a new FLV file…</strong></p>
<p>Finally, click the <strong>“Create”</strong> button to save the settings and export the new FLV file simultaneously. When it’s done, simply navigate to the whole FLV video using the output file path.</p>

<p><strong>Alternative Way to Merge&#x2F;Combine FLV Files on Windows</strong></p>
<p><strong>Joyoshare Media Cutter (Paid tool to merge FLV Files)</strong></p>
<p>Joyoshare Video Joiner for Windows is a comprehensive and user-friendly audio and video merging software that supports a wide range of file formats such as FLV, F4V, HD,4K, MP4, M4V, M4A, DV, MPEG, FLAV, WMA, and others. It is not only a superb video joiner for joining FLV files in batches without re-encoding, but it is also a video editor thanks to the built-in advanced editing tool. That means you can customize and enhance your FLV files as required before integrating them. The two combing modes (high-speed mode and encoding mode) it employs are also noteworthy. With high-speed mode, you can join an unlimited number of FLV files losslessly and swiftly. You can merge files in different formats without gaps and customize the codec, resolution, bit rate, frame rate, and other parameters of your FLV files while in encoding mode.</p>
<p><strong>A Step-by-Step Guide</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Add FLV files…</strong></p>
<p>First, go to the Joyoshare website and download the Joyoshare Video Joiner installation package. Install and configure it on your computer. Then, import FLV files into the video joiner. There are two options: click <strong>“Open File”</strong> to choose them or drag them directly into the software.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="merge flv"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Choose a merging mode and export format…</strong></p>
<p>You must pick a format from high-speed mode and encoding mode based on your requirements by using the <strong>“Format”</strong> button. The former is only for combining files of the same format losslessly at 60 X speed. The other is for users who want to modify files while joining files in different formats. With the use of a <strong>gear icon</strong> beside the selected output format, users can change video settings such as resolution, bit rate, codes, and so on while in encoding mode.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Remove undesirable parts…</strong></p>
<p>Once finished choosing mode and format, simply press <strong>“OK”</strong> to go back to the main screen. Then double-click these FLV files one by one to preview them. You can change the timeline to remove unnecessary sections from your FLV videos. Moreover, renaming and rearranging these video files can also be realized in this step.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Edit FLV files (optional)…</strong></p>
<p>The software has an editor that allows you to easily and flexibly enhance your FLV video files by clicking <strong>“Edit”</strong> next to each file before joining.</p>

<p><strong>Alternative Way to Merge&#x2F;Combine FLV Files on Windows</strong></p>
<p><strong>Joyoshare Media Cutter (Paid tool to merge FLV Files)</strong></p>
<p>Joyoshare Video Joiner for Windows is a comprehensive and user-friendly audio and video merging software that supports a wide range of file formats such as FLV, F4V, HD,4K, MP4, M4V, M4A, DV, MPEG, FLAV, WMA, and others. It is not only a superb video joiner for joining FLV files in batches without re-encoding, but it is also a video editor thanks to the built-in advanced editing tool. That means you can customize and enhance your FLV files as required before integrating them. The two combing modes (high-speed mode and encoding mode) it employs are also noteworthy. With high-speed mode, you can join an unlimited number of FLV files losslessly and swiftly. You can merge files in different formats without gaps and customize the codec, resolution, bit rate, frame rate, and other parameters of your FLV files while in encoding mode.</p>
<p><strong>A Step-by-Step Guide</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Add FLV files…</strong></p>
<p>First, go to the Joyoshare website and download the Joyoshare Video Joiner installation package. Install and configure it on your computer. Then, import FLV files into the video joiner. There are two options: click <strong>“Open File”</strong> to choose them or drag them directly into the software.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2: Choose a merging mode and export format…</strong></p>
<p>You must pick a format from high-speed mode and encoding mode based on your requirements by using the <strong>“Format”</strong> button. The former is only for combining files of the same format losslessly at 60 X speed. The other is for users who want to modify files while joining files in different formats. With the use of a <strong>gear icon</strong> beside the selected output format, users can change video settings such as resolution, bit rate, codes, and so on while in encoding mode.</p>

<p><strong>Alternative Way to Merge&#x2F;Combine FLV Files on Windows</strong></p>
<p><strong>Joyoshare Media Cutter (Paid tool to merge FLV Files)</strong></p>
<p>Joyoshare Video Joiner for Windows is a comprehensive and user-friendly audio and video merging software that supports a wide range of file formats such as FLV, F4V, HD,4K, MP4, M4V, M4A, DV, MPEG, FLAV, WMA, and others. It is not only a superb video joiner for joining FLV files in batches without re-encoding, but it is also a video editor thanks to the built-in advanced editing tool. That means you can customize and enhance your FLV files as required before integrating them. The two combing modes (high-speed mode and encoding mode) it employs are also noteworthy. With high-speed mode, you can join an unlimited number of FLV files losslessly and swiftly. You can merge files in different formats without gaps and customize the codec, resolution, bit rate, frame rate, and other parameters of your FLV files while in encoding mode.</p>
<p><strong>A Step-by-Step Guide</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Add FLV files…</strong></p>
<p>First, go to the Joyoshare website and download the Joyoshare Video Joiner installation package. Install and configure it on your computer. Then, import FLV files into the video joiner. There are two options: click <strong>“Open File”</strong> to choose them or drag them directly into the software.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2: Choose a merging mode and export format…</strong></p>
<p>You must pick a format from high-speed mode and encoding mode based on your requirements by using the <strong>“Format”</strong> button. The former is only for combining files of the same format losslessly at 60 X speed. The other is for users who want to modify files while joining files in different formats. With the use of a <strong>gear icon</strong> beside the selected output format, users can change video settings such as resolution, bit rate, codes, and so on while in encoding mode.</p>

<p><strong>Alternative Way to Merge&#x2F;Combine FLV Files on Windows</strong></p>
<p><strong>Joyoshare Media Cutter (Paid tool to merge FLV Files)</strong></p>
<p>Joyoshare Video Joiner for Windows is a comprehensive and user-friendly audio and video merging software that supports a wide range of file formats such as FLV, F4V, HD,4K, MP4, M4V, M4A, DV, MPEG, FLAV, WMA, and others. It is not only a superb video joiner for joining FLV files in batches without re-encoding, but it is also a video editor thanks to the built-in advanced editing tool. That means you can customize and enhance your FLV files as required before integrating them. The two combing modes (high-speed mode and encoding mode) it employs are also noteworthy. With high-speed mode, you can join an unlimited number of FLV files losslessly and swiftly. You can merge files in different formats without gaps and customize the codec, resolution, bit rate, frame rate, and other parameters of your FLV files while in encoding mode.</p>
<p><strong>A Step-by-Step Guide</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Add FLV files…</strong></p>
<p>First, go to the Joyoshare website and download the Joyoshare Video Joiner installation package. Install and configure it on your computer. Then, import FLV files into the video joiner. There are two options: click <strong>“Open File”</strong> to choose them or drag them directly into the software.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2: Choose a merging mode and export format…</strong></p>
<p>You must pick a format from high-speed mode and encoding mode based on your requirements by using the <strong>“Format”</strong> button. The former is only for combining files of the same format losslessly at 60 X speed. The other is for users who want to modify files while joining files in different formats. With the use of a <strong>gear icon</strong> beside the selected output format, users can change video settings such as resolution, bit rate, codes, and so on while in encoding mode.</p>

<p>After a successful video shoot, video editing tends to wrap up the video production process. However, a video cannot be enlivened by using simple video editing tools, i.e., cut, crop, and trim, but rather tools such as cinematic color grading. Usually, directors want their video to evoke their intended ambiance and appear more realistic – This can only be achieved through cinematic color grading.</p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Color grading <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the alteration and enhancement of color in a video, motion picture, or still image. Color grading is an essential tool for videographers since it enables them to enhance the mood or tone. Stick to this article and learn about the eight tips to apply cinematic color grading to your video.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">Don’t Make These Mistakes!</a></p>
<p>02 <a href="#part2">8 Tips to Apply Cinematic Color Grading to Your Video</a></p>
<h2 id="Don’t-Make-These-Mistakes"><a href="#Don’t-Make-These-Mistakes" class="headerlink" title="Don’t Make These Mistakes"></a>Don’t Make These Mistakes</h2><p>Even though to err is human, there are some mistakes that colorists and video editors need to avoid at all costs. It is not only because they will make them look amateurish but also undermines the message and impact of the video.</p>
<p>Some people assume color grading is as simple as adding filters to their Instagram photos which they are absolutely wrong. Color grading is a long and frustrating process, and it only requires “persons with a thick skin.”</p>
<p>Some mistakes are not only committed by amateurs alone but also professional colorists who are in a rush to complete their projects on due time. Usually, these mistakes degrade the quality output. Some of the mistakes that one needs not make include:</p>
<h4 id="1-Using-a-Poorly-Calibrated-Monitor"><a href="#1-Using-a-Poorly-Calibrated-Monitor" class="headerlink" title="1. Using a Poorly Calibrated Monitor"></a>1. Using a Poorly Calibrated Monitor</h4><p>Almost every videographer and colorist’s goal is to design footages that distinctively display their primary colors and decipher the intended message. And this can only be achieved using a properly calibrated monitor.</p>
<p>Before working on a project, you ought to crosscheck your monitor calibration. Most people assume that the calibration is accurate since they possess a new, out-of-the-box monitor. It is utterly wrong since retailer shops usually adjust the monitor settings to overblown saturation and contrast to attract customers.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you opt to edit your videos without adjusting your monitor calibration, you will have a poor footage.</p>
<h4 id="2-Poor-Prepping-of-the-Video-Footage"><a href="#2-Poor-Prepping-of-the-Video-Footage" class="headerlink" title="2. Poor Prepping of the Video Footage"></a>2. Poor Prepping of the Video Footage</h4><p>One major mistake that videographers often make is not prepping their video correctly. A poorly prepped footage is one that has a bad color space conversion. Usually, the outcome result of poorly prepped footage is an imbalanced image.</p>
<p>Prepping footage is not as easy as an apple pie. Besides, most videographers tend to follow a shortcut by starting messing with the gains and individual nodes, forgetting that a shortcut is often a wrong cut.</p>
<p>The best way of prepping a video is to start by making separate nodes and labeling them differently.</p>
<h4 id="3-Imbalancing-the-Shadow"><a href="#3-Imbalancing-the-Shadow" class="headerlink" title="3. Imbalancing the Shadow"></a>3. Imbalancing the Shadow</h4><p>Have you ever seen video footage with partially opaque shadows? And when you look keenly, you see tinted greens and reds. Usually, this is a result of an imbalanced shadow.</p>
<p>This mistake is not only carried out by beginner videographers but also professionals who are always in a hurry to complete a project. When you look at your scope, you see the shadows are lifted or down in other scenarios – This is also a result of shadow imbalance.</p>
<h4 id="4-Overusing-LUTs"><a href="#4-Overusing-LUTs" class="headerlink" title="4. Overusing LUTs"></a>4. Overusing LUTs</h4><p>A mistake that beginner editors often make is overusing LUTs. Footages with overly used LUTs often appear to be dull. A thing that videographers need to observe when using LUTs is consistency.</p>
<p>When using LUTs, you need to ensure that your project has similar saturation, colors, and contrast throughout your video project. Moreover, it would be best to choose your LUTs based on the film color palette and your story.</p>
<h4 id="5-Having-Limited-break"><a href="#5-Having-Limited-break" class="headerlink" title="5. Having Limited break"></a>5. Having Limited break</h4><p>Having enough break enables one’s eyes to recalibrate. As a colorist, your eyes are often considered the main asset. Sitting for long periods in your workstation and staring for long hours at your monitor may cause one to add more saturation and contrast, thus making the video dull. Therefore the best remedy is to take a break from your monitor.</p>
<p>Besides, coming from a break enables one to have another different perspective about the color grading of the project.</p>
<h2 id="8-Tips-to-Apply-Cinematic-Color-Grading-to-Your-Video-1"><a href="#8-Tips-to-Apply-Cinematic-Color-Grading-to-Your-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="8 Tips to Apply Cinematic Color Grading to Your Video"></a>8 Tips to Apply Cinematic Color Grading to Your Video</h2><p>When it comes to creating cinematic looks in video footage, the camera type is usually non-essential. What matters is that you capture quality videos with the right angles then leave the rest to color grading.</p>
<p>For a video clip to look more cinematic, a couple of elements are put together. Here, we will look at those elements and create stunning videos.</p>
<h4 id="1-Use-Lumetri-Color-to-adjust-brightness-contrast-and-saturation"><a href="#1-Use-Lumetri-Color-to-adjust-brightness-contrast-and-saturation" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Lumetri Color to adjust brightness, contrast, and saturation"></a>1. Use Lumetri Color to adjust brightness, contrast, and saturation</h4><p>The Lumeri color is an essential color grading functionality in most premiere software, including Wondershare Filmora, Adobe After Effects, and Davinci Resolve 17. With this functionality tool, you can carry out a wide range of customizable settings such as hue, saturation, contrasts, brightness, and tone.</p>
<p>The lumetri panel contains a histogram, vectorscope, parade scope, and waveform monitor. In your lumetri panel, you can measure the brightness and tonal values using a histogram, the light intensity with a waveform monitor, saturation and hue using vectorscope, and color channel using parade scope.</p>
<p>Adjusting the brightness, contrast, hue, saturation, and tone to moderate levels will give your video clip that cinematic look.</p>

Use Cosmo functionality to adjust skin tones</h4><p>Due to the light effect, shots taken during the day will have inconsistent color matches, especially skin tone. In the post-production process, one needs to make uniformity in skin tone and the clip. To rectify this, you need to involve a professional color grading functionality, Cosmo.</p>
<p>With cosmo, you can adjust the skin color, squeeze the skin, and soften the skin. Generally, Cosmo makes people in video clips look their best.</p>

<h4 id="3-Use-Highlights-and-Shadows-adjustment"><a href="#3-Use-Highlights-and-Shadows-adjustment" class="headerlink" title="3. Use Highlights and Shadows adjustment"></a>3. Use Highlights and Shadows adjustment</h4><p>A clip will look more cinematic when the shadows and highlights are brought out as separate entities. The shadows become more vivid when adjusted to either teal, purple or blue. You can go a mile and adjust the highlights to become crystal clear by making the footage become yellow, red, or orange.</p>
<p>When carrying out color grading, you need to know the various video demands, such as the horror clips demand more of the dark shadow.</p>

Use Vectorscope to get the accurate adjustment"></a>4. Use Vectorscope to get the accurate adjustment</h4><p>Naked eyes cannot effectively see all the errors in a video project, which is the essence of having a vectorscope. A vectorscope provides all the quantitative information about a video image – This lessens work for video editors.</p>
<p>Vectorscope provides extensive details, such as how intense a given color is – This will help you make necessary adjustments to your footage.</p>

Use the black and white functionality to change the opacity</h4><p>Even though you can change your footage to black and white using the hue and saturation functionality, the black and white tool gives you more control.</p>
<p>This functionality feature can make your footage blend with the soft light part. Besides, it is best to first lower the contrast of your image or video to black and white to be able to highlight the unclear parts.</p>

<h2 id="Don’t-Make-These-Mistakes-1"><a href="#Don’t-Make-These-Mistakes-1" class="headerlink" title="Don’t Make These Mistakes"></a>Don’t Make These Mistakes</h2><p>Even though to err is human, there are some mistakes that colorists and video editors need to avoid at all costs. It is not only because they will make them look amateurish but also undermines the message and impact of the video.</p>
<p>Some people assume color grading is as simple as adding filters to their Instagram photos which they are absolutely wrong. Color grading is a long and frustrating process, and it only requires “persons with a thick skin.”</p>
<p>Some mistakes are not only committed by amateurs alone but also professional colorists who are in a rush to complete their projects on due time. Usually, these mistakes degrade the quality output. Some of the mistakes that one needs not make include:</p>
<h4 id="1-Using-a-Poorly-Calibrated-Monitor-1"><a href="#1-Using-a-Poorly-Calibrated-Monitor-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Using a Poorly Calibrated Monitor"></a>1. Using a Poorly Calibrated Monitor</h4><p>Almost every videographer and colorist’s goal is to design footages that distinctively display their primary colors and decipher the intended message. And this can only be achieved using a properly calibrated monitor.</p>
<p>Before working on a project, you ought to crosscheck your monitor calibration. Most people assume that the calibration is accurate since they possess a new, out-of-the-box monitor. It is utterly wrong since retailer shops usually adjust the monitor settings to overblown saturation and contrast to attract customers.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you opt to edit your videos without adjusting your monitor calibration, you will have a poor footage.</p>
<h4 id="2-Poor-Prepping-of-the-Video-Footage-1"><a href="#2-Poor-Prepping-of-the-Video-Footage-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Poor Prepping of the Video Footage"></a>2. Poor Prepping of the Video Footage</h4><p>One major mistake that videographers often make is not prepping their video correctly. A poorly prepped footage is one that has a bad color space conversion. Usually, the outcome result of poorly prepped footage is an imbalanced image.</p>
<p>Prepping footage is not as easy as an apple pie. Besides, most videographers tend to follow a shortcut by starting messing with the gains and individual nodes, forgetting that a shortcut is often a wrong cut.</p>
<p>The best way of prepping a video is to start by making separate nodes and labeling them differently.</p>
<h4 id="3-Imbalancing-the-Shadow-1"><a href="#3-Imbalancing-the-Shadow-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Imbalancing the Shadow"></a>3. Imbalancing the Shadow</h4><p>Have you ever seen video footage with partially opaque shadows? And when you look keenly, you see tinted greens and reds. Usually, this is a result of an imbalanced shadow.</p>
<p>This mistake is not only carried out by beginner videographers but also professionals who are always in a hurry to complete a project. When you look at your scope, you see the shadows are lifted or down in other scenarios – This is also a result of shadow imbalance.</p>
<h4 id="4-Overusing-LUTs-1"><a href="#4-Overusing-LUTs-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Overusing LUTs"></a>4. Overusing LUTs</h4><p>A mistake that beginner editors often make is overusing LUTs. Footages with overly used LUTs often appear to be dull. A thing that videographers need to observe when using LUTs is consistency.</p>
<p>When using LUTs, you need to ensure that your project has similar saturation, colors, and contrast throughout your video project. Moreover, it would be best to choose your LUTs based on the film color palette and your story.</p>
<h4 id="5-Having-Limited-break-1"><a href="#5-Having-Limited-break-1" class="headerlink" title="5. Having Limited break"></a>5. Having Limited break</h4><p>Having enough break enables one’s eyes to recalibrate. As a colorist, your eyes are often considered the main asset. Sitting for long periods in your workstation and staring for long hours at your monitor may cause one to add more saturation and contrast, thus making the video dull. Therefore the best remedy is to take a break from your monitor.</p>
<p>Besides, coming from a break enables one to have another different perspective about the color grading of the project.</p>
<h2 id="8-Tips-to-Apply-Cinematic-Color-Grading-to-Your-Video-2"><a href="#8-Tips-to-Apply-Cinematic-Color-Grading-to-Your-Video-2" class="headerlink" title="8 Tips to Apply Cinematic Color Grading to Your Video"></a>8 Tips to Apply Cinematic Color Grading to Your Video</h2><p>When it comes to creating cinematic looks in video footage, the camera type is usually non-essential. What matters is that you capture quality videos with the right angles then leave the rest to color grading.</p>
<p>For a video clip to look more cinematic, a couple of elements are put together. Here, we will look at those elements and create stunning videos.</p>
<h4 id="1-Use-Lumetri-Color-to-adjust-brightness-contrast-and-saturation-1"><a href="#1-Use-Lumetri-Color-to-adjust-brightness-contrast-and-saturation-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Lumetri Color to adjust brightness, contrast, and saturation"></a>1. Use Lumetri Color to adjust brightness, contrast, and saturation</h4><p>The Lumeri color is an essential color grading functionality in most premiere software, including Wondershare Filmora, Adobe After Effects, and Davinci Resolve 17. With this functionality tool, you can carry out a wide range of customizable settings such as hue, saturation, contrasts, brightness, and tone.</p>
<p>The lumetri panel contains a histogram, vectorscope, parade scope, and waveform monitor. In your lumetri panel, you can measure the brightness and tonal values using a histogram, the light intensity with a waveform monitor, saturation and hue using vectorscope, and color channel using parade scope.</p>
<p>Adjusting the brightness, contrast, hue, saturation, and tone to moderate levels will give your video clip that cinematic look.</p>

Use Cosmo functionality to adjust skin tones</h4><p>Due to the light effect, shots taken during the day will have inconsistent color matches, especially skin tone. In the post-production process, one needs to make uniformity in skin tone and the clip. To rectify this, you need to involve a professional color grading functionality, Cosmo.</p>
<p>With cosmo, you can adjust the skin color, squeeze the skin, and soften the skin. Generally, Cosmo makes people in video clips look their best.</p>

Use Highlights and Shadows adjustment</h4><p>A clip will look more cinematic when the shadows and highlights are brought out as separate entities. The shadows become more vivid when adjusted to either teal, purple or blue. You can go a mile and adjust the highlights to become crystal clear by making the footage become yellow, red, or orange.</p>
<p>When carrying out color grading, you need to know the various video demands, such as the horror clips demand more of the dark shadow.</p>

<p>After a successful video shoot, video editing tends to wrap up the video production process. However, a video cannot be enlivened by using simple video editing tools, i.e., cut, crop, and trim, but rather tools such as cinematic color grading. Usually, directors want their video to evoke their intended ambiance and appear more realistic – This can only be achieved through cinematic color grading.</p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Color grading <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the alteration and enhancement of color in a video, motion picture, or still image. Color grading is an essential tool for videographers since it enables them to enhance the mood or tone. Stick to this article and learn about the eight tips to apply cinematic color grading to your video.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-3"><a href="#In-this-article-3" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">Don’t Make These Mistakes!</a></p>
<p>02 <a href="#part2">8 Tips to Apply Cinematic Color Grading to Your Video</a></p>
<h2 id="Don’t-Make-These-Mistakes-3"><a href="#Don’t-Make-These-Mistakes-3" class="headerlink" title="Don’t Make These Mistakes"></a>Don’t Make These Mistakes</h2><p>Even though to err is human, there are some mistakes that colorists and video editors need to avoid at all costs. It is not only because they will make them look amateurish but also undermines the message and impact of the video.</p>
<p>Some people assume color grading is as simple as adding filters to their Instagram photos which they are absolutely wrong. Color grading is a long and frustrating process, and it only requires “persons with a thick skin.”</p>
<p>Some mistakes are not only committed by amateurs alone but also professional colorists who are in a rush to complete their projects on due time. Usually, these mistakes degrade the quality output. Some of the mistakes that one needs not make include:</p>
<h4 id="1-Using-a-Poorly-Calibrated-Monitor-3"><a href="#1-Using-a-Poorly-Calibrated-Monitor-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Using a Poorly Calibrated Monitor"></a>1. Using a Poorly Calibrated Monitor</h4><p>Almost every videographer and colorist’s goal is to design footages that distinctively display their primary colors and decipher the intended message. And this can only be achieved using a properly calibrated monitor.</p>
<p>Before working on a project, you ought to crosscheck your monitor calibration. Most people assume that the calibration is accurate since they possess a new, out-of-the-box monitor. It is utterly wrong since retailer shops usually adjust the monitor settings to overblown saturation and contrast to attract customers.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you opt to edit your videos without adjusting your monitor calibration, you will have a poor footage.</p>
<h4 id="2-Poor-Prepping-of-the-Video-Footage-3"><a href="#2-Poor-Prepping-of-the-Video-Footage-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Poor Prepping of the Video Footage"></a>2. Poor Prepping of the Video Footage</h4><p>One major mistake that videographers often make is not prepping their video correctly. A poorly prepped footage is one that has a bad color space conversion. Usually, the outcome result of poorly prepped footage is an imbalanced image.</p>
<p>Prepping footage is not as easy as an apple pie. Besides, most videographers tend to follow a shortcut by starting messing with the gains and individual nodes, forgetting that a shortcut is often a wrong cut.</p>
<p>The best way of prepping a video is to start by making separate nodes and labeling them differently.</p>
<h4 id="3-Imbalancing-the-Shadow-3"><a href="#3-Imbalancing-the-Shadow-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Imbalancing the Shadow"></a>3. Imbalancing the Shadow</h4><p>Have you ever seen video footage with partially opaque shadows? And when you look keenly, you see tinted greens and reds. Usually, this is a result of an imbalanced shadow.</p>
<p>This mistake is not only carried out by beginner videographers but also professionals who are always in a hurry to complete a project. When you look at your scope, you see the shadows are lifted or down in other scenarios – This is also a result of shadow imbalance.</p>
<h4 id="4-Overusing-LUTs-3"><a href="#4-Overusing-LUTs-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Overusing LUTs"></a>4. Overusing LUTs</h4><p>A mistake that beginner editors often make is overusing LUTs. Footages with overly used LUTs often appear to be dull. A thing that videographers need to observe when using LUTs is consistency.</p>
<p>When using LUTs, you need to ensure that your project has similar saturation, colors, and contrast throughout your video project. Moreover, it would be best to choose your LUTs based on the film color palette and your story.</p>
<h4 id="5-Having-Limited-break-3"><a href="#5-Having-Limited-break-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Having Limited break"></a>5. Having Limited break</h4><p>Having enough break enables one’s eyes to recalibrate. As a colorist, your eyes are often considered the main asset. Sitting for long periods in your workstation and staring for long hours at your monitor may cause one to add more saturation and contrast, thus making the video dull. Therefore the best remedy is to take a break from your monitor.</p>
<p>Besides, coming from a break enables one to have another different perspective about the color grading of the project.</p>
<h2 id="8-Tips-to-Apply-Cinematic-Color-Grading-to-Your-Video-4"><a href="#8-Tips-to-Apply-Cinematic-Color-Grading-to-Your-Video-4" class="headerlink" title="8 Tips to Apply Cinematic Color Grading to Your Video"></a>8 Tips to Apply Cinematic Color Grading to Your Video</h2><p>When it comes to creating cinematic looks in video footage, the camera type is usually non-essential. What matters is that you capture quality videos with the right angles then leave the rest to color grading.</p>
<p>For a video clip to look more cinematic, a couple of elements are put together. Here, we will look at those elements and create stunning videos.</p>
<h4 id="1-Use-Lumetri-Color-to-adjust-brightness-contrast-and-saturation-3"><a href="#1-Use-Lumetri-Color-to-adjust-brightness-contrast-and-saturation-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Lumetri Color to adjust brightness, contrast, and saturation"></a>1. Use Lumetri Color to adjust brightness, contrast, and saturation</h4><p>The Lumeri color is an essential color grading functionality in most premiere software, including Wondershare Filmora, Adobe After Effects, and Davinci Resolve 17. With this functionality tool, you can carry out a wide range of customizable settings such as hue, saturation, contrasts, brightness, and tone.</p>
<p>The lumetri panel contains a histogram, vectorscope, parade scope, and waveform monitor. In your lumetri panel, you can measure the brightness and tonal values using a histogram, the light intensity with a waveform monitor, saturation and hue using vectorscope, and color channel using parade scope.</p>
<p>Adjusting the brightness, contrast, hue, saturation, and tone to moderate levels will give your video clip that cinematic look.</p>

Use Cosmo functionality to adjust skin tones</h4><p>Due to the light effect, shots taken during the day will have inconsistent color matches, especially skin tone. In the post-production process, one needs to make uniformity in skin tone and the clip. To rectify this, you need to involve a professional color grading functionality, Cosmo.</p>
<p>With cosmo, you can adjust the skin color, squeeze the skin, and soften the skin. Generally, Cosmo makes people in video clips look their best.</p>

Use Highlights and Shadows adjustment</h4><p>A clip will look more cinematic when the shadows and highlights are brought out as separate entities. The shadows become more vivid when adjusted to either teal, purple or blue. You can go a mile and adjust the highlights to become crystal clear by making the footage become yellow, red, or orange.</p>
<p>When carrying out color grading, you need to know the various video demands, such as the horror clips demand more of the dark shadow.</p>

<p>AR i.e. Augmented reality is a unique approach that is trendy for its variety of applications. It is a technology that provides the composite view to the user’s perception of real world images and videos.</p>
<p>It is a great development in the direction of technological advancement. AR is the concept that combines real-life objects with simulated 3D objects. Businesses use this approach to make their products more presentable and lively for the customers. Whereas, it is also very helpful for the users to experiment and have fun. With the evolution of this approach, now there are many applications available in the market that offers AR functionaltiy. Here, we are listing down the top 10 <strong>AR video apps</strong> which are worth using to experience something unique.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-the-Difference-Between-VR-and-AR"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-the-Difference-Between-VR-and-AR" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What Is the Difference Between VR and AR?"></a>Part 1 What Is the Difference Between VR and AR?</h2><p>Both AR and VR use a distinctive approach and consider different use cases. They work on the concept of bringing a simulated environment to the user. Both VR i.e. the virtual reality and AR i.e. augmented reality are technologies used to replace or enhance the real-life environment with the simulated one. Virtual reality is the replacement of real-life environments with simulated ones. Whereas, Augmented reality is the procedure of augmenting the real-life environment with the addition of digital elements to a live view. This can be done by the camera on a smartphone.</p>
<p>The main aim of designing AR is to provide detailed information to the user about the real world. Its whole design is done by considering and adding the elements of the real world. Whereas, virtual reality is an entirely different simulation. It completely replaces the real-world environment with the virtual world.</p>
<p>Even Though both technologies are the simulation of the real world, they use different components of design and also have distinct targeted audiences. The concept behind VR is to distance the user from the real world as much as possible. Whereas, the concept of AR works with the real world to create a simulated environment.</p>
<p>The use of an eye-covering headset and headphones is very common to make an illusion of the real world, in the case of VR. Whereas, AR is usually accomplished with a smartphone or tablet screen. Here, the camera of the phone is focused at a point to capture the live-streaming of a moment on the screen. The captured data is then prepared by adding some useful information.</p>
<p>The applications of VR are architecture and retail, training, product design, etc. Whereas, the applications of AR are diagnostic data, navigation information, repair instructions, etc. The availability of <strong>ar video maker</strong> also eases the task of the industries for the mentioned purposes.</p>

They work on the concept of bringing a simulated environment to the user. Both VR i.e. the virtual reality and AR i.e. augmented reality are technologies used to replace or enhance the real-life environment with the simulated one. Virtual reality is the replacement of real-life environments with simulated ones. Whereas, Augmented reality is the procedure of augmenting the real-life environment with the addition of digital elements to a live view. This can be done by the camera on a smartphone.</p>
<p>The main aim of designing AR is to provide detailed information to the user about the real world. Its whole design is done by considering and adding the elements of the real world. Whereas, virtual reality is an entirely different simulation. It completely replaces the real-world environment with the virtual world.</p>
<p>Even Though both technologies are the simulation of the real world, they use different components of design and also have distinct targeted audiences. The concept behind VR is to distance the user from the real world as much as possible. Whereas, the concept of AR works with the real world to create a simulated environment.</p>
<p>The use of an eye-covering headset and headphones is very common to make an illusion of the real world, in the case of VR. Whereas, AR is usually accomplished with a smartphone or tablet screen. Here, the camera of the phone is focused at a point to capture the live-streaming of a moment on the screen. The captured data is then prepared by adding some useful information.</p>
<p>The applications of VR are architecture and retail, training, product design, etc. Whereas, the applications of AR are diagnostic data, navigation information, repair instructions, etc. The availability of <strong>ar video maker</strong> also eases the task of the industries for the mentioned purposes.</p>

They work on the concept of bringing a simulated environment to the user. Both VR i.e. the virtual reality and AR i.e. augmented reality are technologies used to replace or enhance the real-life environment with the simulated one. Virtual reality is the replacement of real-life environments with simulated ones. Whereas, Augmented reality is the procedure of augmenting the real-life environment with the addition of digital elements to a live view. This can be done by the camera on a smartphone.</p>
<p>The main aim of designing AR is to provide detailed information to the user about the real world. Its whole design is done by considering and adding the elements of the real world. Whereas, virtual reality is an entirely different simulation. It completely replaces the real-world environment with the virtual world.</p>
<p>Even Though both technologies are the simulation of the real world, they use different components of design and also have distinct targeted audiences. The concept behind VR is to distance the user from the real world as much as possible. Whereas, the concept of AR works with the real world to create a simulated environment.</p>
<p>The use of an eye-covering headset and headphones is very common to make an illusion of the real world, in the case of VR. Whereas, AR is usually accomplished with a smartphone or tablet screen. Here, the camera of the phone is focused at a point to capture the live-streaming of a moment on the screen. The captured data is then prepared by adding some useful information.</p>
<p>The applications of VR are architecture and retail, training, product design, etc. Whereas, the applications of AR are diagnostic data, navigation information, repair instructions, etc. The availability of <strong>ar video maker</strong> also eases the task of the industries for the mentioned purposes.</p>

<p>Even Though both technologies are the simulation of the real world, they use different components of design and also have distinct targeted audiences. The concept behind VR is to distance the user from the real world as much as possible. Whereas, the concept of AR works with the real world to create a simulated environment.</p>
<p>The use of an eye-covering headset and headphones is very common to make an illusion of the real world, in the case of VR. Whereas, AR is usually accomplished with a smartphone or tablet screen. Here, the camera of the phone is focused at a point to capture the live-streaming of a moment on the screen. The captured data is then prepared by adding some useful information.</p>
<p>The applications of VR are architecture and retail, training, product design, etc. Whereas, the applications of AR are diagnostic data, navigation information, repair instructions, etc. The availability of <strong>ar video maker</strong> also eases the task of the industries for the mentioned purposes.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Object-Tracking"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Object-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Object Tracking?"></a>Part 1. What Is Object Tracking?</h2><p>Object Tracking determines the location of an object in a video and can be used for a variety of purposes, including surveillance, security, traffic control, digital forensics, anomaly detection, gesture recognition, visual surveillance, human-computer interaction, augmented reality, and robot vision.</p>
<p>Even though it may seem easy for an average person, object tracking is quite complex for computers because they have to analyze a set of frames and estimate the object’s trajectory based on numbers instead of images.</p>
<p>Because of how complicated it is, Object Tracking is considered one of the most difficult tasks in computer vision. Even though it’s a challenge, it’s not impossible to accomplish.</p>
<p>And there are two levels of Object Tracking that you should learn about:</p>
<h3 id="1-SOT-MOT"><a href="#1-SOT-MOT" class="headerlink" title="1. SOT &amp; MOT"></a>1. SOT &amp; MOT</h3><ol>
<li><strong>Single Object Tracking (SOT):</strong> SOT is a tracking algorithm that creates advanced appearance models and&#x2F;or motion models to manage difficult issues like out-of-plane rotations, illumination variations, or scale changes.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple Object Tracking (MOT):</strong> MOT tracks every part of a video and is mainly concerned with mid-level tasks and serves as a foundation for high-level tasks.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="2-The-Difference-Between-Tracking-And-Detection"><a href="#2-The-Difference-Between-Tracking-And-Detection" class="headerlink" title="2. The Difference Between Tracking And Detection"></a>2. The Difference Between Tracking And Detection</h3><p>After knowing what Object Tracking is, there is another concept you should also be aware of - Object Detection.</p>
<p>The Object Tracking and Object Detection are two important methods in computer vision. Object Tracking tracks the position of a given object in an image in real-time, while Object Detection identifies and localizes objects in an image or video. That is the difference.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Types-Of-Object-Tracking"><a href="#Part-2-Types-Of-Object-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Types Of Object Tracking"></a>Part 2. Types Of Object Tracking</h2><h3 id="Image-Tracking"><a href="#Image-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Image Tracking"></a>Image Tracking</h3><p>Image tracking allows users to interact with digital content more naturally and helps users move and interact with digital objects in the same manner as they will with real-world physical objects.</p>
<p>Image tracking can be used in various augmented reality (AR) applications, such as AR gaming, shopping, and navigation. Moreover, you can also use it for educational purposes, such as teaching anatomy or providing instructions for a difficult task.</p>
<h3 id="Video-Tracking"><a href="#Video-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Video Tracking"></a>Video Tracking</h3><p>Video tracking is the process of tracking objects in a video sequence and can be used for various applications, such as detecting and counting objects in a scene, understanding their motions, and recognizing activities.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-What-Are-The-Difficulties-Of-Object-Tracking"><a href="#Part-3-What-Are-The-Difficulties-Of-Object-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. What Are The Difficulties Of Object Tracking?"></a>Part 3. What Are The Difficulties Of Object Tracking?</h2><p>As what has been mentioned above, the use of object tracking is versatile. However, there are some challenges associated with Object Tracking, such as:</p>
<p><strong>Background Clutter:</strong> The background can impact extracting an object’s features. If the background is more densely populated, detecting or tracking the object of interest can be more difficult.</p>
<p><strong>Occlusion:</strong> This is a phenomenon where the object being tracked is affected by the background or foreground. This causes the tracking algorithm to get confused due to multiple objects coming close together, hence, losing track of the object.</p>
<p><strong>Varying spatial scales:</strong> Varying spatial scales refer to the target object being of a different size or shape, which can confuse the algorithm, leading to errors.</p>
<p><strong>Training and Tracking Speed:</strong> If the object is moving too fast or is too small, it can be difficult to track. Therefore, the tracking module has to be designed to track, identify, and localize objects in a matter of seconds.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-Stages-Of-The-Object-Tracking-Process"><a href="#Part-4-Stages-Of-The-Object-Tracking-Process" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Stages Of The Object Tracking Process"></a>Part 4. Stages Of The Object Tracking Process</h2><p>After the introduction of object tracking technically, let’s learn about its mechanism of it from two sides: periods of the working process and the way it tracks.</p>
<h3 id="1-Stages-Of-The-Object-Tracking-Process"><a href="#1-Stages-Of-The-Object-Tracking-Process" class="headerlink" title="1. Stages Of The Object Tracking Process"></a>1. Stages Of The Object Tracking Process</h3><p>Following are the stages of the Object Tracking process:</p>
<p><strong>Target Initialization</strong></p>
<p>Target initialization is the first step in Object Tracking and involves defining the targets or objects of interest and drawing a bounding box around them in the initial frame. After that, the tracker has to detect the position of the object in the frame while drawing the bounding box.</p>
<p><strong>Appearance Modeling</strong></p>
<p>Appearance modeling is important for understanding how an object will look under different circumstances. If the object being tracked changes appearance due to different lighting, angle, or speed, the tracking algorithm may lose its information and the object itself. Therefore, it has to be conducted to let the algorithm detect the changes and distortion.</p>
<p><strong>Motion Estimation</strong></p>
<p>Motion estimation entails the capacity of the model to anticipate an object’s future position with precision.</p>
<p><strong>Target Positioning</strong></p>
<p>Motion estimation is a process of approximating the most likely region where an object could be present. After the object’s location is approximated, a visual model can be used to determine the target’s location more accurately.</p>
<h3 id="2-Methods-Of-Object-Tracking"><a href="#2-Methods-Of-Object-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="2. Methods Of Object Tracking"></a>2. Methods Of Object Tracking</h3><p>Here’re some methods of Object Tracking:</p>
<p><strong>OpenCV-Based Object Tracking</strong></p>
<p><strong>OpenCV Object Tracking</strong> method is widely used because it offers several built-in functions designed specifically for this purpose, such as GOTURN, MIL, MediandFlow, and CSRT. The tracker type you select will depend on your specific application design. Each tracker has its pros and cons, so there is not a single type of tracker ideal for all applications.</p>
<p><strong>MDNet</strong></p>
<p>Multi-Domain Convolutional Neural Network Tracker is a convolutional neural-based visual tracker and has won the VOT2015 challenge. Moreover, it is composed of domain-specific layers, branches, and multiple shared layers.</p>
<p>The MDNetT tracker is a deep neural network that is trained on numerous Object Tracking datasets. The tracker is designed to work in multiple domains, including video, text, and images.</p>
<p><strong>DeepSort</strong></p>
<p>DeepSort algorithm can track objects in real-time and uses YOLO v3 to compute the bounding boxes around the objects in a frame.</p>
<p>DeepSort uses Kalman filter from Simple Online and Realtime Tracking algorithm and an identification model, ReID to interlink bounding boxes and object tracks.</p>
<p><strong>ROLO</strong></p>
<p>ROLO is a novel Object Tracking method that uses recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to learn object-specific Spatio-temporal representations. This method works with YOLO, an object detection algorithm, and an LTSM for determining the trajectory of an object.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Object-Tracking-1"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Object-Tracking-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Object Tracking?"></a>Part 1. What Is Object Tracking?</h2><p>Object Tracking determines the location of an object in a video and can be used for a variety of purposes, including surveillance, security, traffic control, digital forensics, anomaly detection, gesture recognition, visual surveillance, human-computer interaction, augmented reality, and robot vision.</p>
<p>Even though it may seem easy for an average person, object tracking is quite complex for computers because they have to analyze a set of frames and estimate the object’s trajectory based on numbers instead of images.</p>
<p>Because of how complicated it is, Object Tracking is considered one of the most difficult tasks in computer vision. Even though it’s a challenge, it’s not impossible to accomplish.</p>
<p>And there are two levels of Object Tracking that you should learn about:</p>
<h3 id="1-SOT-MOT-1"><a href="#1-SOT-MOT-1" class="headerlink" title="1. SOT &amp; MOT"></a>1. SOT &amp; MOT</h3><ol>
<li><strong>Single Object Tracking (SOT):</strong> SOT is a tracking algorithm that creates advanced appearance models and&#x2F;or motion models to manage difficult issues like out-of-plane rotations, illumination variations, or scale changes.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple Object Tracking (MOT):</strong> MOT tracks every part of a video and is mainly concerned with mid-level tasks and serves as a foundation for high-level tasks.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="2-The-Difference-Between-Tracking-And-Detection-1"><a href="#2-The-Difference-Between-Tracking-And-Detection-1" class="headerlink" title="2. The Difference Between Tracking And Detection"></a>2. The Difference Between Tracking And Detection</h3><p>After knowing what Object Tracking is, there is another concept you should also be aware of - Object Detection.</p>
<p>The Object Tracking and Object Detection are two important methods in computer vision. Object Tracking tracks the position of a given object in an image in real-time, while Object Detection identifies and localizes objects in an image or video. That is the difference.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Types-Of-Object-Tracking-1"><a href="#Part-2-Types-Of-Object-Tracking-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Types Of Object Tracking"></a>Part 2. Types Of Object Tracking</h2><h3 id="Image-Tracking-1"><a href="#Image-Tracking-1" class="headerlink" title="Image Tracking"></a>Image Tracking</h3><p>Image tracking allows users to interact with digital content more naturally and helps users move and interact with digital objects in the same manner as they will with real-world physical objects.</p>
<p>Image tracking can be used in various augmented reality (AR) applications, such as AR gaming, shopping, and navigation. Moreover, you can also use it for educational purposes, such as teaching anatomy or providing instructions for a difficult task.</p>
<h3 id="Video-Tracking-1"><a href="#Video-Tracking-1" class="headerlink" title="Video Tracking"></a>Video Tracking</h3><p>Video tracking is the process of tracking objects in a video sequence and can be used for various applications, such as detecting and counting objects in a scene, understanding their motions, and recognizing activities.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-What-Are-The-Difficulties-Of-Object-Tracking-1"><a href="#Part-3-What-Are-The-Difficulties-Of-Object-Tracking-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. What Are The Difficulties Of Object Tracking?"></a>Part 3. What Are The Difficulties Of Object Tracking?</h2><p>As what has been mentioned above, the use of object tracking is versatile. However, there are some challenges associated with Object Tracking, such as:</p>
<p><strong>Background Clutter:</strong> The background can impact extracting an object’s features. If the background is more densely populated, detecting or tracking the object of interest can be more difficult.</p>
<p><strong>Occlusion:</strong> This is a phenomenon where the object being tracked is affected by the background or foreground. This causes the tracking algorithm to get confused due to multiple objects coming close together, hence, losing track of the object.</p>
<p><strong>Varying spatial scales:</strong> Varying spatial scales refer to the target object being of a different size or shape, which can confuse the algorithm, leading to errors.</p>
<p><strong>Training and Tracking Speed:</strong> If the object is moving too fast or is too small, it can be difficult to track. Therefore, the tracking module has to be designed to track, identify, and localize objects in a matter of seconds.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-Stages-Of-The-Object-Tracking-Process-1"><a href="#Part-4-Stages-Of-The-Object-Tracking-Process-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Stages Of The Object Tracking Process"></a>Part 4. Stages Of The Object Tracking Process</h2><p>After the introduction of object tracking technically, let’s learn about its mechanism of it from two sides: periods of the working process and the way it tracks.</p>
<h3 id="1-Stages-Of-The-Object-Tracking-Process-1"><a href="#1-Stages-Of-The-Object-Tracking-Process-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Stages Of The Object Tracking Process"></a>1. Stages Of The Object Tracking Process</h3><p>Following are the stages of the Object Tracking process:</p>
<p><strong>Target Initialization</strong></p>
<p>Target initialization is the first step in Object Tracking and involves defining the targets or objects of interest and drawing a bounding box around them in the initial frame. After that, the tracker has to detect the position of the object in the frame while drawing the bounding box.</p>
<p><strong>Appearance Modeling</strong></p>
<p>Appearance modeling is important for understanding how an object will look under different circumstances. If the object being tracked changes appearance due to different lighting, angle, or speed, the tracking algorithm may lose its information and the object itself. Therefore, it has to be conducted to let the algorithm detect the changes and distortion.</p>
<p><strong>Motion Estimation</strong></p>
<p>Motion estimation entails the capacity of the model to anticipate an object’s future position with precision.</p>
<p><strong>Target Positioning</strong></p>
<p>Motion estimation is a process of approximating the most likely region where an object could be present. After the object’s location is approximated, a visual model can be used to determine the target’s location more accurately.</p>
<h3 id="2-Methods-Of-Object-Tracking-1"><a href="#2-Methods-Of-Object-Tracking-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Methods Of Object Tracking"></a>2. Methods Of Object Tracking</h3><p>Here’re some methods of Object Tracking:</p>
<p><strong>OpenCV-Based Object Tracking</strong></p>
<p><strong>OpenCV Object Tracking</strong> method is widely used because it offers several built-in functions designed specifically for this purpose, such as GOTURN, MIL, MediandFlow, and CSRT. The tracker type you select will depend on your specific application design. Each tracker has its pros and cons, so there is not a single type of tracker ideal for all applications.</p>
<p><strong>MDNet</strong></p>
<p>Multi-Domain Convolutional Neural Network Tracker is a convolutional neural-based visual tracker and has won the VOT2015 challenge. Moreover, it is composed of domain-specific layers, branches, and multiple shared layers.</p>
<p>The MDNetT tracker is a deep neural network that is trained on numerous Object Tracking datasets. The tracker is designed to work in multiple domains, including video, text, and images.</p>
<p><strong>DeepSort</strong></p>
<p>DeepSort algorithm can track objects in real-time and uses YOLO v3 to compute the bounding boxes around the objects in a frame.</p>
<p>DeepSort uses Kalman filter from Simple Online and Realtime Tracking algorithm and an identification model, ReID to interlink bounding boxes and object tracks.</p>
<p><strong>ROLO</strong></p>
<p>ROLO is a novel Object Tracking method that uses recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to learn object-specific Spatio-temporal representations. This method works with YOLO, an object detection algorithm, and an LTSM for determining the trajectory of an object.</p>
<h2 id="Part-5-The-powerful-backup-OpenCV-1"><a href="#Part-5-The-powerful-backup-OpenCV-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 5. The powerful backup: OpenCV"></a>Part 5. The powerful backup: OpenCV</h2><p>We have demonstrated how powerful OpenCV Tracking is and how it works. However, do you wonder what OpenCV is? How it supports the tracking goals being achieved? In this part, we will focus on OpenCV and help you better understand the the underlying mechanisms.</p>
<h3 id="1-What-Is-OpenCV-1"><a href="#1-What-Is-OpenCV-1" class="headerlink" title="1. What Is OpenCV?"></a>1. What Is OpenCV?</h3><p>OpenCV is a powerful library that allows you to perform image processing, deep learning, machine learning, and computer vision tasks on live video feeds. Moreover, it can be used to detect objects, track their movements, and recognize faces.</p>
<p>It can help process the data that have videos and images and has been used in various applications, such as object recognition and detection, autonomous cars, robots, medical image analysis, automated surveillance, and anomaly detection.</p>
