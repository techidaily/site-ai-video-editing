<p>Mobile applications with user-friendly interface, allowing us to manipulate the footage quickly, easily choose our preferred formats and effects and adjust the clips according to the requirements our target platforms set; more time-consuming and advanced software with even more options, but which seem to require us to be more skilled and experienced in editing.</p>
<p>Even though editing, as other innovative and creative actions, is limitless in its possibilities, sometimes we just need to make a little change in our project and it’s quite enough for us to be satisfied with our work and material. One of the things which is rather simple to do, but sometimes essential, when it comes to making our clips better and more picturesque for the audience, is cropping a video.</p>
<p>Cropping, in its essence, is great to “hide” some unnecessary objects in our video, and&#x2F;or highlight the main ones. In this article, we discuss how to crop a video in a software called DaVinci Resolve, in simple little steps, how to export our work and lastly, what would be the alternate way to do the same in other computer program.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-crop-a-video-in-Davinci-Resolve"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-crop-a-video-in-Davinci-Resolve" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How to crop a video in Davinci Resolve"></a>Part 1. How to crop a video in Davinci Resolve</h2><p>First and foremost, let’s get to know Davinci Resolve! As mentioned above, it is a software, so let’s be well-aware that we have to download and install it on our computer systems. Of course, it takes a bit of time, but to be able to use an advanced software, it’s totally worth it. If we are to search for the information about Davinci Resolve, we come across the following description: “color grading and non-linear video editing application for macOS, Windows, and Linux”. So, no matter which system we have, we can count on this software, which is a real advantage!</p>

                      alt="crop-video-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>To touch upon the functions, Davinci Resolve includes modules for video editing, color correction, audio mixing and effects, and visual effects. The interface of it is quite advanced, but would be well and soon understandable for someone who has ever used a similar editing software, such as Adobe Premiere Pro. If you are interested in everything the software has to offer, we recommend watching this very viral beginner <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63Ln33O4p4c" >tutorial <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>Now, back to cropping – so, you want to crop the video you took or got somehow, and you also think about using Davinci Resolve? Cropping, in most cases, meaning different applications, platforms and software, is not a complicated task at all, and you can do it in a very short amount of time in Davinci Resolve, too. Therefore, let’s delve into the steps on how to do it!</p>
<p>First, download and install the software, and when it is finished, launch it. You will see a totally clean program, until you add the video you want to work on. To do so, you have to find File in the top menu, find Import and then choose Media.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-davinci-2.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>Then it will open a new window where you can choose your file…</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-davinci-3.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>Your chosen file will be added in Media Pool, and to direct it into the sequence, you have to drag and drop it there.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-davinci-4.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-davinci"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-davinci-5.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>And then you might have difficulty to find the crop button. But here it is – below the screen, on the left, there are two icons, and the second one says – Tools…</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="crop-video-davinci"
                ></p>
<p> Click on the Tools button and more options will appear down the screen where the video clip is shown. And there, you will notice the famous Crop icon, just the second one, which will put your clip in a new window with the option below to crop each side, plus, to add feather around the cropped video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="crop-video-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>When you are ready to make a video bigger and adjust it to a frame size, you need to choose Transform button, left to the Crop icon. You can “touch” the dots on the video and manually manage the size of your cropped clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="crop-video-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>When you are ready to save the video you cropped, find Quick Export – you will see the button above the clip, on the right. A little window with settings will appear, so you can choose the format you want to save your video in, and then, of course, click on Export for the last time.</p>

                     lazyload

<p>First off, we start in the same way – download and install Wondershare Filmora X. Oh – maybe, that is the step you have already taken?..</p>
<p>Click on Import Media Files Here, which will let you add the file(s) you are going to crop.</p>

<p>So, in this article, we have discussed software Davinci Resolve and how to crop a video there. A step by step, written guides help you make the best out of your video clips and never lose track of what you are doing, also, comparing different video editing platforms and tools will make you understand which one works best for you or&#x2F;and your company. Another part of this article was Wondershare Filmora X and how to crop a video there, also, with a detailed guide there. We hope you know a little more about programs, editing, and your own choice!</p>
<p>To touch upon the functions, Davinci Resolve includes modules for video editing, color correction, audio mixing and effects, and visual effects. The interface of it is quite advanced, but would be well and soon understandable for someone who has ever used a similar editing software, such as Adobe Premiere Pro. If you are interested in everything the software has to offer, we recommend watching this very viral beginner <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63Ln33O4p4c" >tutorial <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>Now, back to cropping – so, you want to crop the video you took or got somehow, and you also think about using Davinci Resolve? Cropping, in most cases, meaning different applications, platforms and software, is not a complicated task at all, and you can do it in a very short amount of time in Davinci Resolve, too. Therefore, let’s delve into the steps on how to do it!</p>
<p>First, download and install the software, and when it is finished, launch it. You will see a totally clean program, until you add the video you want to work on. To do so, you have to find File in the top menu, find Import and then choose Media.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-davinci-2.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>Then it will open a new window where you can choose your file…</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-davinci-3.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>Your chosen file will be added in Media Pool, and to direct it into the sequence, you have to drag and drop it there.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-davinci-4.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-davinci"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-davinci-5.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>And then you might have difficulty to find the crop button. But here it is – below the screen, on the left, there are two icons, and the second one says – Tools…</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-davinci-6.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-davinci"
                ></p>
<p> Click on the Tools button and more options will appear down the screen where the video clip is shown. And there, you will notice the famous Crop icon, just the second one, which will put your clip in a new window with the option below to crop each side, plus, to add feather around the cropped video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-davinci-7.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>When you are ready to make a video bigger and adjust it to a frame size, you need to choose Transform button, left to the Crop icon. You can “touch” the dots on the video and manually manage the size of your cropped clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-davinci-8.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-davinci"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/crop-video-davinci-9.jpeg"
                      alt="crop-video-davinci"
                ></p>
<p>When you are ready to save the video you cropped, find Quick Export – you will see the button above the clip, on the right. A little window with settings will appear, so you can choose the format you want to save your video in, and then, of course, click on Export for the last time.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h2 id="Top-10-Sony-LUT-for-Different-Purposes"><a href="#Top-10-Sony-LUT-for-Different-Purposes" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 Sony LUT for Different Purposes"></a>Top 10 Sony LUT for Different Purposes</h2><p>If you’ve ever worked in the color grading profession, you’re aware of how time-consuming and labor-intensive it is to achieve a specific look on a scene. To master color grading, you must practice constantly, one of the reasons for the existence of specialists in this field. While everybody can color grade, not everyone can do it well. People in this business have devised remedies to make the editing workflow considerably more accessible and less time-consuming.</p>
<p>Achieving a specific ambiance in a scene demands ongoing effort and naturally takes longer. LUTs, or Lookup Tables, were created as a result. LUTs are ideal for storing a set of colors to use later or in another program. A LUT is the most effective technique to color or alters your image’s colors.</p>
<h2 id="Benefits-of-using-LUTs"><a href="#Benefits-of-using-LUTs" class="headerlink" title="Benefits of using LUTs"></a>Benefits of using LUTs</h2><p>There are numerous advantages to using lookup tables to edit your footage. We’ve already discussed that it helps to give your films a more polished and professional appearance, which is one of the primary explanations why individuals use LUTs, but there are many more.</p>
<h3 id="1-A-beginning-towards-professionalism"><a href="#1-A-beginning-towards-professionalism" class="headerlink" title="1. A beginning towards professionalism"></a>1. A beginning towards professionalism</h3><p>This is a fantastic approach for beginners to have a good idea of how to build their own trademark looks in their videos. The time it takes to develop your color grading craft is unavoidable. So, as a novice, LUTs will come in useful for you to establish your approach and save your ass, big time.</p>
<p>You’ll eventually come up with a blend of your own LUTs to use, resulting in your own LUT. Not only will LUTs aid in color grading learning, but they will also save funds and resources. You will not only devote time to learning color grading, but you will also spend a significant amount of money on color grading tools and equipment, such as software and color panels. You’ll see why color grading equipment is necessary when you get to this point.</p>
<p>However, for the time being, employing LUTs is the most cost-effective way to obtain a cinematic look.</p>
<h3 id="2-It-saves-your-time"><a href="#2-It-saves-your-time" class="headerlink" title="2. It saves your time"></a>2. It saves your time</h3><p>Because LUTs are predefined colors used to establish a specific look on a picture, they save you time. Having a trustworthy LUT to use for video will save the life of freelance editors who are constantly meeting commitments and modifications. Isn’t the purpose of color grading to generate a visual emotion for your movie? So, with LUTs, you can create one without going through the time-consuming process of manual color correction. Only one-color preset will be applied to all scenes in a single LUT.</p>
<p>However, there’s a good probability that it won’t look the same in all of the images. This is where you’ll adjust the colors to make them more evenly match the film. It’s nothing significant most of the time, just some little saturation adjustments, etc.</p>
<h3 id="3-Work-on-a-budget"><a href="#3-Work-on-a-budget" class="headerlink" title="3. Work on a budget"></a>3. Work on a budget</h3><p>Time spent in a color-grade suite may be highly costly, and it can lead your films to go over budget in order to achieve a specific aesthetic. LUTs, on the other hand, are available for free online or for a fee for more complex versions. Even if you buy your LUTs, you could save thousands of dollars based on the size of your film. LUTs can also assist you in meeting tight deadlines, and setting targets too optimistically is something I’m sure we’ve all done at some point.</p>
<p>Whether it’s a client or a personal project, things can often get pushed to the last minute, so having something in your arsenal that can save you time is always a good bonus. There are, however, projects where you need to appear competent without investing a lot of time on them due to budget limits; this is where a lookup table comes in handy because you can modify the complete style of your movie in a matter of seconds by pressing a few buttons. Even complicated editing can be completed quickly, giving you more time to work on other tasks that will earn you more money.</p>
<h3 id="4-It-provides-an-artistic-approach"><a href="#4-It-provides-an-artistic-approach" class="headerlink" title="4. It provides an artistic approach"></a>4. It provides an artistic approach</h3><p>LUTs are beneficial because they allow videos shot with cameras that shoot very dark, discolored images to have more vivid tones and contrast. This is excellent for grabbing viewers’ attention and making videos more intriguing and engaging. LUTs add an artistic element to videos and can help you develop a visual artistic identity for your videos if you use the same colors. Another advantage of LUTs is that they enhance the color quality of videos shot on smartphones with particular color schemes. Although this varies significantly from brand to brand, you can use LUTs to make a Smartphone video more vibrant and appealing.</p>
