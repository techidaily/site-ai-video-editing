<p>YouTube is a video sharing platform that is popular among people of all age groups. It was launched back in the year 2007 by 3 PayPal employees. Now, it has become the world’s largest search engine and visited websites after Google. It is the abode of the modern world that has something for everyone.</p>
<p>Per day, people spend approximately 1 billion hours watching videos on YouTube. At the same time, the users of YouTube upload approximately 300 hours of video per minute. But, do you know like Google, this video platform works on a technique known as the <strong>YouTube AI algorithm</strong>? The platform highly depends on these algorithms to deliver content to the viewers. As YouTube is overloaded with content, AI is a powerful weapon that helps to decide the video recommendation for the huge number of users. This recommendation system for YouTube works on certain factors.</p>

Its first aim is helping the viewers easily get what they want to watch. The second aim of YouTube’s algorithm is to maximize the satisfaction rate of viewers which ultimately leads to long term engagement.</p>

The working of the <strong>YouTube algorithm AI</strong> depends on several factors. It decides the position of videos at 6 different places as per the viewer’s interest. These locations include:</p>
<p>Notifications, Channel subscriptions, Trending streams, YouTube’s homepage, Recommended streams, and Search results.</p>
<p>Let’s understand some more facts about the working of the YouTube algorithm.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> External factors i.e. the overall audience or market</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Performance i.e. the success rate of video</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Personalization i.e. the history and preferences of viewers</p>

The selection of these videos is based on performance and personalization. Performance is measured depending on the metrics such as viewer surveys, likes, dislikes, average percentage viewed, average view duration, and click-through rates. Personalization means the selection of videos based on the past behavior of the viewers.</p>

Everything You Need to Know About HDRI"></a>What Is HDRI? Everything You Need to Know About HDRI</h2><p>Photography is like art itself. Photographers must carefully select the setting and use the right camera to capture images with lossless quality. However, you’ll realize that some photos appear darker or brighter than in actual life.</p>
<p>In that case, use <strong>free HDRI</strong> software to change that straightway. But HDRI being a relatively new technique, beginners might struggle to edit the photos, let alone find the perfect HDRI software.</p>
<p>So, in this simple guidepost, we’ll learn how to create an HDRI 3D picture using <strong>HDRI for Blender</strong>. But first, let’s understand what an HDRI file is and the difference between HDRI and HDR.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-HDRI"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-HDRI" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is HDRI?"></a>Part 1: What is HDRI?</h2><p>HDRI (High Dynamic Range Image) is simply an image created using multiple image overlays of the same background but with varying exposures. The exposures can range from the brightest highlights to the darkest shadows. So, in short, HDRI expands an image’s dynamic range to brighten or darken it and make it look more natural.</p>
<p>Having said that, HDRI is a raster image created using color pixels. HDRI photos are generally significant in size, so they won’t quickly lose quality like other raster photos such as PNG and JPG. Many formats can store HDRI images, although the most common are OpenEXR (.exr) and Radiance RGBE (.hdr).</p>
<p> Pros</p>
<ul>
<li>You can easily create one using HDRI for Blender, Photoshop, EasyHDRI, etc.</li>
<li>HDRI photos are compatible with many image editing programs.</li>
<li>Produces crisp images with excellent detail and lighting control.</li>
</ul>
<p> Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>32-bit HDRI files have significant sizes.</li>
<li>HDRI can quickly be poorly done without prior experience.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Part-2-What’s-the-difference-between-HDR-and-HDRI"><a href="#Part-2-What’s-the-difference-between-HDR-and-HDRI" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What’s the difference between HDR and HDRI"></a>Part 2: What’s the difference between HDR and HDRI</h2><p>According to Wikipedia, HDR and HDRI are the same things. But is it true? For starters, HDRI is basically a photo with High Dynamic Range qualities. So, yes, HDR and HDRI can mean the same thing in digital image editing.</p>
<p>However, some photo editors argue that there is a difference between these two regarding basic workflow. First, HDR technology increases brightness to show more image details. On the other hand, HDRI performs unique optimization of content and lighting to deliver crisp images. In other words, HDRI brightens the dark shadows without necessarily overexposing the bright image areas.</p>
<p>Some photographers can also consider HDR as images with pixel values higher than 1 or 255. That means that the pixels can be much higher than pure white. But technically speaking, HDR and HDRI can be used interchangeably.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-When-to-use-HDRI"><a href="#Part-3-When-to-use-HDRI" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: When to use HDRI"></a>Part 3: When to use HDRI</h2><p>Now that you have all the information about HDRI, let’s learn about some industries where HDRI is applicable.</p>
<h3 id="1-HDRI-for-3D-visualization-and-3D-animation"><a href="#1-HDRI-for-3D-visualization-and-3D-animation" class="headerlink" title="1. HDRI for 3D visualization and 3D animation"></a>1. HDRI for 3D visualization and 3D animation</h3><p><strong>HDRI 3D</strong> is commonplace these days. 3D animation creators can use programs like <strong>HDRI Blender</strong> to add HDR environments and make the content look detailed and more realistic in high lighting reflections. To put it simply, HDRI makes 3D scenes look lighter, less cartoonish, and more professional. This technology can also be used in interior visualizations in animations.</p>

So, to open an HDRI file on a non-HDR display, you’ll need to convert it to a different low dynamic range format using tone mapping technology. For example, you convert HDRI to JPEG or PNG and enjoy regular bitmaps while maintaining the HDRI properties. You can also open and edit HDRI using desktop programs like EasyHDR, Photoshop, and Blender.</p>

<p>Part 2: What’s the difference between HDR and HDRI</p>
<p>According to Wikipedia, HDR and HDRI are the same things. But is it true? For starters, HDRI is basically a photo with High Dynamic Range qualities. So, yes, HDR and HDRI can mean the same thing in digital image editing.</p>
<p>However, some photo editors argue that there is a difference between these two regarding basic workflow. First, HDR technology increases brightness to show more image details. On the other hand, HDRI performs unique optimization of content and lighting to deliver crisp images. In other words, HDRI brightens the dark shadows without necessarily overexposing the bright image areas.</p>
<p>Some photographers can also consider HDR as images with pixel values higher than 1 or 255. That means that the pixels can be much higher than pure white. But technically speaking, HDR and HDRI can be used interchangeably.</p>

To put it simply, HDRI makes 3D scenes look lighter, less cartoonish, and more professional. This technology can also be used in interior visualizations in animations.</p>

Distribution</h2><p>Distribution is the final stage of production, which happens after the film has been edited, and is ready for release. Many film makers and production companies will advertise the movie’s trailer on social media and the general internet to target the audience that loves the type of movie that has been made. They will either see it on social media or on television to drive people to theaters to watch the movie and get them into the story. A lot of movies have follow-ups when it’s been received really well creating a storyline.</p>

<h6 id="▷-Deliver-the-Emotion-1"><a href="#▷-Deliver-the-Emotion-1" class="headerlink" title="▷ Deliver the Emotion"></a>▷ Deliver the Emotion</h6><p>Many sound effects are placed into the film to deliver the emotion and get the viewer onto the edge of their seat as it amplifies the moment.</p>

Distribution</h2><p>Distribution is the final stage of production, which happens after the film has been edited, and is ready for release. Many film makers and production companies will advertise the movie’s trailer on social media and the general internet to target the audience that loves the type of movie that has been made. They will either see it on social media or on television to drive people to theaters to watch the movie and get them into the story. A lot of movies have follow-ups when it’s been received really well creating a storyline.</p>
