There are currently more than 2.5 billion gamers, and most of them love watching gaming video content on YouTube. Whether people use a montage to parody gaming montages themselves or show off their skills, the effort and time put into them create impressive results.</p>
<p>We will explain how to create gaming montages and give you some tips that you might want to keep in mind to make epic videos.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Make-a-Gaming-Montage"><a href="#How-to-Make-a-Gaming-Montage" class="headerlink" title="How to Make a Gaming Montage"></a>How to Make a Gaming Montage</h2><p>You have several options when it comes to creating gaming montages. You can include a random cut of great scenes, a mixture of the highlighted moments you found thrilling and would like to share with other gamers. In other cases, you’ll have to think of an engaging story in advance, then base your gameplay on this story.</p>
<p>Essentially, the workflow will be slightly different for these two scenarios. It’s much easier with the random cut type, especially when using a reliable video editor. Editing montages is as exciting as playing the game.</p>
<p>With that in mind, here is how to make a gaming montage.</p>
<h3 id="1-Decide-Your-Montage-Story-Type"><a href="#1-Decide-Your-Montage-Story-Type" class="headerlink" title="1) Decide Your Montage Story&#x2F;Type"></a>1) Decide Your Montage Story&#x2F;Type</h3><p>Deciding your montage type beforehand helps clear your mind and create an epic gaming montage that will keep viewers watching. It allows you to choose the relevant video clips for your gaming montage.</p>
<p>Choose the topic of the video and decide the length of each clip and the sequence of the clips. Be sure to put the most epic or funny clips in the last section of your video. And this will make your viewers watch the video until the end.</p>
<h3 id="2-Record-Your-Gameplay-Footage"><a href="#2-Record-Your-Gameplay-Footage" class="headerlink" title="2) Record Your Gameplay Footage"></a>2) Record Your Gameplay Footage</h3><p>The methods to capture the gameplay varies depending on the platform where the game is. The most important thing you have to keep in mind is to ensure your recorder supports Replay Buffer; this will allow you to record scenes that occurred minutes or seconds ago.</p>
<p>That means you do not need to record the gameplay the whole time and burn your hardware. Instead, you’ll capture the moment after interesting things occur.</p>
<p>Game consoles like PS4 allow you to record the video natively for a maximum of one hour with the gamepad. A capture card lets you record it longer than 60 minutes.</p>
<p>Once you’ve all the clips you want on your PC, head over to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://filmora.wondershare.net/filmora-video-editor.html" >https://filmora.wondershare.net/filmora-video-editor.html <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and download Filmora and install the software on your computer.

<p>By right-clicking on the clip in your timeline, you’ll see the options to zoom, speed, change, split, or trim your videos. You can also add sound effects by going to the Audio Tab.</p>

He did the project with Apel, an artist who designed the Fever Dream series skins in the video.</p>
<p>The basic idea of this gaming montage was that the main game character is a corrupted policeman with purple glowing eyes because he’s not human.</p>
<p>When the edits begin, the shape of the main character will shift from CS: GO CT models and turn into his real corrupt CT shape. So that’s why his name keeps changing. You can get his real identity by pausing some of the frames and looking at the “Killfeed.”</p>
