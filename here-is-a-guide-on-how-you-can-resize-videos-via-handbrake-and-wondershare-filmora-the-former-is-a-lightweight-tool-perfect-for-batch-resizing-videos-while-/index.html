The Former Is a Lightweight Tool Perfect for Batch Resizing Videos, While the Latter Is a Powerful Free Video Editing Software</h2><p>Videos are a great medium to share thoughts, concepts, guides, and memories, but regardless of how far technology has come getting them online can pose an issue sometimes. These obstacles often tend to be because either a video clip is too long or the amount of data in it is so high that the service just cannot upload the file to its servers and make it available for the intended receiver.</p>
<p>To solve this issue, users often need to resize a video so that the data cap, which behaved as a restriction, is no longer applicable. Now, there exist multiple software that can do this, and most video editor programs include the ability to export videos in less data-hungry sizes or formats.</p>
<p>So, if you ever face a similar issue, here is a guide on how you can resize videos via Handbrake and Wondershare Filmora. The former is a lightweight tool perfect for batch resizing videos, while the latter is a powerful free video editing software.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-resize-video-with-Handbrake"><a href="#How-to-resize-video-with-Handbrake" class="headerlink" title="How to resize video with Handbrake"></a>How to resize video with Handbrake</h2><p>Open Handbrake and follow the steps listed below.</p>
<p>Once open, the software will present you with options to either import a single video file for resize or a whole batch via folder selection.</p>
<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> <em>If you do not have Handbrake, you can</em> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://handbrake.fr/"><em>download it by visiting the official website</em></a><em>. Also, you will need</em> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0/runtime?utm_source=getdotnetcore&utm_medium=referral"><em>Windows .NET Framework 6.0</em></a> <em>to use Handbrake.</em> <em>If your system does not have the correct config Handbrake will let you know and fail to launch.</em></p>
<p>Once you have imported the video file, the software will present you with two choices.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Option 1:</strong> Use a preset available in the application — the best choice for beginners to choose for beginners.</li>
<li><strong>Option 2:</strong> Set a custom resolution via the Dimensions Tab.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> <em>To ensure the resize is perfect, find out which file format plays best with the end location of your video and convert the video clip to that version.</em></p>

<p>For macOS 10.14 or later</p>
<p>Just keep in mind, when using WonderShare Filmora the resize option appears at the end of the video editing process — during the export action.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Import a video file into Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="resize-video-in-handbrake"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Drag the video file onto the timeline and then choose Export from the top bar.</p>
<p><strong>Author’s Notes:</strong> Here, I recommend using the Export to Device option as having a local copy which you then manually upload to services like YouTube is a process that you can have more control over.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-13.jpeg"
                      alt="resize-video-in-handbrake"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Choose the video file format (marked in Red) and then choose the resolution you require (marked in Yellow).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-14.jpeg"
                      alt="resize-video-in-handbrake"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip</strong></p>
<p>If you press on the settings tab (marked in Yellow, in the image above) and choose custom you can modify more aspects of your video file. Including the configuration used by the audio components.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-15.jpeg"
                      alt="resize-video-in-handbrake"
                ></p>
<p>Choose Custom under the Settings Option to customise Video Details with more precision</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Click on Export once you’ve decided on the resolution.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-16.jpeg"
                      alt="resize-video-in-handbrake"
                ></p>
<p>With this you will now have a video file that has been resized to a size or converted to a format that will hopefully function well with your desired platform.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can also reset the resolution of an entire project before hand in Wondershare Filmora by choosing the right configuration from the <strong>Project Settings</strong> option, found under the <strong>File Tab</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<h2 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>Having read this piece, you may have noticed that software capable of resizing videos can prove quite useful. Wondershare Filmora is this, plus a lot more, its convenient and intuitive user interface is also something we believe will feel welcoming to users. Speaking of Handbrake, while effective and great for batch encoding — if you want to resize more than one video we recommend having Handbrake handy — its bare-bones interface can be intimidating. Regardless, both programs are convenient to utilize and perfectly capable of doing the task at hand with relative ease.</p>

<p>The one thing to keep in mind while using Option 2 is to ensure that the aspect ratio of the video file is maintained; this will prevent the final video from looking like its skewed and prevent it from becoming too tall or too wide</p>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click on the Dimensions Tab to open up a dialog box that will let you edit video resolution.</p>

<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-10.jpeg"
                      alt="resize-video-in-handbrake"
                ></p>
<p>The Dimensions Dialog Box</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Modify resolution to ensure the clip you get is in the right setup.</p>
<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> <em>If you see 1920 x 1080 on your screen, the first number (1920) stands for the width of the video file, while the second number (1080) stands for the height.</em></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-11.jpeg"
                      alt="resize-video-in-handbrake"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip</strong></p>
<p>The one thing to keep in mind while using Option 2 is to ensure that the aspect ratio of the video file is maintained; this will prevent the final video from looking like its skewed and prevent it from becoming too tall or too wide</p>
<p><em>Via Option 2 you can also add borders to the final video if desired, while resizing it to your liked resolution.</em></p>

Hence, if you’re just starting to learn, we recommend accessing more user-friendly software, say Wondershare <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .

<p>For macOS 10.14 or later</p>
<p>Just keep in mind, when using WonderShare Filmora the resize option appears at the end of the video editing process — during the export action.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Import a video file into Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-12.jpeg"
                      alt="resize-video-in-handbrake"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Drag the video file onto the timeline and then choose Export from the top bar.</p>
<p><strong>Author’s Notes:</strong> Here, I recommend using the Export to Device option as having a local copy which you then manually upload to services like YouTube is a process that you can have more control over.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-13.jpeg"
                      alt="resize-video-in-handbrake"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Choose the video file format (marked in Red) and then choose the resolution you require (marked in Yellow).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-14.jpeg"
                      alt="resize-video-in-handbrake"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip</strong></p>
<p>If you press on the settings tab (marked in Yellow, in the image above) and choose custom you can modify more aspects of your video file. Including the configuration used by the audio components.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-15.jpeg"
                      alt="resize-video-in-handbrake"
                ></p>
<p>Choose Custom under the Settings Option to customise Video Details with more precision</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Click on Export once you’ve decided on the resolution.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/resize-video-in-handbrake-16.jpeg"
                      alt="resize-video-in-handbrake"
                ></p>
<p>With this you will now have a video file that has been resized to a size or converted to a format that will hopefully function well with your desired platform.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can also reset the resolution of an entire project before hand in Wondershare Filmora by choosing the right configuration from the <strong>Project Settings</strong> option, found under the <strong>File Tab</strong>.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h2 id="The-Bottom-Line-3"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line-3" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>Having read this piece, you may have noticed that software capable of resizing videos can prove quite useful. Wondershare Filmora is this, plus a lot more, its convenient and intuitive user interface is also something we believe will feel welcoming to users. Speaking of Handbrake, while effective and great for batch encoding — if you want to resize more than one video we recommend having Handbrake handy — its bare-bones interface can be intimidating. Regardless, both programs are convenient to utilize and perfectly capable of doing the task at hand with relative ease.</p>

<h2 id="Related-FAQs"><a href="#Related-FAQs" class="headerlink" title="Related FAQs"></a>Related FAQs</h2><p>1.Is Making AMV illegal?</p>
