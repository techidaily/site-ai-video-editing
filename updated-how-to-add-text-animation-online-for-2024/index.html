<h2 id="How-to-Zoom-Picture-in-Picture-Easy-Solution"><a href="#How-to-Zoom-Picture-in-Picture-Easy-Solution" class="headerlink" title="How to Zoom Picture in Picture [Easy Solution]"></a>How to Zoom Picture in Picture [Easy Solution]</h2><p>Zoom is one of the greatest options on the market for video conferencing. It doesn’t matter whether you use it at home or in an office environment; it will quickly link the team members. One of the most popular video conferencing programs is Zoom. When in-person meetings aren’t feasible, it enables you to communicate electronically with employees, and it’s been a major popularity for social occasions as well. In case you’re not acquainted, picture-in-picture mode enables you to watch videos from one app while using your PC normally. The movie will keep playing in a tiny thumbnail window so that two applications may work simultaneously on your smartphone.</p>
<p>You may create virtual audio and video conferences, webinars, live chats, screen sharing, and other collaboration tools with Zoom, a cloud-based video communications solution. Zoom’s most recent iPhone apps let you dismiss a Zoom Meeting while keeping the Zoom video call open in a picture-in-picture mode. To join a Zoom conference, you don’t need an account, and because the software works with Mac, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android devices, nearly anybody can use it. Since using Zoom’s picture-in-picture mode is the same as using it with other applications, you shouldn’t have any trouble if you often use PiP mode. Here are the top 4 methods you can refer to picture in picture in Zoom.</p>
<h2 id="Method-1-Swap-Shared-Screen-with-Video"><a href="#Method-1-Swap-Shared-Screen-with-Video" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Swap Shared Screen with Video"></a>Method 1: Swap Shared Screen with Video</h2><p>You may move the Zoom Meeting PiP window across the screen, change the thumbnail’s size, and utilize other applications while it remains open, just like any other picture-in-picture window. Before leaving the meeting if you’re not giving a presentation or speaking, you should definitely mute Zoom on your iPhone to prevent noises from your typing or other activities from entering the conversation. Additionally, keep in mind to switch off the camera if you’re engaged in something distracting, at least for the duration of your activity. To reopen the Zoom Meeting and go back to the Zoom app, touch the Picture-in-Picture mode pane. Here are some actions to keep in mind:</p>

The Blackmagic ATEM Mini is a USB video interface and HDMI switcher. Four HDMI inputs, or four cameras that can produce an HDMI video stream, may be switched between live.

It connects to a computer via a USB-C to USB-A connection. The video feed may then be sent to distant colleagues via a number of well-liked videos streaming services, including Zoom.</p>
<p>Step1The ATEM Mini Pro is a basic control switcher with pro-broadcast performance. Your ATEM Mini Pro is really simple to set up. You can connect a full setup with several cameras and microphones in around 30 minutes.</p>

<p>Step2You may connect several camera sources to the inputs of the ATEM Mini Pro. The 4 HDMI inputs each have a separate standards converter built in. As a result, the ATEM Mini can automatically convert inputs that are 1080p, 1080i, or 720p to the switcher’s video standard. You may make quick changes between inputs with no latency or disruption to your video output by using the ergonomic buttons.</p>

<h5 id="Step2Select-Overlay-Effect"><a href="#Step2Select-Overlay-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Step2Select Overlay Effect"></a>Step2Select Overlay Effect</h5><p>Secondly, choose the Effects workspace (located near the top of your window). This will guarantee that the tools we need are accessible. Alternately, you may go to Window &gt; Workspaces &gt; Effects.</p>

<h5 id="Step3Create-a-layer-of-adjustments"><a href="#Step3Create-a-layer-of-adjustments" class="headerlink" title="Step3Create a layer of adjustments"></a>Step3Create a layer of adjustments</h5><p>Go to File &gt; New &gt; Adjustment Layer to begin. Make sure your Project panel is chosen if the option is not accessible. Your clip and sequence will show up in your Project panel with the adjustment layer. Add the timeline with the adjustment layer selected.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h5 id="Step4Create-the-Video-Overlay"><a href="#Step4Create-the-Video-Overlay" class="headerlink" title="Step4Create the Video Overlay"></a>Step4Create the Video Overlay</h5><p>Transitions, generators, audio effects, and video effects are all included under the Effects panel. We’ll begin by selecting the 4-Color Gradient from the “Generate” folder, which contains generators for patterns and gradients, to produce the video overlay effect. Right-click on the adjustment layer in the timeline and drag the appropriate effect there.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<h5 id="Step5Change-the-Effect-Control"><a href="#Step5Change-the-Effect-Control" class="headerlink" title="Step5Change the Effect Control"></a>Step5Change the Effect Control</h5><p>In the Effect Controls panel, you may manage and adjust effects. You may change the default effect settings for each element in your timeline, such as size and opacity, under the Effect Controls panel along with any additional effects you’ve added. To access an item’s effect controls, click on it in the timeline.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="change effects control pr"
                ></p>
<p>By selecting the ‘Show all properties’ next to the adjustment layer in your timeline, you can get a before-and-after comparison. Increase the value by selecting “blend with original.” To change the effect’s strength, move this up and down.</p>
<h5 id="Step6Save-the-Project"><a href="#Step6Save-the-Project" class="headerlink" title="Step6Save the Project"></a>Step6Save the Project</h5><p>Try switching the linear mode to radial. You can make a color transition for circles by doing this. You will be able to highlight various things with color after this transition. The circle’s starting point may be animated to follow a certain item in the scene.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="save the project pr"
                ></p>
<p>To the right of the Presets drop-down menu, choose the Auto Save button. Check the Save Effects Settings box when the Choose a Name dialog box appears. Future exports made with this preset will automatically take into account any Image Overlay settings you’ve configured.</p>
