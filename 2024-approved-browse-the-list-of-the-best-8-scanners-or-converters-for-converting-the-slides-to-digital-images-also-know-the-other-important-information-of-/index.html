Therefore, it is beneficial to convert those slides into digital form. There are also many benefits of this conversion such as:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Preserving the photos for future generations without the fear of getting them lost or damaged.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Old slides might fade up and you can give them a brand new look by using new tools and technologies.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The organization becomes much easier than the physical ones.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It will create less clutter.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> You can share the pictures with just one click with your friends, family members, etc to flourish the memories.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It lets you enjoy your old memories in a better and more enhanced way.</p>
<p>So, you might have understood why there is a need for <strong>converting slides to pictures.</strong> Now, let’s dig down more on the topic.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Convert-Slides-to-Digital-Step-by-Step-Guide"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Convert-Slides-to-Digital-Step-by-Step-Guide" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to Convert Slides to Digital - Step-by-Step Guide"></a>Part 2 How to Convert Slides to Digital - Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Here, we will discuss step-by-step ways to turn the old slides into digital images. So, let’s begin:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Resolution</strong></p>
<p>The very first step for <strong>converting slides to digital photos</strong> is measuring and fixing the resolution of the slides. The technical measurement of image resolution is DPI (dot per inch). It helps you to predict the sharpness or clarity of the final image. The overall measurement depends on the size of the slide and the type of converter or scanner you are using. For example,</p>
<p>A 35 mm slide scanned at 10 MP will give you the images of size 13”*9”.</p>
<p>Step 2: Dust and Scratch Removal</p>
<p>If you have slides that have been wrapped in a box and remained untouched for so long, they might require cleaning. Such slides may develop mold buildup, age-related blemishes, or scratches. They need a cleaning process before using them to convert into slides. A lint-free cloth and an anti-static film cleaner are the best combinations to gently clean the slides and make them fresh.</p>
<p>Step 3: Color Correction and Restoration</p>
<p>Color correction and restoration is another important step when you are dealing with converting old slides into digital images. In order to correct the fading and color shift, you can use the built-in scanning software. You can also use other software for such purposes.</p>
<p>Wondershare Filmora is the best tool which can be used for the color correction of old slides. It is a handy tool with a variety of features. Filmora offers a number of options when it comes to color correction and grading. These options include color histogram, white balance, 3D LUT (3D Lookup table), color and light, HSL, vignette, etc.</p>
<p>Step 4: Using the Best Scanner cum Digital Converter</p>
<p>The next step is choosing the best quality scanner according to the requirement. 35 mm is the most common size of the slides. But, it does come with other uncommon formats too such as 110, 126, 120, 127, etc. You will come to know about the actual size when the image is mounted on the cardboard. Therefore, it is essential to select a quality and versatile scanner which can convert slides of any size effectively.</p>

So, let’s begin:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Resolution</strong></p>
<p>The very first step for <strong>converting slides to digital photos</strong> is measuring and fixing the resolution of the slides. The technical measurement of image resolution is DPI (dot per inch). It helps you to predict the sharpness or clarity of the final image. The overall measurement depends on the size of the slide and the type of converter or scanner you are using. For example,</p>
<p>A 35 mm slide scanned at 10 MP will give you the images of size 13”*9”.</p>
<p>Step 2: Dust and Scratch Removal</p>
<p>If you have slides that have been wrapped in a box and remained untouched for so long, they might require cleaning. Such slides may develop mold buildup, age-related blemishes, or scratches. They need a cleaning process before using them to convert into slides. A lint-free cloth and an anti-static film cleaner are the best combinations to gently clean the slides and make them fresh.</p>
<p>Step 3: Color Correction and Restoration</p>
<p>Color correction and restoration is another important step when you are dealing with converting old slides into digital images. In order to correct the fading and color shift, you can use the built-in scanning software. You can also use other software for such purposes.</p>
<p>Wondershare Filmora is the best tool which can be used for the color correction of old slides. It is a handy tool with a variety of features. Filmora offers a number of options when it comes to color correction and grading. These options include color histogram, white balance, 3D LUT (3D Lookup table), color and light, HSL, vignette, etc.</p>
<p>Step 4: Using the Best Scanner cum Digital Converter</p>
<p>The next step is choosing the best quality scanner according to the requirement. 35 mm is the most common size of the slides. But, it does come with other uncommon formats too such as 110, 126, 120, 127, etc. You will come to know about the actual size when the image is mounted on the cardboard. Therefore, it is essential to select a quality and versatile scanner which can convert slides of any size effectively.</p>

<p>So, you might have understood why there is a need for <strong>converting slides to pictures.</strong> Now, let’s dig down more on the topic.</p>

So, let’s begin:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Resolution</strong></p>
<p>The very first step for <strong>converting slides to digital photos</strong> is measuring and fixing the resolution of the slides. The technical measurement of image resolution is DPI (dot per inch). It helps you to predict the sharpness or clarity of the final image. The overall measurement depends on the size of the slide and the type of converter or scanner you are using. For example,</p>
<p>A 35 mm slide scanned at 10 MP will give you the images of size 13”*9”.</p>
<p>Step 2: Dust and Scratch Removal</p>
<p>If you have slides that have been wrapped in a box and remained untouched for so long, they might require cleaning. Such slides may develop mold buildup, age-related blemishes, or scratches. They need a cleaning process before using them to convert into slides. A lint-free cloth and an anti-static film cleaner are the best combinations to gently clean the slides and make them fresh.</p>
<p>Step 3: Color Correction and Restoration</p>
<p>Color correction and restoration is another important step when you are dealing with converting old slides into digital images. In order to correct the fading and color shift, you can use the built-in scanning software. You can also use other software for such purposes.</p>
<p>Wondershare Filmora is the best tool which can be used for the color correction of old slides. It is a handy tool with a variety of features. Filmora offers a number of options when it comes to color correction and grading. These options include color histogram, white balance, 3D LUT (3D Lookup table), color and light, HSL, vignette, etc.</p>
<p>Step 4: Using the Best Scanner cum Digital Converter</p>
<p>The next step is choosing the best quality scanner according to the requirement. 35 mm is the most common size of the slides. But, it does come with other uncommon formats too such as 110, 126, 120, 127, etc. You will come to know about the actual size when the image is mounted on the cardboard. Therefore, it is essential to select a quality and versatile scanner which can convert slides of any size effectively.</p>

So, let’s begin:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Resolution</strong></p>
<p>The very first step for <strong>converting slides to digital photos</strong> is measuring and fixing the resolution of the slides. The technical measurement of image resolution is DPI (dot per inch). It helps you to predict the sharpness or clarity of the final image. The overall measurement depends on the size of the slide and the type of converter or scanner you are using. For example,</p>
<p>A 35 mm slide scanned at 10 MP will give you the images of size 13”*9”.</p>
<p>Step 2: Dust and Scratch Removal</p>
<p>If you have slides that have been wrapped in a box and remained untouched for so long, they might require cleaning. Such slides may develop mold buildup, age-related blemishes, or scratches. They need a cleaning process before using them to convert into slides. A lint-free cloth and an anti-static film cleaner are the best combinations to gently clean the slides and make them fresh.</p>
<p>Step 3: Color Correction and Restoration</p>
<p>Color correction and restoration is another important step when you are dealing with converting old slides into digital images. In order to correct the fading and color shift, you can use the built-in scanning software. You can also use other software for such purposes.</p>
<p>Wondershare Filmora is the best tool which can be used for the color correction of old slides. It is a handy tool with a variety of features. Filmora offers a number of options when it comes to color correction and grading. These options include color histogram, white balance, 3D LUT (3D Lookup table), color and light, HSL, vignette, etc.</p>
<p>Step 4: Using the Best Scanner cum Digital Converter</p>
<p>The next step is choosing the best quality scanner according to the requirement. 35 mm is the most common size of the slides. But, it does come with other uncommon formats too such as 110, 126, 120, 127, etc. You will come to know about the actual size when the image is mounted on the cardboard. Therefore, it is essential to select a quality and versatile scanner which can convert slides of any size effectively.</p>
