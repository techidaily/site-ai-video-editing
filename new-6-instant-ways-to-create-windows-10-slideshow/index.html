<h3 id="Way-2-Use-iMovie-1"><a href="#Way-2-Use-iMovie-1" class="headerlink" title="Way 2. Use iMovie"></a>Way 2. Use iMovie</h3><p>iMovie is one of the most preferred video editors among Mac and iPhone users. This is because the app comes from Apple, and there are ample features to enhance your video content and quality with effects. Adding a background to a green screen video using iMovie is quite easy. But replacing a background of a video without green screen is rather tough.</p>
<p>Step1 Launch iMovie from Applications folder on your Mac as it comes pre-installed.</p>
<p>Step2 Import your green screen video as well as replacement background video or photo to Project Media folder.</p>
<p>Step3 Drag and drop them into Timeline and place the green screen video above the replacement background video&#x2F;photo. Make sure that the duration of both videos is the same.</p>
