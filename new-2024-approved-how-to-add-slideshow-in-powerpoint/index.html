<p>A slideshow view fills the entire computer screen, much like a real slide show. The presentation is exhibited in full-screen mode, as the audience will see it. Graphics, timings, videos, animated elements, and transition effects get displayed in the same way they appear on stage. PowerPoint is an excellent tool for preparing presentations on the fly, whether for a seminar, classroom, lecture hall, conference, or even a contract pitch. With PowerPoint software, you can never go wrong. We’ll show you <strong>how to do a slideshow presentation</strong> in this post, even if you’re a complete novice who has never used it before.</p>

<p>Ready to make aslideshow? Let us get you started.</p>
<p>Step 1: Create New Presentation</p>
<p>To do so:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Go to your browser and click on the PowerPoint icon.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> When PowerPoint opens, go to the upper left-hand corner and choose “File,” then “New,” listed under “File.”</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Choose “New Presentation” from the drop-down menu, which will create a new slide show for you to begin uploading photos to.</p>

                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Create New Presentation "
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Save PowerPoint</p>
<p>Go to the top right-hand side of the presentation screen and click on the flash drive icon. After that, you’ll be able to name your presentation and pick where to save it.</p>
<p>Remember to save your presentation after something that will remind you of the images in the File. This act will make it easier for you to find them later.</p>

                      alt="Save PowerPoint "
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: Name the Page</p>
<p>Consider a title and type it in the box. Your title page can include a name, date, or image.</p>
<p>Choose an image-friendly arrangement, such as a slide with a title box and an image box, a slide with only an image box, or even a blank slide.</p>

<p>Step 6: Rearrange the Photo</p>

<p>Step 8: Add a Background.</p>
<p>If the white space around the edges of your photographs bothers you, right-click on any slide, choose “Format Background,” and then adjust the background fill. You may change the hue, direction, and transparency of a solid fill, a gradient fill, etc. To make your slides look more professional,</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 6: Rearrange the Photo</p>
<p>You will find it easier to decide the optimum order for the slides if you use the slide sorter.</p>
<p>Bear the bottom of the image pane, and look for the “Slide Sorter” button. Then, using your mouse, drag the slides to their preferred locations.</p>

You may change the hue, direction, and transparency of a solid fill, a gradient fill, etc. To make your slides look more professional,</p>

                      alt="Import Images"
                ></p>
<p>Step 6: Rearrange the Photo</p>
<p>You will find it easier to decide the optimum order for the slides if you use the slide sorter.</p>
<p>Bear the bottom of the image pane, and look for the “Slide Sorter” button. Then, using your mouse, drag the slides to their preferred locations.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 7: Add Transitions</p>
<p>Transitions are essential for tying the presentation together and allowing it to flow smoothly from one image to the next. Go to the “Transitions” tab at the top of the bar and experiment with the various possibilities.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 8: Add a Background.</p>
<p>If the white space around the edges of your photographs bothers you, right-click on any slide, choose “Format Background,” and then adjust the background fill. You may change the hue, direction, and transparency of a solid fill, a gradient fill, etc. To make your slides look more professional,</p>

While the utility works to define a sequential arrangement of shots and elements in a specific video scene, the real effort lies in converting a text centered movie or scene script into a storyboard. Talking of the ways to address this concern, let us discuss about these storyboard essentials in some detail in what follows next:</p>
<p><strong>What Comes First – Script or Storyboard?</strong></p>
<p>Before beginning to comment on the sequence of the aforesaid elements within a film production process, let us first proceed to have an understanding of the terms in a fundamental sense. A script is essentially a text based document that presents a cumulative picture of the video story by unveiling the latter’s storyline and theme. Storyboards on the other hand, are pictorial representations of sequentially arranged shots of the movie with a much more comprehensive detailing.</p>
<p>Going through the above definitions, the obvious and logical sequence of filming out a video is quite clear with scripts preceding the storyboards. Talking a bit on the credibility aspect of these video production stages, the film’s script caters to provide an elementary insight into some of the most essential visual commands. Crafting a storyboard on the other hand, is dedicated towards depicting a detailed follow through of each shot in line with the events described in the script.</p>
<p>Working towards a classic and professional video production task, hence demands a drafting of the latter’s script, which is then succeeded by crafting a storyboard. This facilitates a seamless and easy video creation process with lesser ambiguities. Having talked enough about scripts and storyboards, let us now move ahead with creating storyboards from a film script in the following section:</p>

<p><strong>Step 2: Let’s Start Storyboarding!</strong></p>
<p>Move ahead to planning the sequential placement of shots and scenes of the story in line with the script that you have just created. It is a great idea to pick an array of 4-6 movement shots for a particular scene, so that you can have a sufficient cell spacing to expand the detailing of shot elements. This further caters to a convenient and spatial arrangement of the cells on a standard sized paper.</p>
<p>You can now start to create your storyboard by adding labels to the scenes, penning down the directions, including the specific character dialogues and suitable images.</p>

<p>When you are done with adding all the elements of the script into the storyboard cells, proceed to lay them out in a specific pattern. This step comes quite handy in checking for the continuity and detailing accuracy of the depicted shots. You can further, improvise the elements if needed, or advance to the next step if everything seems fine.</p>

<p><strong>How Can I Get Better at Storyboarding?</strong></p>
<p>Speaking in the light of film production assets and utilities, storyboarding is more of a creative art rather than a customary process or production stage. While it requires consistent effort and practice to master the craft, adhering to some handy tips and tricks can be of great help to improve your skills at creating expressive and finely detailed storyboards.</p>
<p>Heading towards sorting the aforesaid query, the following section presents a concise description of a few amazing and unique storyboard creation guidelines and tricks to present the storyboarding craft at its best:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Stop Aiming to Become a Perfectionist</strong></p>
<p>Considering the fact that you are crafting the storyboard just for the purpose of depicting a sequence of video shots, do not aim at defining every element in comprehensive detail. Instead of making a fresh attempt to depict every minor change, pay more attention towards highlighting the significant points of action within a particular scene.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Prefer Numbering the Storyboard Panels</strong></p>
<p>Since the storyboard you are creating works as a blueprint for the video creation team, it should be convenient to understand and navigate through. Presenting the cells of your storyboard in a numbered sequence tends to provide an easy follow through of the same to the rest of your viewers.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Explore Your Imagination</strong></p>
<p>Your storyboard happens to be the inaugural representation of your video production idea and script in front of the potential audience. You should hence, proceed with the latter’s crafting process while keeping a close reference with the drafted script. Also, it becomes greatly important to add the imaginative element to your creation to avoid creating an bland and customary impression on the audience.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Feedback Has a Great Importance</strong></p>
<p>Make sure to showcase your storyboard to your project investors, prior to beginning with the film creation process. This will aid you with an escape from the unnecessary changes that can pop out from the audience at the last minute, leading to an unwanted financial expense. Pay attention to gather and work on the feedback of the viewers and start the actual creation process only after everything seems to be well settled.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Enjoy Your Work</strong></p>
<p>Enjoying the different aspects of your work is the key to achieve mastery at your craft and a welcoming response from the audience. Accepted that the storyboarding process is mind straining and time consuming, but taking on the challenge with a fun centered attitude will let your hard work shine on in front of the viewers.</p>
<p><strong>Creating Storyboards with Wondershare Filmora</strong></p>
<p>Creating storyboards in the traditional paper and pencil format is undoubtedly an absolute fun activity, but it has the limitations of a customary image drawing. If you want to supplement the contents of your storyboard with additional elements of animations, effects, background themes and music, it would be better to work with storyboard creator software.</p>
<p>Browsing through the heap of alternatives across the web and the IT market, you can conveniently choose to work with the Wondershare <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> to address the concern.

<h2 id="Part-3-Storyboard-Q-A-3"><a href="#Part-3-Storyboard-Q-A-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Storyboard Q&amp;A"></a>Part 3 Storyboard Q&amp;A</h2><p><strong>●</strong> <strong>How can the storyboard creation process be quickly addressed?</strong></p>
<p>When aiming to quickly address the concern of creating storyboards, picking up an online template is a better option in comparison to the traditional pencil and paper drawing. As of working with the web based alternatives, you can add sketches, scripts and notes within the storyboard cells to make them more impressive and detailed.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>What should be the ideal expanse of a storyboard?</strong></p>
<p>There is no hard and fast rule to decide the optimum number of cells or pages for your storyboard. The page count may have variations in line with the content and detailing of the scenes they are crafted to showcase.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Is it essential to include every shot within the storyboard?</strong></p>
<p>On a general note, every shot within your script does not require an inclusion within the storyboard. The answer to this query however, largely depends on the intensity of detailing you wish to add and the diversity of ideas and elements you want to incorporate within the storyboard of a specific film scene.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>What are the essentials of a good storyboard?</strong></p>
<p>When attempting to create a good storyboard, pay attention to the fluent transition of the text centered ideas into pictorial representations. Your video script should possess the right quantity of information to make anyone easily understand the content depiction without having a prior walk-through of your script. Abstain from creating an information overflow either, lest you would end up hiding away the relevant details.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>What are the major parts of a storyboard?</strong></p>
<p>A well-crafted storyboard comprises of 4 important elements. There are namely, the subject of the shot or scene, a suitable and cohesive background, a properly angled camera shot of the main character within the scene and a responsive camera movement.</p>

If yes, then it is important to understand the basic concepts of video aspect ratios. Moreover, you can determine the specifications using an aspect ratio editor online.</p>
<p>Every photo, canvas, responsive design, digital video, or frame is rectangular with precise proportions. Outline the aspect ratios to create shapes according to different mediums like computers, TV, movies, or camera screens.</p>
<p>With the help of aspect ratio calculators, you can calculate the image’s value and new size. You can also use it to convert the image size and keep the objects in shape to make them look natural.</p>
<p>The formula to find an aspect ratio is: Width &#x2F; Height</p>
<h3 id="Aspect-Ratio-Calculation-Process"><a href="#Aspect-Ratio-Calculation-Process" class="headerlink" title="Aspect Ratio Calculation Process"></a>Aspect Ratio Calculation Process</h3><p>Calculating the aspect resolution is pretty straightforward. The steps mentioned below will help you to get the correct height for the edited image:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take the original height-for example, 2400 units.</li>
<li>Take the actual width- for example, 3200 units.</li>
<li>Then, divide the height by width- for example, 2400&#x2F;3200&#x3D;0.75.</li>
<li>Multiply the result (quotient) by new expected width- for instance, 0.75*600&#x3D;450.</li>
<li>The resulting figure is a new height.</li>
