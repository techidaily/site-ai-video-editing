To assist you with the process of video editing, we’ve put up this thorough tutorial that covers everything you’ll need to know to make stunning films, even if you’ve never done it before. We’ll also demonstrate how to utilize the super-intuitive and user-friendly editor to create a video.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Edit-Recorded-Video-in-OBS"><a href="#Part-1-Edit-Recorded-Video-in-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Edit Recorded Video in OBS"></a><strong>Part 1. Edit Recorded Video in OBS</strong></h2><p>OBS is a video streaming and recording application. It’s open source, free, and works on Macs, Windows, and Linux. It is a strong and adaptable screencast video creation tool when paired with competent audio and video editing tools. Unfortunately, OBS doesn’t support editing feature and hence, we’re enlisting the recording steps so you can edit them by using a third-party toolkit mentioned in the guide.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1. Download and Install OBS</strong></p>
<p>Install OBS according to the instructions for your operating system by downloading it from the link below.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2. Setup Screen Recording</strong></p>
<p>The window is divided into separate parts called “docks” when you initially launch the app. Every dock has a distinct function. Scenes, Sources, Mixer, and Controls are the areas to pay attention to. OBS employs a Scenes and Sources system, which will be discussed in more depth in a later lesson. These two tools operate in tandem to help you keep track of your video, audio, and other production materials. When you first start OBS, you’ll see that a scene is already loaded, which you can locate in the bottom left corner of the interface.</p>

                      alt="obs setup screen recording"
                ></p>
<p>You’ll also need to add a source to this scene before you can begin recording. Click the Add button at the bottom of the Sources panel, then pick Screen Capture on Linux or Display Capture on Mac and Windows with the default Scene chosen (it will be highlighted).</p>
<p><strong>Step 3. Customize the Recording Source</strong></p>
<p>You’ll need to create a new source before you can begin recording your desktop screen. Select “Display Capture” by clicking the “+” icon on the Sources dock. You will be prompted to name the Display source in a popup window. Click “OK”. At the bottom right of the screen, click the Settings icon. Take note of the Recording Path field under the Output tab. This is where your recorded video will be kept on your computer.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4. Start&#x2F;Stop Recording</strong></p>
<p>You’ll be able to choose the computer screen display you wish to capture in the following window. If you just have one monitor, make that the default. OBS Studios should show you the screen in the window after a valid display has been chosen. We need to change your graphics settings if OBS is unable to successfully load the screen video. Click the Start Recording button in the bottom right corner when you’re ready to begin recording. When you’re finished, click Stop Recording, and a movie will be saved to the folder you chose in the preferences.</p>
