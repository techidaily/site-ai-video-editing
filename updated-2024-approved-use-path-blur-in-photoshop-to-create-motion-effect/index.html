<h3 id="Add-Dynamic-Effect-to-Your-Static-Images"><a href="#Add-Dynamic-Effect-to-Your-Static-Images" class="headerlink" title="Add Dynamic Effect to Your Static Images"></a>Add Dynamic Effect to Your Static Images</h3><p>Step1 Open Photoshop and import the desired picture. Once done, go to the “Layers” section and copy the background layer. For this, press “Ctrl + J” in Windows and “Command + J” for MacBook.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="create background layer copy"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Now proceed to the “Filter” section and locate the option “Blur Gallery”. From there, choose the “Path Blur” option. Now you would be able to see an arrow on your screen. Using this arrow, you can specify the path blur motion. Drag and close the arrow where you want to show the speed. Also, set a higher value for the speed given on the right side. Once done, hit the “OK” button.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h3 id="Create-a-Long-Exposure-Picture"><a href="#Create-a-Long-Exposure-Picture" class="headerlink" title="Create a Long Exposure Picture"></a>Create a Long Exposure Picture</h3><p>Step1 Navigate to the Adobe Photoshop tool and begin by uploading a picture. Afterward, go to the “Filter” tab and select “Convert for Small Filters.”</p>
<p><img

                      alt="proceed with path blur"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 After dragging the arrow in a particular direction, a blue dot will appear at the center. Press the “Delete” button to eliminate that point. Now select the endpoint of the arrow and change its blur shape.</p>

                      alt="delete the blue dot"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 Utilize the noise section to add a grainy effect in the blurred area. Once done, click on the “OK” button. Now select the masking tool to select the area in your picture. Afterward, choose the “Smart Mask” filter and then navigate to the “Fill” option given in the “Edit” section.</p>

                      alt="select the fill option"
                ></p>
<p>Step5 In the fill menu, choose the color “Black.” Now go to the “Select” section and click “Deselect.” To soften the whole look, you can go to the “Properties” panel and adjust the “Feather” properties.</p>

                      alt="adjust the feather properties"
                ></p>
<p>Step6 Now add the first layer and choose the option “Convert for Smart Filters.” Again, go to the “Filter” section, select “Blur Gallery,” and uncheck the option called “Edit Blur Screen.”</p>

                      alt="tap on convert for smart filters option"
                ></p>
<p>Step7 Now increase the length of the arrow and press “Ctrl + Click” for Windows or “Command + Click” for Mac to reposition the path. You can also add a curve to the arrow. Enhance the speed from the right panel and uncheck the option of “Center Blur.” You can increase the taper value to make the blur gradually trail off. Add a grainy filter for more enhancements.</p>
