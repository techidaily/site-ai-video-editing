<p>Click the <strong>Square</strong> icon, it is located beside the <strong>Pencil</strong> icon at the top section. The shape’s purpose is to crop the video section that you want to remain. If you’re done cutting then you should unclick the <strong>Proportiona</strong>l grid, and the video’s magnification should be 100%. Afterwards, you can check the pixel aspect ratio correction in the After Effects. You need to go through the video before saving your project. This is to avoid unnecessary errors that will make the process troublesome.</p>

<h2 id="The-Bottom-Line-2"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line-2" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>You are once again done with the process of checking out these two applications. After Effects and Wondershare Filmora have a different process when it comes to cropping videos. I hope that you had a clearer understanding on which of these two would suit your video editing needs. The interface also could change your mind depending if you want simplicity or a challenge. Price is also a factor that can affect your willingness to use these applications. But, this guide clearly shows you that it is worth paying for.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on both of these tools? Did you find this information to be helpful?</p>
<p>Check if the video is already in the interface. Find the <strong>Magnifying</strong> tab and zoom out the video into 50%. After that, click the <strong>Grid</strong> icon and <strong>Proportional Grid</strong>.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Click the <strong>Square</strong> icon, it is located beside the <strong>Pencil</strong> icon at the top section. The shape’s purpose is to crop the video section that you want to remain. If you’re done cutting then you should unclick the <strong>Proportiona</strong>l grid, and the video’s magnification should be 100%. Afterwards, you can check the pixel aspect ratio correction in the After Effects. You need to go through the video before saving your project. This is to avoid unnecessary errors that will make the process troublesome.</p>

Then, select <strong>File,</strong> <strong>Export</strong> and finally <strong>Add to Render Queue.</strong> Check on the <strong>Render Settings</strong> (located bottom of the interface) to ensure high quality output. Following that, hit the <strong>Output To</strong> part and decide the destination and folder where you want it to be.</p>

Amidst this, videos have become a powerful medium to relive the past. If you’re aiming to infuse your videos with a touch of the ‘90s, look no further than the VHS effect.</p>
<p>For those who need a quick trip down memory lane, VHS tapes were once the cornerstone of home entertainment. These clunky plastic cassettes captured countless memories, from family gatherings to favorite films and TV shows. While they might be alien to newer generations, they hold a special place in the chronicles of video evolution.</p>
<p>The VHS effect isn’t just about mimicking the look of these tapes. It’s about encapsulating their essence—grainy visuals, occasional jitters, and that characteristic static. Incorporating these imperfections into today’s high-definition videos imparts a distinctive vintage flair. It’s akin to applying an Instagram filter to a photo, where a simple touch can transport a viewer back in time. Dive in as we guide you on adding this retro charm to your free videos.</p>
