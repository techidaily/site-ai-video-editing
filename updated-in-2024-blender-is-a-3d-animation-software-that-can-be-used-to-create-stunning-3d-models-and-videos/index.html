<p>Step 1: Import the video clip you want to rotate to your project.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="rotate-video-blender"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: In the timeline, place the playhead at the beginning of the clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="rotate-video-blender"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: With the playhead still at the beginning of the clip, drag the rotation handle in the preview window to rotate the video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="rotate-video-blender"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4: Move the playhead to the end of the clip and drag the rotation handle again to rotate it further.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="rotate-video-blender"
                ></p>
<p>To rotate a video clip using the Transform Tool…</p>
<p>Select the “Edit” tool from the toolbar.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-blender-11.png"
                      alt="rotate-video-blender"
                ></p>
<p>Go to the “Transform” selection, then select the rotate option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-blender-12.png"
                      alt="rotate-video-blender"
                ></p>
<p>Adjust the rotation angle using the tool.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-blender-13.png"
                      alt="rotate-video-blender"
                ></p>
<p>Both methods are fairly straightforward and easy to use. Experiment with each to see which works best for your project.</p>
<p>Step 2: Then, click on the “Strip” menu and select “Transform.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="rotate-video-blender"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: In the Transform Properties window, you will see a list of different tools for the video. Scroll down until you see the “Rotation” property. This is where you can manually rotate the video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="rotate-video-blender"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4: Click on Enter to save the rotation of the video.</p>
<p>The second way to rotate a video in Blender is by using the Transform Properties window. To do this…</p>
<p>Step 1: Open the video that you want to rotate in Blender.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-blender-4.png"
                      alt="rotate-video-blender"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Next, go to ‘Transform’ in the Active Tool portion of the screen.</p>
<p> Figure 5</p>
<p>Step 3: Go to the ‘Transform’ option in the properties window and adjust based on the rotational angle that you want.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/rotate-video-blender-6.png"
                      alt="rotate-video-blender"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4: Click on ‘Enter’ to apply it to the video.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, we have shown you two different ways to rotate a video in Blender. The first way is by using the Transform Properties window, and the second way is by using the 3D Viewport.</p>
<p>Which method you use is up to you. However, we recommend using the 3D Viewport method, as it is more accurate.</p>
<p>Rotating a video in Blender can be used for other purposes than just rotating it.</p>
<p>Here are some other things that you can do with a rotated video:</p>
<p>- Scale the video up or down</p>
<p>- Flip the video horizontally or vertically</p>
<p>- Change the position of the video in the 3D Viewport</p>

<p>Step1 Start by introducing yourself.</p>
<p>Step2 Get into details.</p>

<p>Step4 Add personalization to your video.</p>
<p>Step5 Video Length.</p>
<h3 id="1-Start-by-introducing-yourself"><a href="#1-Start-by-introducing-yourself" class="headerlink" title="1. Start by introducing yourself"></a>1. Start by introducing yourself</h3><p>You can always start your intro by introducing yourself but don’t just state your name and what</p>
<p>you do, tell them why you do it, what your core values are and what motivates and dives you to</p>
<p>do this kind of career. Because you all know doing vlog on YouTube is a job, work, and a career.</p>
<p>Share emotions with your audience, and help them relate to you. Doing so is going to help you stand out immediately from the crowd and get audiences interested enough to watch the remainder of your video’s content.</p>
<h3 id="2-Get-into-details"><a href="#2-Get-into-details" class="headerlink" title="2. Get into details"></a>2. Get into details</h3><p>Tip is always direct to the point, add a few facts about yourself, like your interest or previous experiences or who you are as a person. If you are a business owner and would want to talk about your business you can always share how it started.</p>
<p>If we are talking about the YouTube intro video. Every good YouTube intro video usually includes beneficial information for subscribers and viewers. Add any short important text that you feel is necessary from the video titles, your YouTube channel name, and social media handles. Keep your informative text in a consistent format and branding style.</p>
<h3 id="3-Add-a-call-to-action"><a href="#3-Add-a-call-to-action" class="headerlink" title="3. Add a call to action"></a>3. Add a call to action</h3><p>if you have successfully maintained the interest of your viewer until the very end of your video, use this opportunity to invite them to engage with your content more. It’s worth including a call to action in each video. Take a full advantage of YouTube to provide your audience with your social media channels and maybe a link or two to your other videos that might interest them,</p>
<h3 id="4-Add-personalization-to-your-video"><a href="#4-Add-personalization-to-your-video" class="headerlink" title="4. Add personalization to your video"></a>4. Add personalization to your video</h3><p>Even though an intro can be more than logo animation, the latter should still be a part of it. Otherwise, there’s a sense that something is messing. Include eye catchy visuals effects to your videos to stands out, so that people can easily remember your YouTube channel.</p>

Video length</h3><p>A long intro, even if it’s spectacular, can get boring once your audience has seen it a few times. An ideal length for intros is up to 8-10 seconds only. Just enough time to deliver your message and branding, and hook audiences in for the rest of the video. Any longer than that, and you might lose viewers who are waiting to see the video that they clicked on.</p>

<p>you do, tell them why you do it, what your core values are and what motivates and dives you to</p>
<p>do this kind of career. Because you all know doing vlog on YouTube is a job, work, and a career.</p>

<p>If we are talking about the YouTube intro video. Every good YouTube intro video usually includes beneficial information for subscribers and viewers.

For some reason, your QuickTime behaviour is out of whack.</p>
<p>People often neglect to keep their QuickTime software up-to-date, which results in problems with video playback, such as no sound or stuttering, among many other things. To fix this issue, just download and install the most latest release of QuickTime player.</p>
<h3 id="Examine-the-System-and-Driver"><a href="#Examine-the-System-and-Driver" class="headerlink" title="Examine the System and Driver"></a>Examine the System and Driver</h3><p>Faulty speakers, audio issues in the system, and update failures will ultimately cause media playback difficulties.</p>

<p>People often neglect to keep their QuickTime software up-to-date, which results in problems with video playback, such as no sound or stuttering, among many other things. To fix this issue, just download and install the most latest release of QuickTime player.</p>
<h3 id="Examine-the-System-and-Driver-2"><a href="#Examine-the-System-and-Driver-2" class="headerlink" title="Examine the System and Driver"></a>Examine the System and Driver</h3><p>Faulty speakers, audio issues in the system, and update failures will ultimately cause media playback difficulties.</p>
<p>To find the root cause, you should first check internally to see whether your speakers are working correctly. Speaking straight to Siri and hearing her reaction is the fastest and most straightforward option.</p>
<p>Another reason you may be hearing no sound on QuickTime is because of a recent system update. Apple, as we all know, often releases new operating systems, and you must keep track of the most current versions of updates in order to keep your system running effectively.</p>
<p>You just need to ensure that your machine is running the most recent version. As a result, your system will resume regular functioning, and QuickTime will be immediately fixed and restored.</p>

To make matters worse, the lack of sound in QuickTime will be the consequence of a corrupted video file.</p>
<p>Try opening the file in a different programme or player to see if the issue may be resolved. If this is the case, your source video file is either destroyed or corrupted. You may wish to consider regaining access to the file in this situation. The likelihood of your file being corrupted by malware or a virus is relatively high. Remember to be patient if this does happen to you.</p>
<p>It is necessary to use third-party repair programmes to successfully fix the file. Consequently, using third-party software to recover and restore the source file should be considered if you are in a situation where the source file is crucial and do not have a backup.

Verifying your QuickTime installation is the most obvious way to find out whether it has decoded all of the video files. Let’s investigate the issue to its root.</p>

For some reason, your QuickTime behaviour is out of whack.</p>
<p>People often neglect to keep their QuickTime software up-to-date, which results in problems with video playback, such as no sound or stuttering, among many other things. To fix this issue, just download and install the most latest release of QuickTime player.</p>
<h3 id="Examine-the-System-and-Driver-3"><a href="#Examine-the-System-and-Driver-3" class="headerlink" title="Examine the System and Driver"></a>Examine the System and Driver</h3><p>Faulty speakers, audio issues in the system, and update failures will ultimately cause media playback difficulties.</p>
<p>To find the root cause, you should first check internally to see whether your speakers are working correctly. Speaking straight to Siri and hearing her reaction is the fastest and most straightforward option.</p>
<p>Another reason you may be hearing no sound on QuickTime is because of a recent system update. Apple, as we all know, often releases new operating systems, and you must keep track of the most current versions of updates in order to keep your system running effectively.</p>
<p>You just need to ensure that your machine is running the most recent version. As a result, your system will resume regular functioning, and QuickTime will be immediately fixed and restored.</p>
<h3 id="Inspect-if-the-File-is-Corrupted-or-not-3"><a href="#Inspect-if-the-File-is-Corrupted-or-not-3" class="headerlink" title="Inspect if the File is Corrupted or not"></a>Inspect if the File is Corrupted or not</h3><p>Checking the file to see whether it has been corrupted is a good idea regardless of whether QuickTime and your system are up and running. To make matters worse, the lack of sound in QuickTime will be the consequence of a corrupted video file.</p>
<p>Try opening the file in a different programme or player to see if the issue may be resolved. If this is the case, your source video file is either destroyed or corrupted. You may wish to consider regaining access to the file in this situation. The likelihood of your file being corrupted by malware or a virus is relatively high. Remember to be patient if this does happen to you.</p>
<p>It is necessary to use third-party repair programmes to successfully fix the file. Consequently, using third-party software to recover and restore the source file should be considered if you are in a situation where the source file is crucial and do not have a backup. As we’ll see, there are a number of options available, including Filmora.</p>
