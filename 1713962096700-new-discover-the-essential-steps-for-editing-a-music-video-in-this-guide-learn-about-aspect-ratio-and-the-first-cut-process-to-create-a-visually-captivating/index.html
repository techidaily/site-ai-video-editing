<h2 id="Adjust-the-aspect-ratio"><a href="#Adjust-the-aspect-ratio" class="headerlink" title="Adjust the aspect ratio"></a>Adjust the aspect ratio</h2><p>The aspect ratio is known as the size of the video frame. For example, the most common aspect ratios are 16:9 and 4:3. The first number represents the width, and the second represents the height.</p>
<p>You should always ask your cinematographer about the aspect ratio. There are chances when cameras won’t shoot at the intended aspect ratio they were framed for. In that case, you’ll need to crop or letterbox them when editing.</p>

If you have a measurement of one side of the frame, you can find the other by using some math. Let’s suppose your frame is 3424 pixels wide. You can use this formula to find the height.</p>
<p><strong>Formula:</strong> 3424 pixels wide <strong>x</strong> 1 high &#x2F; 2.35 wide (or whatever your aspect ratio)</p>

<h2 id="Send-your-first-draft"><a href="#Send-your-first-draft" class="headerlink" title="Send your first draft"></a>Send your first draft</h2><p>The first draft is the video in which you added audio and re-ordered the shots. You decided on the pace and flow of the video to create a basic structure. You made changes to make it interesting and captivating.</p>
<p>Before you put too much effort into editing your video, send it to your director, producer, or client for review. It will help ensure that any big changes can be made before you invest too much time in the edit.</p>
<p>For first drafts, you don’t need anything fancy. A lower-resolution and more compressed file can make sending it to a director or client much easier. You can also add a timer on the music video, so the person reviewing it can give you accurate timing on where he wants any revision.</p>

<li>Click on <strong>Effects</strong> and search for <strong>Timecode</strong> in the search bar.</li>
<li>Choose the timer style you like and drop it onto the new timeline.</li>
<li>Extend the timer to the end of the video.</li>
<li>Adjust the position and add the duration of your music video.</li>

<p>Now you are all set to export the first draft of your music video. You can also adjust the video format on the export option, but MP4 is recommended.</p>

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid GoPro Video Editor?</em></strong></p>
<p>You can choose free or paid softwares depending on your requirements and budget. If a free software meets your requirements then stay on it otherwise move towards a paid alternative. If you have a GoPro and you make videos just for fun then use a free and simple video editor. Even if you are an experienced video editor, I would recommend you to go for free video editors which I have mentioned above as they are quite powerful and professional software but if you are harvesting a good amount of money from this field then you can upgrade to pro versions of these free softwares or get a paid software from start. As almost all of these softwares are professional and can get your job done, so it’s better to choose one, which is comfortable for you to work on.</p>

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid GoPro Video Editor?</em></strong></p>
<p>You can choose free or paid softwares depending on your requirements and budget. If a free software meets your requirements then stay on it otherwise move towards a paid alternative. If you have a GoPro and you make videos just for fun then use a free and simple video editor. Even if you are an experienced video editor, I would recommend you to go for free video editors which I have mentioned above as they are quite powerful and professional software but if you are harvesting a good amount of money from this field then you can upgrade to pro versions of these free softwares or get a paid software from start. As almost all of these softwares are professional and can get your job done, so it’s better to choose one, which is comfortable for you to work on.</p>

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid GoPro Video Editor?</em></strong></p>
<p>You can choose free or paid softwares depending on your requirements and budget. If a free software meets your requirements then stay on it otherwise move towards a paid alternative. If you have a GoPro and you make videos just for fun then use a free and simple video editor. Even if you are an experienced video editor, I would recommend you to go for free video editors which I have mentioned above as they are quite powerful and professional software but if you are harvesting a good amount of money from this field then you can upgrade to pro versions of these free softwares or get a paid software from start. As almost all of these softwares are professional and can get your job done, so it’s better to choose one, which is comfortable for you to work on.</p>

<p><strong><em>Which One Should I Choose Free or Paid GoPro Video Editor?</em></strong></p>
<p>You can choose free or paid softwares depending on your requirements and budget. If a free software meets your requirements then stay on it otherwise move towards a paid alternative. If you have a GoPro and you make videos just for fun then use a free and simple video editor. Even if you are an experienced video editor, I would recommend you to go for free video editors which I have mentioned above as they are quite powerful and professional software but if you are harvesting a good amount of money from this field then you can upgrade to pro versions of these free softwares or get a paid software from start. As almost all of these softwares are professional and can get your job done, so it’s better to choose one, which is comfortable for you to work on.</p>

<p>The gaming world is ever-changing, with developers looking to create innovative ways to immerse players into their digital worlds. One such technology that has begun to sweep is <strong>AI in the game industry</strong>.</p>
<p>AI is a powerful tool in many ways to improve the gaming experience. It can make <strong>artificial intelligence in computer games</strong> more believable and add replayability and immersion to games, and we can expect to see even more impressive applications in the future.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-AI-in-Gaming"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-AI-in-Gaming" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What Is AI in Gaming?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What Is AI in Gaming?</strong></h2><p>In simple terms, AI is a set of algorithms that allow a computer to learn and improve from experience. Although you can apply it in many ways, <strong>artificial intelligence in video games</strong> is usually helpful to create more intelligent and more believable non-player characters (NPCs).</p>
<p>For example, an AI system might be helpful to determine how an NPC reacts to the player’s actions. If the player tries to steal from an NPC, the AI might make the NPC angry and more likely to attack the player. Alternatively, if the player is friendly to an NPC, the <strong>AI game playing</strong> might make the NPC more likely to help the player in future interactions.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Why-Does-AI-in-Gaming-Matter"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Does-AI-in-Gaming-Matter" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Why Does AI in Gaming Matter?"></a>Part 2 <strong>Why Does AI in Gaming Matter?</strong></h2><p>One of the most vital aspects of <strong>AI in video games</strong> is that it can make games more believable and immersive for players. When games can convincingly simulate human-like behavior, it can be a much more enjoyable experience for gamers. AI can make NPCs seem more lifelike and make the game world feel more believable.</p>
<p>AI is also becoming increasingly important for creating procedural content. This is where the game generates content on its own, rather than relying on pre-made assets. For example, a game might use procedural generation to create random dungeons or quests that the player can explore. This can add a lot of replayability to a game, as the player never knows what they will encounter next.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-AI-Will-Completely-Change-Video-Games"><a href="#Part-3-How-AI-Will-Completely-Change-Video-Games" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How AI Will Completely Change Video Games"></a>Part 3 <strong>How AI Will Completely Change Video Games</strong></h2><p>It is not a secret that AI is changing the world as we know it. With its ability to enable computers to learn and improve from experience, AI is paving the way for a future where machines can handle more complex tasks. And nowhere is this more apparent than in the world of video gaming.</p>
<p>In the past, developers brought in AI primarily for simple things like making certain NPCs (non-player characters) move and act realistically. But now, <strong>artificial intelligence in video games</strong> is being used for much more complex tasks like generating procedural content and creating believable human-like behavior. This results in a new generation of <strong>AI game playing</strong> that are more immersive and playable.</p>

<p>The gaming world is ever-changing, with developers looking to create innovative ways to immerse players into their digital worlds. One such technology that has begun to sweep is <strong>AI in the game industry</strong>.</p>
<p>AI is a powerful tool in many ways to improve the gaming experience. It can make <strong>artificial intelligence in computer games</strong> more believable and add replayability and immersion to games, and we can expect to see even more impressive applications in the future.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-AI-in-Gaming-1"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-AI-in-Gaming-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What Is AI in Gaming?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What Is AI in Gaming?</strong></h2><p>In simple terms, AI is a set of algorithms that allow a computer to learn and improve from experience. Although you can apply it in many ways, <strong>artificial intelligence in video games</strong> is usually helpful to create more intelligent and more believable non-player characters (NPCs).</p>
<p>For example, an AI system might be helpful to determine how an NPC reacts to the player’s actions. If the player tries to steal from an NPC, the AI might make the NPC angry and more likely to attack the player. Alternatively, if the player is friendly to an NPC, the <strong>AI game playing</strong> might make the NPC more likely to help the player in future interactions.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Why-Does-AI-in-Gaming-Matter-1"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Does-AI-in-Gaming-Matter-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Why Does AI in Gaming Matter?"></a>Part 2 <strong>Why Does AI in Gaming Matter?</strong></h2><p>One of the most vital aspects of <strong>AI in video games</strong> is that it can make games more believable and immersive for players. When games can convincingly simulate human-like behavior, it can be a much more enjoyable experience for gamers. AI can make NPCs seem more lifelike and make the game world feel more believable.</p>
<p>AI is also becoming increasingly important for creating procedural content. This is where the game generates content on its own, rather than relying on pre-made assets. For example, a game might use procedural generation to create random dungeons or quests that the player can explore. This can add a lot of replayability to a game, as the player never knows what they will encounter next.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-AI-Will-Completely-Change-Video-Games-1"><a href="#Part-3-How-AI-Will-Completely-Change-Video-Games-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How AI Will Completely Change Video Games"></a>Part 3 <strong>How AI Will Completely Change Video Games</strong></h2><p>It is not a secret that AI is changing the world as we know it. With its ability to enable computers to learn and improve from experience, AI is paving the way for a future where machines can handle more complex tasks. And nowhere is this more apparent than in the world of video gaming.</p>
<p>In the past, developers brought in AI primarily for simple things like making certain NPCs (non-player characters) move and act realistically. But now, <strong>artificial intelligence in video games</strong> is being used for much more complex tasks like generating procedural content and creating believable human-like behavior. This results in a new generation of <strong>AI game playing</strong> that are more immersive and playable.</p>

<p>The gaming world is ever-changing, with developers looking to create innovative ways to immerse players into their digital worlds. One such technology that has begun to sweep is <strong>AI in the game industry</strong>.</p>
<p>AI is a powerful tool in many ways to improve the gaming experience. It can make <strong>artificial intelligence in computer games</strong> more believable and add replayability and immersion to games, and we can expect to see even more impressive applications in the future.</p>

<p>04 [8 Games with Incredible Artificial Intelligence](#Part 4)</p>
<p>05 [What AI Video Games Assets Do Filmora Have?](#Part 5)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-AI-in-Gaming-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-AI-in-Gaming-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What Is AI in Gaming?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What Is AI in Gaming?</strong></h2><p>In simple terms, AI is a set of algorithms that allow a computer to learn and improve from experience. Although you can apply it in many ways, <strong>artificial intelligence in video games</strong> is usually helpful to create more intelligent and more believable non-player characters (NPCs).</p>
<p>For example, an AI system might be helpful to determine how an NPC reacts to the player’s actions. If the player tries to steal from an NPC, the AI might make the NPC angry and more likely to attack the player. Alternatively, if the player is friendly to an NPC, the <strong>AI game playing</strong> might make the NPC more likely to help the player in future interactions.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Why-Does-AI-in-Gaming-Matter-3"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Does-AI-in-Gaming-Matter-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Why Does AI in Gaming Matter?"></a>Part 2 <strong>Why Does AI in Gaming Matter?</strong></h2><p>One of the most vital aspects of <strong>AI in video games</strong> is that it can make games more believable and immersive for players. When games can convincingly simulate human-like behavior, it can be a much more enjoyable experience for gamers. AI can make NPCs seem more lifelike and make the game world feel more believable.</p>
<p>AI is also becoming increasingly important for creating procedural content. This is where the game generates content on its own, rather than relying on pre-made assets. For example, a game might use procedural generation to create random dungeons or quests that the player can explore. This can add a lot of replayability to a game, as the player never knows what they will encounter next.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-AI-Will-Completely-Change-Video-Games-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-AI-Will-Completely-Change-Video-Games-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How AI Will Completely Change Video Games"></a>Part 3 <strong>How AI Will Completely Change Video Games</strong></h2><p>It is not a secret that AI is changing the world as we know it. With its ability to enable computers to learn and improve from experience, AI is paving the way for a future where machines can handle more complex tasks. And nowhere is this more apparent than in the world of video gaming.</p>
<p>In the past, developers brought in AI primarily for simple things like making certain NPCs (non-player characters) move and act realistically. But now, <strong>artificial intelligence in video games</strong> is being used for much more complex tasks like generating procedural content and creating believable human-like behavior. This results in a new generation of <strong>AI game playing</strong> that are more immersive and playable.</p>

This Article Will Show You How to Make a Time Lapse Video with Adobe After Effects"></a>Time Lapse Video Is Very Interesting and Creative, Which Usually Attracts More Attention. This Article Will Show You How to Make a Time Lapse Video with Adobe After Effects</h2><p>Time-Lapse movies are great for a variety of projects; you can use them as establishing shots in sitcoms, corporate marketing videos, and they can make lovely backgrounds for animated slideshows. A time-lapse video is essentially a series of photographs taken at regular intervals to depict how the environment changes gradually over a shorter period of time. In this article, we’ll demonstrate how you may quickly and easily build an After Effects time-lapse effect.</p>
<p>With that said, let’s start!</p>
<h2 id="Step-1-Create-a-new-composition"><a href="#Step-1-Create-a-new-composition" class="headerlink" title="Step 1. Create a new composition"></a>Step 1. Create a new composition</h2><p>Calculating your composition length to accommodate the frame rate and number of images is the first step in generating a time-lapse video.</p>
<ol>
<li>Verify the number of images you have for your Sequence.</li>
<li>New Composition Creation. Selecting a frame rate: A time lapse film produced at 30 frames per second will flow smoothly, but you can select any frame rate you like.</li>
<li>To determine the duration of your composition, divide the number of photographs you have by the frame rate you’ve chosen. For instance, if you use 600 photos at 30 frames per second, your composition will last 20 seconds.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Step-2-Import-your-images"><a href="#Step-2-Import-your-images" class="headerlink" title="Step 2. Import your images"></a>Step 2. Import your images</h2><p>You are prepared to make a time-lapse sequence if all of your photographs are saved to the same folder and are in the same order. If you are working directly from your Camera, you will likely have Camera Raw files, although this procedure works with PNG and JPEG sequences.</p>
<ol>
<li>Press Command&#x2F;Control I on your keyboard or select File &gt; Import. Find the folder holding your image sequence.</li>
<li>To begin, select the first picture in the sequence. If all of your images have accurate names, After Effects will be able to identify a sequence of images.</li>
<li>Make sure the Force Alphabetical Order and Camera Raw Sequence checkboxes are selected. Your Time-Lapse Sequence will display in the Project Browser Panel after you click Import.</li>
<li>Once you’ve watched how it plays, you can adjust the Frame Rate by right-clicking the Sequence in the Project Browser and selecting Interpret Footage &gt; Main.</li>
<li>To update your time-lapse, modify the Frame Rate setting and click OK.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="Step-3-Create-movements"><a href="#Step-3-Create-movements" class="headerlink" title="Step 3. Create movements"></a>Step 3. Create movements</h2><ol>
<li>After Effects’ Time-Lapse Sequence can be used just like any other standalone clip. This implies that you may give your time-lapse clip movement by adding Keyframes and Effects.</li>
<li>Place your Playhead at the beginning of the clip after choosing the Image Sequence. Make a keyframe for the scale or position.</li>
<li>To generate a second Keyframe for the value of your choice, move to the end of the clip. Make any necessary Clip modifications.</li>
<li>Right-click on the timeline, choose New &gt; Adjustment Layer, then add your effects to the Adjustment Layer to add effects like noise and grain.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Step-4-Create-slow-motion-from-a-video"><a href="#Step-4-Create-slow-motion-from-a-video" class="headerlink" title="Step 4. Create slow motion from a video"></a>Step 4. Create slow motion from a video</h2><p>You can import your video after you’ve shot it to prepare it for editing. The same steps, including naming your photos in order, must be taken for the Time Lapse sequence. It may be advantageous to entirely rename both your Image Sequence and Performer clip.</p>
<ol>

<p>After Effects CC must be opened, a new project must be created, the Import File menu option must be selected, and the appropriate folder containing the altered still images must be located and selected before the time-lapse photos can be turned into a film.
