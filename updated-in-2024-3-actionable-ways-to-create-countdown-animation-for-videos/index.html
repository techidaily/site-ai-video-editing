Whether you have a real mouseless experience or want to take it as a challenge, let’s get the things clear first.</p>
<ul>
<li>We need to create a <strong>20 seconds</strong> music video.</li>
<li>We will only be using the footage from the <strong>stock library</strong>.</li>
<li>We will be using music from the <strong>Wondershare</strong> Filmora <strong>library</strong>.</li>
<li>We will have 5 minutes to <strong>review</strong> the footage and the music available.</li>
<li>And most importantly, we don’t have a <strong>keyboard</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Step 1. Review your footage</p>
<p>Our first and most crucial step will be to use our imagination and creativity. So get those neurons firing, and let us go!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/editing-use-mouse-only-with-filmora-team-3.gif"
                      alt="reviewing the footage"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Head to the <strong>stock media</strong> folder on the bar mentioned above, the Wondershare Filmora.</li>
<li>Or you can simply look towards the left window, where you will find the sample <strong>videos tab.</strong></li>
<li>Click on the sample videos tab, and a new <strong>window</strong> will appear on the library screen.</li>
<li>Here you will find almost more than <strong>20 videos.</strong></li>
<li>So apart from using the actual recorded footage, we will work our way with what we have from <strong>default</strong>.</li>
<li>For the music, we would be scrolling in the <strong>stock audio library.</strong></li>
<li>Click on the <strong>audio tab</strong> above and start <strong>scrolling</strong>.</li>
<li>You will also find some categories in the <strong>left window</strong>.</li>
<li>Choose the category of your choice and <strong>listen</strong> to the audio.</li>
</ul>
<p>Do whatever suit you best. Keep in mind you only have 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Step 2. Pick music for your clips</p>
<p>Suppose you have found audio that speaks your vibe. The next step would be to find a video that tallies that audio. Let us suppose we have audio that is of the hip-hop genre. Let that creativity shine now!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="drone shot of rooftops"
                ></p>
<p>If you like to add a more <strong>classical vibe</strong>, pick a classical song or audio from the audio library.</p>
<ul>
<li>After picking the song, move on to the sample videos tab and search for videos that match a <strong>classic vibe.</strong></li>
<li>Now random <strong>close-up shots</strong> of a piano, cinematic footage of a big <strong>orchestra</strong>, or simple landscapes with minimalistic movement while focusing on a single object, consider the example below.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="still shot of a bench"
                ></p>
<p>Now that a scenario is constructed, our next step is to arrange these clips in the Wondershare Filmora timeline.</p>
<p>Step 3. Download the clips and audio</p>
<p><strong>You have 15 minutes to create the music video. Start the timer!</strong> Once you have selected a sample video and audio that matches your scenario, you can <strong>download</strong> them from the bottom right icon on the thumbnail. Only if you still need to download them.</p>
<p>Step 4. Insert the audio into the timeline</p>
<ul>
<li>The first step is to drag the audio to the <strong>timeline</strong>.</li>
<li>Now play the <strong>audio</strong> from the start. If you can work with the audio as a whole, then it’s perfect.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want your audio to <strong>start</strong> at a certain point. You have to follow the below-mentioned steps. It is as simple as that!</p>
<p><img

                      alt="splitting the audio on wondershare filmora"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Add</strong> your audio to the timeline.</li>
<li>Then move the <strong>timer</strong> or the slider where you want your audio to start.</li>
<li><strong>Right-click</strong> on the audio file. Select split.</li>
<li>Your audio file will split into two parts.</li>
<li>Delete the prior file and drag the file ahead to the start of the timeline.</li>
</ul>
<p>The next step is to add the videos to the timeline.</p>
<p>Step 5. Add the video to the timeline</p>
<p>When you have your audio in the timeline, your next step is adding the video. After you have trimmed or split your audio to your wish, follow the below steps.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Click</strong> and <strong>drag</strong> to drop the video clips where you want the video to start.</li>
<li><strong>Play</strong> the audio first is a good feature for where you want your video to insert.</li>
<li>Then adjust the <strong>timeline</strong> slider on that point.</li>
<li>Simply drag your video and drop it into the timeline.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> now, remember you have multiple videos to match the audio length as we create a music video. The more, the more optimistic. Now, remember you have multiple videos to match the audio length as we create a music video. The more, the more optimistic.</p>
<p>Download the remaining videos that you would wish to be added to the music and follow the steps mentioned above to add the clips where you desire.</p>
<p>Step 6. Finishing touches</p>

It’s simple; in the 1950s, video-making technologies were slightly advanced, although films were more about rock and roll and poodle skirts. So, without further dilly-dallying, let’s learn how to create a retro 1950-style video with this simple Filmora tutorial.</p>
<h2 id="Preparation"><a href="#Preparation" class="headerlink" title="Preparation"></a>Preparation</h2><p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="1950 vintage scene"
                ></p>
<p>Shooting a video to teleport yourself to the 1950s doesn’t need to be complicated. You simply need to look the part in the video. For example, you can wear velvet-collar jackets, stovepipe trousers, carefully combed back hair, and other trendy styles in the 50s. It’s even better if you can find those vintage chairs in your grandparent’s collection.</p>
<p>How to create a 1950s vintage film:</p>

                      alt="add your video on filmora"

<p>First, fire up Filmora and load the video you want to send back to the 1950s. Then, drag your footage onto the editing timeline.</p>

                      alt="apply a cropping effect to the video"
                ></p>
<p>Once the video is successfully added to Filmora, click the <strong>Effect</strong> tab on the top menu bar and choose the <strong>Crop</strong> effect under the <strong>Utility</strong> folder. Make sure you add the Crop effect two or three tracks above the original video track.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="click the effect tab"
                ></p>
<p>Double-click the Crop effect, then change the Left and Right values to make the video look like it was shot in the 50s. You can set the values as 10.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Up to here, you’ll realize that your video doesn’t still look like a 1950s film per se. Double-click your video clip and choose the <strong>3D LUT</strong> option under the <strong>Color</strong> category. Then, open the drop-down menu and choose <strong>Warm Film</strong>. This will make your video look like it was shot using an old camera.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Please don’t stop there; we want to make the footage slightly grainy. In other words, you need to make the footage have a lot of grain and low light. To do that, tap the <strong>Overlay</strong> menu under the Effects tab, then click <strong>Old Film</strong>. After that, choose the <strong>Random Dust, Dirty Film,</strong> and <strong>Subtle Grain</strong> effects and add them to the tracks above your video clip. Remember to use as much grain as possible to give your footage that vintage look of the 1950s.</p>

<p>Once the video is successfully added to Filmora, click the <strong>Effect</strong> tab on the top menu bar and choose the <strong>Crop</strong> effect under the <strong>Utility</strong> folder. Make sure you add the Crop effect two or three tracks above the original video track.</p>

<p>Up to here, you’ll realize that your video doesn’t still look like a 1950s film per se. Double-click your video clip and choose the <strong>3D LUT</strong> option under the <strong>Color</strong> category. Then, open the drop-down menu and choose <strong>Warm Film</strong>. This will make your video look like it was shot using an old camera.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Please don’t stop there; we want to make the footage slightly grainy. In other words, you need to make the footage have a lot of grain and low light. To do that, tap the <strong>Overlay</strong> menu under the Effects tab, then click <strong>Old Film</strong>. After that, choose the <strong>Random Dust, Dirty Film,</strong> and <strong>Subtle Grain</strong> effects and add them to the tracks above your video clip. Remember to use as much grain as possible to give your footage that vintage look of the 1950s.</p>

<p><strong>How to Set Up an Image Slideshow in the Photos Application</strong></p>

<p>Adhering to the concern, there is the Impress slideshow app, which is essentially a complementary utility of the LibreOffice Suite.

<p>To begin with, navigate to the official LibreOffice website and initiate a free download of the application in your Windows 10 device. All you need to do is, hit the ‘Download Now’ tab, followed by selecting ‘Windows’ as the operating system. For saving the latter’s setup wizard to your device, click on ‘Download Version 6.3.6’ tab.</p>

Once the installation process gets completed, head to and click on the ‘LibreOffice Impress’ tab to launch the utility and land across the following interface:</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Include Slide Transitions</strong></p>
<p>Navigate to the toolbar at the right and tap ‘Slide Transition’ icon to get a display of the preset transition effects. You are allowed to supplement each slide of the presentation with a varying transition effect, or apply a single effect to all of them. To proceed with the latter option, choose the desired transition effect and hit the ‘Apply to All Slides’ tab at the bottom of the ‘Slide Transition’ window.</p>
<p>You can further, modify the speed and sound settings of the applied transition effects. When the adjustments make you happy, navigate to and hit the ‘Play’ tab in the ‘Slide Transition’ window for previewing the applied transition effects.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Customize the Presentation</strong></p>
<p>Moving ahead, the ‘Slide Transition’ window allows you to adjust the screen time of the transition effects. You can either set automatic play duration for each effect, or prefer changing the transitions by a mouse click.</p>
<p>The automatic duration can be set by clicking on the ‘Automatically After’ radio button, followed by entering a desired value in the text box. After setting the time value, click on the ‘Apply to All Slides’ tab to confine all the slide transitions within the set duration.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Adding Subtitles to the Slides</strong></p>
<p>To add a subtitle to any slide, navigate to the ‘Drawing Toolbar’ and click on the ‘Text Box’ icon. You can now, drag the text box to a desired position within the slide and expand it there to type the required text. Select the text box and head to the ‘Properties’ icon in the right side toolbar to customize the added text.</p>
<p>Clicking on the icon will present a series of text formatting options which you can work with to spark up the text as per your will. You can change the font style using the ‘Bold’, ‘Italic’, ‘Underline’ and ‘Strikethrough’ icons, or make the subtitle appear in a suitable font color.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7: Adding a Background Music</strong></p>
<p>To add a background audio within the slides, select any one and open the ‘Sound’ menu by clicking on the latter’s drop down arrow. From here, choose the ‘Other’ sound option. You can now browse through and select a desired music track from your device’s media gallery to add to the selected slide. Skip enabling the ‘Apply to All Slides’ option here; lest the track would play at the appearance of each presentation slide.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8: Preview the Presentation</strong></p>
<p>To have a look at your efforts, navigate to the ‘Menu Bar’ at the top of the app screen and hit the ‘Slide Show’ tab. In the menu that drops down, select the ‘Start From the First Slide’ option to view the presentation from the beginning.
