<p><strong>2. Organize your Timeline and Video Tracks</strong></p>
<h5 id="Step1-Create-Tracks-for-Picture-Editing"><a href="#Step1-Create-Tracks-for-Picture-Editing" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Create Tracks for Picture Editing"></a>Step1 Create Tracks for Picture Editing</h5><p>Keep the first three tracks for picture editing.

<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h5 id="Step3-Create-Tracks-for-Effects"><a href="#Step3-Create-Tracks-for-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Create Tracks for Effects"></a>Step3 Create Tracks for Effects</h5><p>Set the fifth video track as the effect track. It will include all effects from firmware that do not apply to the footage directly.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

In this example, you can put the subtitles here.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="create tracks for on and off content"
                ></p>
<p><strong>3. Organize your Audio Tracks</strong></p>
<h5 id="Step1-Create-Tracks-for-Dialects"><a href="#Step1-Create-Tracks-for-Dialects" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Create Tracks for Dialects"></a>Step1 Create Tracks for Dialects</h5><p>The first two tracks are usually for dialects. You can include all the dialects of characters in these tracks. Keep one track for each character. If you have more characters, feel free to assign more tracks to them.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_11.jpg"
                      alt="create tracks for dialects"

<h5 id="Step2-Create-Tracks-for-Additional-Audio"><a href="#Step2-Create-Tracks-for-Additional-Audio" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Create Tracks for Additional Audio"></a>Step2 Create Tracks for Additional Audio</h5><p>The third audio track could be for any additional audio, such as voiceover. If you don’t have a voiceover in your video, you can leave it empty.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_12.jpg"
                      alt="create tracks for additional audio"
                ></p>
<h5 id="Step3-Create-Tracks-for-Sound-Effects"><a href="#Step3-Create-Tracks-for-Sound-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Create Tracks for Sound Effects"></a>Step3 Create Tracks for Sound Effects</h5><p>The fourth track could usually be the sound effects track. You can add all the clapping sounds, laughing, and all kinds of other foley sound here.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_13.jpg"

<h5 id="Step4-Create-Tracks-for-Ambient-Sound"><a href="#Step4-Create-Tracks-for-Ambient-Sound" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Create Tracks for Ambient Sound"></a>Step4 Create Tracks for Ambient Sound</h5><p>Keep the fifth track for Ambient sound and room tone. You can use it to keep a very subtle environment sound in specific scenes. For example, you can use the room tone recorded on sets.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

But, of course, you could also keep it empty if your project has no background music.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_15.jpg"
                      alt="create tracks for background music"
                ></p>
<p><strong>4. Color Code Your Clips</strong></p>
<p>Suppose you want to make the timeline even easier to view. In that case, you can select all clips from a camera or a subject and color code them into a specific color. For example, you can color code the footage from camera A in red, camera B in yellow, and Camera C in blue. Now, when you look at the Timeline, you can quickly distinguish footage from different cameras.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/timeline_16.jpg"
                      alt="color code your clips"
                ></p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Pro-Tips-about-Improving-Video-Editing-Efficiency"><a href="#Part-2-Pro-Tips-about-Improving-Video-Editing-Efficiency" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Pro Tips about Improving Video Editing Efficiency"></a>Part 2: Pro Tips about Improving Video Editing Efficiency</h2><p><strong>1. Rename Individual Clips</strong></p>
<p>It would be much simpler to organize the timeline if you could quickly rename individual clips. Cut a clip into smaller segments and give each clip a different name. Make sure these clips have a name other than the source video to avoid confusion.</p>
<p><strong>2. Remove Empty Timeline</strong></p>
<p>For quick video editing, timeline organization is essential. Organize your materials and footage at all times to prevent delays. Put everything in the correct folders with the proper labels. To keep your timeline organized, select “Delete Empty Tracks” from the context menu when right-clicking on the track window on the left.</p>
<p><strong>3. Use Keyboard Shortcuts</strong></p>
<p>Knowing keyboard shortcuts allows you to carry out the editing process quickly and precisely.</p>
<p><strong>4. Select Good Music</strong></p>
<p>Don’t only concentrate on the images; the music also affects how well your video comes out. For example, suppose you’re making a drama movie. In that case, you should pick the right music track to evoke particular emotions in your viewers.</p>
<p><strong>5. Add Text and Graphics</strong></p>
<p>Depending on the style of the video, adding text, graphics, or stock video to your project could be helpful. You should provide more text than just the title for some videos.</p>
<h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>You don’t need to be an expert in video editing to produce high-quality videos. In reality, you can complete the task without any expensive, high-end professional training. So how? Well, with the proper video editing tools like Wondershare Filmora, anything is possible. Follow the above guide, organize your timeline and keep the tracks consistent while video editing on Filmora so it’s easier to come back and edit a project or share with other editors.</p>

<p>Knowing keyboard shortcuts allows you to carry out the editing process quickly and precisely.</p>

<p>Don’t only concentrate on the images; the music also affects how well your video comes out. For example, suppose you’re making a drama movie. In that case, you should pick the right music track to evoke particular emotions in your viewers.</p>
<p><strong>5. Add Text and Graphics</strong></p>
<p>Depending on the style of the video, adding text, graphics, or stock video to your project could be helpful. You should provide more text than just the title for some videos.</p>
