<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-a-GIF-File-2"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-a-GIF-File-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What Is a GIF File?"></a>Part 1 What Is a GIF File?</h2><p><strong>GIF</strong> is an acronym for Graphics Interchange Format. Talking of the explicit <strong>GIF meaning</strong>, this one is a short motion snippet created from a set of serially arranged still images in a looping motion. Talking of the origin of GIFs, these were first introduced in 1987 by Steve Wilhite from the US based online service provider CompuServe, precisely on June 15.</p>
<p><strong>GIFs</strong> serve as portable image formats for still and animated images, and are primarily small sized files. However, these are very well compatible with large content files too. In today’s times, GIFs are a trending means of entertainment based content sharing and intensified message delivery to target audience. Additionally, you can conveniently use motion images in the <strong>GIF format</strong> as effective tools of improvising and upgrading your marketing straggles for an enhanced brand promotion.</p>
<p>Considering the immense content varieties of GIFs, these are an eminent part of blogs, social media posts and product websites. You can even use them to objectify your emotions and feelings when conversing with peers through the latest instant messaging applications. The bottom line is, GIFs are an integral part of today’s modern and dynamic communication patterns and needs.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Are-GIF-File-Subject-to-Copyright-2"><a href="#Part-2-Are-GIF-File-Subject-to-Copyright-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Are GIF File Subject to Copyright?"></a>Part 2 Are GIF File Subject to Copyright?</h2><p>The straight and simple answer to this query is a ‘Yes’. CIFs are indeed subject to copyright, just like its creative counterparts. These essentially constitute an original copyrighted creation, or may even originate from an existing copyright protected work. However, you may encounter potential glitches when choosing to work with <strong>GIF images</strong> while sticking with legal constraints.</p>
<p>Talking of the potential issues with the legality of GIF usage, there are two major concerns; the first being the sharing of unlicensed copyrighted GIF content, while the absence of legalized methods for licensed commercial use of these short motion clips being the second. Talking of possible reasons, there is again a duel. At present, there no copyright exercise from the end of original creators of GIF content, along with the absence of exact copyright claim constraints that can be imposed by content owners.</p>
<p>This scenario poses a potential need to look for suitable mitigation methods to curb copyright claims and disputes resulting from illegal use of GIFs. As a matter of fact, the development of a proper legal framework for undisputed GIF usage is a time consuming process. However, you can stay cautious by adhering to the following measures in the meantime:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Refrain from using GIFs in a manner that would appear unsolicited to you, had you been the content owner.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Take a note to credit the original creators in case3 you are using the GIF content from a known copyright source.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Avoid drawing content from doubtful sources, instead search for trusted alternatives, or creating a GIF of your own would be an even better and safe choice.</p>

You can ensure an effective reach and impact of your brand if you include these catchy, short animation loops in your promotion strategy.

<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-a-GIF-File-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-a-GIF-File-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What Is a GIF File?"></a>Part 1 What Is a GIF File?</h2><p><strong>GIF</strong> is an acronym for Graphics Interchange Format. Talking of the explicit <strong>GIF meaning</strong>, this one is a short motion snippet created from a set of serially arranged still images in a looping motion. Talking of the origin of GIFs, these were first introduced in 1987 by Steve Wilhite from the US based online service provider CompuServe, precisely on June 15.</p>
<p><strong>GIFs</strong> serve as portable image formats for still and animated images, and are primarily small sized files. However, these are very well compatible with large content files too. In today’s times, GIFs are a trending means of entertainment based content sharing and intensified message delivery to target audience. Additionally, you can conveniently use motion images in the <strong>GIF format</strong> as effective tools of improvising and upgrading your marketing straggles for an enhanced brand promotion.</p>
<p>Considering the immense content varieties of GIFs, these are an eminent part of blogs, social media posts and product websites. You can even use them to objectify your emotions and feelings when conversing with peers through the latest instant messaging applications. The bottom line is, GIFs are an integral part of today’s modern and dynamic communication patterns and needs.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Are-GIF-File-Subject-to-Copyright-3"><a href="#Part-2-Are-GIF-File-Subject-to-Copyright-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Are GIF File Subject to Copyright?"></a>Part 2 Are GIF File Subject to Copyright?</h2><p>The straight and simple answer to this query is a ‘Yes’. CIFs are indeed subject to copyright, just like its creative counterparts. These essentially constitute an original copyrighted creation, or may even originate from an existing copyright protected work. However, you may encounter potential glitches when choosing to work with <strong>GIF images</strong> while sticking with legal constraints.</p>
<p>Talking of the potential issues with the legality of GIF usage, there are two major concerns; the first being the sharing of unlicensed copyrighted GIF content, while the absence of legalized methods for licensed commercial use of these short motion clips being the second. Talking of possible reasons, there is again a duel. At present, there no copyright exercise from the end of original creators of GIF content, along with the absence of exact copyright claim constraints that can be imposed by content owners.</p>
<p>This scenario poses a potential need to look for suitable mitigation methods to curb copyright claims and disputes resulting from illegal use of GIFs. As a matter of fact, the development of a proper legal framework for undisputed GIF usage is a time consuming process. However, you can stay cautious by adhering to the following measures in the meantime:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Refrain from using GIFs in a manner that would appear unsolicited to you, had you been the content owner.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Take a note to credit the original creators in case3 you are using the GIF content from a known copyright source.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Avoid drawing content from doubtful sources, instead search for trusted alternatives, or creating a GIF of your own would be an even better and safe choice.</p>

<p>A <strong>PowerPoint Looping slideshow</strong> automatically starts over from the beginning after displaying the last slide. A particular slide is displayed for a certain amount of time interval. Once the time has elapsed, the slide automatically moves to the next one. It is sometimes used in seminars to keep the audience busy before the main presentation commences. In most tradeshows, the videos or information you notice repeatedly playing on its own are in a loop. The transition and slide sets get tweaked to work that way. In Nigeria, most banks use looped slides to display their welcome message. Looping slides make display work more accessible and give time to face other activities while your slide runs automatically.</p>

Looping a PowerPoint slideshowmakes a presentation more accessible and more attractive. Studies show that humans tend to remember more of what they see than what they hear. You should use a <strong>PowerPoint-loop slideshow</strong> if you want to make a lasting impression while holding that conference, pitch to your boss at work, or even bid for that project**.** Here are some other reasons you should consider looping in your nextPowerPoint slide show.</p>
<p>A looping PowerPoint slideshow runs automatically. A typical PowerPoint presentation moves to the next slide when the presenter clicks the mouse, but a <strong>looping slideshow</strong> does not need human participation. It displays the next slide automatically after the time interval has elapsed.</p>
<p>It can be helpful to welcome guests to a meeting or Newcomers to an office reception area.</p>
<p>It ensures that latecomers do not miss any significant part of the presentation because a <strong>PowerPoint automatic slideshow loop</strong> starts all over again after displaying the last slide.</p>
<p>Setting up a <strong>looping slideshow</strong> is easy and does not require much equipment. You’re all set to go if you have a computer and projector.</p>
<p>It gives the speaker more time to focus on the audience and interact with them rather than concentrating on getting the next slide correctly.</p>
<p>With or without the presence of an operator, the PowerPoint presentation can display the slides configured to display.</p>
<p>It saves you the stress of arranging and rearranging slides during a meeting or an event.</p>
<p>It makes presentation easy and allows the large audience to flow with the speaker as they do not have to read from documents while trying to keep up with the speaker.</p>
<p>A PowerPoint configured to loop continuously can be used to pass general information.</p>
<p>Not everyone likes speaking in public or making a presentation in front of a large crowd. Someone like me immediately starts sweating profusely and has heart palpitations when many eyes are on me. In this kind of situation, a <strong>looped PowerPoint slideshow</strong> helps take the tension off a nervous speaker as the audience will most likely be concentrating on the slideshows instead of you.</p>

<p>A looping PowerPoint slideshow runs automatically. A typical PowerPoint presentation moves to the next slide when the presenter clicks the mouse, but a <strong>looping slideshow</strong> does not need human participation. It displays the next slide automatically after the time interval has elapsed.</p>
<p>It can be helpful to welcome guests to a meeting or Newcomers to an office reception area.</p>
<p>It ensures that latecomers do not miss any significant part of the presentation because a <strong>PowerPoint automatic slideshow loop</strong> starts all over again after displaying the last slide.</p>
<p>Setting up a <strong>looping slideshow</strong> is easy and does not require much equipment. You’re all set to go if you have a computer and projector.</p>
<p>It gives the speaker more time to focus on the audience and interact with them rather than concentrating on getting the next slide correctly.</p>
<p>With or without the presence of an operator, the PowerPoint presentation can display the slides configured to display.</p>
<p>It saves you the stress of arranging and rearranging slides during a meeting or an event.</p>
<p>It makes presentation easy and allows the large audience to flow with the speaker as they do not have to read from documents while trying to keep up with the speaker.</p>
<p>A PowerPoint configured to loop continuously can be used to pass general information.</p>
<p>Not everyone likes speaking in public or making a presentation in front of a large crowd. Someone like me immediately starts sweating profusely and has heart palpitations when many eyes are on me. In this kind of situation, a <strong>looped PowerPoint slideshow</strong> helps take the tension off a nervous speaker as the audience will most likely be concentrating on the slideshows instead of you.</p>

                      alt="Open your PowerPoint presentation"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Set up the slideshow</strong></p>
<p>Once your desired presentation is open, go to the “Set Up” group on the “Slide Show” tab and then click on the “Set Up Slide Show” button. Once your desired presentation is open, go to the “Set Up” group on the “Slide Show” tab and then click on the “Set Up Slide Show” button.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/how-to-make-a-looping-slideshow-2.jpeg"
                      alt="set up the slideshow"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Choose your mode of control over the slides.</strong></p>
<p>Adialogue box will come up. In the” show options, “select if you want it to get presented by a speaker, which is the default setting of PowerPoint. This option gives the speaker or presenter control over when to advance the slide. The second option, which an individual browses, restricts the control of the speaker over the advancement of the slide, likewise the third option. Checkbox next to “Loop continuously until ‘Esc.’ Then click [OK]. The slide keeps looping automatically until the speaker or presenter presses ok.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/how-to-make-a-looping-slideshow-3.jpg"
                      alt="Choose your mode of control"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Select the number of slides you want to be displayed.</strong></p>
<p>From the “Slides” preview side panel, tap your first slide, press and hold [Shift] and click your last slide or input the number of slides you want to display. This option will select all of the slides you want to display.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/how-to-make-a-looping-slideshow-4.jpg"
                      alt="Select the number of slides"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Set up Transitions mode</strong></p>
<p>Click the [Transitions] tab. The transition appears between slides when a slideshow is displayed. In the Transitions tab in PowerPoint, you can choose the type of transition (such as Fade). From the “Timing” group, uncheck the box next to “On Mouse Click” and check “After .”This setting enables the transition to occur after your preferred time and not when you click the mouse.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/how-to-make-a-looping-slideshow-5.jpg"
                      alt="Set up Transition Mode"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Adjust the time interval</strong></p>
<p>To adjust the duration you would like each slide to display, click the up and down arrows in the “After:” field within the “Timing” group. When your slideshow reaches the last slide, it will automatically loop back to the beginning.</p>
