<h2 id="Add-Text-to-a-Video-Online"><a href="#Add-Text-to-a-Video-Online" class="headerlink" title="Add Text to a Video Online"></a>Add Text to a Video Online</h2><p>One of the easiest ways that you can add text to any video is to use a free online solution. There are many online tools to choose from but VEED is a free solution that is easy to use and offers a wide range of features to choose from.</p>
<p>Here’s how you can use VEED to add text to your video;</p>

Click on “Upload Your Video” to open a new project. In the new project screen that appears, tap on “Upload a file” to add your video.</p>

For that, we recommend Wondershare Filmora, a desktop editing suite that has a lot of useful features.</p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> combines its wealth of editing features and a simple user interface to make it one of the most effective video editors in the market.

<p>Step1Install PowerDirector on your device. Open it and tap “New Project” at the top. Select an aspect ratio depending on the video project you are working on and enter a project name.</p>
<p><img

Due to this, you have more chances to lose your audience and viewers.</p>
<p>In visual storytelling, if you will insert more clips with close shots, it will make the environment cool. The crazy thing is that you can make mimic shots easily at home by utilizing household objects. Let’s check out one of the examples.</p>

If you will have more than two characters, then make dialogues for everyone and practice it again and again to give a fascinating look.</p>
<p>Then speak to your audience, make sure that what you are speaking is vivid and make everything simple and crystal clear.</p>
<h5 id="Step2Shot-a-primary-video"><a href="#Step2Shot-a-primary-video" class="headerlink" title="Step2Shot a primary video"></a>Step2Shot a primary video</h5><p>First of all, make a primary video according to your script by implementing a camera at one side, or you can also change the angle of the camera lens during shooting to have a look from all sides.</p>

<ul>
<li>Watch your edits back and check out where you need.</li>

Two Types of B-rolls: Storytelling Video B-rolls"></a>Part 4. Two Types of B-rolls: Storytelling Video B-rolls</h2><p>During the creation of short films or any storytelling videos, if a person sits and speaks without showing any character or anything else, it will turn boring. Due to this, you have more chances to lose your audience and viewers.</p>
<p>In visual storytelling, if you will insert more clips with close shots, it will make the environment cool. The crazy thing is that you can make mimic shots easily at home by utilizing household objects. Let’s check out one of the examples.</p>
<h3 id="Example-1-Film-B-roll-footage-with-food-1"><a href="#Example-1-Film-B-roll-footage-with-food-1" class="headerlink" title="Example 1. Film B-roll footage with food"></a>Example 1. Film B-roll footage with food</h3><p>So let’s add some b-roll to give it more context even if you have a master shot of yourself looking off frame alone.</p>
<h5 id="Step1Write-a-script-1"><a href="#Step1Write-a-script-1" class="headerlink" title="Step1Write a script"></a>Step1Write a script</h5><p>Before making any video, the first step is to write a script for the whole video. If you will have more than two characters, then make dialogues for everyone and practice it again and again to give a fascinating look.</p>
<p>Then speak to your audience, make sure that what you are speaking is vivid and make everything simple and crystal clear.</p>
<h5 id="Step2Shot-a-primary-video-1"><a href="#Step2Shot-a-primary-video-1" class="headerlink" title="Step2Shot a primary video"></a>Step2Shot a primary video</h5><p>First of all, make a primary video according to your script by implementing a camera at one side, or you can also change the angle of the camera lens during shooting to have a look from all sides.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/primary-footage-of-a-video.gif"
                      alt="primary footage of a video"
                ></p>
<p>As you can see that it’s kind of boring for the audience, but we will make it more unique by implementing closer shots. For this, follow the last step:</p>
<h5 id="Step3Make-B-roll-shots-1"><a href="#Step3Make-B-roll-shots-1" class="headerlink" title="Step3Make B-roll shots"></a>Step3Make B-roll shots</h5><p>Make closer shots of things which the character have to select and pick up. Check out two B-roll shots for the main video:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, make a closer shot of the object (Snacks) that the character is noticing prior.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="b roll footage number 1"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Second, create more intimate footage of the second object (Banana) which the character will select and grab.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="b roll footage number 2"
                ></p>

Make B-roll shots with a cardboard"></a>Example 2. Make B-roll shots with a cardboard</h3><p>Try using readily accessible cardboard to create light effects in different shapes and give the film a fantastical place. These methods frequently produce artistic videos that transmit unique moods to viewers.</p>
<p>Only experienced photographers and videographers understand how to use these fundamental tricks to gain viewers into the photos.</p>
<p>The intriguing thing is that if the light is more shaped, it will more accurately reflect the image’s background, setting, and context. Try it out!</p>
