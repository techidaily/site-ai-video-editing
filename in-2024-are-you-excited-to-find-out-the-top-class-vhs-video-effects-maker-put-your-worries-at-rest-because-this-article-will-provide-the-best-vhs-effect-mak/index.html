<h3 id="The-Subject-Matters"><a href="#The-Subject-Matters" class="headerlink" title="The Subject Matters"></a>The Subject Matters</h3><p>To record a successful rotating video, you need a person or a subject to perform in front of the camera. It can be a model hired by a brand, a social influencer, or maybe it’s you. Keep in mind the following things before recording:</p>
<ul>
<li>The person should get two different costumes.</li>
<li>All the actions need to be rehearsed before shooting</li>
<li>Show affinity and control of the camera.</li>

<h3 id="Shotting-Equipment"><a href="#Shotting-Equipment" class="headerlink" title="Shotting Equipment"></a>Shotting Equipment</h3><p>To record a professional video, you need a good camera. You can use a smartphone to record this footage. There is no need to have a tripod stand or any gear to hold the camera because the camera will be in a rotating position, the same as the subject’s hand.</p>
<p>For this, you need a filmmaker or any person living with you. Just give instructions as shown below to him to record a perfect video for yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Record the whole video in just one direction.</li>
<li>Don’t <strong>shake</strong> the camera because it gives blurry footage.</li>
<li>Ensure to <strong>focus</strong> on the subject during recording.</li>
<li>Don’t <strong>zoom</strong> in or out while recording the video.</li>
<li>Keep the subject in the <strong>middle</strong> of the frame during the recording process.</li>
<li>The <strong>hand rotation</strong> timing is the same as the camera’s rotation.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Filming-of-the-First-Footage"><a href="#Filming-of-the-First-Footage" class="headerlink" title="Filming of the First Footage"></a>Filming of the First Footage</h3><p>To make the footage for the rotating video illusion, we have to record it at least twice to get crystal clear and high-resolution results. Therefore, ensure that we have camera movement in the same direction during all recording times.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can film the video either in the vertical format of the camera or in horizontal format. It all depends upon your script!</p>
<p>Follow the below-mentioned steps to record the first footage for the video:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hold the camera in a perfect format, whatever you choose.</li>
<li>Let the subject stand or sit in the middle of the frame.</li>
<li>The filmmaker can rotate the camera when the subject’s hand rotates.</li>
<li>Try your best to rotate the camera 180 degrees.</li>
<li>Ensure that the camera lens faces the ground at the end of the rotation.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Filming-of-the-Second-Footage"><a href="#Filming-of-the-Second-Footage" class="headerlink" title="Filming of the Second Footage"></a>Filming of the Second Footage</h3><p>To create a second shot, you have to remember that the costume and location of the filming are different from the first footage. Follow the below steps to record it:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first step is to hold the camera in the same direction as the first footage.</li>
<li>When editing, make sure the subject’s position matches the first footage.</li>
<li>Make sure the subject’s hand movement is in the opposite direction from the first shot.</li>
</ul>
