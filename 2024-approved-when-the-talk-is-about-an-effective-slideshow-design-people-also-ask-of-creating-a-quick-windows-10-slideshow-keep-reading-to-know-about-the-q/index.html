                      alt="install process"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> As the installation is done, click on “Start Now” to open the software on the computer. A new black window will be opened on the screen.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="start filmora"
                ></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Click on the “Import Media Files Here” section to select an editable video file or a collection of photos to make the GIF.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add text to gif"
