<h2 id="Part-5-Editing-Tips-to-Improve-Your-Videos"><a href="#Part-5-Editing-Tips-to-Improve-Your-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 5 Editing Tips to Improve Your Videos"></a>Part 5 Editing Tips to Improve Your Videos</h2><p>Apart from trimming, you have to edit different other aspects so that you can make the video engaging and eye-catching. Here are some editing tips you should stick to improve your video content.</p>
<p><strong>Get The Best Video Editor</strong> - Editing a video is equally important as shooting a video. Once you have the best video editor, you can rest assured that your editing work is half done. This is because you have all the tools to turn your raw video into stunning video. You can experiment and come up with the best editing work to your own surprise.</p>
<p><strong>Get The Length Correct</strong> - In today’s world, viewers have very less time to watch videos. Therefore, a lengthy and elaborative video is a bummer. Hence, you should trim the video and keep only the portions that are relevant, engaging, and not boring.</p>
<p><strong>Start with a Bang</strong> - The first impression is always the most important, and hence, the intro of your video is extremely crucial to keep the attention of the audiences intact. To make the intro interesting, you should not only focus on the content but also on video effects and animations that are attention-grabbing.</p>
<p><strong>Smooth Cuts and Soothing Colours</strong> - When you are cutting from one scene or angle to another, the transition should be smooth so that it does not feel abrupt. Therefore, you should cut scenes when the subjects and objects seem to be static so that the transition is smooth naturally. Play attention to colour and the video editors allow you to enhance the quality by adjusting the colors and picture properties.</p>
<p><strong>Graphical Objects</strong> - Use graphical objects and animated texts wherever possible for better explanations. Things can get boring visually when you do not add graphical elements, transitions, and animations appropriately in different places. Similarly, the use of texts and titles makes the video more engaging. Instead of static texts, there are animated texts and titles available with stickers and memes that you can edit your video with.</p>
<p><strong>Play Attention to Sound</strong> - Sound is the most neglected part of a video by amateur video creators when one should pay attention to it. The sound effects can keep the audiences hooked to your video and make them not get bored. Certain sound effects refresh the attention of the audiences when it starts to fade, and hence, you should place the sound effects wisely.</p>
<p><strong>Proper Flow</strong> - The editing work should be smooth so that the flow of the video is smooth and efficient. It takes time, and hence, you can practice and learn video editing so that your video can stand out instantly after your editing touches. Besides, the editing should be such that the video feels like a story that audiences can invest in and get engaged throughout.</p>
<h2 id="Part-6-How-to-Share-Your-Videos"><a href="#Part-6-How-to-Share-Your-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 6 How to Share Your Videos"></a>Part 6 How to Share Your Videos</h2><p>In order to share videos after trimming them, you need to save the video properly.

Different file formats have different features such as compression and lossless. According to the file format, the file size varies for the same duration of video.</p>
<p>Therefore, the video trimmer you are using must have different file formats for saving and exporting the editing video files. Some video trimmers have in-built features to share videos on social media platforms and upload on video streaming platforms like YouTube. Depending on your target audiences, you need to adjust the parameters like aspect ratio, video resolution, as well as duration. Besides, you can upload videos on cloud storage and share with anyone as per your requirements.</p>

<h2 id="Part-5-Editing-Tips-to-Improve-Your-Videos-1"><a href="#Part-5-Editing-Tips-to-Improve-Your-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 5 Editing Tips to Improve Your Videos"></a>Part 5 Editing Tips to Improve Your Videos</h2><p>Apart from trimming, you have to edit different other aspects so that you can make the video engaging and eye-catching. Here are some editing tips you should stick to improve your video content.</p>
<p><strong>Get The Best Video Editor</strong> - Editing a video is equally important as shooting a video. Once you have the best video editor, you can rest assured that your editing work is half done. This is because you have all the tools to turn your raw video into stunning video. You can experiment and come up with the best editing work to your own surprise.</p>
<p><strong>Get The Length Correct</strong> - In today’s world, viewers have very less time to watch videos. Therefore, a lengthy and elaborative video is a bummer. Hence, you should trim the video and keep only the portions that are relevant, engaging, and not boring.</p>
<p><strong>Start with a Bang</strong> - The first impression is always the most important, and hence, the intro of your video is extremely crucial to keep the attention of the audiences intact. To make the intro interesting, you should not only focus on the content but also on video effects and animations that are attention-grabbing.</p>
<p><strong>Smooth Cuts and Soothing Colours</strong> - When you are cutting from one scene or angle to another, the transition should be smooth so that it does not feel abrupt. Therefore, you should cut scenes when the subjects and objects seem to be static so that the transition is smooth naturally. Play attention to colour and the video editors allow you to enhance the quality by adjusting the colors and picture properties.</p>
<p><strong>Graphical Objects</strong> - Use graphical objects and animated texts wherever possible for better explanations. Things can get boring visually when you do not add graphical elements, transitions, and animations appropriately in different places. Similarly, the use of texts and titles makes the video more engaging. Instead of static texts, there are animated texts and titles available with stickers and memes that you can edit your video with.</p>
<p><strong>Play Attention to Sound</strong> - Sound is the most neglected part of a video by amateur video creators when one should pay attention to it. The sound effects can keep the audiences hooked to your video and make them not get bored. Certain sound effects refresh the attention of the audiences when it starts to fade, and hence, you should place the sound effects wisely.</p>
<p><strong>Proper Flow</strong> - The editing work should be smooth so that the flow of the video is smooth and efficient. It takes time, and hence, you can practice and learn video editing so that your video can stand out instantly after your editing touches. Besides, the editing should be such that the video feels like a story that audiences can invest in and get engaged throughout.</p>
<h2 id="Part-6-How-to-Share-Your-Videos-1"><a href="#Part-6-How-to-Share-Your-Videos-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 6 How to Share Your Videos"></a>Part 6 How to Share Your Videos</h2><p>In order to share videos after trimming them, you need to save the video properly. There are different file formats available for video files. For example, MP4 is the most popular video file format among Windows users. On the contrary, MOV is the most popular video file format. Different file formats have different features such as compression and lossless. According to the file format, the file size varies for the same duration of video.</p>
<p>Therefore, the video trimmer you are using must have different file formats for saving and exporting the editing video files. Some video trimmers have in-built features to share videos on social media platforms and upload on video streaming platforms like YouTube. Depending on your target audiences, you need to adjust the parameters like aspect ratio, video resolution, as well as duration. Besides, you can upload videos on cloud storage and share with anyone as per your requirements.</p>

<h2 id="Part-5-Editing-Tips-to-Improve-Your-Videos-2"><a href="#Part-5-Editing-Tips-to-Improve-Your-Videos-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 5 Editing Tips to Improve Your Videos"></a>Part 5 Editing Tips to Improve Your Videos</h2><p>Apart from trimming, you have to edit different other aspects so that you can make the video engaging and eye-catching. Here are some editing tips you should stick to improve your video content.</p>
<p><strong>Get The Best Video Editor</strong> - Editing a video is equally important as shooting a video. Once you have the best video editor, you can rest assured that your editing work is half done. This is because you have all the tools to turn your raw video into stunning video. You can experiment and come up with the best editing work to your own surprise.</p>
<p><strong>Get The Length Correct</strong> - In today’s world, viewers have very less time to watch videos. Therefore, a lengthy and elaborative video is a bummer. Hence, you should trim the video and keep only the portions that are relevant, engaging, and not boring.</p>
<p><strong>Start with a Bang</strong> - The first impression is always the most important, and hence, the intro of your video is extremely crucial to keep the attention of the audiences intact. To make the intro interesting, you should not only focus on the content but also on video effects and animations that are attention-grabbing.</p>
<p><strong>Smooth Cuts and Soothing Colours</strong> - When you are cutting from one scene or angle to another, the transition should be smooth so that it does not feel abrupt. Therefore, you should cut scenes when the subjects and objects seem to be static so that the transition is smooth naturally. Play attention to colour and the video editors allow you to enhance the quality by adjusting the colors and picture properties.</p>
<p><strong>Graphical Objects</strong> - Use graphical objects and animated texts wherever possible for better explanations.

Here are some editing tips you should stick to improve your video content.</p>
<p><strong>Get The Best Video Editor</strong> - Editing a video is equally important as shooting a video. Once you have the best video editor, you can rest assured that your editing work is half done. This is because you have all the tools to turn your raw video into stunning video. You can experiment and come up with the best editing work to your own surprise.</p>
<p><strong>Get The Length Correct</strong> - In today’s world, viewers have very less time to watch videos. Therefore, a lengthy and elaborative video is a bummer. Hence, you should trim the video and keep only the portions that are relevant, engaging, and not boring.</p>
<p><strong>Start with a Bang</strong> - The first impression is always the most important, and hence, the intro of your video is extremely crucial to keep the attention of the audiences intact. To make the intro interesting, you should not only focus on the content but also on video effects and animations that are attention-grabbing.</p>
<p><strong>Smooth Cuts and Soothing Colours</strong> - When you are cutting from one scene or angle to another, the transition should be smooth so that it does not feel abrupt. Therefore, you should cut scenes when the subjects and objects seem to be static so that the transition is smooth naturally. Play attention to colour and the video editors allow you to enhance the quality by adjusting the colors and picture properties.</p>
<p><strong>Graphical Objects</strong> - Use graphical objects and animated texts wherever possible for better explanations. Things can get boring visually when you do not add graphical elements, transitions, and animations appropriately in different places. Similarly, the use of texts and titles makes the video more engaging. Instead of static texts, there are animated texts and titles available with stickers and memes that you can edit your video with.</p>
<p><strong>Play Attention to Sound</strong> - Sound is the most neglected part of a video by amateur video creators when one should pay attention to it. The sound effects can keep the audiences hooked to your video and make them not get bored. Certain sound effects refresh the attention of the audiences when it starts to fade, and hence, you should place the sound effects wisely.</p>
<p><strong>Proper Flow</strong> - The editing work should be smooth so that the flow of the video is smooth and efficient. It takes time, and hence, you can practice and learn video editing so that your video can stand out instantly after your editing touches. Besides, the editing should be such that the video feels like a story that audiences can invest in and get engaged throughout.</p>
<h2 id="Part-6-How-to-Share-Your-Videos-3"><a href="#Part-6-How-to-Share-Your-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 6 How to Share Your Videos"></a>Part 6 How to Share Your Videos</h2><p>In order to share videos after trimming them, you need to save the video properly. There are different file formats available for video files. For example, MP4 is the most popular video file format among Windows users. On the contrary, MOV is the most popular video file format. Different file formats have different features such as compression and lossless. According to the file format, the file size varies for the same duration of video.</p>
<p>Therefore, the video trimmer you are using must have different file formats for saving and exporting the editing video files. Some video trimmers have in-built features to share videos on social media platforms and upload on video streaming platforms like YouTube. Depending on your target audiences, you need to adjust the parameters like aspect ratio, video resolution, as well as duration. Besides, you can upload videos on cloud storage and share with anyone as per your requirements.</p>

<p><strong>A Step-by-Step Guide to Merge FLV files on Windows&#x2F;Mac using Wondershare Filmora</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Launch Wondershare Filmora and load FLV files…</strong></p>
<p>When you run this FLV joiner, simply click <strong>“Import”</strong> to load all of the local FLV files that you want to merge to the User’s album of this FLV video merger. You can also just drag and drop the target files from your PC into the album.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="merge flv"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Merge FLV files into one…</strong></p>
<p>At the bottom of this FLV file merger, there lies a <strong>Timeline</strong>. Drag FLV files from the album to the Timeline and use the slider bar to help you arrange all FLV files in the Timeline without overlapping them. That’s very important as if you put one video to another, the original video will get split. Also, make sure that all FLV files are placed in the sequence in which they are to be played. If not, you can rearrange any video clip with a simple drag-and-drop.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Choose the target format as FLV…</strong></p>
<p>When you are sure that all FLV files are in the correct required order on the Timeline, you can view the effect in real-time in the preview pane. If everything is fine, you are now ready to export this new FLV file. All you have to do is just press the <strong>“Create”</strong></p>
<p>button, then go to the <strong>“Format” tab &gt; “FLV” output format</strong> in the output window.</p>

<p><strong>Alternative Way to Merge&#x2F;Combine FLV Files on Windows</strong></p>
<p><strong>Joyoshare Media Cutter (Paid tool to merge FLV Files)</strong></p>
<p>Joyoshare Video Joiner for Windows is a comprehensive and user-friendly audio and video merging software that supports a wide range of file formats such as FLV, F4V, HD,4K, MP4, M4V, M4A, DV, MPEG, FLAV, WMA, and others. It is not only a superb video joiner for joining FLV files in batches without re-encoding, but it is also a video editor thanks to the built-in advanced editing tool. That means you can customize and enhance your FLV files as required before integrating them. The two combing modes (high-speed mode and encoding mode) it employs are also noteworthy. With high-speed mode, you can join an unlimited number of FLV files losslessly and swiftly. You can merge files in different formats without gaps and customize the codec, resolution, bit rate, frame rate, and other parameters of your FLV files while in encoding mode.</p>
<p><strong>A Step-by-Step Guide</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Add FLV files…</strong></p>
<p>First, go to the Joyoshare website and download the Joyoshare Video Joiner installation package. Install and configure it on your computer. Then, import FLV files into the video joiner. There are two options: click <strong>“Open File”</strong> to choose them or drag them directly into the software.</p>

                      alt="merge flv"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Choose a merging mode and export format…</strong></p>
<p>You must pick a format from high-speed mode and encoding mode based on your requirements by using the <strong>“Format”</strong> button. The former is only for combining files of the same format losslessly at 60 X speed. The other is for users who want to modify files while joining files in different formats. With the use of a <strong>gear icon</strong> beside the selected output format, users can change video settings such as resolution, bit rate, codes, and so on while in encoding mode.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3: Remove undesirable parts…</strong></p>
<p>Once finished choosing mode and format, simply press <strong>“OK”</strong> to go back to the main screen. Then double-click these FLV files one by one to preview them. You can change the timeline to remove unnecessary sections from your FLV videos. Moreover, renaming and rearranging these video files can also be realized in this step.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Edit FLV files (optional)…</strong></p>

It is not only a superb video joiner for joining FLV files in batches without re-encoding, but it is also a video editor thanks to the built-in advanced editing tool. That means you can customize and enhance your FLV files as required before integrating them. The two combing modes (high-speed mode and encoding mode) it employs are also noteworthy. With high-speed mode, you can join an unlimited number of FLV files losslessly and swiftly. You can merge files in different formats without gaps and customize the codec, resolution, bit rate, frame rate, and other parameters of your FLV files while in encoding mode.</p>
<p><strong>A Step-by-Step Guide</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Add FLV files…</strong></p>
<p>First, go to the Joyoshare website and download the Joyoshare Video Joiner installation package. Install and configure it on your computer. Then, import FLV files into the video joiner.

<p><strong>Step 2: Choose a merging mode and export format…</strong></p>
<p>You must pick a format from high-speed mode and encoding mode based on your requirements by using the <strong>“Format”</strong> button. The former is only for combining files of the same format losslessly at 60 X speed. The other is for users who want to modify files while joining files in different formats. With the use of a <strong>gear icon</strong> beside the selected output format, users can change video settings such as resolution, bit rate, codes, and so on while in encoding mode.</p>

It is not only a superb video joiner for joining FLV files in batches without re-encoding, but it is also a video editor thanks to the built-in advanced editing tool. That means you can customize and enhance your FLV files as required before integrating them. The two combing modes (high-speed mode and encoding mode) it employs are also noteworthy. With high-speed mode, you can join an unlimited number of FLV files losslessly and swiftly. You can merge files in different formats without gaps and customize the codec, resolution, bit rate, frame rate, and other parameters of your FLV files while in encoding mode.</p>
<p><strong>A Step-by-Step Guide</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Add FLV files…</strong></p>
<p>First, go to the Joyoshare website and download the Joyoshare Video Joiner installation package. Install and configure it on your computer. Then, import FLV files into the video joiner.

The former is only for combining files of the same format losslessly at 60 X speed. The other is for users who want to modify files while joining files in different formats. With the use of a <strong>gear icon</strong> beside the selected output format, users can change video settings such as resolution, bit rate, codes, and so on while in encoding mode.</p>

It is not only a superb video joiner for joining FLV files in batches without re-encoding, but it is also a video editor thanks to the built-in advanced editing tool. That means you can customize and enhance your FLV files as required before integrating them. The two combing modes (high-speed mode and encoding mode) it employs are also noteworthy. With high-speed mode, you can join an unlimited number of FLV files losslessly and swiftly. You can merge files in different formats without gaps and customize the codec, resolution, bit rate, frame rate, and other parameters of your FLV files while in encoding mode.</p>
<p><strong>A Step-by-Step Guide</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Add FLV files…</strong></p>
<p>First, go to the Joyoshare website and download the Joyoshare Video Joiner installation package. Install and configure it on your computer. Then, import FLV files into the video joiner.

<p><strong>Step 2: Choose a merging mode and export format…</strong></p>
<p>You must pick a format from high-speed mode and encoding mode based on your requirements by using the <strong>“Format”</strong> button. The former is only for combining files of the same format losslessly at 60 X speed. The other is for users who want to modify files while joining files in different formats. With the use of a <strong>gear icon</strong> beside the selected output format, users can change video settings such as resolution, bit rate, codes, and so on while in encoding mode.</p>
