Obviously, it’ll be a treat for you!</p>
<p>Planning and preparing before the shoot is the key to making a music video successful. You can only achieve this after location scouting and emerging with the best one. And scheduling for big projects before the day is more important. Let’s directly move towards the things to consider before shooting!</p>
<h2 id="Location-scouting"><a href="#Location-scouting" class="headerlink" title="Location scouting"></a>Location scouting</h2><p>The pleasant and eye-catchy location always makes your music video trending or flopping. You should first go with your budget and then come up with location ideas. In the upcoming tip, we will use 3lau’s song “Tokyo” as an example.</p>

<p>If you are going with large projects, you need to consider the following requirements!</p>
<h3 id="1-Availability-of-electricity"><a href="#1-Availability-of-electricity" class="headerlink" title="1. Availability of electricity"></a>1. Availability of electricity</h3><p>You need rig lights and a large lighting setup to make your video more glow and give them aesthetic vibes. For this, make sure you choose a location where light is readily available.</p>
<h3 id="2-Separate-room"><a href="#2-Separate-room" class="headerlink" title="2. Separate room"></a>2. Separate room</h3><p>During shooting for big projects, you need room to store all gear and sensitive equipment in one place for many days.</p>

<h3 id="3-Check-the-size"><a href="#3-Check-the-size" class="headerlink" title="3. Check the size"></a>3. Check the size</h3><p>The foremost thing in choosing the location is to check the Height and Width of the studio. They should be enough to rig the lights in the studio easily and place every required thing in a decided space.</p>
<p>For Example, while shooting a 3lau song, there is a need for a bus to come into the studio easily, but there is an issue in entering the bus due to height issues of the door. Due to this, the director changed the location at the spot to sort out this issue.</p>

<h3 id="3-Do-Planning"><a href="#3-Do-Planning" class="headerlink" title="3. Do Planning"></a>3.

<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
<p>On day 1 of the Tokyo song, the filming is done in two halves; the first half day goes towards filming everything in the bus, and the other half day, there is a shoot of everything outside the bus.</p>
<p>While in day 2, there is a filming of every memory. For this, there are setups of rooms and homes for making perfect shots according to the requirements of a music video.</p>

<p>Text-to-speech (TTS) is a type of assistive technology that reads digital text aloud. It’s sometimes called “read aloud” technology. This technology has evolved to the point of being inculcated or introduced directly to some video editing applications without having to visit a separate text-to-speech application or software for support. This article therefore aims at discussing ten video makers that have inbuilt the text-to-speech feature.</p>

<h2 id="Capture-the-moment-and-Cut"><a href="#Capture-the-moment-and-Cut" class="headerlink" title="Capture the moment and Cut"></a>Capture the moment and Cut</h2><p>CapCut is a free all-in-one video editing app that helps you create amazing videos. It is a mobile app for iOS and Android devices which is easy to use in terms of creating your content. It makes your cutting, reversing and speed change easier than ever when you get it right to produce incredible results as you share on social media. You can make your video captivating by adding features such as filters, stickers, speed changes, background music, effects, split, reverse and more to make your wonderful moments more polished and professional.</p>
<p>FEATURES</p>
<p>After reviewing both versions (Android and iOS) of CapCut, we found that the app is indeed easy to use and includes a ton of attractive features designed for TikTok users. Would we recommend it to you? Yes, definitely, but with some caveats.</p>
<ul>
<li>Split function: This is similar to trimming where you have to separate the clip in order to define your desired part of the clip. Your clip can be further extended after splitting, so it’s just a process of simple trimming in editing.</li>
<li>Video overlay: This feature helps you place a video on another video. Those who do this often are those who have reaction channels, online teachers and gamers. This feature helps the viewers to simultaneously comprehend explanations the main video content alongside the reaction or explanation.</li>
<li>Speed control: This feature aids speed ramping. You can slow down your video and increase the speed just as you want. One thing to have in mind is when you plan to edit such a video, you have to shoot in a high resolution and high frame rate like 30-60fps so as to avoid the amateurish look.</li>
<li>Reverse video: The reverse feature helps you to rewind your clip to create the effect you have pictured in your mind while shooting.</li>
<li>Music library: CapCut comes with an impressive collection of royalty-free music and sound effects that can really make a huge difference to your videos. The tracks have a high quality and you can effortlessly insert them into your video to create the feel you desire.</li>
<li>Filters: Choose from various filters to soften or sharpen your videos and make them more professional-looking. There are color-based and season-based filters, as well as a range of beautification tools to enhance video quality. Filters can also be used effectively if you have multiple clips that have color variations or different contrast and brightness levels. Since you can’t edit most of these in CapCut, you can avoid having to use a desktop editor by choosing the right filters and applying them to all your clips to bring some uniformity.</li>
<li>Effects: There’s a collection of effects you can select from to appeal to the visual cravings of your audience. This will add colour to your content as it makes your viewers involved in the video. These effects include split-screen, retro, comic, party, dreamy, and so on. These effects will make your video look fresh and professionally edited.</li>
<li>Stickers and text: Stickers could be fun to use due to their expressive nature. Your choice as a content creator will go a long way in determining the fascination of your content. CapCut has therefore had you covered when it comes to adding fun features to your content to make it more interactive and exciting. Stickers and texts are therefore engaging tools you can employ to drive the fantasy of your audience. Also, it creates room for more details to be added without necessarily having to introduce more audio contents especially. With this feature, you can literally do more with less using CapCut.</li>

It is a mobile app for iOS and Android devices which is easy to use in terms of creating your content. It makes your cutting, reversing and speed change easier than ever when you get it right to produce incredible results as you share on social media. You can make your video captivating by adding features such as filters, stickers, speed changes, background music, effects, split, reverse and more to make your wonderful moments more polished and professional.</p>
<p>FEATURES</p>
<p>After reviewing both versions (Android and iOS) of CapCut, we found that the app is indeed easy to use and includes a ton of attractive features designed for TikTok users. Would we recommend it to you? Yes, definitely, but with some caveats.</p>
<ul>
<li>Split function: This is similar to trimming where you have to separate the clip in order to define your desired part of the clip. Your clip can be further extended after splitting, so it’s just a process of simple trimming in editing.</li>
<li>Video overlay: This feature helps you place a video on another video. Those who do this often are those who have reaction channels, online teachers and gamers. This feature helps the viewers to simultaneously comprehend explanations the main video content alongside the reaction or explanation.</li>
<li>Speed control: This feature aids speed ramping. You can slow down your video and increase the speed just as you want. One thing to have in mind is when you plan to edit such a video, you have to shoot in a high resolution and high frame rate like 30-60fps so as to avoid the amateurish look.</li>
<li>Reverse video: The reverse feature helps you to rewind your clip to create the effect you have pictured in your mind while shooting.</li>
<li>Music library: CapCut comes with an impressive collection of royalty-free music and sound effects that can really make a huge difference to your videos. The tracks have a high quality and you can effortlessly insert them into your video to create the feel you desire.</li>
<li>Filters: Choose from various filters to soften or sharpen your videos and make them more professional-looking. There are color-based and season-based filters, as well as a range of beautification tools to enhance video quality. Filters can also be used effectively if you have multiple clips that have color variations or different contrast and brightness levels. Since you can’t edit most of these in CapCut, you can avoid having to use a desktop editor by choosing the right filters and applying them to all your clips to bring some uniformity.</li>
<li>Effects: There’s a collection of effects you can select from to appeal to the visual cravings of your audience. This will add colour to your content as it makes your viewers involved in the video. These effects include split-screen, retro, comic, party, dreamy, and so on. These effects will make your video look fresh and professionally edited.</li>
<li>Stickers and text: Stickers could be fun to use due to their expressive nature. Your choice as a content creator will go a long way in determining the fascination of your content. CapCut has therefore had you covered when it comes to adding fun features to your content to make it more interactive and exciting. Stickers and texts are therefore engaging tools you can employ to drive the fantasy of your audience. Also, it creates room for more details to be added without necessarily having to introduce more audio contents especially. With this feature, you can literally do more with less using CapCut.</li>

<p>Text-to-speech (TTS) is a type of assistive technology that reads digital text aloud. It’s sometimes called “read aloud” technology. This technology has evolved to the point of being inculcated or introduced directly to some video editing applications without having to visit a separate text-to-speech application or software for support. This article therefore aims at discussing ten video makers that have inbuilt the text-to-speech feature.</p>

It is a mobile app for iOS and Android devices which is easy to use in terms of creating your content. It makes your cutting, reversing and speed change easier than ever when you get it right to produce incredible results as you share on social media. You can make your video captivating by adding features such as filters, stickers, speed changes, background music, effects, split, reverse and more to make your wonderful moments more polished and professional.</p>
<p>FEATURES</p>
<p>After reviewing both versions (Android and iOS) of CapCut, we found that the app is indeed easy to use and includes a ton of attractive features designed for TikTok users. Would we recommend it to you? Yes, definitely, but with some caveats.</p>
<ul>
<li>Split function: This is similar to trimming where you have to separate the clip in order to define your desired part of the clip. Your clip can be further extended after splitting, so it’s just a process of simple trimming in editing.</li>
<li>Video overlay: This feature helps you place a video on another video. Those who do this often are those who have reaction channels, online teachers and gamers. This feature helps the viewers to simultaneously comprehend explanations the main video content alongside the reaction or explanation.</li>
<li>Speed control: This feature aids speed ramping. You can slow down your video and increase the speed just as you want. One thing to have in mind is when you plan to edit such a video, you have to shoot in a high resolution and high frame rate like 30-60fps so as to avoid the amateurish look.</li>
<li>Reverse video: The reverse feature helps you to rewind your clip to create the effect you have pictured in your mind while shooting.</li>
<li>Music library: CapCut comes with an impressive collection of royalty-free music and sound effects that can really make a huge difference to your videos. The tracks have a high quality and you can effortlessly insert them into your video to create the feel you desire.</li>
<li>Filters: Choose from various filters to soften or sharpen your videos and make them more professional-looking. There are color-based and season-based filters, as well as a range of beautification tools to enhance video quality. Filters can also be used effectively if you have multiple clips that have color variations or different contrast and brightness levels. Since you can’t edit most of these in CapCut, you can avoid having to use a desktop editor by choosing the right filters and applying them to all your clips to bring some uniformity.</li>
<li>Effects: There’s a collection of effects you can select from to appeal to the visual cravings of your audience. This will add colour to your content as it makes your viewers involved in the video. These effects include split-screen, retro, comic, party, dreamy, and so on. These effects will make your video look fresh and professionally edited.</li>
<li>Stickers and text: Stickers could be fun to use due to their expressive nature. Your choice as a content creator will go a long way in determining the fascination of your content. CapCut has therefore had you covered when it comes to adding fun features to your content to make it more interactive and exciting. Stickers and texts are therefore engaging tools you can employ to drive the fantasy of your audience. Also, it creates room for more details to be added without necessarily having to introduce more audio contents especially. With this feature, you can literally do more with less using CapCut.</li>

<p>FEATURES</p>
<p>After reviewing both versions (Android and iOS) of CapCut, we found that the app is indeed easy to use and includes a ton of attractive features designed for TikTok users. Would we recommend it to you? Yes, definitely, but with some caveats.</p>
<ul>
<li>Split function: This is similar to trimming where you have to separate the clip in order to define your desired part of the clip. Your clip can be further extended after splitting, so it’s just a process of simple trimming in editing.</li>
<li>Video overlay: This feature helps you place a video on another video. Those who do this often are those who have reaction channels, online teachers and gamers. This feature helps the viewers to simultaneously comprehend explanations the main video content alongside the reaction or explanation.</li>
<li>Speed control: This feature aids speed ramping. You can slow down your video and increase the speed just as you want. One thing to have in mind is when you plan to edit such a video, you have to shoot in a high resolution and high frame rate like 30-60fps so as to avoid the amateurish look.</li>
<li>Reverse video: The reverse feature helps you to rewind your clip to create the effect you have pictured in your mind while shooting.</li>
<li>Music library: CapCut comes with an impressive collection of royalty-free music and sound effects that can really make a huge difference to your videos. The tracks have a high quality and you can effortlessly insert them into your video to create the feel you desire.</li>
<li>Filters: Choose from various filters to soften or sharpen your videos and make them more professional-looking. There are color-based and season-based filters, as well as a range of beautification tools to enhance video quality. Filters can also be used effectively if you have multiple clips that have color variations or different contrast and brightness levels. Since you can’t edit most of these in CapCut, you can avoid having to use a desktop editor by choosing the right filters and applying them to all your clips to bring some uniformity.</li>
<li>Effects: There’s a collection of effects you can select from to appeal to the visual cravings of your audience. This will add colour to your content as it makes your viewers involved in the video. These effects include split-screen, retro, comic, party, dreamy, and so on. These effects will make your video look fresh and professionally edited.</li>
<li>Stickers and text: Stickers could be fun to use due to their expressive nature. Your choice as a content creator will go a long way in determining the fascination of your content. CapCut has therefore had you covered when it comes to adding fun features to your content to make it more interactive and exciting. Stickers and texts are therefore engaging tools you can employ to drive the fantasy of your audience. Also, it creates room for more details to be added without necessarily having to introduce more audio contents especially. With this feature, you can literally do more with less using CapCut.</li>
