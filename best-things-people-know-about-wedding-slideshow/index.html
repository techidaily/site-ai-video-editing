It made what was initially created for gamers to become something much more. It gives people a communication platform when social interaction through online mediums was not so popular.</p>
<p>First founded in 2015, Discord came intending to be a gamer’s platform to chat and build one another communities. More so, it has become a platform that is more than that and encompasses audiences or communities of different interests and not only gamers.</p>
<p>Discord is now a platform for messaging and allows users to communicate using different channels. This platform can be a less formal version of Slack. Users can write text and send video and voice messages and other forms of rich media such as photos and videos through the platform.</p>
<p>There are a lot of exceptional Discord servers that function as a place to speak about a lot of different things and interact using <strong>Gif discord emoji.</strong> This is like Reddit, where communities get built via forums that create a network experience through shared interests or hobbies. Due to this, it has become easy to discover a niche on Discord as there are a lot of distinct servers that accommodate an extensive range of interests.</p>
<p>Each server is composed of multiple channels, and every channel has its subjects, individual rule set, and interests. Thus, every channel can be valuable to talk about different things:</p>
<p>● You can talk about gaming</p>
<p>● The other can be useful to talk about sports activities, etc.</p>
<p>The possibilities are endless, and the most crucial part is that it is free to create these servers.</p>
<p>The most effective way to discover servers is by simply Googling them because the search feature on the platform only shows the most popular ones.</p>
<p>Discord is a somewhat flexible platform as it works on both desktop and mobile applications. You will connect your YouTube and Spotify accounts to add to your experience.</p>
<p>On top of its versatility, Discord is also very customizable based on a person’s interests and how someone desires to use the platform. Users can have servers that can be either private or public. There is also a position of an administrator, in which they can assign roles to each person, which comes with special privileges and name tags. These roles may benefit various large groups and provide a moderation sense in the server.</p>
<p>Not only does Discord offer group chats, but it also offers a non-public chatting feature which is also available. This allows users to talk one-on-one with other users and turn out to be friends with one another.</p>

A perfect example is writing a chat about something very empowering. When you choose to correspond this type of content through text, it could take a little more effort and a bit of intricately used language to build up the reader and get the desired effect of empowering the reader. Emojis are very accurate in passing out the meaning and are shorter than words. That is the primary reason why all-in-all emojis can save effort and time to create your Discord chat.</p>

It made what was initially created for gamers to become something much more. It gives people a communication platform when social interaction through online mediums was not so popular.</p>
<p>First founded in 2015, Discord came intending to be a gamer’s platform to chat and build one another communities. More so, it has become a platform that is more than that and encompasses audiences or communities of different interests and not only gamers.</p>
<p>Discord is now a platform for messaging and allows users to communicate using different channels. This platform can be a less formal version of Slack. Users can write text and send video and voice messages and other forms of rich media such as photos and videos through the platform.</p>
<p>There are a lot of exceptional Discord servers that function as a place to speak about a lot of different things and interact using <strong>Gif discord emoji.</strong> This is like Reddit, where communities get built via forums that create a network experience through shared interests or hobbies. Due to this, it has become easy to discover a niche on Discord as there are a lot of distinct servers that accommodate an extensive range of interests.</p>
<p>Each server is composed of multiple channels, and every channel has its subjects, individual rule set, and interests. Thus, every channel can be valuable to talk about different things:</p>
<p>● You can talk about gaming</p>
<p>● The other can be useful to talk about sports activities, etc.</p>
<p>The possibilities are endless, and the most crucial part is that it is free to create these servers.</p>
<p>The most effective way to discover servers is by simply Googling them because the search feature on the platform only shows the most popular ones.</p>
<p>Discord is a somewhat flexible platform as it works on both desktop and mobile applications. You will connect your YouTube and Spotify accounts to add to your experience.</p>
<p>On top of its versatility, Discord is also very customizable based on a person’s interests and how someone desires to use the platform. Users can have servers that can be either private or public. There is also a position of an administrator, in which they can assign roles to each person, which comes with special privileges and name tags. These roles may benefit various large groups and provide a moderation sense in the server.</p>
<p>Not only does Discord offer group chats, but it also offers a non-public chatting feature which is also available. This allows users to talk one-on-one with other users and turn out to be friends with one another.</p>

They can also be helpful to add the much-needed buzz that cannot be through word or text.</p>

<li>Wondershare Filmora is an easy-to-use video merger.</li>
</ol>
<p>Before I detail online video joiners, I’d like to mention Wondershare Filmora, which can automatically merge video files without or with transitions. It merges video files with the same or various file extensions in 1:1 quality (.mp4, .mov, .mkv, .avi, etc). Continue reading to learn more about this simple video merging and how to merge videos.</p>
<p>Part 2: Using Filmora to combine, merge, and join clips</p>
<p>To join videos, first, import them.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/combine-video-instagram-2.jpg"
                      alt="combine-video-instagram-"
                ></p>
<p>You can drag the files from Windows File Explorer to the User’s Album or click the “Import” button on the window and choose files from your computer. All imported files will appear in thumbnail format in the User’s Album. To preview a file in the right-hand preview window, double-click it.</p>
<ol>
<li>To merge video files, drag &amp; drop them.</li>
</ol>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/combine-video-instagram-3.jpg"
                      alt="combine-video-instagram-"
                ></p>
<p>Move videos from the User’s Album to the video track on the Timeline after that. All video files will be combined into a single video with no transition. However, you can use the following method to add transitions between video clips.</p>
<ol>
<li>Add transitions in the third step (optional)</li>
</ol>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="combine-video-instagram-"
                ></p>
<p>Add transitions between clips for a smooth transition from one to the next to make the linked videos look like a complete movie. Go to the Transition tab and drag the desired change to the intersection of two clips. You can also right-click any transition to bring up a menu with choices such as “Apply to All” and “Random to All” for your convenience.</p>
<p>Step 4: Combine video files into a single file.</p>
