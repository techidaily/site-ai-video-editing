While that is an entirely unscientific assessment that you should not cite in a college paper, given the accessibility and sophistication of today’s green screen technology, it is probably not far off. Everyone has access to expert compositing technology, from Marvel movies to local news stations.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT ARE GREEN SCREEN AND CHROMA KEYING?</strong></p>
<p>The colored background you want to make transparent and remove from your shot is referred to as a green screen. This is typically a single-colored backdrop, which can be any color but is usually bright green because it is the color most dissimilar to human skin tones. (Blue screens were commonly used in the early days of film, and they may still be used in some cases.)</p>
<p>The chroma key is a time-honored and widely used visual effects technique. Simply stated, chroma key is the process of photographing a subject against a solid-color background and then removing that background in post-production and replacing it with transparency. The subject can then be positioned in front of any new background.</p>

<p>When you record a video against a green screen, you can make the background transparent and replace it with other video clips, graphics, or still images of your choice. It’s easy to overlay any footage with iMovie’s green screen effect. For example, you can transport yourself anywhere or appear in your favorite films.</p>
<p>The green Screen effect, also referred as the Chroma Key effect, is a simple way to combine two clips into one with impressive scenes. You can, for example, fly over a very high mountain. Green Screen is a background that is only one color, usually green. This could be another pure color, such as Blue or Pink. By dragging and dropping, you can apply a green screen video to another in iMovie. It’s incredibly simple to create stunning videos using the iMovie Green Screen effect.</p>

<p>Davinci Resolve has two versions including a full studio version which is available for $299. Because some professional tools, such as team collaboration and video noise reduction, cannot be used without a full license, the free program has a surprising number of features. The majority of the features included in the free version are adequate for professionals and hobbyists.</p>
<p>Although the Davinci Resolve program is regarded as a professional grade editor, it does include some advanced tools such as exporting, audio mastering, color correction, and more. The program is also useful for arranging audio and video clips, and it has a large selection of effects and filters. The additional color correction and adjustments available here can also aid in HDR support and produce more professional results when working with camera RAW data.</p>
<p>Davinci Resolve is also well-known for having one of the best color grading programs available. The outcome can be hugely potent when using the accessible chromakey tools. It doesn’t take much to figure out how to use this effect with the quick tutorial on board.</p>

<p><strong>Steps On How To Remove the Green Screen in DaVinci Resolve Inside the Color Tab</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1 – Add the Qualifier Tool &amp; select the color</strong></p>
<p>After you finish cutting the video, jump inside the “<strong>Color</strong>” tab and select the Qualifier Tool. Make sure you set the tool in “<strong>3D</strong>” mode to enable us to select a bigger range of the green spectrum.</p>
<p>Do this by simply selecting the fourth dot from the middle-upper area of the window or by selecting it from the drop-down mode selector situated in the window’s top-right corner.</p>
<p>After selecting the 3D mode for the Qualifier Tool, go ahead and select the range of green colors you want to remove by simply drawing lines on top of the screen, similar to the way I did in the image below.</p>

<h4 id="Step-2-–-Removing-the-color"><a href="#Step-2-–-Removing-the-color" class="headerlink" title="Step 2 – Removing the color"></a><strong>Step 2 – Removing the color</strong></h4><p>As you can see in the small rectangle, Resolve did the keying, but it doesn’t know what to do with it because we didn’t specify. Right-click underneath the node, select “Add Alpha Output” and then link the node.</p>
<p>Yes, I know it will key out the subject and not the green screen. There is no problem. Go ahead and select the Revert button situated in the “Selection Range” window. Everything should be OK now.</p>

<h4 id="Step-3-–-Clean-the-edges"><a href="#Step-3-–-Clean-the-edges" class="headerlink" title="Step 3 – Clean the edges"></a><strong>Step 3 – Clean the edges</strong></h4><p>As you can surely notice, there are still some issues we have to address. In the hair area and on the outline of the subject, there is a noticeable green color spill. We don’t want that! On top of this, there will be many situations where you will still notice some noisy green pixels in the transparent area, around the corners of the screen, or the subject.</p>
<p>To get rid of these problems, we have to jump into the Qualifier window. Here, there are many settings you can play with to tweak the output. Most of the time, you will solve these problems by checking “Despill”, further selecting more of the greens and adding them to the Selection Range, or modifying the shrink, ”Black Clip” and “White Clip”.</p>

<p><strong>Steps On How To Chroma Key In Lightworks</strong></p>
<h2 id="1-Record-your-video"><a href="#1-Record-your-video" class="headerlink" title="1. Record your video"></a><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Record your video</strong></h2><p>First, you need a green or blue background to shoot against. As we’ll explain later, it doesn’t have to be a very specific shade, but it needs to be substantially different from the subject you’re shooting. You might have seen occasions when a weather presenter’s tie has appeared transparent during a broadcast. This is because the material was too close in color to the backdrop, or the key wasn’t quite set accurately enough.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-37.jpg"
                      alt="green-screen-software"
                ></p>
<p>You can make your backdrop using a sheet, or a large sheet of paper or card. If you’re planning to make videos frequently, there are inexpensive chromakey backdrops available that include a frame to hang the cloth from. If space is limited, collapsible screens are also available starting at around US$40. These screens are also handy for photography.</p>
<p>Good lighting is essential. You need to make sure that the screen is evenly lit so the color is consistent. It’s also important to ensure your subject is far enough from the screen to avoid shadows and color spills (when the blue or green backdrop reflects off your subject).</p>
<h2 id="2-Import-and-trim"><a href="#2-Import-and-trim" class="headerlink" title="2. Import and trim"></a><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Import and trim</strong></h2><p>Once you’ve shot your video, download and install <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/lightworks" >Lightworks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It’s free for personal use, but you’ll need to register for a free account if you want to use it for longer than 30 days.</p>
<p>Click the button marked Create a New Project, give it a name, and select a frame rate (you can find this by right-clicking your recorded video and selecting the Details tab). Here we’re using a still image as a background, but you can also use another video. Import this the same way.</p>
<p>Click the Edit tab and drag your video from the Project Contents panel onto the V1 track of the timeline below. If there’s unwanted footage at the beginning or end of your clip, right-click it and select Trim In or Trim Out, then use the yellow handles to change where the clip starts and finishes.</p>
<p>Right-click the preview window marked Sequence #1 and select Tracks &gt; Add Video. Drag your video clip into the V1 track and your still image into V2. Click and drag the right-hand side of the image in the V2 track until it’s the same length as the video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<h2 id="3-Set-the-key"><a href="#3-Set-the-key" class="headerlink" title="3. Set the key"></a><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Set the key</strong></h2><p>Now click the VFX tab, select the V1 track in the timeline and click the tab marked with a plus icon. Click the Favorites drop-down menu and select Key, followed by Green Screen. Click Add Effect and you’ll see a new panel of settings under the color correction wheels.</p>
<p>Use the eyedropper tool on the left to select the background you want to remove. This will typically do quite a good job by itself, but it will need a little fine-tuning. Try sliding the Saturation and Luminance sliders and adjusting their steepness using the handles that appear when you move your mouse over them. You’ll notice that each adjustment you make has a knock-on effect on the changes you’ve made with the other sliders; it’s a matter of balancing all three to achieve the best effect, preserving detail while minimizing spill.</p>
<p>To see how the filter is working, click the ‘Reveal’ box. The white areas are the parts of the video that will be removed, and the black areas are the parts that will remain.</p>
<p>The Remove Spill slider will add a purple tint to neutralize green tones in areas that need it.</p>

<h2 id="4-Tweak-and-export"><a href="#4-Tweak-and-export" class="headerlink" title="4. Tweak and export"></a><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Tweak and export</strong></h2><p>Once you’re happy, you can use Lightworks’ other VFX tools to make other changes like color correction and cropping. When you’re done, return to the Edit tab, right-click the preview window at the top right and select Export.</p>
<p>The only two export options you’ll see in the free version of Lightworks are Vimeo and YouTube, but this is a little misleading. These will save the video to your PC or Mac in an MP4 format, but they won’t do the uploading for you unless you check the appropriate box.</p>
<p>Select a destination folder and name for your video file and click ‘Start’. The processing will begin, and you’ll see a progress bar at the top right. This task will run in the background so you can continue working on your project, and you’ll be notified when it’s complete.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>WHICH SHOULD I CHOOSE: FREE OR PAID GREEN SCREEN SOFTWARE?</strong></p>
<p>If you want something quick, cheap, and easy, and having your footage seems to be fairly clean with few shadows or spills, there are several cheap or free apps into which you can import a clip, apply a chroma key, and export without much editing or advanced features.</p>
<p>If your footage calls for attention, extra equipment can be required. If your clip has inconsistent lighting fixtures or poor quality, you may require equipment that permits you to observe a couple of chroma keys to suit the numerous shades of green or color correction equipment to restore your pictures. For even advanced functions, you’ll want to spend a little time and money learning, however the end result will most possibly be worthwhile. More advanced chroma key equipment are normally used inside full-featured NLEs through integrated equipment or expert plug-ins that encompass extra beneficial functions including advanced color correction, noise reduction, HDR (High Dynamic Range) color support, movement and keyframing, extra file layout and high-resolution support, and multi-camera editing.</p>
<p><strong>FAQS ABOUT EDITING GREEN SCREEN</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What is the most important thing when using a green screen?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When lighting your green screen, ensure there is even, soft light on the entirety of the green screen. This is crucial for a proper key. Many filmmakers overlook this essential part and focus on lighting the subject. However, be sure to use whatever lights you have to expose the green screen background evenly.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Why do filmmakers use green screens?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A green screen basically lets you drop in whatever background images you want behind the actors and&#x2F;or foreground. It’s used in film production (and also in news and weather reports) to relatively simply place the desired background behind the subject&#x2F;actor&#x2F;presenter.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Why is a green screen not a different color?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The really short answer is that green screens are green because people are not green. For the effect to work, the background must use a color that isn’t used elsewhere in the shot – and green is nothing like human skin tone.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Green screen video production is not difficult. Anyone, with the right tools can create green screen effects like a pro. Simply follow the precautions listed above and choose the software that best suits your needs.</p>
<p>Whether you’re making a professional film or a simple family video, I’m confident you’ll find something suitable among the options listed above.</p>

<p>When you record a video against a green screen, you can make the background transparent and replace it with other video clips, graphics, or still images of your choice. It’s easy to overlay any footage with iMovie’s green screen effect. For example, you can transport yourself anywhere or appear in your favorite films.</p>
<p>The green Screen effect, also referred as the Chroma Key effect, is a simple way to combine two clips into one with impressive scenes. You can, for example, fly over a very high mountain. Green Screen is a background that is only one color, usually green. This could be another pure color, such as Blue or Pink. By dragging and dropping, you can apply a green screen video to another in iMovie. It’s incredibly simple to create stunning videos using the iMovie Green Screen effect.</p>

<p>Davinci Resolve has two versions including a full studio version which is available for $299. Because some professional tools, such as team collaboration and video noise reduction, cannot be used without a full license, the free program has a surprising number of features. The majority of the features included in the free version are adequate for professionals and hobbyists.</p>
<p>Although the Davinci Resolve program is regarded as a professional grade editor, it does include some advanced tools such as exporting, audio mastering, color correction, and more. The program is also useful for arranging audio and video clips, and it has a large selection of effects and filters. The additional color correction and adjustments available here can also aid in HDR support and produce more professional results when working with camera RAW data.</p>
<p>Davinci Resolve is also well-known for having one of the best color grading programs available. The outcome can be hugely potent when using the accessible chromakey tools. It doesn’t take much to figure out how to use this effect with the quick tutorial on board.</p>

<p><strong>Steps On How To Remove the Green Screen in DaVinci Resolve Inside the Color Tab</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1 – Add the Qualifier Tool &amp; select the color</strong></p>
<p>After you finish cutting the video, jump inside the “<strong>Color</strong>” tab and select the Qualifier Tool. Make sure you set the tool in “<strong>3D</strong>” mode to enable us to select a bigger range of the green spectrum.</p>
<p>Do this by simply selecting the fourth dot from the middle-upper area of the window or by selecting it from the drop-down mode selector situated in the window’s top-right corner.</p>
<p>After selecting the 3D mode for the Qualifier Tool, go ahead and select the range of green colors you want to remove by simply drawing lines on top of the screen, similar to the way I did in the image below.</p>

Right-click underneath the node, select “Add Alpha Output” and then link the node.</p>
<p>Yes, I know it will key out the subject and not the green screen. There is no problem. Go ahead and select the Revert button situated in the “Selection Range” window. Everything should be OK now.</p>

<h4 id="Step-3-–-Clean-the-edges-1"><a href="#Step-3-–-Clean-the-edges-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 3 – Clean the edges"></a><strong>Step 3 – Clean the edges</strong></h4><p>As you can surely notice, there are still some issues we have to address. In the hair area and on the outline of the subject, there is a noticeable green color spill. We don’t want that! On top of this, there will be many situations where you will still notice some noisy green pixels in the transparent area, around the corners of the screen, or the subject.</p>
<p>To get rid of these problems, we have to jump into the Qualifier window. Here, there are many settings you can play with to tweak the output. Most of the time, you will solve these problems by checking “Despill”, further selecting more of the greens and adding them to the Selection Range, or modifying the shrink, ”Black Clip” and “White Clip”.</p>

<p><strong>Steps On How To Chroma Key In Lightworks</strong></p>
<h2 id="1-Record-your-video-1"><a href="#1-Record-your-video-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Record your video"></a><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Record your video</strong></h2><p>First, you need a green or blue background to shoot against. As we’ll explain later, it doesn’t have to be a very specific shade, but it needs to be substantially different from the subject you’re shooting. You might have seen occasions when a weather presenter’s tie has appeared transparent during a broadcast. This is because the material was too close in color to the backdrop, or the key wasn’t quite set accurately enough.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-37.jpg"
                      alt="green-screen-software"
                ></p>
<p>You can make your backdrop using a sheet, or a large sheet of paper or card. If you’re planning to make videos frequently, there are inexpensive chromakey backdrops available that include a frame to hang the cloth from. If space is limited, collapsible screens are also available starting at around US$40. These screens are also handy for photography.</p>
<p>Good lighting is essential. You need to make sure that the screen is evenly lit so the color is consistent. It’s also important to ensure your subject is far enough from the screen to avoid shadows and color spills (when the blue or green backdrop reflects off your subject).</p>
<h2 id="2-Import-and-trim-1"><a href="#2-Import-and-trim-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Import and trim"></a><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Import and trim</strong></h2><p>Once you’ve shot your video, download and install <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/lightworks" >Lightworks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It’s free for personal use, but you’ll need to register for a free account if you want to use it for longer than 30 days.</p>
<p>Click the button marked Create a New Project, give it a name, and select a frame rate (you can find this by right-clicking your recorded video and selecting the Details tab). Here we’re using a still image as a background, but you can also use another video. Import this the same way.</p>
<p>Click the Edit tab and drag your video from the Project Contents panel onto the V1 track of the timeline below. If there’s unwanted footage at the beginning or end of your clip, right-click it and select Trim In or Trim Out, then use the yellow handles to change where the clip starts and finishes.</p>
<p>Right-click the preview window marked Sequence #1 and select Tracks &gt; Add Video. Drag your video clip into the V1 track and your still image into V2. Click and drag the right-hand side of the image in the V2 track until it’s the same length as the video.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<h2 id="3-Set-the-key-1"><a href="#3-Set-the-key-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Set the key"></a><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Set the key</strong></h2><p>Now click the VFX tab, select the V1 track in the timeline and click the tab marked with a plus icon. Click the Favorites drop-down menu and select Key, followed by Green Screen. Click Add Effect and you’ll see a new panel of settings under the color correction wheels.</p>
<p>Use the eyedropper tool on the left to select the background you want to remove. This will typically do quite a good job by itself, but it will need a little fine-tuning. Try sliding the Saturation and Luminance sliders and adjusting their steepness using the handles that appear when you move your mouse over them. You’ll notice that each adjustment you make has a knock-on effect on the changes you’ve made with the other sliders; it’s a matter of balancing all three to achieve the best effect, preserving detail while minimizing spill.</p>
<p>To see how the filter is working, click the ‘Reveal’ box. The white areas are the parts of the video that will be removed, and the black areas are the parts that will remain.</p>
<p>The Remove Spill slider will add a purple tint to neutralize green tones in areas that need it.</p>

<h2 id="4-Tweak-and-export-1"><a href="#4-Tweak-and-export-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Tweak and export"></a><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Tweak and export</strong></h2><p>Once you’re happy, you can use Lightworks’ other VFX tools to make other changes like color correction and cropping. When you’re done, return to the Edit tab, right-click the preview window at the top right and select Export.</p>
<p>The only two export options you’ll see in the free version of Lightworks are Vimeo and YouTube, but this is a little misleading. These will save the video to your PC or Mac in an MP4 format, but they won’t do the uploading for you unless you check the appropriate box.</p>
<p>Select a destination folder and name for your video file and click ‘Start’. The processing will begin, and you’ll see a progress bar at the top right. This task will run in the background so you can continue working on your project, and you’ll be notified when it’s complete.</p>

<p><strong>WHICH SHOULD I CHOOSE: FREE OR PAID GREEN SCREEN SOFTWARE?</strong></p>
<p>If you want something quick, cheap, and easy, and having your footage seems to be fairly clean with few shadows or spills, there are several cheap or free apps into which you can import a clip, apply a chroma key, and export without much editing or advanced features.</p>
<p>If your footage calls for attention, extra equipment can be required. If your clip has inconsistent lighting fixtures or poor quality, you may require equipment that permits you to observe a couple of chroma keys to suit the numerous shades of green or color correction equipment to restore your pictures. For even advanced functions, you’ll want to spend a little time and money learning, however the end result will most possibly be worthwhile. More advanced chroma key equipment are normally used inside full-featured NLEs through integrated equipment or expert plug-ins that encompass extra beneficial functions including advanced color correction, noise reduction, HDR (High Dynamic Range) color support, movement and keyframing, extra file layout and high-resolution support, and multi-camera editing.</p>
<p><strong>FAQS ABOUT EDITING GREEN SCREEN</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What is the most important thing when using a green screen?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When lighting your green screen, ensure there is even, soft light on the entirety of the green screen. This is crucial for a proper key. Many filmmakers overlook this essential part and focus on lighting the subject. However, be sure to use whatever lights you have to expose the green screen background evenly.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Why do filmmakers use green screens?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A green screen basically lets you drop in whatever background images you want behind the actors and&#x2F;or foreground. It’s used in film production (and also in news and weather reports) to relatively simply place the desired background behind the subject&#x2F;actor&#x2F;presenter.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Why is a green screen not a different color?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The really short answer is that green screens are green because people are not green. For the effect to work, the background must use a color that isn’t used elsewhere in the shot – and green is nothing like human skin tone.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Green screen video production is not difficult. Anyone, with the right tools can create green screen effects like a pro. Simply follow the precautions listed above and choose the software that best suits your needs.</p>
<p>Whether you’re making a professional film or a simple family video, I’m confident you’ll find something suitable among the options listed above.</p>

<p>When you record a video against a green screen, you can make the background transparent and replace it with other video clips, graphics, or still images of your choice. It’s easy to overlay any footage with iMovie’s green screen effect. For example, you can transport yourself anywhere or appear in your favorite films.</p>
<p>The green Screen effect, also referred as the Chroma Key effect, is a simple way to combine two clips into one with impressive scenes. You can, for example, fly over a very high mountain. Green Screen is a background that is only one color, usually green. This could be another pure color, such as Blue or Pink. By dragging and dropping, you can apply a green screen video to another in iMovie. It’s incredibly simple to create stunning videos using the iMovie Green Screen effect.</p>

<p>Davinci Resolve has two versions including a full studio version which is available for $299. Because some professional tools, such as team collaboration and video noise reduction, cannot be used without a full license, the free program has a surprising number of features. The majority of the features included in the free version are adequate for professionals and hobbyists.</p>
<p>Although the Davinci Resolve program is regarded as a professional grade editor, it does include some advanced tools such as exporting, audio mastering, color correction, and more. The program is also useful for arranging audio and video clips, and it has a large selection of effects and filters. The additional color correction and adjustments available here can also aid in HDR support and produce more professional results when working with camera RAW data.</p>
<p>Davinci Resolve is also well-known for having one of the best color grading programs available. The outcome can be hugely potent when using the accessible chromakey tools. It doesn’t take much to figure out how to use this effect with the quick tutorial on board.</p>

<p><strong>Steps On How To Remove the Green Screen in DaVinci Resolve Inside the Color Tab</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1 – Add the Qualifier Tool &amp; select the color</strong></p>
<p>After you finish cutting the video, jump inside the “<strong>Color</strong>” tab and select the Qualifier Tool. Make sure you set the tool in “<strong>3D</strong>” mode to enable us to select a bigger range of the green spectrum.</p>
<p>Do this by simply selecting the fourth dot from the middle-upper area of the window or by selecting it from the drop-down mode selector situated in the window’s top-right corner.</p>
<p>After selecting the 3D mode for the Qualifier Tool, go ahead and select the range of green colors you want to remove by simply drawing lines on top of the screen, similar to the way I did in the image below.</p>

Right-click underneath the node, select “Add Alpha Output” and then link the node.</p>
<p>Yes, I know it will key out the subject and not the green screen. There is no problem. Go ahead and select the Revert button situated in the “Selection Range” window. Everything should be OK now.</p>

In the hair area and on the outline of the subject, there is a noticeable green color spill. We don’t want that! On top of this, there will be many situations where you will still notice some noisy green pixels in the transparent area, around the corners of the screen, or the subject.</p>
<p>To get rid of these problems, we have to jump into the Qualifier window. Here, there are many settings you can play with to tweak the output. Most of the time, you will solve these problems by checking “Despill”, further selecting more of the greens and adding them to the Selection Range, or modifying the shrink, ”Black Clip” and “White Clip”.</p>

<p><strong>Steps On How To Chroma Key In Lightworks</strong></p>
<h2 id="1-Record-your-video-2"><a href="#1-Record-your-video-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Record your video"></a><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Record your video</strong></h2><p>First, you need a green or blue background to shoot against. As we’ll explain later, it doesn’t have to be a very specific shade, but it needs to be substantially different from the subject you’re shooting. You might have seen occasions when a weather presenter’s tie has appeared transparent during a broadcast. This is because the material was too close in color to the backdrop, or the key wasn’t quite set accurately enough.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/green-screen-software-37.jpg"
                      alt="green-screen-software"
                ></p>
<p>You can make your backdrop using a sheet, or a large sheet of paper or card. If you’re planning to make videos frequently, there are inexpensive chromakey backdrops available that include a frame to hang the cloth from. If space is limited, collapsible screens are also available starting at around US$40. These screens are also handy for photography.</p>
<p>Good lighting is essential. You need to make sure that the screen is evenly lit so the color is consistent. It’s also important to ensure your subject is far enough from the screen to avoid shadows and color spills (when the blue or green backdrop reflects off your subject).</p>
<h2 id="2-Import-and-trim-2"><a href="#2-Import-and-trim-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Import and trim"></a><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Import and trim</strong></h2><p>Once you’ve shot your video, download and install <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/lightworks" >Lightworks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It’s free for personal use, but you’ll need to register for a free account if you want to use it for longer than 30 days.</p>
<p>Click the button marked Create a New Project, give it a name, and select a frame rate (you can find this by right-clicking your recorded video and selecting the Details tab). Here we’re using a still image as a background, but you can also use another video. Import this the same way.</p>
<p>Click the Edit tab and drag your video from the Project Contents panel onto the V1 track of the timeline below. If there’s unwanted footage at the beginning or end of your clip, right-click it and select Trim In or Trim Out, then use the yellow handles to change where the clip starts and finishes.</p>
<p>Right-click the preview window marked Sequence #1 and select Tracks &gt; Add Video. Drag your video clip into the V1 track and your still image into V2. Click and drag the right-hand side of the image in the V2 track until it’s the same length as the video.</p>

<h2 id="3-Set-the-key-2"><a href="#3-Set-the-key-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Set the key"></a><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Set the key</strong></h2><p>Now click the VFX tab, select the V1 track in the timeline and click the tab marked with a plus icon. Click the Favorites drop-down menu and select Key, followed by Green Screen. Click Add Effect and you’ll see a new panel of settings under the color correction wheels.</p>
<p>Use the eyedropper tool on the left to select the background you want to remove. This will typically do quite a good job by itself, but it will need a little fine-tuning. Try sliding the Saturation and Luminance sliders and adjusting their steepness using the handles that appear when you move your mouse over them. You’ll notice that each adjustment you make has a knock-on effect on the changes you’ve made with the other sliders; it’s a matter of balancing all three to achieve the best effect, preserving detail while minimizing spill.</p>
<p>To see how the filter is working, click the ‘Reveal’ box. The white areas are the parts of the video that will be removed, and the black areas are the parts that will remain.</p>
<p>The Remove Spill slider will add a purple tint to neutralize green tones in areas that need it.</p>

When you’re done, return to the Edit tab, right-click the preview window at the top right and select Export.</p>
<p>The only two export options you’ll see in the free version of Lightworks are Vimeo and YouTube, but this is a little misleading. These will save the video to your PC or Mac in an MP4 format, but they won’t do the uploading for you unless you check the appropriate box.</p>
<p>Select a destination folder and name for your video file and click ‘Start’. The processing will begin, and you’ll see a progress bar at the top right. This task will run in the background so you can continue working on your project, and you’ll be notified when it’s complete.</p>

<p><strong>WHICH SHOULD I CHOOSE: FREE OR PAID GREEN SCREEN SOFTWARE?</strong></p>
<p>If you want something quick, cheap, and easy, and having your footage seems to be fairly clean with few shadows or spills, there are several cheap or free apps into which you can import a clip, apply a chroma key, and export without much editing or advanced features.</p>
<p>If your footage calls for attention, extra equipment can be required. If your clip has inconsistent lighting fixtures or poor quality, you may require equipment that permits you to observe a couple of chroma keys to suit the numerous shades of green or color correction equipment to restore your pictures. For even advanced functions, you’ll want to spend a little time and money learning, however the end result will most possibly be worthwhile. More advanced chroma key equipment are normally used inside full-featured NLEs through integrated equipment or expert plug-ins that encompass extra beneficial functions including advanced color correction, noise reduction, HDR (High Dynamic Range) color support, movement and keyframing, extra file layout and high-resolution support, and multi-camera editing.</p>
<p><strong>FAQS ABOUT EDITING GREEN SCREEN</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What is the most important thing when using a green screen?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When lighting your green screen, ensure there is even, soft light on the entirety of the green screen. This is crucial for a proper key. Many filmmakers overlook this essential part and focus on lighting the subject. However, be sure to use whatever lights you have to expose the green screen background evenly.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Why do filmmakers use green screens?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A green screen basically lets you drop in whatever background images you want behind the actors and&#x2F;or foreground. It’s used in film production (and also in news and weather reports) to relatively simply place the desired background behind the subject&#x2F;actor&#x2F;presenter.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Why is a green screen not a different color?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The really short answer is that green screens are green because people are not green. For the effect to work, the background must use a color that isn’t used elsewhere in the shot – and green is nothing like human skin tone.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Green screen video production is not difficult. Anyone, with the right tools can create green screen effects like a pro. Simply follow the precautions listed above and choose the software that best suits your needs.</p>
<p>Whether you’re making a professional film or a simple family video, I’m confident you’ll find something suitable among the options listed above.</p>

<p>When you record a video against a green screen, you can make the background transparent and replace it with other video clips, graphics, or still images of your choice. It’s easy to overlay any footage with iMovie’s green screen effect. For example, you can transport yourself anywhere or appear in your favorite films.</p>
<p>The green Screen effect, also referred as the Chroma Key effect, is a simple way to combine two clips into one with impressive scenes. You can, for example, fly over a very high mountain. Green Screen is a background that is only one color, usually green. This could be another pure color, such as Blue or Pink. By dragging and dropping, you can apply a green screen video to another in iMovie. It’s incredibly simple to create stunning videos using the iMovie Green Screen effect.</p>

<p>Davinci Resolve has two versions including a full studio version which is available for $299. Because some professional tools, such as team collaboration and video noise reduction, cannot be used without a full license, the free program has a surprising number of features. The majority of the features included in the free version are adequate for professionals and hobbyists.</p>
<p>Although the Davinci Resolve program is regarded as a professional grade editor, it does include some advanced tools such as exporting, audio mastering, color correction, and more. The program is also useful for arranging audio and video clips, and it has a large selection of effects and filters. The additional color correction and adjustments available here can also aid in HDR support and produce more professional results when working with camera RAW data.</p>
<p>Davinci Resolve is also well-known for having one of the best color grading programs available. The outcome can be hugely potent when using the accessible chromakey tools. It doesn’t take much to figure out how to use this effect with the quick tutorial on board.</p>

<p><strong>Steps On How To Remove the Green Screen in DaVinci Resolve Inside the Color Tab</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1 – Add the Qualifier Tool &amp; select the color</strong></p>
<p>After you finish cutting the video, jump inside the “<strong>Color</strong>” tab and select the Qualifier Tool. Make sure you set the tool in “<strong>3D</strong>” mode to enable us to select a bigger range of the green spectrum.</p>
<p>Do this by simply selecting the fourth dot from the middle-upper area of the window or by selecting it from the drop-down mode selector situated in the window’s top-right corner.</p>
<p>After selecting the 3D mode for the Qualifier Tool, go ahead and select the range of green colors you want to remove by simply drawing lines on top of the screen, similar to the way I did in the image below.</p>

Right-click underneath the node, select “Add Alpha Output” and then link the node.</p>
<p>Yes, I know it will key out the subject and not the green screen. There is no problem. Go ahead and select the Revert button situated in the “Selection Range” window. Everything should be OK now.</p>

In the hair area and on the outline of the subject, there is a noticeable green color spill. We don’t want that! On top of this, there will be many situations where you will still notice some noisy green pixels in the transparent area, around the corners of the screen, or the subject.</p>
<p>To get rid of these problems, we have to jump into the Qualifier window. Here, there are many settings you can play with to tweak the output. Most of the time, you will solve these problems by checking “Despill”, further selecting more of the greens and adding them to the Selection Range, or modifying the shrink, ”Black Clip” and “White Clip”.</p>

<p><strong>Steps On How To Chroma Key In Lightworks</strong></p>
<h2 id="1-Record-your-video-3"><a href="#1-Record-your-video-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Record your video"></a><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Record your video</strong></h2><p>First, you need a green or blue background to shoot against. As we’ll explain later, it doesn’t have to be a very specific shade, but it needs to be substantially different from the subject you’re shooting. You might have seen occasions when a weather presenter’s tie has appeared transparent during a broadcast. This is because the material was too close in color to the backdrop, or the key wasn’t quite set accurately enough.</p>

                ></p>
<p>You can make your backdrop using a sheet, or a large sheet of paper or card. If you’re planning to make videos frequently, there are inexpensive chromakey backdrops available that include a frame to hang the cloth from. If space is limited, collapsible screens are also available starting at around US$40. These screens are also handy for photography.</p>
<p>Good lighting is essential. You need to make sure that the screen is evenly lit so the color is consistent. It’s also important to ensure your subject is far enough from the screen to avoid shadows and color spills (when the blue or green backdrop reflects off your subject).</p>
<h2 id="2-Import-and-trim-3"><a href="#2-Import-and-trim-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Import and trim"></a><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Import and trim</strong></h2><p>Once you’ve shot your video, download and install <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/lightworks" >Lightworks <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It’s free for personal use, but you’ll need to register for a free account if you want to use it for longer than 30 days.</p>
<p>Click the button marked Create a New Project, give it a name, and select a frame rate (you can find this by right-clicking your recorded video and selecting the Details tab). Here we’re using a still image as a background, but you can also use another video. Import this the same way.</p>
<p>Click the Edit tab and drag your video from the Project Contents panel onto the V1 track of the timeline below. If there’s unwanted footage at the beginning or end of your clip, right-click it and select Trim In or Trim Out, then use the yellow handles to change where the clip starts and finishes.</p>
<p>Right-click the preview window marked Sequence #1 and select Tracks &gt; Add Video. Drag your video clip into the V1 track and your still image into V2. Click and drag the right-hand side of the image in the V2 track until it’s the same length as the video.</p>

<h2 id="3-Set-the-key-3"><a href="#3-Set-the-key-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Set the key"></a><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Set the key</strong></h2><p>Now click the VFX tab, select the V1 track in the timeline and click the tab marked with a plus icon. Click the Favorites drop-down menu and select Key, followed by Green Screen. Click Add Effect and you’ll see a new panel of settings under the color correction wheels.</p>
<p>Use the eyedropper tool on the left to select the background you want to remove. This will typically do quite a good job by itself, but it will need a little fine-tuning. Try sliding the Saturation and Luminance sliders and adjusting their steepness using the handles that appear when you move your mouse over them. You’ll notice that each adjustment you make has a knock-on effect on the changes you’ve made with the other sliders; it’s a matter of balancing all three to achieve the best effect, preserving detail while minimizing spill.</p>
<p>To see how the filter is working, click the ‘Reveal’ box. The white areas are the parts of the video that will be removed, and the black areas are the parts that will remain.</p>
<p>The Remove Spill slider will add a purple tint to neutralize green tones in areas that need it.</p>

When you’re done, return to the Edit tab, right-click the preview window at the top right and select Export.</p>
<p>The only two export options you’ll see in the free version of Lightworks are Vimeo and YouTube, but this is a little misleading. These will save the video to your PC or Mac in an MP4 format, but they won’t do the uploading for you unless you check the appropriate box.</p>
<p>Select a destination folder and name for your video file and click ‘Start’. The processing will begin, and you’ll see a progress bar at the top right. This task will run in the background so you can continue working on your project, and you’ll be notified when it’s complete.</p>

<p><strong>WHICH SHOULD I CHOOSE: FREE OR PAID GREEN SCREEN SOFTWARE?</strong></p>
<p>If you want something quick, cheap, and easy, and having your footage seems to be fairly clean with few shadows or spills, there are several cheap or free apps into which you can import a clip, apply a chroma key, and export without much editing or advanced features.</p>
<p>If your footage calls for attention, extra equipment can be required. If your clip has inconsistent lighting fixtures or poor quality, you may require equipment that permits you to observe a couple of chroma keys to suit the numerous shades of green or color correction equipment to restore your pictures. For even advanced functions, you’ll want to spend a little time and money learning, however the end result will most possibly be worthwhile. More advanced chroma key equipment are normally used inside full-featured NLEs through integrated equipment or expert plug-ins that encompass extra beneficial functions including advanced color correction, noise reduction, HDR (High Dynamic Range) color support, movement and keyframing, extra file layout and high-resolution support, and multi-camera editing.</p>
<p><strong>FAQS ABOUT EDITING GREEN SCREEN</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What is the most important thing when using a green screen?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When lighting your green screen, ensure there is even, soft light on the entirety of the green screen. This is crucial for a proper key. Many filmmakers overlook this essential part and focus on lighting the subject. However, be sure to use whatever lights you have to expose the green screen background evenly.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Why do filmmakers use green screens?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A green screen basically lets you drop in whatever background images you want behind the actors and&#x2F;or foreground. It’s used in film production (and also in news and weather reports) to relatively simply place the desired background behind the subject&#x2F;actor&#x2F;presenter.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Why is a green screen not a different color?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The really short answer is that green screens are green because people are not green. For the effect to work, the background must use a color that isn’t used elsewhere in the shot – and green is nothing like human skin tone.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Green screen video production is not difficult. Anyone, with the right tools can create green screen effects like a pro. Simply follow the precautions listed above and choose the software that best suits your needs.</p>
<p>Whether you’re making a professional film or a simple family video, I’m confident you’ll find something suitable among the options listed above.</p>
