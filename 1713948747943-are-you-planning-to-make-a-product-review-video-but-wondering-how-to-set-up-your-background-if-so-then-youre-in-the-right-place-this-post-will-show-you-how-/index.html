Tips: How to improve product review video"></a>Part 2. Tips: How to improve product review video</h2><p>Following these tips will help you improve the quality of your product review videos and make them more enjoyable for your audience.</p>
<p><strong>1) Make sure your video has the correct resolution and scale</strong></p>
<p>Having the correct resolution and scale for your video will make sure that it has a high-definition (HD) or high-quality resolution. Also, it will ensure that your video is the correct size when exporting.</p>
<p>If the scale is different from the resolution, then the empty space will be filled with black, and you will get black bars border that makes your video smaller.</p>
<p><strong>2) Use proper lighting to ensure your video looks clear and bright</strong></p>
<p>To get proper lighting, you should use natural lighting whenever possible, such as sunlight. However, if you can’t shoot during the day or it’s difficult to get natural light, you will need to use artificial lighting.</p>
<p>Next, adjust the white balance on your camera. You can also edit the color grading to finalize the look and improve the overall color of your video.</p>
<p><strong>3) Make sure the audio quality of your video is good</strong></p>
<p>Poor audio can make your video harder to listen to and turn off viewers.</p>
<h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>It is essential to know how to adjust the background to black in your product review video. This is because it can help to make your video content more professional and stand out.

<h2 id="How-to-Remove-Background-Noise-From-Video-Sony-Vegas"><a href="#How-to-Remove-Background-Noise-From-Video-Sony-Vegas" class="headerlink" title="How to Remove Background Noise From Video Sony Vegas"></a>How to Remove Background Noise From Video Sony Vegas</h2><p>The most popular activity you’ll get from video creators is to remove unpleasant noises like rumble or buzz from a final film, whether a promotional video, a short story, a short advertisement, or something else entirely. When mixing and capturing sound effects or even other multimedia design elements, it’s typical to have to remove background noises.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there are some techniques for eliminating these background noises. In this guide, I will illustrate how to eliminate background noise on Windows, Mac, and Online.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Remove-Background-Noise-from-Video-Sony-Vegas"><a href="#How-to-Remove-Background-Noise-from-Video-Sony-Vegas" class="headerlink" title="How to Remove Background Noise from Video Sony Vegas?"></a><strong>How to Remove Background Noise from Video Sony Vegas?</strong></h2><p>Nothing is more frustrating than watching your film’s current video footage and hearing excessive background noise. Well, if you’re unfamiliar with Vegas Pro, don’t worry; we’ll show you how to reduce noise with these simple steps.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick guide on reducing background noise in Sony Vegas. Follow these techniques to minimize background noise quickly and effectively, leaving you with clear audio:</p>
<h3 id="Method-1-Lower-the-Volume"><a href="#Method-1-Lower-the-Volume" class="headerlink" title="Method #1: Lower the Volume"></a><strong>Method #1: Lower the Volume</strong></h3><p>Consider lowering the volume of your video. Low-level noise is frequently seen in audio at the lowest volume settings. Simply decrease the general volume levels to fight this, and it may clean any mild, below-the-floor background noise.</p>
<p>Slide down the volume lever in the track to the left to lower the level of all audio occurrences within the track. To equalize the course, press the top of the track and drag the gain level down.</p>

<h3 id="Method-2-Utilize-the-Noise-Gate-Feature"><a href="#Method-2-Utilize-the-Noise-Gate-Feature" class="headerlink" title="Method #2: Utilize the Noise Gate Feature"></a><strong>Method #2: Utilize the Noise Gate Feature</strong></h3><p>Reducing the volume and implementing the first method does not always eliminate background noise, so you must explore further.</p>
<p>There may be circumstances where the background noise is louder than the speaker, and decreasing the total volume makes it incomprehensible.</p>
<p>I suggest that you consider the Noise Gate if the background noise is a constant hiss. Noise Gate effectively suppresses sound below a specific volume, and background noise volume is lesser than the audio you want to include in your edit. As a result, using the Noise Gate is the best option.</p>
<p>To use the Noise Gate, go to the Track FX section of the interface and click the Audio FX button. Now select “Noise Gate.” The choices for this are now visible. Raise the threshold level; this establishes the total volume quality threshold. The Noise Gate will remove all audio below the threshold.</p>

In this article, I also prepared a few alternative ways that you can use to remove background noises from your video. Let’s skip the talk and start learning:</p>
<h3 id="1-Wondershare-Filmora-–-Overall-Best"><a href="#1-Wondershare-Filmora-–-Overall-Best" class="headerlink" title="#1: Wondershare Filmora – Overall Best"></a><strong>#1:</strong> <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <strong>– Overall Best</strong></h3><p><strong>It is available on Windows and Mac.</strong></p>
<p>Although there are many applications available for removing background noise, experts recommend Wondershare Filmora Video Editor. Let’s get right to the point.</p>
<p>Aside from the standard audio editing tools, Filmora now includes better wavelengths, volume keyframing, peak detection, and audio fades, resulting in a higher-quality audio editing interface. Here are some of the trump cards of using Filmora to remove background audio noise:</p>
<ul>
<li>Waveform audio editing with adjustable track height</li>
<li>Remove background noise with ONE click using the Denoise function.</li>
<li>Adjust the Denoise level to Weak, Mid, or Strong for improved noise reduction outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s a guide on how to use Filmora to improve video footage, including how to eliminate background noise:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the Wondershare Filmora timeline panel, upload your clip. Trim and erase the video sections that you don’t wish to keep.</li>
<li>Hover over the Audio option after right-clicking the clip in the timeline. The four choices available are silence detection, modification audio, removal audio, and mute. Select the “Audio Detach” feature to extract the audio from the video.</li>
</ol>
<p><img

                      alt="remove-noise-sony-vegas-"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li>Double-click on the audio file and select “Remove background noise” in the Edit Menu to eliminate the background noise instantly. You may also reach the Editing panel by double-clicking the video in the timeline without removing audio from the video and switching to the Audio page to edit audio and remove noise.</li>
</ol>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="remove-noise-sony-vegas-"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li>You may also use the Equalizer tool to fine-tune the audio to make it seem more authentic. Simply tweak the music to fit the visual frame by frame if you want a better assessment. After analyzing the results, click Export to save the noise-reduced clip to your device or share it immediately to YouTube or Vimeo.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="2-Audacity"><a href="#2-Audacity" class="headerlink" title="#2: Audacity"></a><strong>#2:</strong> <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.audacityteam.org/" >Audacity <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><strong>It is available on Windows, Mac, and Linux.</strong></p>
<p>Audacity is a free, accessible, high-quality audio editing program that runs on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. You may use it to record live audio, modify it with capabilities like a cut, copy, and paste, and visualize advanced audio analysis using the Spectrogram view mode.You may also use it to eliminate background noise from your audio or video files for free.</p>
<p>The improved detailed instructions for removing background noise in Audacity in 2022 are listed below:</p>
<p><strong>Step #1: Import Files to Audacity</strong></p>
<p>Move to the File menu and hit Open or Import after running the program to load the audio or video source into Audacity. Before editing, Audacity will prompt you to make a copy of the audio track. This impresses me as extremely thoughtful. If you want to import a video file into Audacity, you’ll have to download and install FFmpeg Library beforehand. Otherwise, you’ll need to separate the audio from the video or transcode the video to a suitable audio format.</p>

                      alt="remove-noise-sony-vegas-"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step #2: Detect the Noise Segment</strong></p>
<p>Locate a portion with pure background noise by zooming in on the track or adjusting the Track Size under the View menu.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="remove-noise-sony-vegas-"
                ></p>
<p>Choose “Noise Reduction” from the Effect tab, begin with the defaults, and then hit “Get Noise Profile” to have Audacity determine what to filter out based on the specified section.</p>
<p><strong>Step #3: Eliminate Background Noise with Noise Profile</strong></p>
<p>Next, select the entire audio track that requires noise reduction, return to the Noise Reduction panels, select how much noise you want to eliminate, and click OK to eliminate the noise. You may use the default settings. Audacity will automatically minimize the noise, and the outcome will be visible on the audio track right away.</p>
<p><strong>Step #4: Calibrate the Settings</strong></p>
<p>To address the white noise of your audio, go to Effect and Amplify. To see if the noise has been gone, click “Preview.” Click “OK” and then export the denoised clip from Audacity to MP3, WAV, or other codecs.</p>

<p>Audacity is a free, accessible, high-quality audio editing program that runs on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. You may use it to record live audio, modify it with capabilities like a cut, copy, and paste, and visualize advanced audio analysis using the Spectrogram view mode.You may also use it to eliminate background noise from your audio or video files for free.</p>
<p>The improved detailed instructions for removing background noise in Audacity in 2022 are listed below:</p>
<p><strong>Step #1: Import Files to Audacity</strong></p>
<p>Move to the File menu and hit Open or Import after running the program to load the audio or video source into Audacity. Before editing, Audacity will prompt you to make a copy of the audio track. This impresses me as extremely thoughtful. If you want to import a video file into Audacity, you’ll have to download and install FFmpeg Library beforehand. Otherwise, you’ll need to separate the audio from the video or transcode the video to a suitable audio format.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step #2: Detect the Noise Segment</strong></p>
<p>Locate a portion with pure background noise by zooming in on the track or adjusting the Track Size under the View menu.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Choose “Noise Reduction” from the Effect tab, begin with the defaults, and then hit “Get Noise Profile” to have Audacity determine what to filter out based on the specified section.</p>
<p><strong>Step #3: Eliminate Background Noise with Noise Profile</strong></p>
<p>Next, select the entire audio track that requires noise reduction, return to the Noise Reduction panels, select how much noise you want to eliminate, and click OK to eliminate the noise. You may use the default settings. Audacity will automatically minimize the noise, and the outcome will be visible on the audio track right away.</p>
<p><strong>Step #4: Calibrate the Settings</strong></p>
<p>To address the white noise of your audio, go to Effect and Amplify. To see if the noise has been gone, click “Preview.” Click “OK” and then export the denoised clip from Audacity to MP3, WAV, or other codecs.</p>

<p><strong>Method #2: Utilize the Noise Gate Feature</strong></p>
<p>Reducing the volume and implementing the first method does not always eliminate background noise, so you must explore further.</p>
<p>There may be circumstances where the background noise is louder than the speaker, and decreasing the total volume makes it incomprehensible.</p>
<p>I suggest that you consider the Noise Gate if the background noise is a constant hiss. Noise Gate effectively suppresses sound below a specific volume, and background noise volume is lesser than the audio you want to include in your edit. As a result, using the Noise Gate is the best option.</p>
<p>To use the Noise Gate, go to the Track FX section of the interface and click the Audio FX button. Now select “Noise Gate.” The choices for this are now visible. Raise the threshold level; this establishes the total volume quality threshold. The Noise Gate will remove all audio below the threshold.</p>

<p>Although there are many applications available for removing background noise, experts recommend Wondershare Filmora Video Editor. Let’s get right to the point.</p>
<p>Aside from the standard audio editing tools, Filmora now includes better wavelengths, volume keyframing, peak detection, and audio fades, resulting in a higher-quality audio editing interface. Here are some of the trump cards of using Filmora to remove background audio noise:</p>
<ul>
<li>Waveform audio editing with adjustable track height</li>
<li>Remove background noise with ONE click using the Denoise function.</li>
<li>Adjust the Denoise level to Weak, Mid, or Strong for improved noise reduction outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s a guide on how to use Filmora to improve video footage, including how to eliminate background noise:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the Wondershare Filmora timeline panel, upload your clip. Trim and erase the video sections that you don’t wish to keep.</li>
<li>Hover over the Audio option after right-clicking the clip in the timeline. The four choices available are silence detection, modification audio, removal audio, and mute. Select the “Audio Detach” feature to extract the audio from the video.</li>

Otherwise, you’ll need to separate the audio from the video or transcode the video to a suitable audio format.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step #2: Detect the Noise Segment</strong></p>
<p>Locate a portion with pure background noise by zooming in on the track or adjusting the Track Size under the View menu.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Choose “Noise Reduction” from the Effect tab, begin with the defaults, and then hit “Get Noise Profile” to have Audacity determine what to filter out based on the specified section.</p>
<p><strong>Step #3: Eliminate Background Noise with Noise Profile</strong></p>
<p>Next, select the entire audio track that requires noise reduction, return to the Noise Reduction panels, select how much noise you want to eliminate, and click OK to eliminate the noise. You may use the default settings. Audacity will automatically minimize the noise, and the outcome will be visible on the audio track right away.</p>
<p><strong>Step #4: Calibrate the Settings</strong></p>
<p>To address the white noise of your audio, go to Effect and Amplify. To see if the noise has been gone, click “Preview.” Click “OK” and then export the denoised clip from Audacity to MP3, WAV, or other codecs.</p>

<ol>
<li>Choose a video file first, then click the Upload Video button below. Depending on the size of the video, this could take some time.</li>
<li>Click the download file to save it to your PC after it’s finished.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="How-to-Use-Color-Grading-in-Final-Cut-Pro"><a href="#How-to-Use-Color-Grading-in-Final-Cut-Pro" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Color Grading in Final Cut Pro"></a>How to Use Color Grading in Final Cut Pro</h2><p>Have you ever questioned the purpose of those odd video scopes or how to build super grades from the start in Final Cut Pro? In contrast to editing talents, color grading is a technical and difficult ability that takes practice.</p>
<p>In order to help, we decided to compile a thorough beginner’s article to color grading in Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p>With that said, let’s begin!</p>
<h2 id="1-Discover-how-you-color-grade-in-Final-Cut-Pro"><a href="#1-Discover-how-you-color-grade-in-Final-Cut-Pro" class="headerlink" title="1. Discover how you color grade in Final Cut Pro"></a>1. Discover how you color grade in Final Cut Pro</h2><p>Color grading may be a tedious and time-consuming operation, therefore it’s a skill set that calls for a lot of patience. Some editors won’t conduct any color grading or correction beyond the bare minimum. But even mundane-looking film may look remarkable if you know how to give it a dramatic touch.</p>
<p>A more cinematic grade requires a number of procedures, and there is no one method that works for all situations. We’ll therefore walk you through the process of creating a cinematic color grade in Final Cut Pro, but depending on your material, you might need to add or omit some phases.</p>
<h5 id="Step1Filming"><a href="#Step1Filming" class="headerlink" title="Step1Filming"></a>Step1Filming</h5><p>Since the raw video is essential for producing a cinematic image, an outstanding grade begins with the camera.</p>
<p>Use the greatest quality settings your camera offers while recording your video; the more information in your picture, the more you can manipulate it during grading.</p>
<p>While it may seem preferable to shoot with as much color as you can, using a duller color profile is very necessary. Your camera will have color settings, and although the washed-out, drab appearance may not inspire confidence in you, it will offer you a lot more editing possibility.</p>
<h5 id="Step2Create-a-color-profile"><a href="#Step2Create-a-color-profile" class="headerlink" title="Step2Create a color profile"></a>Step2Create a color profile</h5><p>After importing your film, you may be concerned about the general dull look of your recordings. The reason for that is because you have not yet matched the color profile of your sequence to the one of your camera. To start on this process, it goes as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>Drag your clip onto your timeline and make sure it is selected. Click on the Inspector icon.</li>
<li>Then click on the Information tab of the clip.</li>
<li>Navigate all the way down through the options to find the Color LUT option.</li>
<li>Then choose the Color profile that matches your clip based on the camera it is filmed with.</li>
<li>You’re done!</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="Step3Checking-the-scopes"><a href="#Step3Checking-the-scopes" class="headerlink" title="Step3Checking the scopes"></a>Step3Checking the scopes</h5><p>The Scopes in Final Cut Pro are panels that display the color information of your shots. They are quite complicated and can be difficult to comprehend if you did not use them ever before. You can activate Video Scopes by clicking View &gt; Show in Viewer &gt; Video Scopes from the View menu. The three components of grading are the highlights, mid-tones, and shadows. Your highlights are shown at the top and your shadows are at the bottom in all grading tools and scopes.</p>
<h2 id="2-Include-Color-Wheels"><a href="#2-Include-Color-Wheels" class="headerlink" title="2. Include Color Wheels"></a>2. Include Color Wheels</h2><p>Now that your setup is complete, you can begin grading your footage. Grading is done in multiple layers stacked on top of each other. It may take multiple levels to create the desired look. Follow the instructions below to modify your settings to match your clip if you want to give your footage a cinematic look.</p>
<p>You may access a wider range of color manipulation tools with the built-in color wheels, exposure adjustments, including isolation of color selection, RGB modifications across tone ranges, and simple masking.</p>
<h2 id="3-Color-board"><a href="#3-Color-board" class="headerlink" title="3. Color board"></a>3. Color board</h2><p>A vertical color spectrum is shown on the Color Board, and it is intersected by a horizontal line that features four nodes. These are the ranges of the footage that are designated as the Highlights, Midtones, and Shadows, respectively.</p>
<p>Adjusting a node to a new color space has an immediate and noticeable impact on the corresponding section of the image. If you move above the horizontal line, it will increase, and if you go below the line, it will decrease.</p>
<p>You also have control over the Saturation and Exposure settings. These are wonderful to have if you want to increase the contrast in your photographs and make particular colors more vivid or muted.</p>
<h2 id="4-Masks"><a href="#4-Masks" class="headerlink" title="4. Masks"></a>4. Masks</h2><p>Using the Shape Masks feature, each of these individual effects can be perfect for particular regions of your footage. In addition, by utilizing a Color Mask, you can alter the appearance of a specific color. It is possible to apply multiple iterations of each color adjustment to a clip and find it listed under the Effect heading.</p>
<p>The order can be changed by dragging and dropping, and either method can be disabled or enabled. Utilizing keyframes allows for the effects of color grading to be specifically timed as well. Last but not least, keep in mind that the quality and color sample depth of the clips determine how much of an overall adjustment you are capable of making to a color.</p>
<h2 id="5-Color-Curves"><a href="#5-Color-Curves" class="headerlink" title="5. Color Curves"></a>5. Color Curves</h2><p>If you are experienced with more advanced picture editing software, such as Adobe Photoshop, you will benefit greatly from using color curves. Adjustments can be made independently to both the Luma (the brightest areas) and the primary composite colors (red, blue, and green).</p>
<h2 id="6-Match-Colors"><a href="#6-Match-Colors" class="headerlink" title="6. Match Colors"></a>6. Match Colors</h2><p>Match Color is an additional choice that may be made from the improvement’s menu. This function will try to replicate the visual style of one video clip in another. First, choose the clip whose color you want to change, click on that clip that has the desired appearance, and last, choose Match Color.</p>
<p>You will still be able to utilize these settings as shortcuts even after you have gained more experience with manual grading and are comfortable making finer adjustments manually. It is important to keep in mind that while using Final Cut Pro X for color grading, effects can be layered on top of one another.</p>
<p>It’s not likely that a single tool or adjustment will solve an issue or produce the desired result; rather, it’s more likely that a number of different impacts will be required. In the same way that different visual effects in Final Cut Pro X may be toggled on and off, any layers that you add to a clip can have their visibility controlled from the Inspector window.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In Final Cut Pro X, you may choose from a wide variety of grading plugins, ranging from more affordable solutions like FCPeffects to more expensive ones like Magic Bullet Looks, which are designed specifically for feature film-style grades.</p>
<p>Additionally, there is a variety of stand-alone applications for color grading, such as DaVinci Resolve and FilmConvert. You might be comfortable with their gear, but you should also know that their professional-grade color package includes some rather complex editing options.</p>
<p>Beginning to experiment with all of Final Cut Pro X’s functions and determining which ones are most useful to you is the best method to gain an understanding of the program’s color grading capabilities. If you don’t currently have a project that requires your attention, you can download stock footage and experiment with it.</p>
