Frequently in cases where the devices share different forms of resolution, it makes sharing videos a hassle.</p>
<p>In those situations, changing the resolution of your video can be a great idea. It will also allow you to save storage. In this article, you’ll adjust the resolution in just a few clicks by Wondershare Filmora. But before we learn how to change a video’s resolution, let’s look into what a video resolution is!</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-a-Video-Resolution"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-a-Video-Resolution" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is a Video Resolution?"></a>Part 1. What Is a Video Resolution?</h2><p>A video resolution, in short, is the quality of the video visible. A video is rendered at a specific rate whenever you watch a movie or go to a cinema. A screen is made up of <strong>tiny pixels</strong> and arranged in an order that determines the resolution of a screen.</p>
<p>Video resolution is rendered in a <strong>vertical</strong> and <strong>horizontal</strong> orientation. Therefore, whenever you play a video on YouTube, the resolution scale is available for you to choose from, i.e., <strong>480p</strong>, <strong>720p</strong>, <strong>1080p,</strong> etc.</p>
<p>In most cases, a resolution is dictated by the full abbreviation. So, for example, a <strong>720p</strong> video is <strong>1280 x 720,</strong> and a <strong>1080p</strong> video is a <strong>1920 x 1080</strong> resolution.</p>

<p><img

                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The number written before is the number of horizontal pixels in a video. And the number written after is the vertical pixels in a video.</p>
<p>Before we adjust the resolution of a video, let’s look at a comparison between different types of video resolution.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-7-Different-Types-of-Video-Resolution"><a href="#Part-2-7-Different-Types-of-Video-Resolution" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 7 Different Types of Video Resolution"></a>Part 2. 7 Different Types of Video Resolution</h2><p>It has been established that a video resolution is not a constant number and changes according to the screen.

<p>You can <strong>trim</strong>, <strong>add effects</strong>, and <strong>join</strong> multiple clips in this process. After finishing the editing process, it’s time to select an export format.</p>
<h5 id="Step4-Export-Your-Video"><a href="#Step4-Export-Your-Video" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Export Your Video"></a>Step4 Export Your Video</h5><p>You can export into video formats in two ways with Filmora. It can be either selecting a format for your video. Or you can also choose to export your video to a particular device.</p>
<p><strong>Video Format Resolution</strong></p>
<p>Wondershare Filmora is a fantastic software that allows you to access a variety of formats for your videos. These export formats include <strong>MP4</strong>, <strong>WMV</strong>, <strong>F4V</strong>, <strong>MOV</strong>, <strong>TS</strong>, <strong>3GP</strong>, and more. To select a format for your video, follow the steps as guided:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on <strong>Export</strong>.</li>
<li>In the left column, click on the <strong>video</strong> format you need.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Export</strong> on the bottom right corner of the window.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-11.png"
                      alt="wondershare filmora selecting video format"
                ></p>
<p>Exporting a video in a specific format not only allows you to change the format of a video but also allows you to change the resolution simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>Default Resolution Settings</strong></p>
<p>Some formats have a built-in resolution. Whenever you choose a specific format for a video, the resolution of the video will be shifted to the resolution of that format, i.e., <strong>TS</strong> has a default <strong>1080p</strong> resolution.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Another thing to remember is that most video formats have defaulted to <strong>1080p</strong>. But there are some formats whose resolutions vary according to their style. A good example is a <strong>3GP</strong> format, which is set to <strong>352 x 488</strong> by default.</p>
<p><strong>Customize the Resolution</strong></p>
<p>But if you don’t find the resolution stable for your device, you can also change this default resolution in simple steps. In the export window, follow the steps mentioned ahead:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the preset tab, go to &gt; <strong>settings</strong>.</li>
<li>In the video tab, click on the <strong>resolution</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>drop-down</strong> menu, select the resolution that you desire.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also select a custom resolution by these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the <strong>drop-down</strong> menu, click on <strong>Custom</strong>.</li>
<li>Here, you can change the height and width according to your wish.</li>
</ul>

                ></p>
<p>Now that we have our clips imported, it is time to add them to the timeline below!</p>
<h5 id="Step3-Add-The-Video-Clips-to-Timeline-1"><a href="#Step3-Add-The-Video-Clips-to-Timeline-1" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Add The Video Clips to Timeline"></a>Step3 Add The Video Clips to Timeline</h5><p>To add Video clips to the timeline, go through the steps as guided:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hold Right click to drag and select the <strong>video clips</strong> in the import window.</li>
<li>Release Right-click when in the <strong>timeline</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-10.png"
                      alt="wondershare filmora importing clips to the timeline"
                ></p>
<p>Doing so would have added the video clips to the timeline. Instead, it has created a workplace to edit our videos.</p>
<p>You can <strong>trim</strong>, <strong>add effects</strong>, and <strong>join</strong> multiple clips in this process. After finishing the editing process, it’s time to select an export format.</p>
<h5 id="Step4-Export-Your-Video-1"><a href="#Step4-Export-Your-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Export Your Video"></a>Step4 Export Your Video</h5><p>You can export into video formats in two ways with Filmora. It can be either selecting a format for your video. Or you can also choose to export your video to a particular device.</p>
<p><strong>Video Format Resolution</strong></p>
<p>Wondershare Filmora is a fantastic software that allows you to access a variety of formats for your videos. These export formats include <strong>MP4</strong>, <strong>WMV</strong>, <strong>F4V</strong>, <strong>MOV</strong>, <strong>TS</strong>, <strong>3GP</strong>, and more. To select a format for your video, follow the steps as guided:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on <strong>Export</strong>.</li>
<li>In the left column, click on the <strong>video</strong> format you need.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Export</strong> on the bottom right corner of the window.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/change-video-resolution-11.png"
                      alt="wondershare filmora selecting video format"
                ></p>
<p>Exporting a video in a specific format not only allows you to change the format of a video but also allows you to change the resolution simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>Default Resolution Settings</strong></p>
<p>Some formats have a built-in resolution. Whenever you choose a specific format for a video, the resolution of the video will be shifted to the resolution of that format, i.e., <strong>TS</strong> has a default <strong>1080p</strong> resolution.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Another thing to remember is that most video formats have defaulted to <strong>1080p</strong>. But there are some formats whose resolutions vary according to their style. A good example is a <strong>3GP</strong> format, which is set to <strong>352 x 488</strong> by default.</p>
<p><strong>Customize the Resolution</strong></p>
<p>But if you don’t find the resolution stable for your device, you can also change this default resolution in simple steps. In the export window, follow the steps mentioned ahead:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the preset tab, go to &gt; <strong>settings</strong>.</li>
<li>In the video tab, click on the <strong>resolution</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>drop-down</strong> menu, select the resolution that you desire.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also select a custom resolution by these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the <strong>drop-down</strong> menu, click on <strong>Custom</strong>.</li>
<li>Here, you can change the height and width according to your wish.</li>
</ul>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Exporting a Video to a Specific Device</strong></p>
<p>Selecting a format for your video can help if you want to change the resolution. But in cases where you want to export a video to a particular mobile device. Such as an <strong>iPhone</strong> or an <strong>iPad</strong>, you can select the device export option.</p>
<p>In the device export option, you can select a custom device. Filmora allows you to choose from a wide variety of machines available when you choose a custom device; the resolution will be set to optimal for that particular device.</p>
<p><strong>Select a Folder to Export Your Video</strong></p>
<p>After you are done calibrating the resolution settings, you can move on to select the export location for your video. You can do so by the steps mentioned:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the main Export window, navigate to the <strong>Save</strong></li>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Final Step</strong></p>
<p>The last step to export your video is clicking on the <strong>Export</strong> icon in the bottom right corner of the window. It opens up a <strong>render</strong> window. Wait for a few minutes until the video finishes exporting.</p>
<p>When the export is finished, a window will pop up as a reminder. You can also find the target folder by clicking on <strong>Find Target</strong>.</p>

What is a Bokeh Effect?</h2><p>The Japanese word boke, which meaning “blur,” “haze,” or “boke-aji,” the “blur quality,” is where the term “bokeh” originates. The pronunciation of bokeh is BOH-K or BOH-kay. You can find a lot of people discussing the beautiful bokeh that their favorite fast lenses allow on any photography website or forum.</p>
<p>Bokeh is characterized by the words “smooth,” “amazing,” “superb,” “good,” “beautiful,” “sweet,” “silky,” and “great.” But what is it exactly? When using a fast lens and the widest aperture possible, such as f&#x2F;2.8 or wider, you can create bokeh, which is described as “the effect of a fuzzy out-of-focus background.” Bokeh is the appealing or aesthetically pleasant aspect of out-of-focus blur in a shot, to put it simply.</p>

What is a Bokeh effect used for?</h2><p>Most often, bokeh is employed for artistic purposes. You might occasionally desire a little background blur so that the viewer’s attention is drawn to the subject. In other cases, you can want it to completely detract from the subject, as in portraiture when you want to concentrate on the individual’s eyes or mouth while blurring the rest of the image. It’s true that some people use bokeh inadvertently, like looking for photos with excellent bokeh that they may use as free images on their websites or blogs. This isn’t advised, though, as it’s against the law and usually frowned upon in the photographic community as a whole to steal someone else’s image in this manner.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-do-you-create-a-Bokeh-effect"><a href="#Part-3-How-do-you-create-a-Bokeh-effect" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How do you create a Bokeh effect?"></a>Part 3.

It can impart a sense of perfection to everything in a photo, making it look lot more appealing and engaging. Bokeh helps to create a dreamy backdrop that gives the image a whole new level of depth and perspective.</p>
<p>Using a camera lens with a shallow depth of focus is one of the many methods for achieving bokeh in photography. You need a short depth of field so that your lens aperture can be opened up as wide as possible to achieve beautiful bokeh. You can take pictures with shallow depth of field, often known as bokeh, with a point and shoot or a DSLR. A common photography technique used to make the subject stand out from the backdrop is called bokeh.</p>
<p>It can be used to draw attention to the topic by blurring or losing focus on the background. Three different kinds of lenses can create beautiful bokeh: prime lenses with a wide aperture The best lenses for bokeh are often wide-aperture prime lenses. Although they are frequently more expensive and heavier than zoom lenses, they offer a wider field of view. Since there is a greater difference in depth between the foreground and background when using a wide-open aperture, wide aperture prime lenses make blurring the background easier.</p>
