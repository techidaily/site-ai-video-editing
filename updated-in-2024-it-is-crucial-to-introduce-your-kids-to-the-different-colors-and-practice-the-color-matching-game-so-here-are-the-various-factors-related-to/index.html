<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Offers a way of describing the world</strong></p>
<p>For the children, this world is an absolutely new place. They have been introduced to this planet quite recently and are exploring and discovering the different aspects. And one of the major aspects of the world is its colour.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Learning about safety and health through colours</strong></p>
<p>The colour red is commonly associated with danger, and the colour danger is associated with safety. And this is generalized across almost all cultures.

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Offers a way of describing the world</strong></p>
<p>For the children, this world is an absolutely new place. They have been introduced to this planet quite recently and are exploring and discovering the different aspects. And one of the major aspects of the world is its colour.</p>
<p>So, when they learn about colours, they tend to find a way to describe the environment. It gives them a better understanding of the world and their surrounding as they learn about the colours.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Learning to classify and sort</strong></p>

How Do You Do Photo Glitch Effect in Photoshop?"></a>Part 1. How Do You Do Photo Glitch Effect in Photoshop?</h2><p>The jagged lines, the colorful pixels, frozen visuals, and also the distorted colors, everything perfectly blends to make a glitch effect. Usually, this is how all the glitch templates are, but if you get an opportunity to customize your image glitch effect and make your special effect, what will you do?</p>
<p>The best option to adopt in any such circumstances is Photoshop. With Photoshop, you can create a stunning and mind-blowing Photoshop VHS effect. If you want to learn about its steps, then continue reading.</p>
<p>Step 1: The process starts by importing the image to Photoshop on which you plan to add the photo glitch effect. Then you should always convert the image from colorful to black and white. This could be done quickly by going into the ‘Image’ menu from the menu bar. Next, go for the ‘Adjustments’ option and select ‘Desaturate.’</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="tap on desaturate option"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Now duplicate the image by dragging it onto the New Layer icon in the Layers Panel. Then double click on the duplicated image. This will open a ‘Layer Style’ settings menu. Here, click on the icon for ‘R Channel’ and deselect it.</p>

                      alt="disable channel r"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: Now, it’s time to add the first glitch element. For that, hold the ‘Shift’ key and move the image by using the left&#x2F;right cursor keys on the keyboard. This will offset the image layer from the original.</p>

                      alt="add first glitch element"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4: You can now select the ‘Mark’ tool from the left side. Make a rectangle anywhere on the image with the Mark tool and then switch back to the ‘Move’ tool. Then again, nudge the rectangular portion left or right to offset it. You can repeat this process multiple times on different areas of the image.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-How-Do-You-Do-Photo-Glitch-Effect-in-Photoshop-3"><a href="#Part-1-How-Do-You-Do-Photo-Glitch-Effect-in-Photoshop-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How Do You Do Photo Glitch Effect in Photoshop?"></a>Part 1. How Do You Do Photo Glitch Effect in Photoshop?</h2><p>The jagged lines, the colorful pixels, frozen visuals, and also the distorted colors, everything perfectly blends to make a glitch effect. Usually, this is how all the glitch templates are, but if you get an opportunity to customize your image glitch effect and make your special effect, what will you do?</p>
<p>The best option to adopt in any such circumstances is Photoshop. With Photoshop, you can create a stunning and mind-blowing Photoshop VHS effect. If you want to learn about its steps, then continue reading.</p>
<p>Step 1: The process starts by importing the image to Photoshop on which you plan to add the photo glitch effect. Then you should always convert the image from colorful to black and white. This could be done quickly by going into the ‘Image’ menu from the menu bar. Next, go for the ‘Adjustments’ option and select ‘Desaturate.’</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="tap on desaturate option"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: Now duplicate the image by dragging it onto the New Layer icon in the Layers Panel. Then double click on the duplicated image. This will open a ‘Layer Style’ settings menu. Here, click on the icon for ‘R Channel’ and deselect it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="disable channel r"
                ></p>
<p>Step 3: Now, it’s time to add the first glitch element. For that, hold the ‘Shift’ key and move the image by using the left&#x2F;right cursor keys on the keyboard. This will offset the image layer from the original.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add first glitch element"
                ></p>
<p>Step 4: You can now select the ‘Mark’ tool from the left side. Make a rectangle anywhere on the image with the Mark tool and then switch back to the ‘Move’ tool. Then again, nudge the rectangular portion left or right to offset it. You can repeat this process multiple times on different areas of the image.</p>

                      alt="use mark and move tool"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5: At this point, make a New Layer and fill it with White. Now right-click on this white layer and select the option of ‘Convert to Smart Object.’</p>

                      alt="tap on the option of convert to smart object"
                ></p>
<p>Step 6: Move to the menu bar at the top and go to the ‘Filter’ section. From there, select the option of ‘Filter Gallery.’ A new window will show up. Head to the ‘Sketch’ category, and there change the ‘Pattern Type’ to ‘Line.’ You can also play with the ‘Contrast’ and the ‘Size’ of the lines.</p>

                      alt="change the pattern"
                ></p>
<p>Step 7: Now, in the ‘Layers Panel,’ select the option of ‘Overlay’ from the dropdown menu so that the different layers can show through. You can adjust the visibility of the lines by adjusting the number on the scale.</p>

                      alt="tap on overlay"
                ></p>
<p>Step 8: After setting everything for the glitch effect in your image, you can now add colors using the ‘Gradient Map.’ Or you can also import some graphic textures to Photoshop and add them to the image. Don’t forget to change the ‘Binding Mode’ to ‘Overlay.’ You can then play with the color and graphic settings.</p>

                      alt="change the binding mode"
                ></p>
<p>Step 9: Once all the color adjustments have satisfied you, it’s time to add some text to your glitch image. For that, head to the ‘Text’ tool from the left menu and type in your text. Edit it as you did to your image so that you can make a cool glitch text effect Photoshop and with this, you are all done with making the most stunning glitch effect Photoshop.</p>

<h2 id="Best-Practical-Tips-to-Improve-Your-Lighting-in-the-Sun"><a href="#Best-Practical-Tips-to-Improve-Your-Lighting-in-the-Sun" class="headerlink" title="Best Practical Tips to Improve Your Lighting in the Sun"></a>Best Practical Tips to Improve Your Lighting in the Sun</h2><p>Shooting outdoors is a challenge in most situations. We have to deal with the sun being overexposed or the background is too dark.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll show you how to light with the sun the easiest way. These simple and effective tips can help you block the harsh sun and make it to your advantage!</p>
<h2 id="1-Preparation"><a href="#1-Preparation" class="headerlink" title="1) Preparation"></a>1) Preparation</h2><p>You may need those things to film under the harsh sun:</p>
<ol>
<li>An ND filter for your lens</li>
<li>A flag to block the sun. It can be anything like a black poster.</li>
<li>A white poster to bounce the sunlight.</li>
<li>Artificial light equipment.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now let’s see when and how to use them against the strong sunlight!</p>
<h2 id="2-Direct-to-the-Sun"><a href="#2-Direct-to-the-Sun" class="headerlink" title="2) Direct to the Sun"></a>2) Direct to the Sun</h2><p>If we want a specific background for our shot but our talent has to face the sun, here are some tips you can do to undermine the unflattering light or the blindness.</p>
<p><strong>1. Pick up an ND filter on your lens</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/len.jpg"
                      alt="pick up an nd filter on lens"
                ></p>
<p>We use it outside so we can open our aperture to get nice blurry backgrounds without overexposing our footage.</p>
<p><strong>2. Use a “flag” to block or shape the sunlight</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/black-flag.jpg"
                      alt="black flag"
                ></p>
<p>Using a black piece of poster board works perfectly fine, hold it up to the sun. Also, remember to angle your “flag” to create harsh lines or fully shade your talent.</p>
<p><strong>3. Adjust your camera to fit the environment</strong></p>
<p>For example, you can change the exposure of your camera to match the talent’s face giving a more silhouette look.</p>
<h2 id="3-Back-to-the-Sun"><a href="#3-Back-to-the-Sun" class="headerlink" title="3) Back to the Sun"></a>3) Back to the Sun</h2><p>Have you ever been filming outside only to see your talent dark in the frame with the background blown out with light? To fix the problem, the simplest way is to use a “bounce”.</p>
<p>By using a “bounce”, we can reflect the light from the sun to our talent. Make sure to lift the bounce and move it around to get the right amount of light on your talent.</p>
<p>This should give us a nice look with the sun backlighting our subject and the bounce filling in the shadows and giving us soft light on our talent’s face!</p>
<h2 id="4-Artificial-lighting"><a href="#4-Artificial-lighting" class="headerlink" title="4) Artificial lighting"></a>4) Artificial lighting</h2><p>If we want to control our lighting better, we will want to use artificial lights in combination with the sun.</p>
<p>For example, weather changes. As you shot, the sun will move and make lighting challenging to keep consistent.</p>
<p>In that case, we can use the <strong>flag technique</strong> that we used before to block the harsh sunlight and then use our lights on our talent’s face, this keeps our lighting more consistent than if we relied on just the natural light.</p>
<p>Now, take a look at the comparison with all the lighting conditions we create:</p>
<ol>
<li>Flag VS Flag &amp; Light</li>
</ol>

                ></p>
<ol>
<li>Backlight VS Backlight &amp; Bounce</li>
</ol>
