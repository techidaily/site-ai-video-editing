<p>The following passage will guide you through everything you must consider while choosing music for your videos. But first, we’ll show you how easy it is to alter your video with music using Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<h2 id="How-different-types-of-music-affect-your-videos"><a href="#How-different-types-of-music-affect-your-videos" class="headerlink" title="How different types of music affect your videos"></a>How different types of music affect your videos</h2><p>You can easily change the viewer’s perception using different music, even with the same visuals. The right song will elevate your video to another level and assist in relaying your feelings and emotions to the viewers. The following examples will illustrate how changing the audio changes the impression of the video.</p>
<h3 id="Example-1"><a href="#Example-1" class="headerlink" title="Example #1"></a>Example #1</h3><p>Let’s say you have a video of someone walking through the woods. Now without music audio, your video will be boring. You can quickly fix this by adding an upbeat song to make your video more energetic.</p>

                      alt="adding an uplifting beat to your video"
                ></p>
<p>Using the same visuals, you can add a more tense and dramatic song, like from a horror movie. You have successfully changed the entire vibe of the same video from “inspiring” to “sinister.” It proves the importance of the balance between audio and visuals.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adding scary music to your video"
                ></p>
<h3 id="Example-2"><a href="#Example-2" class="headerlink" title="Example #2"></a>Example #2</h3><p>For a better understanding, let’s look at a movie scene we all know and love. Take the entrance scene from Avengers: Endgame. The music used by the producer aims to excite the audience while building up the hype for the upcoming battle. However, if we change the audio of this scene, we end up with a completely different set of emotions that might not go too well with the shot.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/the-power-of-music-in-videos-3.gif"
                      alt="changing the music of a movie scene"
                ></p>
<p>Now that we’ve seen how crucial audio can be in a video, let’s see how to choose the best music audio for your video.</p>
<h2 id="Tip-1-Identify-the-mood"><a href="#Tip-1-Identify-the-mood" class="headerlink" title="Tip #1: Identify the mood"></a>Tip #1: Identify the mood</h2><p>As we’ve demonstrated before, the audio can change the entire mood of the video. The right music for any video will be the one that compliments the spirit of the visuals and relays the emotions the producer intended.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/the-power-of-music-in-videos-4.gif"
                      alt="identifying the mood of the video"
                ></p>
<p>Rewatch your recorded clips until you know the mood portrayed by the visuals. Select music that matches the spirit of your visuals. For example, you would use different music for a sunny day compared to a cloudy day. Once you’ve figured out the mood and understand the emotions you want to elicit, search for audio that achieves this and balances out your visuals.</p>
<h2 id="Tip-2-Video-and-music-style"><a href="#Tip-2-Video-and-music-style" class="headerlink" title="Tip #2: Video and music style"></a>Tip #2: Video and music style</h2><p>We’ve already established that different styles of music complement other types of videos. So, keep the type of your video in consideration. For example, is your video fast-paced and full of action, or is it more serious in nature, like an interview or documentary?</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/the-power-of-music-in-videos-5.gif"
                      alt="matching the video and audio styles"
                ></p>
<p>Once you have music that matches your video style, check the audio wave. The four most common patterns are steady, ascending, descending, or furious. The audio wave will help you select the visuals that best match that audio.</p>

<p>For example, if you’re using audio with an ascending audio wave, you would use visuals that build up with the audio. The beat drop will signal the transition to reveal a powerful shot.</p>

We all have a favorite music genre, but sometimes that may not go well with our visuals. For example, you love country music but have a video about the nightlife in the city. Using country music in a video about the town does not match well and will confuse your audience.</p>

<p>The following passage will guide you through everything you must consider while choosing music for your videos. But first, we’ll show you how easy it is to alter your video with music using Wondershare Filmora.</p>
<h2 id="How-different-types-of-music-affect-your-videos-1"><a href="#How-different-types-of-music-affect-your-videos-1" class="headerlink" title="How different types of music affect your videos"></a>How different types of music affect your videos</h2><p>You can easily change the viewer’s perception using different music, even with the same visuals. The right song will elevate your video to another level and assist in relaying your feelings and emotions to the viewers. The following examples will illustrate how changing the audio changes the impression of the video.</p>
<h3 id="Example-1-1"><a href="#Example-1-1" class="headerlink" title="Example #1"></a>Example #1</h3><p>Let’s say you have a video of someone walking through the woods. Now without music audio, your video will be boring. You can quickly fix this by adding an upbeat song to make your video more energetic.</p>

                      alt="adding an uplifting beat to your video"
                ></p>
<p>Using the same visuals, you can add a more tense and dramatic song, like from a horror movie. You have successfully changed the entire vibe of the same video from “inspiring” to “sinister.” It proves the importance of the balance between audio and visuals.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adding scary music to your video"
                ></p>
<h3 id="Example-2-1"><a href="#Example-2-1" class="headerlink" title="Example #2"></a>Example #2</h3><p>For a better understanding, let’s look at a movie scene we all know and love. Take the entrance scene from Avengers: Endgame. The music used by the producer aims to excite the audience while building up the hype for the upcoming battle. However, if we change the audio of this scene, we end up with a completely different set of emotions that might not go too well with the shot.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/the-power-of-music-in-videos-3.gif"
                      alt="changing the music of a movie scene"
                ></p>
<p>Now that we’ve seen how crucial audio can be in a video, let’s see how to choose the best music audio for your video.</p>
<h2 id="Tip-1-Identify-the-mood-1"><a href="#Tip-1-Identify-the-mood-1" class="headerlink" title="Tip #1: Identify the mood"></a>Tip #1: Identify the mood</h2><p>As we’ve demonstrated before, the audio can change the entire mood of the video. The right music for any video will be the one that compliments the spirit of the visuals and relays the emotions the producer intended.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/the-power-of-music-in-videos-4.gif"
                      alt="identifying the mood of the video"
                ></p>
<p>Rewatch your recorded clips until you know the mood portrayed by the visuals. Select music that matches the spirit of your visuals. For example, you would use different music for a sunny day compared to a cloudy day. Once you’ve figured out the mood and understand the emotions you want to elicit, search for audio that achieves this and balances out your visuals.</p>
<h2 id="Tip-2-Video-and-music-style-1"><a href="#Tip-2-Video-and-music-style-1" class="headerlink" title="Tip #2: Video and music style"></a>Tip #2: Video and music style</h2><p>We’ve already established that different styles of music complement other types of videos. So, keep the type of your video in consideration. For example, is your video fast-paced and full of action, or is it more serious in nature, like an interview or documentary?</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="matching the video and audio styles"
                ></p>
<p>Once you have music that matches your video style, check the audio wave. The four most common patterns are steady, ascending, descending, or furious. The audio wave will help you select the visuals that best match that audio.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="identifying the audio wave"

<p>For example, if you’re using audio with an ascending audio wave, you would use visuals that build up with the audio. The beat drop will signal the transition to reveal a powerful shot.</p>
