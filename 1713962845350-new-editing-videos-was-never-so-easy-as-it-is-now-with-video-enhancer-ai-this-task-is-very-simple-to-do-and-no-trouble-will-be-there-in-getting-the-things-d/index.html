In After Effects, this tool adds an invisible layer that is used to mask or reveal parts of a layer, including video, graphics, text, shapes, and images. This feature is in the arsenal of any visual effects artist or motion graphic designer.</p>
<p>For After Effects editors, <strong>Track Mattes</strong> can be an incredibly helpful tool for managing multiple layers and creating complex animations.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll explore everything you need to know about <strong>Track Mattes</strong>. We’ll cover topics like the difference between a mask and Track Matte, finding this tool in After Effects, and its four options: Alpha Matter, Alpha Inverted Matte, Luma Matte, and Luma Inverted Matte.</p>
<ol>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-Are-Track-Mattes-In-After-Effects"><a href="#Part-1-What-Are-Track-Mattes-In-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Are Track Mattes In After Effects?"></a>Part 1. What Are Track Mattes In After Effects?</h2><p>A Track Matte is an element used in video editing to control the opacity of a layer. Essentially, it lets you create a “hole” in a layer so that underlying layers can show through. This tool can be used with video and audio layers, which is essential for creating complex composites in After Effects.</p>
<p>You can use Track Mattes to generate shapes, reveal part of a layer, or keying outs. Interestingly, it remains independent of all layers in your projects, which means you can get visual effects and animations more efficiently than with the masks tool.</p>
<p>Moreover, Track Mattes uses Alpha or Luma channels as a layer mask to determine what parts of the layer to reveal. For instance, you can make a top layer that provides an Alpha or Luminous effect and a bottom layer consisting of the image that will be revealed or shown.</p>
<p>Thus, if you want to use an image to hide your video until you want to unveil it or add a picture in your text, Track Mattes will help you to shape the appearance of a layer above it.</p>

Differences Between A Mask And A Track Matte"></a>Part 2. Differences Between A Mask And A Track Matte</h2><p>In Adobe After Effects, there are two types of masking tools: Masks and Track Mattes. Both are used to hide or reveal a portion of a layer.</p>
<p>Here’re some key differences between a Mask and a Track Matte:</p>
<ol>
<li>A mask is dependent on a specific layer, while the Track Matter is independent of any layer.</li>
<li>A mask is applied directly to a layer having an image or a video and transforms with the layers. On the other hand, Track Matte is a stationary mask applied to the composition rather than a layer.</li>

All Four Track Matte Options In After Effects</h2><p>After Effects provides four types of Track Matte options: Alpha Matte, Alpha Inverted Matte, Luma Matte, and Luma Inverted Matte, each has its own specific use case. But first, you need to understand what Alpha and Luma are:</p>
<p><strong>Alpha:</strong> This Track Matte type uses the layer’s Alpha channel to determine the layer’s opacity.</p>
<p><strong>Luma:</strong> This Track Matte type uses the top layer’s brightness to mask the bottom layer.</p>

<p>Let’s find out the functions of each option one by one:</p>
<h3 id="Alpha-Matte"><a href="#Alpha-Matte" class="headerlink" title="Alpha Matte"></a>Alpha Matte</h3><p>Alpha Matte is an important option under the Track Matte menu, as it allows you to create a mask based on the transparency of the layer you are using it on. Like the mask, it will use any pixel above 0% opacity and can be useful for various purposes, such as creating a vignette or isolating a certain area of the frame.</p>
<h3 id="Alpha-Inverted-Matte"><a href="#Alpha-Inverted-Matte" class="headerlink" title="Alpha Inverted Matte"></a>Alpha Inverted Matte</h3><p>The Alpha Inverted Matte option is quite the opposite of the Alpha Matte, and around the Alpha channel, it uses negative space from the above layer and will therefore use pixels with 0% opacity as it had 100% opacity.</p>
<h3 id="Luma-Matte"><a href="#Luma-Matte" class="headerlink" title="Luma Matte"></a>Luma Matte</h3><p>Instead of using the Alpha channel, Luma Mattes uses the brightness level or Luma channel of the upper layer to create a mask for the bottom layer.</p>
<h3 id="Luma-Inverted-Matte"><a href="#Luma-Inverted-Matte" class="headerlink" title="Luma Inverted Matte"></a>Luma Inverted Matte</h3><p>Opposite of the Luma Matte, the Luma Inverted Matte uses dark or low luminance areas of the upper layer to create a mask for the lower layer.</p>
<h3 id="Differences-Between-Alpha-Channel-and-Luma-Channel"><a href="#Differences-Between-Alpha-Channel-and-Luma-Channel" class="headerlink" title="Differences Between Alpha Channel and Luma Channel"></a>Differences Between Alpha Channel and Luma Channel</h3><p>When altering the opacity of a layer, it may look like the brightness settings are changed. This might confuse some users, as both Alpha and Luma channels carry the same information. However, they differ in how they are used.</p>
<p>Alpha channel is a type of Track Matte that stores transparency information. This information determines how opaque or transparent a layer will be when superimposed over another layer.</p>

                ></p>
<p>On the other hand, a Luma channel is a video track that stores brightness information. This information is used to determine how bright or dark an image will be and is further divided into three channels, i.e., Red, Green, and Blue (RGB). Their value ranges from 0 to 255, where 0 represents the darkest value while 255 represents the brightest value.</p>

<p>Part 1. What Are Track Mattes In After Effects?</p>
<p>A Track Matte is an element used in video editing to control the opacity of a layer. Essentially, it lets you create a “hole” in a layer so that underlying layers can show through. This tool can be used with video and audio layers, which is essential for creating complex composites in After Effects.</p>
<p>You can use Track Mattes to generate shapes, reveal part of a layer, or keying outs. Interestingly, it remains independent of all layers in your projects, which means you can get visual effects and animations more efficiently than with the masks tool.</p>
<p>Moreover, Track Mattes uses Alpha or Luma channels as a layer mask to determine what parts of the layer to reveal. For instance, you can make a top layer that provides an Alpha or Luminous effect and a bottom layer consisting of the image that will be revealed or shown.</p>
<p>Thus, if you want to use an image to hide your video until you want to unveil it or add a picture in your text, Track Mattes will help you to shape the appearance of a layer above it.</p>

Many of these features are exposed through FFmpeg’s command line interface but can also be accessed from the program’s Python bindings and its Qt GUI frontend, called QFFMpeg.</p>
<p>This article will explain using FFmpeg command line tools to record video streams on Windows and Mac computers with step-by-step examples and screenshots.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-FFmpeg"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-FFmpeg" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is FFmpeg?"></a>Part 1. What is FFmpeg?</h2><p>FFmpeg stands for “FF Multi-Platform Executable” and was originally developed by Fabrice Bellard in the year 2000 as an extension of the MPlayer project. The sole purpose of the software command-line design is to provide a complete solution for users to record live streams (audio and&#x2F;or video) from any type of device that supports either the RTSP or HTTP streaming protocols.</p>
<p>FFmpeg is a complete, cross-platform solution to record, convert, mix, and edit audio and video files. The software has over 250 input formats, which allows users to <strong>record video streams</strong> in any media format. The FFmpeg commands stream the video back after recording, convert it into MP4 or MKV file, and process incoming data on the fly, such as rtmpdump.</p>

How to Record a Video Stream With FFmpeg on Windows?"></a>Part 2. How to Record a Video Stream With FFmpeg on Windows?</h2><p>The free FFmpeg command line tool is a great way to record a live internet stream and listen back to it later. If you have a Windows PC and want to record a video stream or screen using FFmpeg, our following step-by-step method will help you go through this process without facing many difficulties.</p>
<p>Step1 First, launch a browser of your choice on your Windows PC and head to the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-windows" >FFmpeg <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> website. Hover over the Windows icon in the middle pane and select either the <strong>gyan.dev</strong> or <strong>BTbn</strong> build.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/downloading-ffmpeg-on-windows.png"
                      alt="downloading ffmpeg on windows"
                ></p>
<p>On the next screen, select the latest <strong>Windows 64-bit</strong> file from the list. Why? You need to use a computer compatible with the Windows 64-bit version. Next, download the ZIP file on your PC and use ZIP file extraction software to open the file contents.</p>
<p>Step2 Locate the <strong>ffmpeg.exe</strong> file on the extracted file and copy it to a new folder on your computer hard drive (e.g., C:\VideoRecorder).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="extracting ffmpeg files on windows pc"
                ></p>
<p>Step3 In the next step, click the <strong>Start</strong> icon on your Windows dashboard and type <strong>cmd</strong> in the search box. Right-click on Command Prompt, select <strong>“Run as Administrator,”</strong> and launch the program.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="launching command prompt"
                ></p>
<p>Now, write the command to select the FFmpeg directory. For example, cd <strong>C:\VideoRecorder</strong>, and hit the <strong>“Enter”</strong> key.</p>
<p>Step4 To start recording the video stream, simply call FFmpeg and use the following command line. In this case, we are taking the example of capturing a YouTube video of “Running up that hill” from the top-rated TV show Stranger Things.</p>
<p>ffmpeg.exe -y -i <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV0RAcuG2Ao" >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV0RAcuG2Ao <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> runningup.mp4</p>
<p>Hit the “Enter” key, and the output of this command will be displayed on the Command Prompt interface.</p>
<p>The command options have the following meanings:</p>
<p><strong>-y</strong> allows automatic rewriting of existing files.</p>
<p><strong>-i</strong> <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV0RAcuG2Ao" >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV0RAcuG2Ao <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the stream URL that FFmpeg will record. You can change it with any video stream URL.</p>
<p><strong>runningup.mp4</strong> is the name of the output file.</p>

Although transient glitches are typical, they can occasionally linger for a few seconds or more.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>You can use a glitch effect to temporarily change the appearance of the image in the video to give the impression that a machine is processing it. Additionally, it gives your finished piece a fantastic, dreamlike aspect.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-When-Should-you-Apply-a-Glitch-Effect"><a href="#Part-2-When-Should-you-Apply-a-Glitch-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: When Should you Apply a Glitch Effect?"></a>Part 2: When Should you Apply a Glitch Effect?</h2><p>A few years back, we had no choice but to watch glitchy movies on rusty VCR devices. Nowadays, retro video effects are very popular in TV movies and even games. You can use these effects in many ways, like making fake vintage footage or emulating a glitching computer.</p>
<p>Filmmakers frequently employ glitching in their videos to give the impression that a character has been affected by a technical abnormality, is having a flashback, or is being watched by someone else via a digital camera system. Something happens when the person or image flashes, often without their knowledge. In addition, you can apply the glitch effect to a composition to evoke a feeling of dramatic irony.</p>

                      alt="select your clip and click on edit"
                ></p>
<p>Step2 Put the new copies on the layer above the others and make sure everything is lined up exactly. To create the glitch effect, separate the color channels on your Clips into the primary colors red, green, and blue.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="double-click on the top clip"
                ></p>
<p>Go to Color and open the White Balance option to make this layer completely red. Next, drag both Temperature and Tint sliders to a hundred.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="open the white balance option"
                ></p>
<p>Step4 Now click the little eye icon on the timeline to hide the top layer and move on to the middle layer.</p>
<p>Step5 Double-click on your middle clip and go to Color, then select White Balance and set your Temperature to -100 and your Tint to 100.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="go to color"
                ></p>
<p>Step6 Finally, hide this layer just like before. Repeat the same steps for the last clip but make this clip the blue layer by leaving the Temperature at zero and setting the Tint to -100.</p>

                      alt="click the video tab"
                ></p>
<p>Now click on the clip in your preview window and move the image over by pressing the left Arrow key on your keyboard a few times. Once you’re happy with the top clip, hide that layer by clicking the eye icon.</p>

                      alt="click on the clip in your preview window"
                ></p>
<p>Step8 To make the middle layer visible, double-click the clip in your mid layer and set the Blending Mode of this layer to Screen.</p>

                      alt="double-click the clip in your mid layer"
                ></p>
<p>Now click on your clip in the preview window and press the Right key as many times as you did before. Finally, make all the layers visible by clicking the eye icon.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/glitch_effect_14.jpg"
                      alt="press the right key"
                ></p>

<p>Step1 First, click the Effects Tab and type in Vignette.</p>
<p>Step2 Next, drag the Vignette Radius effect to a layer above your previous three layers.</p>
<p>Step3 Now adjust the length to match the other clips.</p>
<p><strong>VHS static effects</strong></p>
<p>A VHS effect is a grainy distortion that resembles an old analog video cassette recording. To apply the VHS static effects:</p>
<p>Step1 Click the Effects tab.</p>
<p>Step2 Search for the VHS static and drag it to a new layer above everything else.</p>
<p>Step3 Extend one of the effects to match the length of your previous clips.</p>

<p>VCR Distortion effect will make your video look highly glitched. To apply this effect:</p>
<p>Step1 Click on the Effects tab.</p>
<p>Step2 Search for VCR Distortion, then drag and drop this effect over your previous layer.</p>

<li>One of the best ways to use the VCR Distortion effect is to cut it short and intersperse it around your video in random parts.</li>
<li>The glitch Distortion effect is very intense, so we recommend cutting this effect very short and dropping it at random parts of your video.</li>
<li>You can also use these effects as a sneaky way to hide Cuts in your video.</li>

<h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>You can use glitch effects created or inspired by faulty video equipment as a powerful storytelling tool. These effects can help you change the tone of the entire video by adding a specific visual aesthetic and making the narrative simpler to convey and more approachable for the audience.</p>

<p>Now click on the clip in your preview window and move the image over by pressing the left Arrow key on your keyboard a few times. Once you’re happy with the top clip, hide that layer by clicking the eye icon.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/glitch_effect_12.jpg"
                      alt="click on the clip in your preview window"
                ></p>
<p>Step8 To make the middle layer visible, double-click the clip in your mid layer and set the Blending Mode of this layer to Screen.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/glitch_effect_13.jpg"
                      alt="double-click the clip in your mid layer"
                ></p>
<p>Now click on your clip in the preview window and press the Right key as many times as you did before. Finally, make all the layers visible by clicking the eye icon.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/glitch_effect_14.jpg"
                      alt="press the right key"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Vignette</strong></p>
<p>A vignette is a dark border that fades around the frame’s edges in Filmora. You can easily add a vignette effect to your video by using these steps:</p>
<p>Step1 First, click the Effects Tab and type in Vignette.</p>
<p>Step2 Next, drag the Vignette Radius effect to a layer above your previous three layers.</p>
<p>Step3 Now adjust the length to match the other clips.</p>
<p><strong>VHS static effects</strong></p>
<p>A VHS effect is a grainy distortion that resembles an old analog video cassette recording. To apply the VHS static effects:</p>
<p>Step1 Click the Effects tab.</p>
<p>Step2 Search for the VHS static and drag it to a new layer above everything else.</p>
<p>Step3 Extend one of the effects to match the length of your previous clips.</p>
<p><strong>VCR Distortion</strong></p>
<p>VCR Distortion effect will make your video look highly glitched. To apply this effect:</p>
<p>Step1 Click on the Effects tab.</p>
<p>Step2 Search for VCR Distortion, then drag and drop this effect over your previous layer.</p>

<li>One of the best ways to use the VCR Distortion effect is to cut it short and intersperse it around your video in random parts.</li>
<li>The glitch Distortion effect is very intense, so we recommend cutting this effect very short and dropping it at random parts of your video.</li>
<li>You can also use these effects as a sneaky way to hide Cuts in your video.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Summary-1"><a href="#Summary-1" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>You can use glitch effects created or inspired by faulty video equipment as a powerful storytelling tool. These effects can help you change the tone of the entire video by adding a specific visual aesthetic and making the narrative simpler to convey and more approachable for the audience.</p>
<p>We recommend using Filmora 11 for adding built-in glitch effects. You can also use this app to create custom glitch effects within a few minutes.</p>
