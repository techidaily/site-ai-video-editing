<p>Thanks to increased uptake by the coronavirus epidemic, Discord has become more prevalent than ever in recent years. However, while many individuals have become more familiar with Discord, not everyone is aware of all its features. <strong>Discord server boost</strong> can help you unlock Discord’s full potential by adding new features to the server you run.</p>
<p>A <strong>server boost</strong> might provide various benefits. These increases, however, are not free, which is why it’s necessary to debate if they’re worthwhile.</p>
<p>Finally, we will investigate all the possible Discord server boost levels, benefits, and expenses. Keep in mind that while this article will cover everything there is to know about server enhancements, it is ultimately up to you to decide whether they are worthwhile. Let’s get into it!</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-a-Discord-Server-Boost-and-is-It-Worth-It"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-a-Discord-Server-Boost-and-is-It-Worth-It" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is a Discord Server Boost and is It Worth It?"></a>Part 1 <strong>What is a Discord Server Boost and is It Worth It?</strong></h2><p><strong>Discord Nitro Boost</strong> is a monthly membership costing $10 and linked to a user’s account. The advantages are likewise limited to a single user.</p>
<p>Server boosts are one of Discord’s main revenue streams, and they function similarly to Nitro. There are, nevertheless, significant distinctions. Server boosts are benefits tied to a particular server and used by any member.</p>
<p>A server must acquire two boosts to unlock level 1 boosts, seven boosts to reach level 2 perks and fourteen boosts for level 3.</p>
<p>With all of this in mind, can you say, <strong>Discord server boosts</strong> are worthwhile? They most certainly are. The added features can improve everyone’s server experience and are inexpensive, significantly if boosting as a group.</p>
<p>Whether or not server boosting is worthwhile is mainly subjective. If you’re not an active server member and only use Discord to play games with a small group of pals, you might want to save your money. if you’re a member of a clan or online community dedicated to a server, boosting can be a terrific way to contribute to ‘the greater good.’ Aside from the cosmetic bonuses that come with each level, the better audio quality, streaming quality, and upload limit are valuable features.</p>
<p>If you plan to buy two or more <strong>server boosts,</strong> we offer Discord Nitro, which includes two server enhancements for the same price as buying them separately, plus a 30% discount on any additional server boosts purchased.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-Much-is-a-Boost-Discord"><a href="#Part-2-How-Much-is-a-Boost-Discord" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How Much is a Boost Discord?"></a>Part 2 <strong>How Much is a Boost Discord?</strong></h2><p>Any member of the Discord Server can provide a boost for $4.99 per month. If you’re a Discord Nitro subscriber, all <strong>Discord Server Boost</strong> purchases are discounted by 30%.</p>
<p>Discord just implemented reduced upgrade thresholds for Discord Server Levels. Previously, Level 2 required 15 server boosts, while Level 3 required 30 server boosts. However, Level 2 requires only seven server boosts with a recent upgrade, and Level 3 requires 14 boosts.</p>
<p>Level 2 would cost $34.93, and Level 3 would cost $69.86. Nitro subscribers will pay $24.45 for Level 2 and $48.90 for Level 3.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Open the Discord server</p>
<p>Log into your Discord server</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Choose the server you want to boost.</p>
<p>First, choose the server you wish to boost. Go to the Server Settings drop-down menu and select the Server Boost option once you’re on that server.</p>

                      alt="Choose the server you want to boost"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Verify Benefits and Boost</p>
<p>A new screen will appear after you select the Boost button. This shows the current perks and the number of Server Boosts applied to this server.</p>
<p>If everything appears to be in order, click the Boost This Server button to confirm it.</p>
<p>Remember that you can also “Gift Nitro” to someone else from this screen. You can give more if you’re feeling generous.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/full-guide-to-discord-boost-3.jpg"
                      alt="Verify and boost"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Confirmation Page</p>
<p>Discord wants to make sure you understand what you’re signing up for, so you’ll be asked to reconfirm.</p>
<p>They’ll ask you again when you hit the confirmation button. If you have second thoughts, this is your time to back out.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Discord is aware that you’re serious about enhancing a server’s performance. They want to make sure you’re boosting the correct one. If everything looks good, push the Boost button one more time.</p>
<p>However, you should be aware that if you boost this Server, you will be unable to transfer this Boost to another server for seven days.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Confirmation page"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Choose a Boost Number</p>
<p>Do you require several boosts?</p>
<p>This action can be after the confirmation screen.</p>
<p>Choose how many boosts you want for this Server in Discord. But don’t be concerned! Before you pay for anything, you can see the subtotal.</p>
<p>Select the plus or minus symbol in the window to modify the number of server boosts.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Payment Information</p>

<p>Thanks to increased uptake by the coronavirus epidemic, Discord has become more prevalent than ever in recent years. However, while many individuals have become more familiar with Discord, not everyone is aware of all its features. <strong>Discord server boost</strong> can help you unlock Discord’s full potential by adding new features to the server you run.</p>
<p>A <strong>server boost</strong> might provide various benefits. These increases, however, are not free, which is why it’s necessary to debate if they’re worthwhile.</p>
<p>Finally, we will investigate all the possible Discord server boost levels, benefits, and expenses. Keep in mind that while this article will cover everything there is to know about server enhancements, it is ultimately up to you to decide whether they are worthwhile. Let’s get into it!</p>

The advantages are likewise limited to a single user.</p>
<p>Server boosts are one of Discord’s main revenue streams, and they function similarly to Nitro. There are, nevertheless, significant distinctions. Server boosts are benefits tied to a particular server and used by any member.</p>
<p>A server must acquire two boosts to unlock level 1 boosts, seven boosts to reach level 2 perks and fourteen boosts for level 3.</p>
<p>With all of this in mind, can you say, <strong>Discord server boosts</strong> are worthwhile? They most certainly are. The added features can improve everyone’s server experience and are inexpensive, significantly if boosting as a group.</p>
<p>Whether or not server boosting is worthwhile is mainly subjective. If you’re not an active server member and only use Discord to play games with a small group of pals, you might want to save your money. if you’re a member of a clan or online community dedicated to a server, boosting can be a terrific way to contribute to ‘the greater good.’ Aside from the cosmetic bonuses that come with each level, the better audio quality, streaming quality, and upload limit are valuable features.</p>
<p>If you plan to buy two or more <strong>server boosts,</strong> we offer Discord Nitro, which includes two server enhancements for the same price as buying them separately, plus a 30% discount on any additional server boosts purchased.</p>

If you’re a Discord Nitro subscriber, all <strong>Discord Server Boost</strong> purchases are discounted by 30%.</p>
<p>Discord just implemented reduced upgrade thresholds for Discord Server Levels. Previously, Level 2 required 15 server boosts, while Level 3 required 30 server boosts. However, Level 2 requires only seven server boosts with a recent upgrade, and Level 3 requires 14 boosts.</p>
<p>Level 2 would cost $34.93, and Level 3 would cost $69.86. Nitro subscribers will pay $24.45 for Level 2 and $48.90 for Level 3.</p>

So How to Create Your Own Countdown Video? This Article Will Tell You some Ideas About Contdown Video Editing</h2><p>Have you ever wanted to use Adobe After Effects to recreate a countdown timer for a rocket launch or simply create a suspenseful moment in a video by displaying how the time runs out? This tutorial will show you how. It is imperative that you become familiar with the process of creating a countdown in After Effects.</p>
<p>In this article, we will demonstrate how to use Adobe After Effects to put together a countdown video. This procedure is a straightforward one, and it will handle expressions as well as plugins. Stay here and read on to find out more about the various methods in which we might accomplish this goal!</p>
<p>Let’s begin!</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Create-a-new-composition"><a href="#Part-1-Create-a-new-composition" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Create a new composition"></a>Part 1. Create a new composition</h2><p>It’s possible that you only want to show the minutes and seconds. Make a mask around the entire area you intend to use in order to quickly remove undesired information.</p>
<p>1. Create a new Text Layer.</p>
<p>2. Alt + Click (on a PC) or Option + Click (on a Mac) on the stopwatch in the Source Text to display text options.</p>
<p>3. Place the expression “timeToCurrentFormat” within the expression box (). You must set your composition frame rate to 60 frames per second in order to make it appear to be a real digital countdown timer.</p>
<p>4. Everything should be pre-composed, and the composition’s tempo should be reversed to make it count down. Right-click the composition and choose Time &gt; Time Reverse Layer to change its pace.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="create new text countdown video"
                ></p>
<h2 id="Part-2-Using-the-timecode-plugin"><a href="#Part-2-Using-the-timecode-plugin" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Using the timecode plugin"></a>Part 2. Using the timecode plugin</h2><p>To make a countdown timer, you can use the Timecode plugin rather than the “timeToCurrentFormat()” statement. The timer layout will be immediately created when the plugin is added to a New Solid; use the same steps as before to convert it to a countdown timer.</p>
<p>Here is a quick video that demonstrates how simple it is to set up a countdown timer in this manner:</p>
<p>Step1 Ctrl-click (Windows) or Command-click (Mac OS) the time display to cycle through Timecode Base or Frames&#x2F;Feet + Frames (depending on whether the “Use Feet + Frames” option is checked in the Project Settings). The Timeline panel’s upper-left corner, as well as the bottoms of the Layer, Composition, and Footage panels, all indicate the current time. Timeline panel (See.)</p>
<p>Step2 A smaller text version of the option that is not selected in the project settings will be seen underneath. Do the following to limit the display to the Timecode or Frames option that was chosen in the Project Settings:</p>
<p>Step3 Choose After Effects &gt; Preferences &gt; Display (Mac OS) or Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Display to access the display preferences window (Windows). Remove the check mark next to “Show Timecode and Frames in Timeline Panel” (this option is selected by default).</p>
<p>Step4 Change the time display units by selecting File &gt; Project Settings and then selecting a different choice from the list in the Time Display Style section.</p>
<p>Timecode:</p>
<p>Displays the current time as timecode in the time rulers of the Timeline, Layer, and Footage panels. You have the option of utilizing the timecode from the source media (Use Media Source) or beginning at 00:00:00:00. To use timecode rather than frames, select the Timecode option from the menu.

Hence, it is necessary to invest in suitable options. If you wish to design something unique, you must create the GIF file or image online using different websites and resources. Besides, the communication platform is yet to introduce editing features. Here is a straightforward way to make <strong>GIF Avatar in Discord</strong> online referencing Peter Davis’ article, how to make discord PFP online.</p>

Regular gear like cameras and lights are slightly cheaper, but there are plenty of ways to DIY regular items to use as film gear.</p>
<p>Making DIY film gear may not give you the same look as professional gear, but it could be a fun project and give you similar looks on a budget. In this article, let’s look at some dollar-store DIY hacks that you can use for filmmaking on a budget.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<h2 id="Tip-1-Add-foreground-elements-to-improve-the-frame-of-videos"><a href="#Tip-1-Add-foreground-elements-to-improve-the-frame-of-videos" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1. Add foreground elements to improve the frame of videos"></a>Tip 1. Add foreground elements to improve the frame of videos</h2><p>Let’s start with something we can do to enhance your framing. Sometimes we want to direct our audience’s attention to a specific part of the frame. In this case, it’s the talent of placing an object in the shot’s foreground that can help us do that. While also making a more attractive frame. At the dollar store, try using something like these fake plants.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/dollar-store-film-making-hacks-2.png"
                      alt="fake plants"
                ></p>
<p>You can place it in front of your lens. Then focus on the talent behind it, giving a blurry foreground that perfectly frames the talent. Here’s how the shot looks with and without foreground elements.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/dollar-store-film-making-hacks-3.png"
                      alt="framing the subject"
                ></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"
                     
                ></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Remember, you can also use a <strong>different angle</strong> than simply approaching the object from the front. You can try and use different perspectives until you find the shot or footage you are looking for.</p>
<h2 id="Tip-2-Adjust-lights-with-poster-boards"><a href="#Tip-2-Adjust-lights-with-poster-boards" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2. Adjust lights with poster boards"></a>Tip 2. Adjust lights with poster boards</h2><p>The shot below looks dark and boring because the background has no light. Here’s the shot with and without the lights.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/dollar-store-film-making-hacks-4.png"
                      alt="shot with or without lights"
                ></p>
<p>A practical light is a light that shows up on screen rather than lighting talent from off-screen. For example, some dollar stores have small LED accent lights for around three dollars.</p>
<p>Others even have lights with adhesive backings that allow you to place them all over the room—creating great lighting accents with small eye-catching pockets of light.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/dollar-store-film-making-hacks-5.png"
                      alt="lights with adhesive backings"
                ></p>
<p>On film sets, crews use a bounce to reflect light from one light source in another direction. At the dollar store, we can find something like this poster board to get a similar effect.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="use bounce to reflect light"
                ></p>
<p>By reflecting the light onto the bounce, we get softer, more spread-out light when it’s reflected. Then you will get the result in a nicer look. Using poster boards, you can do multiple things with light.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use white to bounce light.</li>
<li>Use black as a flag to shape or block light.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="use white to bounce light"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>You can also use green for a small green screen when filming a product video</li>
</ul>
<p>You might have seen how big production companies create those alienated landscapes, such as in the movie Avatar and many more.</p>
<p>The concept is recording your object in front of a green screen behind it. Then, it’s much easier to add a separately filmed background to the final footage with a video editor like Filmora.</p>

<h3 id="1-Felt-pads"><a href="#1-Felt-pads" class="headerlink" title="1. Felt pads"></a>1. Felt pads</h3><p>Felt pads with adhesive backs can be stuck onto noisy props like a coffee mug. This way, we won’t hear the mug hitting the table when we’re recording sound.</p>

<h3 id="2-Socks-as-pop-filters"><a href="#2-Socks-as-pop-filters" class="headerlink" title="2. Socks as pop filters"></a>2.

Pops usually occur when people say words that start with the letter P or B.</p>
<p>Then what is a pop filter? You might have seen in some YouTube videos, especially live streamers, where they use a microphone with a plate on its head; that’s called a pop filter. You can purchase pricey gear like a pop filter, or we can get a pack of cheap socks at the dollar store and place them over the mic.</p>
<p>It will make your voiceover slightly quieter, but it should also get rid of the popping. So keep adding socks until you hear no more pops in your voiceover.</p>
