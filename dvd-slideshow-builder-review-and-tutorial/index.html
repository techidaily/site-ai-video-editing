<h3 id="Without-sound"><a href="#Without-sound" class="headerlink" title="Without sound"></a>Without sound</h3><p>The B-roll shots are mostly without audio or with little background sound. In most cases, the sound of the primary video is continued while the B-roll footage is just shown.</p>

Two Types of B-rolls: Explanation Video B-rolls"></a>Part 2. Two Types of B-rolls: Explanation Video B-rolls</h2><p>When recording any explanatory video, the audience may leave it in the middle of a video if a character explains without any visual representation. When explaining something new, showing the object in B-roll can be more effective than just verbally explaining what the audience is seeing.</p>
<p>Let’s take the video we made about microphones as an example. Instead of just verbally introduce the various mics, we inserted B-roll footage to display what they look like and how they can be used. The combination of the visual footage and the background voiceover presents the mic in a more vivid way. Also, it keeps the audience’s attention.</p>

Two Types of B-rolls: Storytelling Video B-rolls</h2><p>During the creation of short films or any storytelling videos, if a person sits and speaks without showing any character or anything else, it will turn boring. Due to this, you have more chances to lose your audience and viewers.</p>
<p>In visual storytelling, if you will insert more clips with close shots, it will make the environment cool. The crazy thing is that you can make mimic shots easily at home by utilizing household objects. Let’s check out one of the examples.</p>

Film B-roll footage with food</h3><p>So let’s add some b-roll to give it more context even if you have a master shot of yourself looking off frame alone.</p>
<h5 id="Step1Write-a-script"><a href="#Step1Write-a-script" class="headerlink" title="Step1Write a script"></a>Step1Write a script</h5><p>Before making any video, the first step is to write a script for the whole video. If you will have more than two characters, then make dialogues for everyone and practice it again and again to give a fascinating look.</p>
<p>Then speak to your audience, make sure that what you are speaking is vivid and make everything simple and crystal clear.</p>
<h5 id="Step2Shot-a-primary-video"><a href="#Step2Shot-a-primary-video" class="headerlink" title="Step2Shot a primary video"></a>Step2Shot a primary video</h5><p>First of all, make a primary video according to your script by implementing a camera at one side, or you can also change the angle of the camera lens during shooting to have a look from all sides.</p>

<h5 id="Step3Make-B-roll-shots"><a href="#Step3Make-B-roll-shots" class="headerlink" title="Step3Make B-roll shots"></a>Step3Make B-roll shots</h5><p>Make closer shots of things which the character have to select and pick up. Check out two B-roll shots for the main video:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, make a closer shot of the object (Snacks) that the character is noticing prior.</li>

Two Types of B-rolls: Explanation Video B-rolls"></a>Part 2. Two Types of B-rolls: Explanation Video B-rolls</h2><p>When recording any explanatory video, the audience may leave it in the middle of a video if a character explains without any visual representation. When explaining something new, showing the object in B-roll can be more effective than just verbally explaining what the audience is seeing.</p>
<p>Let’s take the video we made about microphones as an example. Instead of just verbally introduce the various mics, we inserted B-roll footage to display what they look like and how they can be used. The combination of the visual footage and the background voiceover presents the mic in a more vivid way. Also, it keeps the audience’s attention.</p>

Two Types of B-rolls: Storytelling Video B-rolls</h2><p>During the creation of short films or any storytelling videos, if a person sits and speaks without showing any character or anything else, it will turn boring. Due to this, you have more chances to lose your audience and viewers.</p>
<p>In visual storytelling, if you will insert more clips with close shots, it will make the environment cool. The crazy thing is that you can make mimic shots easily at home by utilizing household objects. Let’s check out one of the examples.</p>
<h3 id="Example-1-Film-B-roll-footage-with-food-1"><a href="#Example-1-Film-B-roll-footage-with-food-1" class="headerlink" title="Example 1. Film B-roll footage with food"></a>Example 1.

<h5 id="Step1Write-a-script-1"><a href="#Step1Write-a-script-1" class="headerlink" title="Step1Write a script"></a>Step1Write a script</h5><p>Before making any video, the first step is to write a script for the whole video. If you will have more than two characters, then make dialogues for everyone and practice it again and again to give a fascinating look.</p>
<p>Then speak to your audience, make sure that what you are speaking is vivid and make everything simple and crystal clear.</p>
<h5 id="Step2Shot-a-primary-video-1"><a href="#Step2Shot-a-primary-video-1" class="headerlink" title="Step2Shot a primary video"></a>Step2Shot a primary video</h5><p>First of all, make a primary video according to your script by implementing a camera at one side, or you can also change the angle of the camera lens during shooting to have a look from all sides.</p>
